 &HT;    Mack Brown for Coach of the Year
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's Election Day, and on this ballot, Mack
Brown is the Big 12 Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, and Bill Clinton's lips move when he lies, Kerry Collins'
pencil isn't the sharpest one in the box, and John Glenn has major
ups.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any other choice but Mack the Nice? R.C. Slocum's
excellent Texas Aggies o(accent) some of whom were even
academically eligible o(accent) were ranked in preseason. Billy the
Cutup Snyder has Kansas State robots who could probably beat the
Washington Redskins without a coach. Tom Osborne will probably get
some votes out of a force of habit.
</P>
<P>
   But Mack's the Man. The first-year Texas football coach might
have been so named even without Saturday's take-your-breath-away,
take-Nebraska's-home win streak-away, 20-16 win. However, that
shocking victory should have nailed down a Coach of the Year
plaque, barring any late-season, banana-peel slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely should be Coach of the Year,'' Mr. Heisman-to-be
Ricky Williams said. ``He's made all the difference. We had pretty
much the same team as last year. The biggest difference is this
coaching staff and strength Coach (Jeff) Madden. Coach Brown is
more in touch with his players.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Brown deserves so much credit for a
turnaround from 4-7 to 6-2 is that he demands so little of it. And
he's smart enough to know he'll get it whether he wants it or not.
Instead, the self-effacing coach dishes it out to his able
assistants, Madden and 120 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``My influence is minimal,'' he said. ``I'd like to sit here and
take all the credit, but I had very little to do with Saturday's
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it. Brown has wowed in every department.
Gameplanning. Crunch-time decisions. Play-calling. Recruiting.
Public relations. And he has a competent, highly qualified staff
o(accent) nine have been head coaches at some level o(accent) that
has 189 combined years of experience. They've shown no panic, only
patience and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   The dangerous flip side is they could be in demand. ``We need to
keep 'em,'' said Brown, who is paying coordinators Carl Reese and
Greg Davis $115,000 each and each of the rest $80,000 or more to do
just that. At 55, Reese's head coaching window has probably closed
with no regrets from this defensive miracle worker. But offensive
boss Davis, 47, could be courted after a stellar season in which he
hasn't gotten the credit he's deserved, working with a freshman
quarterback in a new system. This observer would put Brown's staff
on a par with John Mackovic's first staff, Fred Akers' first staff
and Darrell Royal's 1971-75 staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Mackovic's assistants included top defensive coordinator Leon
Fuller, defensive line coach Rex Norris and Gene Dahlquist, Pat
Watson, Cleve Bryant and Bucky Godbolt offensively. Akers claimed
Fuller, David McWilliams, Mike Parker and Alan Lowry. Those
outstanding DKR crews boasted four eventual head coaches (Akers,
McWilliams, Emory Bellard and Spike Dykes), one should-have-been
head coach (Mike Campbell) and two top NFL assistants (Willie
Zapalac and Don Breaux).
</P>
<P>
   Brown talked to former Longhorns Bill Bradley (Buffalo Bills)
and Jerry Gray (Tennessee Oilers) about positions on his staff but
wanted to kickstart his program with people he already knew and
trusted. If new openings occur, those two might be in line.
</P>
<P>
   With a two-game improvement in the win column that's likely to
grow, Brown has engineered an about-face that has been bettered so
far by only Arkansas's Houston Nutt. The Razorback rookie has taken
a floundering 4-7 team to 7-0 and would be my early favorite to
become National Coach of the Year over Tulane's Tommy Bowden.
However, Brown should be a National Coach of the Year finalist for
the third year in a row. If not for those two humiliating defeats
by UCLA and Kansas State, he probably could add that to his list of
honors. However, he should be considered because of those two
losses because he kept his team together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not so worried about being browbeaten any more,'' senior
center Russell Gaskamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar setbacks wrecked Texas a year ago, but it is the
buoyancy of his staff, the sheer intensity of Madden and Brown's
constant upbeat attitude that has allowed the Longhorns to bail
water until they could right the ship. For instance, Texas trailed
K-State by 30, but when it forced a turnover, it was Christmas Day
for the bubbly Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Texas didn't fold in the second half against
UCLA this season as it did a year ago. That's why a 48-7 trouncing
in Manhattan the next week didn't harm these kids' psyche as
they've responded with five straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches don't like to lose,'' wideout Wane McGarity said.
``They take it just as hard as we do. They want us to feel losing
is bad, but they want us to get rid of it. We're not going to be
losers, and give the coaches all the credit.''

NBA LOCKOUT NO VACATION FOR HEARN
</HEADLINE>
 (restores material cut off) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike the NBA players, the refrigerator in the Hearn household
is working harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The 126-day labor dispute has made longtime Lakers announcer
Chick Hearn more restless than the nomadic Larry Brown. His wife,
Marge, confirmed that much the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fran,'' she sweetly chided him (Francis is his real name), ``I
hope you don't keep checking the refrigerator every chance you get
to see if the butter is getting hard and the Jell-O is jiggling.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the unpleasantness between the owners and the
players can't be over _ or ``in the refrigerator,'' in Hearnspeak _
soon enough to suit the octogenarian.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a stretch to say Hearn lives to work and works to live.
There's a reason why he hasn't had this much time on his hands in
more than six decades, since he took his first full-time job
straight out of East Aurora (Ill.) High.
</P>
<P>
   Words might be putty in his hands, to be shaped into wondrous
images. But Hearn has a tough time whittling leisure time into
anything worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most forlorn period I've had in my life,'' Hearn
said.
</P>
<P>
   A child of the Depression, Hearn learned early that to have a
job was a godsend. To enjoy what one does is to be twice blessed.
</P>
<P>
   These children of debauchery with their eight-car garages and
five-figure-per-game salaries who are crying foul, Hearn has a hard
time understanding. It's not a generation gap that separates Hearn
from the players who are fighting the owners for a bigger piece of
an already sickeningly sweet pie, it's a gentility gap.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marathoners weren't the only ones running around New
York on Sunday. A hardy band of fashion professionals spent the day
dashing from the West 50s to Chelsea to SoHo to the Lower East Side
to Greenwich Village. They were winding up a three-day weekend of
shows by young, mostly downtown designers to open the final week of
the American spring 1999 fashion season.
</P>
<P>
   The official week of shows _ centered on the tents in Bryant
Park _ opened Monday, but by then more than 30 less-known designers
had paraded their efforts. The top magazine editors may not have
gone downtown themselves, but representatives of their publications
and of major stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus,
Bloomingdale's and Henri Bendel searched the Off Seventh Avenue
shows for new talent. They found collections that ranged from the
experimental to the polished.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most refined were from evening wear designers.
William Calvert showed on Sunday in an empty bank on 57th Street,
Robert Danes on Saturday in a SoHo art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Calvert roped off an area where the models mingled and chatted
as if deserted by their men at a party. Fat chance. Each model
stepped out and circled the room to give the spectators a close-up
of what she was wearing. And a good thing it was, because only
close up could you see the masterly seaming that allowed the
dresses to flow gracefully over the body, outlining the figure
without constricting it.
</P>
<P>
   Calvert understands the elegance of simplicity, but a minimalist
he is not. His clothes have shape and subtle details. A slim red
crepe dress has a back slit and is draped to disclose an orange
lining. Other dresses have necklines that extend precisely to the
edge of each shoulder. Or a slim dress is draped softly under each
arm. Another, in white, is topped with a sleeveless bolero that
stands away from the neck to frame the face.
</P>
<P>
   The intricacies of Calvert's cuts recall Charles James, while
the architectural purity of the clothes gives them a timeless
beauty just right for this moment.
</P>
<P>
   Danes, in his best show to date, kept the lines of his dresses
simple but relied on tasteful decoration, using lacy openwork or
insets of another color or draped panels of fabric. A white dress
was divided asymmetrically into satin and chiffon halves. Lacy
tunics veiled satin and chiffon dresses. A bride ended his show in
a white dress with a train swathed in tulle for a theatrical effect
that would delight a modern romantic.
</P>
<P>
   David Rodriguez paired well-cut tailored jackets with layered
sheer skirts for a play of hard against soft. He used hand
painting, floral embroideries and appliques on pale satin or
georgette, added fine quilting to organza and used origami folding
as a decorative element.
</P>
<P>
   The folded cloth, in the shapes of flowers and stars, was
devised by a fabric artist, Chris Palmer. Rodriguez used these
``shadow fold'' designs on the front of a jacket or to outline a
neckline or mimic the look of scales on a gazar dress. Unlike much
origami pleating other designers have been using, the shadow folds
were flat, like appliques, not bulky or awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is a talented designer who will be heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   Others over the weekend used origami, asymmetry and
deconstruction techniques that designers like Rei Kawakubo, Martin
Margiela and Helmut Lang have made part of the universal fashion
language. Some, regrettably, looked merely derivative, while others
added personal quirks.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Lee experimented with deconstruction, ripping chiffon,
wrapping the body in gauze, adding panels or rectangles of colored
fabric to unexpected places and making clothing with pieces of
different fabrics. He crinkled the hems of some dresses and beaded
the ragged edges of others. Putting stirrup pants under some
clothes was a misstep, but Lee shows promise.
</P>
<P>
   Both Anait Bian and Gabriella Zanzani were too influenced by the
Japanese. Ms. Bian added sparkles to the models' faces, put panels
of pleats on the side of skirts, set in the fronts of jackets on an
angle, put an upside-down pleated layer over a skirt and turned one
sleeve of a dress into a hood. Ms. Zanzani had the models' hair
wrapped around their necks, showed tanks with separate sleeves, put
pleated folds on the sides of skirts and, in homage to Lang,
layered sheer tanks over solid.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Bennett put aprons of varying sizes and materials over
shirts and long full skirts, layered black tulle over voile and
decorated white cotton with delicate threadwork.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Danenberg had a more commercial, less tacky collection
than last season's. But her show was unoriginal, picking up trends
like ponchos, pouch belts, sheer layers over opaque, bare midriffs
over hip-huggers, asymmetric hems and even turned-under harem hems.
She also succumbed to soleless shoes, including spats over bare
feet. High heels held _ barely _ by a band across the instep have
been shown by avant-garde European designers and don't make any
more sense on this side of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Pixie Yates, a darling of the young crowd, was also a
disappointment, concentrating on peasant blouses or cropped
sweaters teamed with bias-cut micro-minis or long skirts with
drawstring waists.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Witt strewed pink roses on her runway for a charming
little show of quilted Liberty prints, smocking, flounced skirts
trimmed with satin ribbons and sequined ballet shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Thomas went his own way with a collection of 1950s sheaths
and full-skirted dresses in retro prints of ferns, cabbage roses
and multicolor florals, shown with matching purses and sometimes
cat's-eye glasses. The market for such styles may be limited, but
Thomas did them with flair and humor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The designers who showed on Sunday, including Bennett, Calvert
and Ms. Danenberg, were an independent lot. The other 20 were
organized under SOS, for South of Seventh, a group sponsored by the
SoHo and TriBeCa Partnerships, two nonprofit organizations that
provide job training for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The group event brought designers for the first time to a
central site, instead of scattering them around lower Manhattan as
in previous years. Shows were given on two floors at 428 Broadway,
near Canal Street, and a short walk away in Old St. Patrick's
Church gymnasium on Mulberry Street.
</P>
<P>
   The designer weekend was organized by Vicki Ross, an
international retail consultant, who worked six months on lining up
sponsors. To be part of South of Seventh, each designer put up
$1,000, which covered everything but models (most of whom were paid
in clothing, rather than money), invitations and personal
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   There were 18 sponsors, including R.J. Reynolds, American
Express, Henri Bendel, Swarovski Crystal, United Distillers and
Wolford. They paid the major expenses and contributed to the
organizing partnerships, for which a benefit dinner on Friday night
also raised $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   When the next season of shows rolls around in February, Ms. Ross
is hoping to display 30 designers in a three-day South of Seventh
weekend. ``We already have 300 designers on the waiting list,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Which just proves how important group fashion shows have become
to designers with a limited budget. They know it's their best shot
at getting the press attention that will spell orders and, with
luck, sales.

COWBOYS SEE EAGLES DISCOVER NEW LOWS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Call the National Football Conference East what
you wish: lousy, lame, weak, ghoulish, sorry. But the Dallas
Cowboys do not want to hear it. Just call them the front-runners.
With half the season over, they are first in the division.
</P>
<P>
   A thorough 34-0 thrashing of the lousy, lame, weak, ghoulish and
sorry Philadelphia Eagles before 67,002 fans Monday night at
Veterans Stadium insured the Cowboys the top spot. Dallas is 5-3
and no other NFC East team has a winning record, the only division
in the National Football League with this distinction. The bottom
three teams in the division (Giants, Eagles and Redskins) are a
combined 5-19. The Giants (3-5) are up next for Dallas. The Eagles
are a horrendous 1-7.
</P>
<P>
   They fell behind by 17-0 by halftime Monday night and then in
the third quarter watched Dallas score on Troy Aikman's 9-yard
touchdown pass to tight end David LaFleur. By the time Emmitt Smith
rambled 15 yards for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter to put
Dallas ahead by 34-0, most of the Eagles' fans were long gone and
so were the Eagles' hopes for anything good to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman played well in his first game back after missing five
because of a broken collarbone. He completed 14 of 26 passes for
171 yards and 2 touchdowns and then left with more than nine
minutes left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The game had just enough big plays to hold the fans' attention.
Too bad for the Eagles' fans that they were all Dallas plays.
</P>
<P>
   The play of the game was made just before halftime _ by Deion
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders had played possum on his previous punt return. Though
there appeared to be running room, he signaled for a fair catch and
simply caught the ball and tossed it to an official.
</P>
<P>
   But on the next Philadelphia punt, Sanders caught the ball, took
a quick step toward the middle and then broke down the right
sideline. Sanders, 31 and in his 10th pro season, sped through the
Eagles' defenders and then showed a burst of pure speed at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders still delights. This return was for 69 yards, a
touchdown that made it 17-0 Dallas, with 1 minute 49 seconds left
in the half. Right then, the Eagles looked stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Eagles? A half remained.
</P>
<P>
   This was Dallas' 55th appearance on ``Monday Night Football.''
Only Miami (57) has more. It was the fourth straight season that
Dallas and Philadelphia had met on a Monday night. Dallas has won
all four. In fact, the Cowboys are 10-3 in their last 12 games
against the Eagles. And Dallas _ with a 31-7 victory over the
Giants on Sept. 21 _ made it 2-0 on Monday nights this season.
Sanders returned a punt for a touchdown in that one, too, for 59
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's first half proved too much for the Eagles. Dallas
was damaging enough, but the Eagles sputtered and spun and helped
the Cowboys spurt to a 17-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10-0 after one quarter, a quarter in which Philadelphia
ran 10 offensive plays, passed 4 times and gained no passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quarter in which quarterback Rodney Peete, on the
Eagles' first offensive series, injured his right hand and did not
return. And that, too, would prove costly, quickly, to
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas got things started right. Though Aikman was sacked on his
first snap for an 8-yard loss, he and the Dallas offense righted
themselves and drove 14 plays and kept the ball for 7:06, roaming
all the way to the Eagles' 16. Richie Cunningham kicked a 33-yard
field goal to put Dallas ahead, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   On Philadelphia's next possession, Peete was injured and the
Eagles punted. The Cowboys punted it right back. Peete's
replacement, Bobby Hoying, tried to hand the ball off to running
back Charlie Garner on his first snap. The exchange was way off.
Garner, though, was the one who bobbled it most, fumbling the ball
to Dallas at the Eagles' 11, where Kavika Pittman recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Aikman zipped a tight, sharp throw toward
Michael Irvin. Irvin ran a deep out pattern in the left corner of
the end zone for the score and the conversion gave Dallas a 10-0
lead with 1:27 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse for Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   In the final seconds of the first quarter, the Eagles celebrated
when running back Duce Staley burst through a stunting Dallas line
and sped 46 yards to the Dallas 37. That was easily the Eagles'
highlight of the half. But a Hoying pass was intercepted on the
same drive, early in the second quarter.

OUR TOWNS: A BAKE SALE WITH TRADITION IN THE RECIPE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ When the ``For Sale'' sign went up at Landolfi's
Italian Pastry Shop, grown men cried.
</P>
<P>
   Where would they go for sfogliatelle, cannoli and rum cake soft
as a cloud? Who would provide zeppoli for the Feast of St. Joseph
and braided sweet bread for Easter? What about the trays of pignoli
cookies that are a must at Neapolitan weddings?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like they would always be there,'' said Msgr. Thomas
Gervasio of St. Joachim's Roman Catholic Church, just a block away
in the historic Chambersburg neighborhood, where Landolfi's has
been a fixture for more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gervasio, the 11th of 13 children, recalls the short walk each
Sunday to pick up sweets for the midday meal. There he would bump
into the Dileos, Tuccillos and other families who made ``the Burg''
their home, living in brick row houses, pressing wine in the
basement and growing figs in their tiny backyards.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is unchanged, with a picture of the Blessed Virgin on
the wall, opera on the radio and the pastries made with the recipes
Pasquale Landolfi brought from the Neapolitan village of Casandrino
in 1891. On his deathbed, in an apartment behind the store,
Landolfi dictated the recipes, now under lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   Landolfi's great-nephew, Gary Bencivengo, the fourth and current
owner, is offering those recipes and an apprenticeship to whoever
buys the shop, which is on the market for $150,000. He wants the
new owner to work beside him and his wife, Suzanne, long enough to
master the technique and get to know the customers, who do not take
kindly to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever buys it is a brave person,'' said Rosalie Brenna, who
served Landolfi cookies at her wedding and buys them for her
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``My customers will let them know if anything's wrong,'' said
Suzanne Bencivengo, who went through a neighborhood hazing when she
entered the insular world of Chambersburg as a young bride. ``This
is not just a store to these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bencivengo, 40, grew up behind the counter. He napped on flour
sacks, scrubbed baking tins and practiced the piano in the living
room with the customers watching. By 10, he was baking. His father
urged him to go to college, where he lasted two weeks. Pastry was
his calling.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his experience, when his parents, George and Ann
Bencivengo, retired to South Carolina in 1990, customers said the
cakes had tasted better the year before. ``I made them that year,''
Gary said.
</P>
<P>
   It took months for him to quiet the skeptics and longer for his
wife to fill the shoes of her formidable mother-in-law. Now the
couple and their three children are headed south, too, near Myrtle
Beach, where they intend to open a pastry shop.
</P>
<P>
   The Bencivengos say they yearn to be near family. But changes
have taken a toll. Chambersburg retained its Old World flavor
longer than most neighborhoods here, where the 19th-century iron,
steel and rubber factories were abandoned in the 1960s. But now,
even the Burg is fraying at the edges.
</P>
<P>
   The parishes have withered as old-timers have died and families
have moved to the suburbs. Doors that stood open are bolted.
Toddlers can't play on the stoop.
</P>
<P>
   Bencivengo is one of the few of his contemporaries to remain.
``That's my gripe with my generation,'' he said. ``Everybody wants
a big backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   A customer, Anthony Anastasio, shrugged guiltily. He grew up in
the Burg, within blocks of his relatives, each in a house with a
15-by-20-foot yard. Now Anastasio lives on 10 acres in
Pennsylvania. He is an accountant in the Public Defender's office
and comes in for cannoli.
</P>
<P>
   Bencivengo tried a second store in Princeton, but overwork sent
him to the hospital. He thought about adding Latin sweets for the
Central American newcomers to the neighborhood. He considered
working longer hours to make up for slower business. But he already
sells all day, six days a week, and bakes most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the perfect buyer has not been easy. One local bakery
wants to purchase the name but not the store. Another candidate
wants to jump in without training.
</P>
<P>
   Bencivengo is wary. ``I need to feel them out more, look into
their eyes,'' he said. ``It boils down to passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his customers, Bencivengo grows misty at the prospect of
leaving. ``The thought of giving someone the key and closing the
door behind me. ... I run that day through my mind so often. I'll
need to be sedated.''

FOOTBALL SPIRITS MAY NOT SURVIVE HOLIDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Look at it this way: Football fans who were delaying
Christmas plans until the local postseason picture was determined
can call the airlines now.
</P>
<P>
   Grandmas everywhere will be pleased to have visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's highly undistinguished o-fer by the Seahawks,
Huskies and Cougars suggests a winter football bleakness unseen in
awhile here.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Northwest has been a citadel of big-time gridiron
greatness. What passes for a feast hereabouts is a Rose Bowl or a
pro playoff game about every decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Tallahassee, South Bend and Green Bay, it ain't _ for which we
can be eternally grateful, unless you're prone to painting your
face and going shirtless in front of 60,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies are 5-3 and staggering into the buzzsaw portion of
the schedule, the Cougars are 3-5 and hanging on to last year's
Rose Bowl programs for dear life, and the 4-4 Seahawks pulled all
groins in taking a giant step backward Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For the Snohomish County coaching triumvirate of Jim Lambright,
Mike Price and Dennis Erickson, the news has been worse than a hike
in the cost of overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Price is in the least jeopardy. For a school that goes to the
Rose Bowl every 67 years, expectations are less than enormous.
</P>
<P>
   A few laughs, a few wins and low foam in the keg are usually
sufficient features to satisfy most Cougar fans most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Ryan Leaf had chosen to screech childishly at Northwest
reporters for his senior year instead of providing the same classy
display for Southern California reporters, the cosmic serendipity
of 1997 was a once-every-Comet-Kahoutek kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lambright missed by one play, a failed two-point
conversion by Oregon State, of having to sell off several internal
organs to pacify the Tyee Club crowd, he's probably safe, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Huskies earlier were falsely accused of being a
top-10 team by the wire-service polls, the sanctions-savaged junior
and senior classes provide enough of a fig leaf that unless
Lambright commits NCAA violations or embarrasses players publicly _
always a modest threat _ even a 5-6 record is survivable.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Erickson, he has neither the protection of low
expectations nor the excuse of lack of talent.
</P>
<P>
   By blowing an entirely winnable home game Sunday against an
ordinary team, the Seahawks allowed owner Paul Allen and president
Bob Whitsitt to revisit their darkest offseason doubts about the
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Denied their first love by the NBA lockout, these guys might be
bored enough to do anything, particularly given the large
investment in players, coaches, facilities and advertising made in
the franchise over the last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't merely the 31-18 loss to an archrival _ it was the
repetition of previous mistakes that was so damning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be different if we were the same team from four or
five years ago,'' defensive end Michael Sinclair, an eight-year
Seahawk, said after Sunday's game. ``We say we're not. We still do
the same things. That's a killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep doing the same stuff. We keep playing like (years
ago). I'm very frustrated. We can't do stupid stuff like that and
expect to win a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a significant offseason upgrade in talent, the Seahawks
continue to do the stupid stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Had they not received an officiating break on the
simultaneous-catch call involving Joey Galloway against San Diego a
week earlier, the Seahawks likely would be an undefendable 0-4 in
the AFC West despite closely contesting each game.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility is decent that all three teams will be denied
the postseason. While that is the usual fare for the Seahawks and
Cougars, the traditional Husky bowl participation is in jeopardy
even with a 6-5 mark because of better marks in the rest of the
Pac-10 combined with the place-slotting of the minor bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Bad as the collective football fortunes are at the moment, one
doesn't have to get into the Wayback Machine to find recent similar
travail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Seahawks were 6-10 (following a 2-14 season),
Washington State was 5-6 and the Huskies, although 7-4, were
bowl-less because of the Pac-10 sanctions that provoked the
resignation of coach Don James 12 days before the season.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Seattle was considered a sporting abyss whose
depth and breadth nearly defied measurement. At least now there are
the Mar . . . oh, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   As with the stock market, sports-team fortunes are always
cyclical. It's just that in local football, I don't recall any
sustained emotional wealth from a run above the 9,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Bleak as it seems, there is solace for the local sports fan this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
   No Sonics-Mavericks games.
</P>
<P>
   And you can always look forward to all those wonderful slices of
fruitcake in Grandma's overheated kitchen.

NBA LOCKOUT IS NO VACATION FOR HEARN
</HEADLINE>
 (2nd TRY AT RESTORING MATERIAL CUT OFF) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Unlike the NBA players, the refrigerator in the
Hearn household is working harder than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The 126-day labor dispute has made longtime Los Angeles Lakers
announcer Chick Hearn more restless than the nomadic Larry Brown.
His wife, Marge, confirmed that much the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fran,'' she sweetly chided him (Francis is his real name), ``I
hope you don't keep checking the refrigerator every chance you get
to see if the butter is getting hard and the Jell-O is jiggling.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the unpleasantness between the owners and the
players can't be over _ or ``in the refrigerator,'' in Hearnspeak _
soon enough to suit the octogenarian.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a stretch to say Hearn lives to work and works to live.
There's a reason why he hasn't had this much time on his hands in
more than six decades, since he took his first full-time job
straight out of East Aurora (Ill.) High.
</P>
<P>
   Words might be putty in his hands, to be shaped into wondrous
images. But Hearn has a tough time whittling leisure time into
anything worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most forlorn period I've had in my life,'' Hearn
said.
</P>
<P>
   A child of the Depression, Hearn learned early that to have a
job was a godsend. To enjoy what one does is to be twice blessed.
</P>
<P>
   These children of debauchery with their eight-car garages and
five-figure-per-game salaries who are crying foul, Hearn has a hard
time understanding. It's not a generation gap that separates Hearn
from the players who are fighting the owners for a bigger piece of
an already sickeningly sweet pie, it's a gentility gap.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson complains about having to scale back his $10,000
monthly allowance so he can cover his $12,500 monthly rent on a
home in Beverly Hills, his $7,200-a-month child-support payment and
his $75,000-a-year car insurance for eight luxury vehicles, and
Hearn bristles.
</P>
<P>
   He can scarcely stomach the rhetoric coming from both camps. For
33 years he hasn't let any illness slow him down, so it bugs him
that other peoples' avarice has put off his 3,044th consecutive
Lakers broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any sympathy for the players or the owners,''
Hearn said. ``I feel sorry for the people such as ushers who need
the money they earn from NBA games.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Marge, the faceless hostage in this crisis. Even
Chick acknowledged the lockout ``has been harder on her than it's
been on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Marge didn't disagree. As she put it, ``He's on vacation. I'm
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Any woman with a retired man underfoot knows exactly what Marge
means. Those household chores you've been doing the same way for 58
years? Try getting them done with your husband providing running
commentary. The way Chick dissects her form, you'd think Marge's
name was Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes in Encino, we can hear Chick clearly:
</P>
<P>
   ``She goes back and forth like a windshield wiper with the
vacuum. A piece of lint stands like a sentry, blocking the Hoover's
path. It's got things dammed up, I tell you. Marge doesn't need a
sweeper, she needs a crane!''
</P>
<P>
   Silly Marge, she had the temerity to look at the work stoppage
as a blessing in disguise. This would be her chance to drag Chick
to the theater and to Las Vegas. They'd finally enjoy quality time
together, away from Chick's spoiled mistress, basketball.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Marge did manage to coax Chick onto a cruise
ship, turning the reluctant tourist into a captive vacationer. They
sailed to Alaska, stopping in ports with populations smaller than
the average NBA star's entourage.
</P>
<P>
   It was paradise, up to a point. Chick and Marge would wander the
streets of some idyllic outpost and Chick would feel himself
starting to relax. Then all of a sudden some stranger would call
out his name and ask, ``So, when is the NBA going to start up
again?''
</P>
<P>
   Chick's smile would grow taut, his jaw would tighten and his
frustration would start spilling out. By the time his new friend
had thanked him for his time and gotten his autograph, Chick's
buoyant mood had sunk deeper than the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Other than their 11-day cruise, Marge hasn't had much luck
spiriting Chick away. Hearn said he is reluctant to roam too far,
lest the labor dispute is suddenly resolved. That's also the reason
he gives for turning down a radio station's overtures to spin
oldies and yarns with Marge acting as his sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the lockout ends, Hearn wants to be able to get to the
Forum within the hour. So until there are any obscure basketball
statistics to commit to memory, Hearn is hanging close to home and
trying to concentrate on Marge's scribblings.
</P>
<P>
   She gives him a list of things to do every day. Heaven help the
NBA if Hearn has enough time to tackle the final item.
</P>
<P>
   If he starts cleaning out the garage, we'll know the league
really has hit the skids.

TIME RUNNING OUT FOR UNDERACHIEVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ The Seattle Seahawks have reached the midway
point of their fourth season under Dennis Erickson on the verge.
</P>
<P>
   On the verge of what is the question.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-4, the Seahawks still can become the playoff team they were
expecting to be by winning, say, six of their remaining eight
games. Or they can continue to be the turnover-plagued,
mistake-riddled team that has lost four of its past five games to
waste a 3-0 season start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating more than anything. We still feel we have a
good football team,'' Randy Mueller, Seahawks vice president of
football operations, said Monday. ``We have to make an effort to
change things and shake it up. No one is happy with 4-4.''
</P>
<P>
   The shaking process started Monday when veteran wide receiver
Ronnie Harris was released and plans were made to bring in
offensive linemen and linebackers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not franchise-turning moves, but moves intended to make a
statement and get the players' attention as this struggling team
tries to pick up the pieces in the wake of Sunday night's
embarrassing loss to the Oakland Raiders on national TV and in
front of a sellout crowd at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Erickson met with Mueller, who in turn met with club
president Bob Whitsitt. Erickson also met with his players. Mueller
also met with linebacker Chad Brown, who made some critical _ some
would say long-overdue _ comments about accountability after
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   There was no players-only meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we didn't have a meeting,'' said Brown, whose decision to
put his finger on the bleeding pulse of this team has thrust him
into the role of being the heart and soul of this team. ``Let's
give it a day or two and get some perspective. We gave a game away,
and if you dwell on it any farther than today you're taking energy
away from what you should be devoting to the Kansas City game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' season has been diminished to a cliche. They must
take each game one at a time, starting with Sunday's rematch with
the Chiefs, another highly touted team that has fallen to 4-4, at
the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten ourselves into a position where we have no room
at all for error,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to this than winning or losing a few more football
games. The Seahawks are playing for the future of the coach who has
spent the past four years compiling this collection of talented
underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson is in the fourth season of the five-year deal he signed
in 1995. The expectations were that he would rescue this franchise.
Erickson has made the Seahawks better, but the team still is not a
winner. And there is no need to remind him that his tenure is
teetering on what happens in the next eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Erickson is upset,'' wide receiver James McKnight said.
``He told us he has a sick feeling in his stomach and that he's
going to do everything he can to make it go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson can start by throwing caution to the wind, not to
mention the football. He was hired away from the University of
Miami in part because his offense was always imaginative and wide
open to the point of making opposing defensive coordinators' heads
spin. Life in the NFL, and on the coaching hot seat, has made him
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   It might be unfair to brand him with the coaching-not-to-lose
label that eventually led to the firing of Chuck Knox after the
1991 season, but Erickson's offense has lost some of its pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   With another loss or two, the Seahawks will have nothing to
lose. So instead of backing themselves into that corner, they might
as well come out firing. Bring back the wide receiver screen that
was so effective at Miami, and is used with success at this level
by the San Francisco 49ers and Green Bay Packers. It is one more
way to get the ball into the hands of Joey Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time a ``Wow'' was attached to the scheme that
went into a Seahawks offensive play?
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is winning, and the Seahawks have not done
enough of it since Erickson was hired. More than the 27-29 record
in 4{ seasons under Erickson is the bottom-line fact that the
Seahawks have been above .500 in only 12 of a possible 56 weeks _
with half of those coming this season.
</P>
<P>
   These players are better than that. But this team has yet to
prove it is better than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to believe that you can win, and you've got to
believe that you can compete with anybody,'' veteran safety Mark
Collins said after the loss to the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's here yet. You've got to have
consistency; we don't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than cringe when he read the statements by Brown and
Collins, Mueller almost welcomed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason we brought those guys in here,'' he said.
``They won't accept losing. They're bound and determined to fix it.
Any sense that, `Yeah, we're OK,' that would be fooling
ourselves.''

MANAGER'S EXIT COSTS L.A. $200,000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Offering rare insight into why the city of Los
Angeles routinely pays top managers to retire or resign, Mayor
Richard Riordan said he convinced the parks manager to step down by
offering her a one-year, $200,000 consulting contract.
</P>
<P>
   The city has spent more than $1.2 million since 1990 to buy out
at least 11 city bureaucrats, most of whom were pressured to quit
or were fired because of poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Jackie Tatum, general manager of the Department
of Parks and Recreation, Riordan contends he was forced into
``back-room lobbying'' because he cannot remove managers himself
and didn't think he could muster enough votes on the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to every council member and they agreed, but I wasn't
sure there would be the votes there. So I did some back-room
lobbying, and we worked out the contract,'' Riordan said Monday.
``We offered her a contract to be a consultant on a quid pro quo
for her leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's spokeswoman said such buyouts actually save the city
money by preventing dismissed employees from suing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bigger picture, at the end of the day, is to give the
mayor the authority to hire and fire department heads,'' said
mayoral spokeswoman Noelia Rodriguez. ``That's the key to
developing accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the proposals to be presented to voters next year, the
elected Charter Reform Commission is recommending that the mayor be
empowered to fire department managers.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Chick, however, said the city already has
powers to remove department managers who are not performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the power where the mayor sets goals and objectives
and it's reviewed by council,'' Chick said. ``That allows you to
make a direct route to remove general managers who aren't
performing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chick said she also distrusted the use of buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not from the private sector where these come from, but it
seems to me it's better to reward someone for performance and
remove those who aren't performing up to standard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said he had no choice but to offer Tatum a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Recreation and Parks, we had a situation everyone
recognized wasn't working well,'' said Riordan, who as a parks
commissioner in 1992 selected Tatum as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Tatum agreed to the consulting contract in which she
would continue to work for the city but not as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   One of her top assistants, Rick Sessinghaus, is serving as
interim general manager until a permanent department head is
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum, who had been paid $147,329 a year as general manager, did
not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum is one in a series of high-ranking city officials offered
consulting contracts in return for their resignation or early
retirement, under Riordan and former Mayor Tom Bradley. Among these
were former Community Redevelopment Agency chief John Tuite, Zoo
Director Mark Goldstein, Animal Services Director Gary Olsen and,
perhaps the most famous, former Police Chief Willie L. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan would not detail specific complaints about Tatum, but
other officials, on the condition of anonymity, said she had a
habit of promising programs and projects and never following
through.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her departure, Riordan had issued a statement
praising her years of service and hoping she would be able to bring
in money to the city from private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Parks Commission President Steve Soboroff said she has been
doing that and that he would continue to make sure she did perform
her consulting work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor wanted to see a change,'' Soboroff said. ``But I'll
make sure we get our money's worth out of her. She's already done a
lot of work with companies like Nike and Reebok to get them to pay
for projects, such as refinishing gym floors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has tremendous contacts in the private sector and I think
it will help us bring in more money.''

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Eleven of the classiest race horses in Europe
boarded flights in Dublin, Ireland, and in London Monday and headed
for Churchill Downs on a mission that has frequently been fruitless
but promises greater success this time: carrying the colors of
Europe's best racing stables in the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Their handlers knew two things as they started the annual
trans-Atlantic invasion: The cool weather here figured to
invigorate their horses, and they were returning to the scene of
their greatest successes in the 14 runnings of the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   They also seemed to be living down the suspicion that time,
distance and past failures might be diminishing Europe's zest for
sending horses so far so late in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans intend to start six horses each in the Mile and the
Turf, both run on grass and both more suitable for horses who
customarily race on grass. They even seem to have the favorites in
each race: Desert Prince in the Mile and Royal Anthem and Daylami
in the Turf.
</P>
<P>
   But Royal Anthem, who has been working out at Churchill Downs
ahead of the main body of English horses, Monday came down with
soreness in his left foreleg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a setback,'' Henry Cecil, the trainer of the
3-year-old colt, said. ``Hopefully, we will be able to run, but it
is not definite.''
</P>
<P>
   Alistair Donald, director of the International Racing Bureau,
said the trouble seemed to stem from a ``hot nail'' in a shoe worn
by Royal Anthem, a son of Theatrical, who has won four of his five
starts. But later, the barn reported that a new shoe had been
fastened in place and the colt's condition was improving.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Breeders' Cup was inaugurated in 1984, runners from
Europe have competed in 98 races and have won 16, finished second
in 14 and third in 14. So, they have run in the money about 15
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The two flights from Britain brought to 16 the number of
European horses aiming for this year's Breeders' Cup, the largest
contingent since the 1994 races. They were also held at Churchill
Downs and drew 26 runners from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign horses won the Mile and the Turf and ran second in the
Turf and the Juvenile. But the Europeans did even better at
Churchill Downs in 1991, when 21 runners were entered and three
won: Sheikh Albadou in the Sprint, Arazi in the Juvenile with a
stunning dash around the field, and Miss Alleged in the Turf.
</P>
<P>
   But the next year at Gulfstream Park in Florida, in the darkest
hour for European horses, another 21 made the trip and all were
shut out. The culprit was commonly believed to be the hot weather,
which wilted many horses who preferred cooler Novembers. After
that, the number who chanced the trip dwindled to nine last year at
Hollywood Park _ except when they ran the Breeders' Cup again at
Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot weather may have been one factor, but not the only one,''
Donald said. ``There is a bit of a trend, namely, that if you're
going to keep your horse in training when he's 4 years old,
trainers will elect not to overdo it and compromise their horse for
the following year. So, they'll stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it's an expensive business, traveling to the Breeders'
Cup. It could run you from $5,000 to $10,000 to fly your horse with
others, or as much as $60,000 if he flies alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But over the years, the European horses have held their own.
Of the 16 winners from Europe, 10 were from France, four from
England and two from Ireland. And remember, Miesque won the Mile
two years in a row, in 1987 and 1988. And this year, we think the
Europeans have as good a chance of winning as at any time in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   The most talented runner from Europe may already be at Churchill
Downs: Swain, perhaps the most versatile horse in Europe and the
best in England. He is entered in the $4 million Classic, the main
event.
</P>
<P>
   In his only other race on the dirt, the Dubai World Cup last
March, he lost by a nose to Silver Charm, the winner of the
Kentucky Derby last year.
</P>
<P>
   Another star, Daylami, will run in the Turf. They are
stablemates, and both were on the track at Churchill Downs Monday
morning doing their exercise while the others from Europe were
flying the Atlantic to join them.

RUDOLPH MELONE, 73, FOUNDER OF CALIFORNIA'S GILROY GARLIC FESTIVAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rudolph J. Melone, whose career as a college administrator was
overshadowed by his founding of the famed Gilroy Garlic Festival in
Gilroy, Calif., died on Sept. 17 in San Francisco. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which started in 1979, now draws more than 125,000
paying visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   Melone, a native of New Haven, Conn., was a University of
Portland graduate who received his doctorate in the administration
of higher education at the University of California at Berkeley and
helped start Pima Community College in Tucson, Ariz., before going
to Gilroy in 1975 as president of Gavilan Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Melone got the idea for the festival after reading about a
similar event in France. He presented his idea to the Rotary Club
and enlisting local garlic growers and other businesses. After
initial resistance, he won enough support to stage the first
festival. It was such a success he had no trouble making it an
annual event, one where the profusion of garlic-laced foods include
garlic ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   The festival has an innovative structure that insures a constant
flow of new volunteers and new ideas. The 5,000 volunteers receive
an hourly ``stipend'' paid to the charities of their choice from
festival proceeds and work their way up to management positions.
</P>
<P>
   In its first 20 years the festival has raised more than $5
million for Gilroy charities.
</P>
<P>
   At Berkeley, Melone, who was divorced, married a widow with
three young sons, adopted them and moved to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Melone stepped down as festival head after three years and
retired from Gavilan in 1985 because of failing eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to San Francisco, the development of video
magnifiers restored his ability to read, and he twice served as
acting president of the Saybrook Institute, a small graduate school
of psychology.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gloria; a son from his first
marriage, Mark, of Paterson, Calif.; three other sons, John, of
Union City, Calif., Philip, of Vallejo, Calif., and Michael, of
Emeryville, Calif., and four grandsons.

EAGLES CORNERBACK, DEFENSIVE END GET EXTENSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Philadelphia Eagles yesterday prevented
cornerback Bobby Taylor and defensive end Greg Jefferson from
becoming unrestricted free agents after the season by signing the
two players to multiyear contract extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the Eagles' second-round selection in the 1995 draft,
received a six-year extension that included a revised contract for
this season. Jefferson received a four-year contract that also
included a revised package for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep our players here, and this is certainly a step
in that direction,'' said Tom Modrak, the Eagles' director of
football operations. ``Bobby obviously is one of the elite
cornerbacks in the NFL, and signing him to a long-term contract _
one that will keep him with us through the year 2004 _ is exciting.
``He's only 24 and has a great future in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Signing Greg Jefferson to an extension gives us some stability
up front. He's a solid, front-line player who has improved every
year he's been here.'' Hoying decision The Eagles must decide
whether third-year quarterback Bobby Hoying will emerge as a
cornerstone for their struggling franchise in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying, whom coach Ray Rhodes benched earlier this season, did
not provide any evidence last night to suggest that the Ohio State
product deserves the quarterback-of-the-future label.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying replaced injured starter Rodney Peete after the latter
suffered a laceration to his right index finger, and disaster
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying and running back Charlie Garner failed to execute their
exchange on a handoff on the quarterback's first snap with 2:18
remaining in the first quarter. Defensive end Kavika Pittman
recovered the loose ball at the Eagles' 9-yard line, and
quarterback Troy Aikman completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to
receiver Michael Irvin two plays later as the Cowboys took a 10-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying's third pass attempt _ on first-and-15 from the Cowboys'
25-yard line _ resulted in an interception by strong safety Darren
Woodson. Those two mistakes likely resulted in a 10-point swing in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying, the Eagles' third-round selection in the 1996 draft,
started four of the season's first five games before being benched
in favor of Peete. Hoying completed 13 of 39 passes for 124 yards
with two interceptions last night. More penalty woes Repeat
offenders Ike Reese and Anthony Marshall hurt the Eagles on special
teams, combining for four penalties for 50 yards in the first half.
The Eagles were penalized seven times for 70 yards in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Reese and Marshall were both called for offensive holding,
Marshall for unnecessary roughness and Reese for unsportsmanlike
conduct. Matt Stevens was called for roughing the kicker on the
Cowboys' third-quarter punt.
</P>
<P>
   Then, defensive back Tim McTyer was called for unnecessary
roughness for a late hit on Cowboys wide receiver Billy Davis, the
intended receiver in the end zone late in third quarter. Two
penalties on that drive led to a Cowboys' field goal, which made it
27-0. Briefly The 46-yard run by Duce Staley in the first quarter
was the longest of his career and of this Eagles season. ...
Baltimore quarterback Jim Harbaugh was at the game to see his
brother, Eagles special teams coach John Harbaugh. ... A man in a
skunk suit sat among the Eagles fans with a ``We stink'' sign. A
banner at the 50-yard line banner read ``We deserve better'' at the
start of the game, and ``Stadium? Build a kennel'' in the second
half. At least three brawls broke out in the stands, and
anti-Jeffrey Lurie chants protesting the Eagles' ownership were
heard in the second half.

WANTED: A SCORING TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Detroit Red Wings played three-quarters of last season minus
an unsigned Sergei Fedorov and never seemed to suffer for it. The
Kings, for all intents and purposes, have been without an injured
Jozef Stumpel for the first 11 games of this season and have
sputtered to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be fair to compare a rebuilding Kings franchise to
a team that has won consecutive Stanley Cups. On the other hand,
the Kings' 126-minute, 12-second goal drought has provided a vivid
reminder that they have a long way to go before they can be viewed
as a serious contender for anything more than first- or
second-round playoff elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of offense didn't just start for the Kings with
Stumpel's hip-flexor injury and it isn't simply an aberration of
the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Since play resumed following last season's Olympic break, the
Kings have played 42 regular-season and playoff games, posting a
16-22-4 record and averaging 2.26 goals a game. In those 42 games,
the Kings have been shut out six times and have been limited to two
or fewer goals 25 times.
</P>
<P>
   Big centers who can get the puck to a team's scoring threats are
at a premium in the NHL. The better teams have two of them. Teams
with only one are doomed to inconsistency. Right now, with Stumpel
sidelined, the Kings have none, unless newly promoted Olli Jokinen
can do the job at age 19.
</P>
<P>
   If he can, and if Stumpel ultimately returns at full strength,
Stumpel's injury might prove a blessing because of the premature
opportunity it forced the Kings to give Jokinen.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings better hope Jokinen can do the job. The offensive
drought is at 126:12 ... and counting.
</P>
<P>
   __ All in the family: After trading his son, Eric, to the Kings
last week, Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix acknowledged he
had always known such a day would come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the committee (coaches and management) made me
understand when we did the trade, I could not be the dad,'' Pierre
Lacroix said. ``I had to be the GM. I always had in the back of my
mind some day I would have to do the opposite and trade away Eric.
I hope you all understand and respect what I am going through.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stevie Wonder: Detroit's Steve Yzerman hasn't had a 100-point
season since 1992-93, when he had 137 points, and in recent years
he has concentrated more on playing a two-way game than on
producing gaudy numbers. At 33, the hugely productive years seemed
behind Yzerman, who in 1988-89 had 155 points, the best season ever
by a player not named Wayne Gretzky or Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting, then, that Yzerman quietly has begun putting
up big numbers again.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 52 games, including the end of last season and the
playoffs, Yzerman has 21 goals and 66 points, which projects to 104
points in an 82-game season. Last season, Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr
led the NHL with 102 points.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, who has three goals and 13 points in 10 games this
season, credits his stint with the Canadian Olympic team earlier
this year for his increased output. The high tempo of the practices
made him realize he could play with greater intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're doing anything, you can get lazy and stop doing
whatever it is with the same crispness or sharpness, and going to
the Olympics was a real boost,'' Yzerman said. ``It gave me a
renewed enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not gloating: Commissioner Gary Bettman said he doesn't view
the NBA lockout as a positive event for the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a bus drives through a puddle, everyone gets splashed,''
Bettman said. ``Are we going to wind up getting more exposure for
the NHL if the NBA doesn't play? Probably. But this isn't the way
you want to get it. It just gives fans another reason to be
disillusioned with pro sports. At the end of the day, I don't wish
it on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the small crowds that are becoming routine in a
number of NHL arenas, it doesn't appear the league is cleaning up
from the NBA lockout, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   __ Loose pucks: And the Kings thought they had goalie problems:
Detroit's Chris Osgood dressed up as Baywatch hunk David Hasselhoff
for a Halloween party, and his date went as Pamela Anderson. Osgood
applied loads of tanning goo to himself for the occasion and has
had a strange, orange tint ever since. Backup goalie Norm Maracle
went as a cheerleader and at last report still hadn't gotten all
the mascara off his eyelashes.

NORBERT WOLLHEIM, 85, LEADER OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Idaho, Wash.)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norbert Wollheim, a tenacious Auschwitz survivor who
went on to sue the Germans for compensation for his work as a slave
laborer, then devoted his life to building a spirited movement of
Holocaust survivors, died on Sunday at Long Island Jewish Medical
Center. He was 85 and lived in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart failure, said his stepson Peter
Sprung.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for many to imagine that someone who lived through
the horrors that Wollheim endured could sustain so deep a zest for
life. His aspirations as a lawyer were shattered by the Nazis'
anti-Jewish laws. His pregnant wife and 3-year-old son died at
Auschwitz, two of 80 relatives killed by the Nazis. He was one of
the 25,000 Jews who were forced to build a synthetic-rubber plant
for I.G. Farben, risking extermination in Auschwitz's gas chambers
if they collapsed from fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, far from succumbing to despair, Wollheim, upon liberation,
built a second family with a woman he met at Bergen-Belsen, a
former concentration camp that was later used by the British to
house refugees. And he did not stop there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, he sued Farben, one of Germany's largest manufacturers,
saying it was a matter of principle that the Germans should pay him
for two years of work. Not only did he initially win about $25 a
week for himself, but his suit also opened the way for a settlement
with Farben that established a fund of $6.43 million to compensate
other Jewish laborers. He remained active in work for survivors'
claims for much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   After immigrating to the United States in 1952, Wollheim, along
with Benjamin Meed, Ernest Michel and a handful of others, knit
together the survivor community at a time when many did not want to
dwell on their experience, or felt they were not even entitled to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   The movement produced its most luminous moment in 1981, when
7,000 survivors from around the world _ mostly successful
middle-aged men and women who had once endured starvation,
degradation and the loss of their families _ gathered in Jerusalem
to pay tribute to their dead and affirm the triumph of their own
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Wollheim, a courtly, cultured man with a gift for tart
understatement, was born on April 26, 1913, in Berlin, the son of a
Jew who had fought for the German Army in World War I. When the
Nazis made it impossible for Wollheim to pursue a legal career, he
worked for the embattled Jewish community. After the ravages of
Kristallnacht in November 1938, he helped arrange and escort
transports that took 9,730 Jewish children by train and ferry to
safety in Britain. Although some journeys had the cliffhanger
elements of an espionage novel, the most painful part for Wollheim
was watching children being separated from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew that, for many, it would be the last goodbye,'' he
said 50 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Wollheim had been promised that he would be able to get his
wife, Rosa, out as well. But war replaced the rescue transports
with more lethal ones, and the Wolllheims, who by then had a son,
Uriel, were sent to Auschwitz in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Wollheim, whose arm bore the number 107984, spoke with eloquent
simplicity about what one interviewer called the ``art of
survival.'' He described how he endured by picking lice off his
body, keeping himself clean and doggedly obtaining a razor so that
he could shave and keep up his morale.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no art,'' he said. ``Art is something that has to do
with beauty, with ingenuity. I survived because I had a will to
survive, a will to tell the world what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the need for supporting a family that now
included two children precluded the study of law, but, working as a
bookkeeper, he studied accounting at New York University, was
certified in 1962, and built an accounting career that lasted until
1991. When his second wife, Friedel, died in 1977, he married the
former Charlotte Sprung from Michigan, who today works with
schoolteachers to help them teach about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Peter, of
Boise, Idaho; a daughter, Ruth Wachter of Queens; two stepsons,
Peter, of Brooklyn, and Jeffrey Sprung of Seattle, and a grandson.

L.A. MURDER RATE FALLS BY 30 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PATRICK McGREEVY AND DOUGLAS HABERMAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Murder plunged by 30 percent in Los Angeles in the
first nine months of the year, continuing a trend that has pushed
crime rates to a 30-year low, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a significant reduction overall,'' Los Angeles Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Parks attributed the decline in part to LAPD's FASTRAC
computerized crime analysis system, which has helps the LAPD focus
on problem areas and deploy officers to combat the crimes. The
expansion of the police force by 2,000 officers has also helped, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is continuing efforts to reduce crime, including
plans to expand the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program to
junior high schools and high schools by next February.
</P>
<P>
   Police recorded 146 fewer murders in the city and 28 fewer in
L.A.'s suburban San Fernando Valley so far this year compared to
1997. Overall, 341 murders occurred in the city, compared to 487 in
the same period last year. In the valley, there have been 44
murders, compared to 72 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All violent crimes, including homicide, rape, robbery and
aggravated assaults, are down significantly from last year at this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Police logged about 7,000 fewer violent crimes so far this year
than last in the city and 1,340 fewer in the valley, statistics
show. So far this year there have been 21,000 violent crimes in the
city and 6,008 in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers continue a decade-long trend that has put crime
rates at a 30-year low, police have said.
</P>
<P>
   In its first comprehensive study attempting to explain this
decade's steady decrease in violent crime, the Los Angeles Police
Department concluded in June that the improving economy, the tough
``three strikes, you're out'' sentencing law and the expansion of
the police force all appeared to be factors.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors believed responsible included changing
demographics, the 1994 Northridge Earthquake and a 1994 LAPD
decision to reclassify homicides and aggravated assaults as
repressible crimes, so police officers would be held accountable
for decreasing their rates, the study said.

PHILADELPHIA _ Troy Aikman did not have to do anything heroic in
his return from a five-game hiatus. He just had to keep a broken
left collarbone from being refractured, and he had to avoid making
more mistakes than the Philadelphia Eagles were making.
<TEXT>

   In winning 34-0 at Veterans Stadium on Monday night, Aikman and
the Dallas Cowboys did not commit a turnover, while their lowly
opponents hurt themselves with two interceptions, a lost fumble and
numerous costly penalties.

   Aikman completed 14 of 26 passes for 171 yards and two
touchdowns, while Emmitt Smith rushed for 101 yards and one TD on
23 carries.

<P>
   ``I wasn't as sharp as I would like to have been,'' Aikman said.
``But I thought I saw things pretty well. I took one shot on my
left shoulder late in the first quarter, and it held up pretty
well. You have to be happy with the way things went.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out and dominate the football game, and
that's something this football team hasn't done this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys at midseason are 5-3 (2-1 with Aikman
quarterbacking) and threatening to run away with the NFC East,
while their division foes, the Eagles, dropped to 1-7 in being shut
out for the first time ever by Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey was happy with Aikman's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got off some great throws, and he took some licks,'' Gailey
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Eagles, they have been so inept this year that one
local radio station was calling for the fans to arrive late to
express their displeasure with owner Jeffrey Lurie for maintaining
a below-average player payroll.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever their feelings, the football fans of Philadelphia
couldn't resist the lure of the Cowboys. When the game started, the
stands were virtually full (attendance was 67,002), with people
outside searching for scalpers to sell them tickets.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Eagles came out with the intent to swarm Aikman
and put his healing collarbone to the test. Tackle Hollis Thomas
sacked Aikman on the Cowboys' first play from scrimmage. But Aikman
completed his first pass, to multipurpose star Deion Sanders, for
11 yards and a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Using a variety of formations, including one with five wideouts,
Aikman proceeded to lead his team on a seven-minute, 47-yard drive.
On the Eagles' 34-yard line, he completed a fourth-and-two to
Michael Irvin to extend the drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were stopped at the 16 when fullback Daryl Johnston
met resistance on third-and-one. Richie Cunningham kicked a 33-yard
field goal for the game's first score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought if we could put some points up there early, we
could take the crowd out of it, which is something we haven't done
here before,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the quarterback who would be injured in the
game was not Aikman but Philadelphia's Rodney Peete. On the Eagles'
first possession, a finger on Peete's throwing hand was cut to the
bone, requiring stitches.
</P>
<P>
   With Bobby Hoying replacing Peete, the Eagles on their second
possession botched a handoff. Hoying placed the ball a little high
to the 5-9 Charlie Garner, and it squirted into the air. Kavika
Pittman recovered for the Cowboys on the Philadelphia 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that turnover was the biggest play of the game,''
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   It was big because Aikman quickly capitalized, throwing a
10-yard pass to Irvin, who made an acrobatic over-the-shoulder
catch in the end zone. It was Irvin's first touchdown of the season
and pushed the Cowboys ahead 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``They double-teamed Irvin almost every play tonight,'' Gailey
said. ``But he worked hard to get open.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman said he led Irvin so far that ``I don't think anyone else
could have gotten to that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had a brief offensive threat in the final minute of
the first quarter as Duce Staley, replacing Garner, swept the left
side for a 46-yard gain. It was the longest play from scrimmage by
the Eagles this season.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Omar Stoutmire prevented a touchdown by tackling
Staley by the heel after the runner had broken clear down the left
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd roared its approval of the long gainer, but the
excitement was short-lived. Three plays later, Hoying thew an
interception to Darren Woodson, and the Cowboys took possession on
their 11-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   With their offense stalling, the Cowboys got a lift from Deion
Sanders, who returned a punt 69 yards for a touchdown with two
minutes left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders faked out a couple of Eagles and then dashed up the
middle of the field through an alley created by his teammates. It
was the second time this season Sanders has scored on a punt
return.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 17-0 at halftime, the Cowboys appeared to have the game
secured. But they did not let up. In the third quarter, they drove
80 yards in eight plays to take a 24-0 lead. Aikman finished the
drive with a nine-yard touchdown pass to tight end David LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' defense played better than the score indicated, but
the ineptitude of their offense gave them no chance. Aikman was
pressured often, but he protected himself as well as the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And that was about all the Cowboys needed from him.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
PHILADELPHIA _ The message on the large banner hanging from a
railing at Veterans Stadium was directed at Jeffrey Lurie, the
owner of the flightless Eagles, but it might as well have been
delivered to the entire NFL.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It read: ``We deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season of sinking performance across the board, this one
was lower than a mole doing the limbo.
</P>
<P>
   In a league where kindergarten-style finger painting
increasingly passes for high art, it was hardly even worthy of a
place on the refrigerator door.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys pummeled the Eagles 34-0 Monday night, which on the
surface appeared rather impressive. Until you consider that they
beat up a team that couldn't hit back. Which is becoming the norm
these days in Paul Tagliabue's little kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some football?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, quite frankly.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday nights, only Ally McBeal over on Fox looks to be
more malnourished than these gaunt affairs that keep turning up to
haunt Al, Dan and Boomer on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles surrendered two interceptions, a fumbled snap and a
69-yard punt return to the indomitable Deion Sanders and spent the
rest of the night going backward with penalties and an offense that
gives ineptitude a very bad name.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of cohesion, continuity or any kind of coherent plan made
the Eagles look like every other team the Cowboys have beaten in
the NFC East. And come to think of it, the NFC East is not really
much different than the rest of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Face it: There are the Denver Broncos and everybody else in a
season that will be fortunate not to atrophy before Christmas. Or
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   What do the Cowboys really know about themselves with a 5-3
record at the midway point in the season? That they can take care
of themselves in a fight against a collection of tomato cans. Of
which the NFL seems to have more than a Campbell's Soup factory.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys accomplished their primary goal, which was to get
out of the game without significant injury.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman returned to the lineup for the first time since Week
2, when he suffered a broken collarbone against the Broncos, and
did prove he could withstand a hit.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's first play, linebacker James Darling charged
through from the left side of the Eagles' defense and slammed
Aikman to the hard AstroTurf for an eight-yard loss. Aikman bounced
right back up and went on to complete 14 of 26 passes for 171 yards
and a pair of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith carried 23 times for 101 yards, his fourth time
over the century mark this season and the ninth time he has done it
against Philly.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin caught his first touchdown pass of the season on a
perfectly thrown 10-yard strike from Aikman in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was Deion. He settled under Tommy Hutton's
punt at his 31, took a couple of steps forward, let defenders sail
past, then juked and swiveled and cut and ran to the right, leaving
would-be tacklers grasping at air, and eventually high-stepped and
mugged for the TV cameras going into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness for Deion _ a jolt of electricity in a lifeless
evening who also had an interception. By halftime, numerous fights
had broken out in the stands, probably among fans trying to keep
each other awake. By the start of the fourth quarter, The Vet was
more than half empty, and by the eight-minute mark, the only people
left in the upper deck were the drunks who couldn't find the exits.
</P>
<P>
   In a setting that used to vibrate with one of the NFL's great
rivalries, you couldn't even hear the echoes of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Where do the Cowboys go from here? Maybe just home to celebrate
what is an unofficial clinching of their division title. They are
3-0 on the road against NFC East rivals; who can catch them? The
Cardinals are a game back at 4-4 but hardly seem capable. The
Giants are 3-5 and seem lost. The Eagles and Redskins are 1-7 and
hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   There are tests down the road against Minnesota and at Kansas
City, but not much else for the Cowboys to do except try to avoid
getting hurt before the playoffs. Which just might provide a
football fan with something of interest, if anybody other than the
Broncos learns to play this game by then.
</P>
<P>
   You can look on the bright side if you're businessman Bob
McNair, trying to bring the NFL back to Houston. Those inflated
franchise prices have to be dropping with this kind of lowly
product all that is on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, is this something Houston needs like bigger
mosquitoes and more humidity?
</P>
<P>
   Like the banner said: ``We deserve better.''

COWBOYS FEAST ON ROADKILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Cowboys were both innocent bystanders and
benefactors. Just wait, watch and try not to giggle _ that was
Dallas' best game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Think of every way possible to screw up the game of football.
Keep thinking. Be creative. Only then, when your disaster list is
overflowing, can the performance of the Eagles last night even
start to be gauged.
</P>
<P>
   How good were the Cowboys? Good enough for an easy W, but beyond
that, this was a nationally televised game low-lighted and even
dominated by the ineptness of a totally confused and overmatched
foe.
</P>
<P>
   A final score of 34-0 has to be taken for what it's worth. The
Cowboys still aren't exactly Super Bowl contenders, but when it
comes to the NFC East, they are kicking some butt. Dallas went to
4-0 in the division, and in those four games have outscored
divisional brothers, 134-27.
</P>
<P>
   Here at The Vet, misfortune has repeatedly gang-tackled the
Cowboys over the years, but this one was a total reversal. The only
negative was an early struggle by the offense as the return of Troy
Aikman to the lineup didn't pay immediate first-half dividends. In
time, however, everything would go nicely, thanks to the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 67,002 Cowboy-haters who normally rock The Vet were a
subdued and peaceful bunch. And that was before the game even
started.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the fans came expecting the worst from a 1-6 team that
was about to go 1-7. Banners were hung with such dire messages as
``We Deserve Better;'' ``Help Wanted: A Better Coach;'' ``1-7 is
Unacceptable;'' ``Please Give Us Something to Cheer About.'' Former
quarterback Randall Cunningham, now with the Vikings, was once
booed out of Philly. But all is apparently forgiven. One banner
said, ``Randall Come Home.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of booing was heard throughout the evening, but this time
it wasn't aimed at the Cowboys. By midway through the third
quarter, half the crowd had departed. By the start of the fourth
quarter, only the homeless remained. Never have the Cowboys seen
The Vet so docile. But when have the Eagles been this bad?
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Cowboys obviously feasted. Not that it probably
made any difference, but Philly did lose starting quarterback
Rodney Peete in the first quarter, and if nothing else, Peete is
superior in savvy to his backup, Bobby Hoying, who had no clue or
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles had but one legitimate scoring chance, and that was
in the first half after Darren Woodson was called for pass
interference. The threat ended on the next play with a Woodson
interception.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise, the Eagles offered stout defensive resistance in
the first half, shutting down the Dallas running game while also
causing Aikman problems. A 17-0 halftime lead looked bigger than it
actually was because the Rev. Deion got loose again on a punt
return, whistling through the Eagles for 69 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Once the second half started, however, Aikman was throwing,
Emmitt was running, and all that was remained was to count the
penalty flags _ both teams were on a world-record pace for yellow
hankies.
</P>
<P>
   On any of its special teams, Philly faced a flag parade. They
ended up with 11 penalties for 110 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But come tomorrow, Chan Gailey will be harping on the 10 flags
for 130 yards that hit the Cowboys. In this area, Dallas played
down to the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys needed most, however, they received. That meant
a win without a major injury, plus Aikman getting back in gear. In
addition, more NFC East types are coming right up.
</P>
<P>
   There are the Giants on Sunday at Texas Stadium, then the
Arizona Cardinals the next week on the road. All other East teams
have at least two losses within the division.
</P>
<P>
   But it's easy to look ahead when you've just played the Eagles.
No team in any division is this bad.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a great rivalry, and what was once a dreaded road
trip, became a laugher here last night. And this time it was the
Cowboys doing the laughing.

TROY BADDEST IN LAND OF BAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It was not, everyone had agreed, the ideal
setting for the resurrection of Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   Tough room.
</P>
<P>
   Tough crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Tough luck.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Vet, where they spray-painted a 100-yard stretch of
concrete green, then cackled and put hash marks on it; a devil's
den where even Santa Claus has been known to get sacked; where
snowballs come packed around D-sized batteries and opposing players
and coaches _ remember Jimmy Johnson? _ are regularly christened
with the finest barley and hops as they exit the field.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime last night, the surly Philadelphians even jeered the
poor Frisbee-catching dog when it fumbled the disk.
</P>
<P>
   We forgot one important factor, however, as we fussed and
fretted over Aikman's fragile health: the hapless Eagles, who
arrived at the party disguised as an accident the pooch left on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Trick or treat.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman didn't just survive, he thrived as seven weeks of rust
flaked off, speck by speck, and when all but the last meager shreds
of what began as a crowd of 67,002 had headed for the exits and
Dallas' 34-0 rout was in the books, Cowboys' fans could take a deep
breath and relax.
</P>
<P>
   He's back and he's still bad.
</P>
<P>
   As in good.
</P>
<P>
   Really good.
</P>
<P>
   This, the Eagles had babbled all week, would be their chance to
turn a 1-6 season around and start over. This had been the scene of
some of Aikman's most ignominious moments, including being knocked
out with a concussion last season.
</P>
<P>
   No team has tormented Aikman like the Eagles, who came into the
game with more sacks (42) of the Cowboys' quarterback and more
interceptions (15) off him than any other defense in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And when Eagles defensive tackle Hollis Thomas sacked Aikman on
the first play, the already well-oiled Veterans Stadium fans howled
like wolves at a full moon.
</P>
<P>
   One problem.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman got up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took one hit early,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said, ``and
I think it was good for him and us to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   This, you see, was like starting over for Aikman, too, a second
season, if you will, after the first one lasted less than a game
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   And if it wasn't perfect _ and no, it wasn't _ there were
certainly no serious complaints. The runaway allowed Aikman, who
threw two touchdown passes, to watch third-teamer Mike Quinn
quarterback the team for most of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Aikman totals were modestly impressive considering the long
layoff: 14-of-26, 171 yards, two TDs.
</P>
<P>
   He came back after the first-play sack to complete his first
pass in almost two months, an 11-yarder to Deion Sanders for a
first down. He was 3-of-4 passing in leading the Cowboys on a
game-opening, 14-play drive that eventually bogged down at the
Philadelphia 16, where Richie Cunningham salvaged a 33-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, he had taken his first hits from the aroused Philly
defense and bounced back up, growling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' Aikman allowed, ``good to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Aikman had even shown he might have wised up a
little. He opted for a clever quarterback slide when it was clearly
the smart thing to do, rather than try to macho it for another yard
or two.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's game plan didn't ask Aikman to be too bold _ his
longest completion in the first half went for only 11 yards _ but
by the third quarter there was no holding back.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' opening drive of the second half was classic
Aikman. He marched the team 80 yards in eight plays, completing
four of five passes along the way, including a 44-yarder to Billy
Davis. He capped it with a perfectly thrown 9-yard touchdown pass
to tight end David LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   His two TD passes, including a 10-yarder to Michael Irvin at the
end of the first quarter, were his best throws of the night.
</P>
<P>
   He found Irvin on a crossing pattern in the end zone and put
just enough zip on the ball to lift it over cornerback Bobby
Taylor. And Aikman's 9-yarder to LaFleur was placed where the big
tight end could just barely stretch out and pull it in, yet gave
the Eagles no chance to defend against it.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if all this sounds all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   He's back.
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some football?

JOKINEN SET TO TAKE STUMPEL'S PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In an ideal world, the Los Angeles Kings'
top prospect, Olli Jokinen, would be allowed to develop naturally
in the team's farm system, with exposure to the NHL coming only
when he was fully prepared for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in an ideal world,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor
said Monday afternoon, ``we'd be 11-0 and have no injuries. We
don't live in an ideal world.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, with the Kings (4-5-2) in an offensive drought, Taylor
promoted the 19-year-old Jokinen from the team's AHL affiliate in
Springfield. Jokinen is scheduled to practice today with the Kings,
whose next game is Thursday night at the Forum against the St.
Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have been shut out in three of their last four games,
including twice in a row over the weekend. They haven't scored a
goal in the last 126 minutes, 12 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Not blessed with great offensive depth to begin with, the Kings'
attack has been badly diminished by the absence of No. 1 center
Jozef Stumpel, who was scoreless in four games before heading to
the sidelines with a hip-flexor strain and a possible abdominal
strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a little boost offensively,'' Taylor said.
``(Jokinen) is as good a playmaker as we have on the team,
especially with Stumpel out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen, the third player chosen in the 1997 NHL draft, had
three goals and nine points in nine games at Springfield. The
6-foot-3, 208-pound Finnish native was pointless in eight games
with the Kings a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor will spend today in New York at a meeting of the league's
general managers. Asked if he might be close to trading for an
established NHL scorer, Taylor said, ``There'll be some
discussions. I wouldn't say we're close. We're always looking. It
takes a while to build a club. We don't want to fill one hole and
create another one. We have to show some patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he does not plan to recall a defenseman immediately
to replace Doug Bodger, who broke his left hand during the warmups
before Sunday's game.

HARRY WEESE, 83, DESIGNED WASHINGTON'S METRO SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Ill., Ind., N.M., Calif.)  
(mk) 
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Weese, a Chicago architect whose design for the Washington
Metro system produced some of the most powerful public spaces of
our time, died on Thursday at a veterans' home in Manteno, Ill. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   A major figure in Chicago architecture and planning since the
1950s, Weese specialized in historic preservation as well as new
buildings in the modern idiom. In 1967, he undertook the renovation
of Adler and Sullivan's Auditorium Theater in Chicago, one of the
country's most architecturally distinguished performance halls. He
also supervised the restoration of the Field Museum of Natural
History and Orchestra Hall in Chicago and Union Station in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, his modern buildings include the Time and Life
Building, a concrete tower with a skin of glass and dark steel, and
the Metropolitan Corrections Center, an imposing, triangular
structure of concrete patterned with irregularly spaced slit
windows. He also championed the redesign of large areas of the
city's lakefront shoreline, proposing the development of
recreational areas on artificial islands.
</P>
<P>
   But Weese's most spectacular project came his way in 1967, when
his firm, Harry Weese Associates, was awarded the contract to
design Washington's 100-mile Metro system. Given the opportunity to
work as an equal partner with the project's engineers, Weese
designed a systemwide network of stations that rank among the
greatest public works of this century.
</P>
<P>
   With their soaring vaults of coffered concrete, unencumbered by
columns, these stations recall the visionary designs of Piranesi.
At stations where two subway stations intersect, Weese created
narthexlike spaces that induce an almost religious sense of awe.
That may be one reason why the stations have remained free from
graffiti since the system's opening in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Rippling lights, embedded in the subway platforms, do more than
announce incoming trains. They also provide underground delight. At
the tubelike entrances to some of the stations, like Dupont Circle,
escalators offer commuters a giddy descent into a spatial vortex.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Mahr Weese was born in Evanston, Ill., in 1915. He was
educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
graduated in 1938 with a bachelor's degree in architecture. Later,
he studied city planning under Eliel Saarinen at the Cranbrook
Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., with a group of students
that included Charles and Ray Eames, Harry Bertoia, Florence Knoll
and Benjamin Baldwin. He and Baldwin opened an architectural firm
in 1941, but their practice was interrupted by World War II. Weese
enlisted in the Navy and served as an engineering officer until
1945.
</P>
<P>
   He reopened his own practice in 1947, after a year in the
Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill. In 1950, an
introduction to Irwin Miller, owner of Cummins Engine Co., led to
commissions for Columbus, Ind., the town Miller was developing as a
showcase for postwar American architecture. Weese's design for the
First Baptist Church, a structure of brick and slate completed in
1965, remains the town's most prominent landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro system is not Weese's only important achievement in
the nation's capital. In 1962, he designed the Arena Stage theater,
a work that pioneered the use of lighting equipment, catwalks and
other functional elements as esthetically expressive features.
Weese also deserves credit for the realization of Maya Lin's
stunning Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the Washington Mall. In 1981,
while serving as a juror for the competition to design the
memorial, Weese helped select Ms. Lin's proposal from among 1,420
entries, and helped the design survive the considerable opposition
it aroused.
</P>
<P>
   Weese is survived by his wife, Kate; three daughters, Shirley
Weese Young of Chicago, Marcia Weese of Santa Fe, N.M., and Kate
Weese of Kensington, Calif., and five grandchildren.

SANDERS GIVES COWBOYS LIFT AT RIGHT TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Greeted by a chorus of boos upon entering
Veterans Stadium last night, Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders had a
little fun with equally hated Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew you had to be around,'' Sanders joked. ``They only boo
me or you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' fans found out what the rest of the league is coming
to know more and more each week. Though he may be distancing
himself from his ``Prime Time'' nickname, Sanders loves to be the
center of attention _ especially under the bright lights of Monday
Night Football.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders returned a punt 69 yards for a touchdown in the second
quarter to spark the Cowboys to a 34-0 blowout victory against the
sinking Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' heroics helped take the pressure off quarterback Troy
Aikman, who returned to action for the first time since fracturing
his collarbone on Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, downplaying his own efforts, said it was important to
have Aikman back after a five-game hiatus. Though Aikman was rusty
early, he completed 14 of 26 passes for 171 yards and two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great quarterback,'' Sanders said. ``We were fortunate
to have him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Cowboys (5-3) one game ahead of
second-place Arizona (4-4) in the NFC East, while the Eagles
dropped to 1-7.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman passed the physical test. Questions about his fractured
collarbone were answered on the game's first play when he was
sacked by Eagles tackle Hollis Thomas. However, he quickly bounced
back and continued to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was good for him and good for us to see that,''
said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, who also complimented the defense
for getting its first shutout since blanking the Giants, 27-0, on
Sept. 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who was hit four times in the game and sacked once, said
the shoulder held up fine and credited the offense line for great
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys up front did a nice job,'' Aikman said. ``I know what
this game is about, and you are going to get hit. The shoulder did
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided score, which can largely be attributed to a
dominant performance by the Cowboys' defense and the ineptitude of
the woeful Eagles, belied the struggles of the Cowboys' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the layoff on Aikman and his cohesiveness with
the Cowboys' offense were evident early. Aikman was only 7-of-13
for 57 yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out and play with some consistency,'' Aikman
said. ``That's the thing this football team has not done.''
</P>
<P>
   They led 17-0 at intermission but amassed only one real drive,
which covered 47 yards and resulted in a 33-yard field goal by
Richie Cunningham in the first quarter. The Cowboys also turned an
Eagles fumble into a 10-yard touchdown pass from Aikman to Michael
Irvin, who ended a nine-game drought without a touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a 10-0 advantage, the Cowboys could not distance
themselves from the bumbling Eagles _ that is, until Sanders' punt
return with one minute, 49 seconds left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   What was most amazing is that the Eagles actually punted the
ball to Sanders. Eagles coach Ray Rhodes said before the game that
they would not give Sanders a chance to break the game open.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Tommy Hutton swayed from the strategy with a wobbly
37-yard effort down the middle of the field. Sanders put a
now-you-see-me, now-you-don't move on Eagles cover men Kevin Turner
and Corey Walker and then cut toward the right sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Hutton grabbed at his jersey at the 10-yard line, but Sanders
already had the ball stretched out and was in the midst of his
high-stepping strut.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who lost starting quarterback Rodney Peete in the
first quarter, had no chance of catching the Cowboys in the second
half with the inexperienced Bobby Hoying at the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying was 13-of-39 for 124 yards and was sacked three times. He
had two passes intercepted, by Sanders and strong safety Darren
Woodson. The Cowboys' defense held the Eagles to 200 yards total
offense and 96 yards rushing.

DIFFERENT PATHS LEAD SMITH, RICE TO THE QB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A picture hangs on a wall at Auburn University. An example for
all defensive linemen who are tempted to nap through meetings. A
simple photograph of Mark Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``First thing Monday, our nose guard walks in and wants to know
if I caught the highlights of Mark on ESPN,'' said Pete Jenkins,
defensive line coach at Auburn. ``We're all just so proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Proud enough that they still invoke his name as a motivational
chant during workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know he came back here last off-season?'' Jenkins said.
``At 6 a.m. every morning, he was out there with us, doing
individual drills. You like to see people like that succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Illinois, you don't have to look hard to
find pictures of Simeon Rice. Just last week, he visited his alma
mater. And when he dropped by the football offices, they couldn't
help but marvel at his journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knew where he was going to play as a freshman,'' said
sports information director Dave Johnson. ``There was speculation
that he might be a tight end or a fullback. They stuck him at
defensive end, and he just ran over everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice's visit wasn't for celebration. He was attending a funeral
for Kevin Moore, a close friend who was tragically shot at a
fraternity party. He's the second friend Rice has lost due to
senseless violence in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Two men. One from the deep South, one from the big city. One who
was plucked from the seventh round in the 1997 draft, one the third
man chosen a year earlier. But together, Smith and Rice may have
saved the Cardinals' season from slipping into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Together they anchored what many are calling the Cardinals' most
courageous defensive effort in decades, one that somehow occurred
with Eric Swann on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's monster line: 10 tackles, eight solo, three for losses;
one sack; one forced fumble; and two quarterback hurries. He did
not get credit for beating the quarterback to a handoff, throttling
an attempted two-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's afternoon included six quarterback hurries, four
pressures and two sacks. And in his best Lawrence Taylor
impersonation, he forced a fumble and recovered on the same play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Smith was just a guy possessed,'' Cardinals defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis said. ``And Simeon was just a demon out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the aesthetics of a 17-15 victory in Detroit. Forget for
a moment that the Cardinals haven't beaten anyone worthy of turf
toe. Forget that the offense is still a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   A victory on the road never requires style points. And as the
offense continues to burp and crawl, it meant something for the
defense to play that well under duress, without Swann, when nothing
else was working.
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, there is vindication. With a nagging knee injury, he
should have redshirted his senior year in college. Except Auburn
had no one to replace him and Smith played, even though he didn't
practice all season. On draft day, he paid for that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I came in this league, I've been out to prove
something,'' said Smith, who entered the NFL as one big medical
risk. ``I should've been a top draft choice. I wasn't. Now, I have
to work my way up.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rice, there is growing confirmation that he isn't a
one-season wonder. On Sunday, Rice was the one who put the defense
on his shoulders, the one who showed the leadership. By now, you
should know he is no fluke and no flake.
</P>
<P>
   It was only fitting that Smith and Rice effectively ended the
football game. Smith, by sacking and forcing Frank Reich to fumble
after the Lions started their final drive with a 21-yard gain.
Rice, by simultaneously throwing two linemen to the ground in
pursuit of the loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simeon's well runs deeper than people think,'' McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the defense and two men who rose above everyone else,
so might the Cardinals' season. &QL;

MCKINNON DRAWS RAVES FOR EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Detroit had the ball on first down at the Arizona 48-yard line
with 3:49 left in the first quarter when quarterback Charlie Batch
dropped to pass.
</P>
<P>
   What Cardinals fans probably remember is that Simeon Rice not
only stripped the ball from Batch, but also recovered it, drawing
much praise after the Cardinals' 17-15 win Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't know is that alert play by middle linebacker Ron
McKinnon was the key to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that play, Ronnie turned around and sprinted backward 17
yards under the receiver, which caused the quarterback to pull the
ball down and allowed Simeon to get to him,'' Cardinals defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Such plays by McKinnon are among the reasons why the Cardinals'
defense is rounding into one of the NFL's top units, and why it
hasn't missed a beat since the free-agent departure of middle
linebacker Eric Hill last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Try these statistics on for size:
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals own the NFL lead in takeaways with 25. McKinnon
has played a direct role in 40 percent of them, with five
interceptions, three forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   His five interceptions tie him for the NFL lead with safeties Ty
Law of New England and Robert Griffith of Minnesota. No other NFL
linebacker has more that two.
</P>
<P>
   In just half a season, he's become the first Cardinals
linebacker to have five interceptions in a season since E.J. Junior
in 1985 and Leo Sanford in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an undersized (5 feet 10, 240 pounds) former walk-on
at Division II Northern Alabama, and an undrafted free agent who
has been thrust into the role of replacing the much bigger Hill, a
three-time Pro Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Testimonials? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis: ``I've never had a middle linebacker who can play the
pass as well. (Mike) Singletary was a great man-to-man pass
defender, but Ronnie is a better zone defender than any linebacker
I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin: ``The thing he has more than any linebacker
I've been around _ and I've been around some great ones _ is an
awareness on pass defense. He has a tremendous awareness of where
the football is going and gets to the right area, reading the route
and the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interception he had against Detroit was one of the best
I've ever seen from linebacker. He dropped in his area about eight
yards in front of Herman Moore, who was open, and made a tremendous
play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all in the preparation, teammate Jamir Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron is beginning to understand the game at this level,''
Miller said. ``He knows you have to study and spend extra time
watching film of opponents. Because he does, he knows teams like to
attack the middle, and he knows where they're going to attack and
he gets there.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon, who now has eight interceptions in two years, acquired
his study habits from Hill, whom he calls his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching film plays a big part, even if you have to do it on
your day off,'' he said. ``The more you watch, the more you know
what's going on. Some of it is instinct, but you also have a good
idea where the ball is going because of down and distance and who
has been getting it the most. Sometimes you look away, then come
back in that direction real hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I'm leading the league or played a part in
that many takeaways. I just try to get around the ball and create
something; do something to help us score and win. I'm playing
pretty well, but not my best, yet. I haven't really turned it loose
yet.'' &QL;

ASU ATTRACTS TOP FOOTBALL RE CRUITS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-RECRUIT-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 and RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona State's on-field struggles have not deterred some of the
state's top recruits from committing to the football program.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most coveted, Superior High School safety Brandon
Tomerlin and Shadow Mountain wide receiver Shaun McDonald, said
Monday they have given oral commitments. They join Shadow Mountain
running back Josh Amobi, who also told ASU he will play there in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't concern me at all,'' McDonald said of the Sun
Devils' 4-4 start. ``I like the direction of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald is the brother of ASU wide receiver Tariq McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun McDonald fractured his fibula against St. Mary's two weeks
ago but said he expects to return if Shadow Mountain advances to
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils also are in the running for Cottonwood Mingus
offensive lineman Nick Johnson and Superior defensive end and tight
end Tony Aguilar, who are widely regarded as the top two recruits
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8, 315-pound Johnson has scheduled four recruiting
trips, including Arizona State on Dec. 11, said his mother, Pamela.
He will also visit Ohio State on Nov. 21, Arizona on Nov. 28 and
Washington on Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of talent in the state is higher than it has been in
years and has attracted many of top programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a secret,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``You see
Michigan, Notre Dame, Nebraska, Texas, Colorado, all the Pac-10
schools. I think we're doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent is as good as it has been in the last three, four
years at least, and maybe longer. My sense is there are more
skill-position athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Superior's Aguilar, who is 6-5, 295 pounds, said he isn't
bothered by ASU's slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about that stuff,'' Aguilar said. ``When I go on
my visit, I just see how it feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomerlin, who is best friends with Aguilar, said they don't
discuss colleges, but he added, ``Personally, I think he'll go to
ASU. That's my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomerlin recently moved from quarterback to tailback. Last week
against Winkelman Hayden, he suffered a hip pointer. He said he'll
be ready for Friday's first-round 2A playoff game at home against
Gila Bend.
</P>
<P>
   As a safety, he has eight interceptions this season, giving him
a state record 31 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   He said some Division I schools, including Colorado, recruited
him as a quarterback, but that he'll likely play in ASU's
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the ideal place for me,'' he said. ''They're
recruiting me as an athlete. They didn't really say anything about
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're struggling for defensive backs, and I think I may have
a legitimate shot at seeing playing time in the future there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Johnson described the recruiting experience as
``interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a joy in the naivete when you begin,'' she said. ``But
after a while, it becomes pretty serious business. The people we
have dealt with have been exemplary, but this is a huge life
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who is also a standout soccer player, said he looks
forward to playing with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be fun,'' he said. ``I just really like the offense,
the coaches there.'' &QL;

HISTORY SHOWS FANS UNLIKELY TO FORGIVE SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NFL failed to learn a lesson from its mistakes of 1982 and
played the 1987 season with replacement players because of a labor
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL failed to benefit from the mistakes made in football,
losing more than a third of the 1994 season because of a lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball didn't get it either in 1994 and committed
the unpardonable sin of canceling a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when the regular season was scheduled to begin, the NBA
officially joins the list of labor losers.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan won't be soaring toward a seventh title in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   John Stockton will make no one-handed passes on the run to Karl
Malone in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Riley's Armani suits will remain in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal won't be ruining rims at the Great Western
Forum, either with thunderous dunks or paint-chipping bricks from
the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody knows whether Scottie Pippen ever will wear a Suns
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA also has failed to learn from the past mistakes of rival
professional leagues, and at least the first month of the season is
lost because of a labor impasse that has entered its fifth month.
</P>
<P>
   As in every one of these labor disputes, the fans of the sport
are forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association reports a
``noticeable decline'' in retail orders for NBA-licensed products
such as clothing and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a slow process to bring the fans back to
basketball,'' said Diamondbacks pitcher Gregg Olson, who was in the
Atlanta Braves organization in 1994 when baseball lost the Series.
``You don't know how long this (lockout) is going to go, but you
can tell people are getting frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be some damage done. You can't compare it to
what happened in baseball yet, but the longer it goes, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tocchet of the Coyotes saw the damage the NHL lockout did
in 1994 when his sport was beginning to draw new fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were making huge inroads when they locked us out,'' Tocchet
said. ``And it did kind of put us in reverse. Hockey was going
great. We had just put teams in California and Florida, but the
lockout stagnated us a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the person like the NBA fan who is sitting on the fence
and didn't know much about hockey, we couldn't grab those people
for at least another year or two. That really hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   George Young, vice president of football operations for the NFL
and former general manager of the New York Giants, believes his
sport has learned a lesson from work stoppages in 1982 and 1987,
when replacement players were used.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1990s, we've had the good fortune of not facing a
lockout or strike,'' Young said. ``Both sides realized it's in the
best interest of each to have labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn from the past. You learn that you don't want to
alienate the fans. Owners are conscious of that, and so are the
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably no labor impasse has created more ill will with fans
than the baseball strike of 1994 that wiped out the World Series.
It took four years and the greatest home run derby in the game's
history to put baseball back in the good graces of its fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Series had been played through wars, through
earthquakes, and for it not to be played under those circumstances
_ in terms of how the fans saw it, when it was within the control
of the people in control of the game itself _ it was a very
damaging thing,'' said Joe Garagiola Jr., general manager of the
Diamondbacks who was a player agent at the time of that strike.
</P>
<P>
   While some have contended that other sports, hockey in
particular, will benefit from the NBA's problems, Garagiola
disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have one of these situations, in a way, it's
harmful to all sports,'' he said. ``It's such a negative for the
fans, and you don't ever want to have a situation where that
negative feeling is translated across the board. People start to
say, `I'm fed up with all of these guys.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who says that if the NBA doesn't play, that's a good
thing for hockey, the NFL or baseball, they're misinformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans, however, have a hard time understanding why short
millionaires can't reach agreement with tall millionaires about how
to split up $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still laugh at Bill Clinton's line about the last baseball
strike,'' said Bobby Smith, general manager of the Coyotes. ``He
said, `It's just a few hundred folks fighting over a few billion
dollars.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The public sees it that way. There ought to be a common ground
if players and owners understand the economics and have the good of
the sport in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   When the NHL lopped off 36 games because of the 1994 lockout,
Smith had just retired and was in the same boat as a lot of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a typical fan, of course,'' he said. ``I'm very
passionate about hockey. I really missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the basketball lockout ends, Olson said NBA players will
have to try to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did little things, like signing autographs before games,
trying to get out and meet the fans,'' Olson said. ``But the people
that we were signing for were the people already at the games. The
hard part is finding ways to bring back the people who are staying
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, perhaps as a pre-emptive strike, is giving season
ticket holders their money back for lost games _ plus 6 percent
interest. Even without that 6 percent, history says jilted fans
will come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many elements to sports, the games themselves,
that transcend these things,'' Garagiola said. ``They're setbacks,
but somehow, some way, along comes Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa and
that helps the healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Tocchet, himself an an avid follower of the NBA, said
it's tough to be a pro basketball fan right now. He believes the
NBA may lose fans just as hockey did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think so,'' he said. ``I think the fans are soured on
the NBA situation. I know I am, and I love the NBA. For some
reason, I've lost interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he empathizes with NBA players and owners, but both
sides in any sports labor dispute could benefit by remembering how
good they have it in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always talk about survival,'' he said. ``There are some
people in the NFL who remember when things weren't so good. I
remember Mr. (Art) Rooney (late Pittsburgh owner) used to say that
his biggest thrill wasn't winning on Sunday, it was making payroll
on Monday.'' &QL;

MONDAYS MADE MORE EXCITING  WITH BOWL POLL  
</HEADLINE>
 POLL-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the quest to crown a true national collegiate football
champion, words and phrases such as ``quartile'' and ``adjusted
deviation'' have been introduced to the sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the folks who gave us the complicated Bowl
Championship Series formula again crunched numbers into dust and
ranked the top teams in the land.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what? Their top 11 matches the top 11 in the
Associated Press poll, which is determined by writers, most of whom
think an adjusted deviation is what you do to a broken nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a great deal of respect for sportswriters,''
Fiesta Bowl Executive Director John Junker said slyly.
</P>
<P>
   Like the AP and coaches polls, the BCS standings, which are only
two weeks old, have proved they can change dramatically each week,
even if the top teams don't lose.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, the top-ranked team in the first standings last week,
dropped to third because of its lackluster 28-24 victory over
Stanford last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State, No. 1 in both the AP and coaches polls, moved from
second to first in the BCS standings, and Tennessee, third last
week, moved up one spot. Kansas State was fourth and Florida moved
from sixth to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Behind its victory over Oregon, Arizona jumped from 14th to 10th
in the BCS standings.
</P>
<P>
   The top two teams in the final BCS poll play in the Tostitos
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it (the BCS poll) creates a higher level of intrigue
nationally,'' Junker said. ``Mondays still aren't as big as
Saturdays, but they are pretty big, aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   They will only get bigger. The formula consists of four
components: record, strength of schedule, average ranking in the AP
and coaches polls and the average of three computer rankings. As
teams beat ranked opponents, and as their opponents win, their
potential to move up in the standings increases.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, for instance, stayed in fourth place but is more
than two points closer to second place than it was last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats could have as many as three games remaining against
ranked opponents (Missouri, Nebraska and the Big 12 title game).
Victories in those games could move them into contention for a
Fiesta Bowl berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting more competitive,'' Junker said. ``And when you
look down the road, with certain teams with certain schedule
improvements and big wins possible, it can become extremely
dramatic.'' &QL;

KHABIBULIN EASILY PASSES EARLY TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So far, things couldn't be much better for the Coyotes. They've
won three straight games and are undefeated in their past four.
</P>
<P>
   They've allowed only 14 goals, the fewest in the NHL. Their star
players, notably goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, are producing. And
their youngsters are beginning to turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   The league is beginning to take notice. But the real test will
come Friday, when the two-time defending Stanley Cup champion
Detroit Red Wings skate into town for a nationally televised game
at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Since their 3-0 win in Los Angeles on Sunday, the Coyotes will
have had five days to prepare. Coach Jim Schoenfeld doesn't want to
analyze too much and overload on his game planning with so much
free time.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, he doesn't have to spend any of that time
worrying about his starting goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's been doing the job, but especially Niki,''
Schoenfeld said. ``He's really accepted the challenge of being a
consistent, upper-echelon netminder. It's early in the season, but
there's a lot of things we can like so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin is hotter than a $2 pistol. In seven starts, he's
turned away 186 out of 199 total shots and hasn't allowed more than
two goals since the Coyotes' 4-1 loss to Ottawa in the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I played pretty good in that game, too,'' Khabibulin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he did. The rest of the team admittedly failed
miserably in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   But things changed in a hurry, and after Sunday's victory, the
Coyotes found themselves just one point behind Detroit for second
place overall in the Western Conference. They trail first-place
Dallas by only three.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, already the most successful Russian-born goalie in
NHL history, seemed to be facing a crossroads in his young career
after suffering through extended slumps last season. Talk of him
perhaps someday joining the league's goalie elite, such as Dominik
Hasek, Martin Brodeur and Patrick Roy appeared premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Coyotes defenseman Keith Carney said.
``When you mention those guys, you think about Stanley Cups.
They've been there or gotten really close. That's the next step for
Niki. He keeps getting 30-win seasons, but once he gets a sniff at
the Cup, he'll be mentioned along with those guys, I have no doubts
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin said the Coyotes' crazy schedule, in which they play
just twice in nine days after opening the season with three home
games in nine days, has been to his benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in great shape and I haven't played many games, so I feel
fresh every time out,'' he said. ``My focus and my concentration
have been real good because of that. Overall, I'd say it's been
pretty good for our whole team, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the number of times Phoenix defensemen and
forwards alike have dropped to their knees or dived to the ice on
their stomachs to block shots with their bodies. Sunday night, the
team blocked 23 of them. Teppo Numminen was credited with eight
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that,'' Khabibulin said. ``That's a goalie's best
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we've been asking the guys to do more of, to
pay that physical price,'' Schoenfeld said. ``It's not always a fun
part of the game, but sometimes it's a necessary part. Like (Sunday
against the Kings), when you've got guys like (Rob) Blake and
(Steve) Duchesne back there who can send off rockets, if you're not
willing to go down and sacrifice the body, then there's going to be
a lot of opportunities against your goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   It figures to be a turkey shoot against the well-armed Red
Wings, who regularly roll out four lines that can hurt their
opponent. But Khabibulin usually plays at his best against Detroit,
which is another thing the Coyotes have going for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'll be ready,'' Khabibulin said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The stage is set. &QL;

IT APPEARS AIKMAN CAN SHOULDER THE LOAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Cowboys again might be able to lean on the
shoulders of their quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   That became apparent when Eagles defensive lineman Hollis Thomas
leaned on Troy Aikman's left shoulder and drove it into Veterans
Stadium's artificial surface.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's pass fell incomplete, but Thomas' first-quarter hit
demonstrated that the quarterback's left shoulder appears almost
completely healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took one early,'' said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey. ``I think
it was good for him and us to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' said Aikman, who completed 14 of 26 pass
attempts for 171 yards and two touchdowns during last night's 34-0
victory against the Eagles. ``I took one hit in the shoulder, but
it held up pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman suffered a fracture to his left clavicle during the
Cowboys' 42-23 defeat to the Denver Broncos on Sept. 13 at Mile
High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' defense hit Aikman four times during the evening,
including an 8-yard sack by Thomas on the game's first play from
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman never flinched.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback responded with an 11-yard completion to Deion
Sanders on third-and-10 from the Cowboys' 37-yard line on the
game's third play from scrimmage. That completion sustained a
47-yard, 14-play drive that resulted in a 33-yard field goal by
kicker Richie Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great quarterback and we were fortunate to have him in
there tonight,'' said Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman did show caution, most noticeably during a third-quarter
sack by cornerback Troy Vincent. Aikman attempted to scramble on a
third-and-21 play from the Cowboys' 25-yard line, but a nifty slide
prevented Vincent from delivering a clean hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be smart about it,'' said Aikman. ``I didn't
want to take any unneccesary shots to the shoulder.''

DEFENSE GIVES CAMPO REASON TO SMILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Three hours before last night's game against the
Philadelphia Eagles, Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Campo wore
an uneasy smile as he posed for pictures with a well-wisher at the
team hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time Campo would be uncomfortable all night.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the hard-charging Leon Lett, and the playmaking abilities
of Deion Sanders and Darren Woodson, Campo's defense shut out an
opponent for the first time in more than two years with a 34-0
victory against the Eagles, who came into the game ranked last in
total offense.
</P>
<P>
   The performance was a sharp turnaround from their last time out,
when the Cowboys suffered a second-half meltdown on defense in a
13-12 loss to the Chicago Bears on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The only people unable to handle the pressure last night were
the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Cowboys, who should improve on their No. 11 ranking
in defense, knocked out Eagles starting quarterback Rodney Peete,
who suffered a cut on his finger. Then they blitzed and confused
his replacement, Bobby Hoying, who completed 13 of 39 passes for
124 yards. The Cowboys sacked him three times and picked him off
twice. And in the end, they held the Eagles to 200 yards total
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The first interception wiped out the Eagles' only legitimate
chance at scoring. A Woodson pass-interference call put the Eagles
on the Cowboys 19 midway through the second quarter. But Woodson,
who has not had the All-Pro season he is accustomed to, made up for
his mistake by jumping in front of tight end Jason Dunn to record
his first interception of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Eagles would have problems just getting into
field-goal position. Hoying had little time to throw all night, and
was sacked by rookie Michael Myers, lineman Hurvin McCormack, and
linebacker Dexter Coakley. Sanders, who outscored the Eagles by
himself with a 69-yard punt return for a touchdown, picked off
Hoying in the fourth quarter to end an Eagles threat.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, a shutout meant that hard-luck cornerback Kevin
Smith was not responsible for allowing an enemy wide receiver in
the end zone for the first time since Week 2.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Sanders blanketed Irving Fryar, who ``led'' the Eagles
with four receptions for 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' run defense also played strong. The Eagles' only
bright spot came when they caught the Cowboys in a blitz and Duce
Staley popped through for 33 yards. But Staley could only muster 23
yards the rest of the night. Starting running back Charlie Garner
was held to 15 yards on seven carries as the Eagles finished with
96 yards on the ground, the fourth consecutive time the Cowboys
have held an opponent to under 100 yards rushing, and the sixth
time overall.
</P>
<P>
   The elements came together for the Cowboys' first shutout since
a 27-0 victory against the New York Giants Sept. 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   You can smile now, Dave.

CSUN INVESTIGATING COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Blenda Wilson, the president of Cal State
Northridge, has ordered an internal investigation into the arrest
of women's basketball coach Michael Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant vice president of student affairs Mary Ann
Cummins-Prager is conducting the investigation, Wilson said Monday.
Interviews could be concluded today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of our investigation is to find out what happened
and to take action,'' Wilson said. ``There must be accountability
for personnel in the athletic department and accountability for the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham was charged by the FBI with conspiracy to distribute,
and possession with intent to distribute, 50 grams or more of crack
cocaine. The fourth-year coach was placed on paid administrative
leave Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she learned Thursday that there were previous
allegations from players concerning Abraham and the use of drugs.
That information came to Wilson from athletic director Paul Bubb,
through vice president of student affairs Ron Kopita.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, however, Bubb publicly said he had never heard
of allegations linking Abraham to drugs. Wilson said it was
``possible'' Bubb could face disciplinary action for the apparent
contradiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul had explained to (Kopita) of a previous report from
students,'' Wilson said. ``Paul's report to Ron was that the report
was not substantiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, who refused comment Monday night, was suspended without
pay for five days in 1996. That stemmed from the shooting of
football player Shayne Blakey, and the cover-up that followed.
Former football coach Dave Baldwin said at the time that Blakey had
his appendix removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic department has an obligation to be committed to
the highest standards,'' Wilson said. ``Once I have the complete
report, I will make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Former basketball player Tammie Mills said ``a couple'' players
went to Bubb following the 1996-97 season to discuss Abraham's
erratic behavior. Mills said she was not one of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Montgomery, CSUN's director of human resources, said he
could not comment on a specific case. However, he said proper
procedure for an employee's alleged use of drugs is for the
department supervisor to conduct an investigation, which could
include confronting the individual. The supervisor determines the
scope of the investigation and whether formal action is required.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said she wanted to wait until she had an opportunity to
review the report before deciding whether Bubb should have alerted
other school officials about the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also said the school has made arrangements for any
players, or other students, to receive counseling regarding the
matter.

ISLANDERS DEFEAT PANTHERS, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Monday night's 6-2 victory over the Florida
Panthers was worth more to the New York Islanders than 2 points in
the standing. It also made them a winning team for the first time
in almost a year at 6-5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a barrier,'' Trevor Linden said of the .500 mark.
``And once you break through it, psychologically it's healthy, it's
good. Once that momentum gets rolling, it's a lot easier to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who improved to 4-1 on this homestand, were last
above .500 on Nov. 19, 1997, when they were 9-8-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders even moved into a tie for first place in the
Atlantic Division at 12 points with the Philadelphia Flyers
(5-4-2). ``It puts a smile on your face,'' Rich Pilon said of the
Islanders' place atop the division. ``It's nice to get over the
hump and be in first place for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' offense did not waste its chances on Monday
night, the defense did not allow many and Tommy Salo's goaltending
(18 saves) was outstanding. Two goals each by Bryan Smolinski and
Robert Reichel helped the Islanders to their most lopsided victory
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders fell behind by 2-1 early in the second period, but
bounced back with five straight goals. They outshot Florida by
29-20.
</P>
<P>
   Smolinski opened the scoring with a power-play goal 1 minute 11
seconds into the game, one-timing the puck past Florida goalie Sean
Burke from the middle of the right circle.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Rob Niedermayer tied the score at 1-1 with a
power-play goal at 5:36. Panthers defenseman Robert Svehla made a
cross-ice pass, but the puck deflected off Niedermayer's skate and
into the Islanders' net. Salo immediately skated toward the
referee, Stephen Walkom, to complain. After a review, the goal was
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   After Florida went ahead, 2-1, on Bill Lindsay's goal at 2:41,
the Islanders scored three straight goals in the second period.
Smolinski tapped in a rebound, Reichel scored on a wraparound and
Linden fired one in with 52 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel's goal was surely the Islanders' strangest this season.
Reichel was coming out of the penalty box, where he had been sent
for unsportsmanlike conduct, just as Linden cleared the puck.
Burke, unaware of Reichel, left the crease to stop the puck.
Reichel easily stole it from the Florida goalie, skated around the
goal and scored.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel tapped in a rebound at 1:21 of the third period to give
the Islanders a 5-2 lead. Claude Lapointe turned the game into a
rout, scoring the Islanders' sixth goal on the power play at 10:30
of the third period.

DEFIANT GATES TAKES STAND _ ON VIDEOTAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON SWARTZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates finally appeared in federal court Monday _ albeit on
videotape _ and said he didn't remember or understand various
e-mail messages that seem to bolster arguments that Microsoft used
its clout to harm competitors including Netscape Communications and
Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department showed about two hours of highlights
culled from 20 hours of pretrial depositions taken at the company's
Redmond, Wash., headquarters this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, appeared by
turns nervous, defiant and evasive, frequently rocking and
fidgeting in his leather chair. Much of Monday's testimony in the
government's antitrust case against Microsoft focused on
Cupertino's Apple Computer.
</P>
<P>
   In 46 pages of explosive written testimony released Friday,
Apple executive Avie Tevanian said Microsoft threatened to stop
developing its popular Office software package for Macintosh
computers if Apple did not make Microsoft's Internet Explorer the
primary browser on Macs.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 1997 e-mail disclosed Monday, Ben Waldman, head of
Microsoft's Macintosh division, allegedly told Gates, ``The threat
to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point
that we have, as doing so will do a greater deal of harm to Apple
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   In another e-mail disclosed Monday, Gates allegedly was told:
``Mac Office is the perfect club to use on them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, government attorney David Boies read the memos to
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Gates said he didn't understand what they meant, adding ``Well,
I know that Apple would prefer that we have a more updated version
of Mac Office, that that would be a positive thing for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the alleged threat, Apple had featured Netscape's
Navigator as the primary browser on their Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian wrote that a Macintosh version of Office was ``critical
to the commercial viability'' of Apple. Microsoft Office includes
the Excel spreadsheet software, Word for word processing, and other
programs. Tevanian will testify in court tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Some trial observers called the Apple evidence &UR;  &LR; among the
strongest yet against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very serious piece of evidence, a smoking gun,''
said Rich Gray, an intellectual property and antitrust attorney in
San Jose. ``Microsoft's timing makes it clear it was willing to
stop development (of Office) in order to hurt Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has argued that the seamless combination of its
browser with Windows 98 was to benefit consumers, not destroy
Netscape as a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In his taped testimony, Gates also said he did not recall an
Aug. 8, 1997, e-mail he allegedly sent to Microsoft executives,
asking: ``Do we have a clear plan on what we want Apple to do to
undermine Sun?''
</P>
<P>
   Gates also denied knowing that Microsoft executives met with
Netscape Communications on June 21, 1995, to discuss dividing up
the browser market. Netscape Chief Executive Officer James
Barksdale testified last week that Microsoft made the proposal at
Netscape's offices in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   When presented with a June 1, 1995, e-mail message from
Microsoft executive Paul Maritz about a business deal with
Netscape, Gates said he did not remember the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In sometimes combative exchanges with Gates captured on tape,
government lawyers contend Microsoft set out to ``pollute Java,''
the programming language made by Sun Microsystems Inc. to run on
any operating system. They said the software giant viewed it as a
threat to its Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember sending it,'' said Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any doubt you sent it?'' Boies asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be e-mail I sent,'' Gates said. Asked what he
meant when he wrote the e-mail, Gates replied: ``I don't
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray called the tapes a ``clear
attempt to sensationalize the case and distract people's attention
from the weakness of the government's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers said the videotape and e-mail messages paint
an unflattering portrait of Microsoft, but may not constitute
illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously sleazy stuff,'' said Jeffrey Tarter, editor of
Softletter in Watertown, Mass. ``None of these actions by
themselves prove anything. But taken as a whole, they indicate a
pattern of obnoxious, bullying behavior. The question remains if
driving a hard bargain and displaying such behavior is illegal
under antitrust law.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft ``is a large company with the mind-set of a startup,''
said Mike Elgan, editor of Windows magazine in Jericho, N.Y. ``That
is what makes it so successful, as well as object of a federal
probe.''

TABLOID'S SETBACK IN `REPRINT' LIBEL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARRIET CHIANG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Setting limits on the coverage of private
individuals, the California Supreme Court ruled Monday that the
media are not protected from libel suits if they reprint defamatory
statements about a private figure.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the high court upheld a $1.17 million
verdict awarded to Khalid Khawar, a Bakersfield farmer who was
falsely identified as the assassin of Senator Robert Kennedy in an
article by the Globe, a tabloid newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Globe ran an article summing up a book by
conspiracy theorist Robert Morrow that contained the false
allegations about the 1968 assassination. The Globe ran an enlarged
photo of Khawar that appeared in Morrow's book. Next to the
article, it had an arrow pointing to Khawar and identifying him as
the assassin.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe argued that it could not be found liable because it
was accurately reporting on a matter of public controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid's legal defense was supported by several major news
organizations, which were concerned about the standards the court
would set for reporting secondhand news.
</P>
<P>
   Several federal and state courts have recognized that the press
has an absolute right under the First Amendment to accurately
report on public controversies even if they include people making
defamatory remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Supreme Court said most courts have recognized
this privilege only when it involves a public figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republication of accusations made against private figures are
never protected by the neutral reportage privilege,'' wrote Justice
Joyce Kennard in the court's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting false accusations involving private individuals can
have a ``devastating effect'' on their reputation because they do
not have the same access to the media as a public figure to defend
themselves, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court declined to say whether the media would be
protected if they were reporting on a public figure.
</P>
<P>
   James Brelsford, a San Francisco attorney who filed a
friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the American Broadcasting
Co., Hearst Corp. and several other news organizations, said it is
disappointing that the court refused to recognize this privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``It rejected some of the realities of what it means to be in
the news reporting business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is issuing a warning that when it comes to media
reports on nonpublic figures, the press is going to be held to a
tight standard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khawar's attorney, Francis Pizzulli of Santa Monica, said the
decision draws a line between mainstream journalism and tabloid
newspapers. ``Most people don't look to the media for retelling
lies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When private people are involved, he said, ``the decision
clarifies that their reputations are not grist for the mill for
journalists who have no good faith in spreading the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles attorney Kelli Sager, who filed a brief in support
of the Globe on behalf of NBC, CBS, the Los Angeles Times and
several other news groups, said she was relieved that the court did
not use this decision to infringe on the media's right to run book
reviews and wire service stories that report on defamatory
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of the court drawing a line between
reporting on private figures and public figures, telling newspapers
that you need to take special care when reporting on private
figures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy arose after the Globe ran &UR;  &LR; an article in its
April 1989 issue on Morrow's book, ``The Senator Must Die.'' Morrow
alleged that Kennedy's assassination in 1968 was the work of the
Iranian shah's secret police and the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   He included in the book a photo taken of Khawar at the
Ambassador Hotel where he was covering Kennedy as a photojournalist
for a Pakistani magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Khawar was at the hotel and had his picture taken with Kennedy
but he was in another room when the senator was shot, according to
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   After the story was published, Khawar and his family received
numerous threats.
</P>
<P>
   Khawar sued the Globe in August 1989 and won. The state Court of
Appeal upheld the verdict. He also sued Morrow, but lost.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding Khawar's verdict, the court said Khawar was not an
``involuntary public figure'' because he had no way of knowing that
Kennedy would be assassinated moments after he had his photo taken
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he have sufficient access to the media ``to effectively
counter the defamatory falsehoods in the Globe article,'' Kennard
said.
</P>
<P>
   The court also found that there was ample evidence that the
Globe acted with malice when it published the report. The FBI and
local prosecutors had conducted an extensive investigation on the
assassination. Sirhan Sirhan was found guilty by a jury and
sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy of the Morrow
book's central claim,'' Kennard said. And yet the Globe
``purposefully avoided the truth'' without any investigation of its
own.

 &HT;    Small scar doesn't tell whole story
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Rod Foster pulled up the green pant leg of his
Wright State warm-up suit and eased down the top of his white
cotton sock until you saw the faint, two-inch scar just above his
left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all you can see of it anymore,'' he said with a shrug.
``From this, you can't really tell how big of a deal it was in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, this thin line of flesh is really more like the
great divide. On one side there was the National Basketball
Association, where Foster was a Phoenix Suns shooting guard known
for his speed and spring. He was called Rocket Rod, a nickname he
picked up in his glory days as a UCLA Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the other side of the scar, you find basketball stops
far beyond those marquee seasons with UCLA and the NBA. The
travelogue of teams includes Savannah, Quad Cities (Ill.), Rapid
City (S.D.) and San Jose of the Continental Basketball Association,
Erie of the World Basketball League, the barnstorming Athletes in
Action, Master's College, an NAIA school in California, and now,
Wright State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rocket has landed,'' Foster, the Raiders new assistant
basketball coach, said quietly as he headed to the team's Monday
afternoon practice in the Nutter Center. ``But you know something,
I couldn't be in a better situation. I've got no remorse over what
once was. What I like is this group of kids we have here. I really
hope I can help them turn things around.''
</P>
<P>
   In Foster, Wright State _ which opens its 1998-99 basketball
season tonight with an exhibition game against the Dayton-based
Supreme Court _ may have found a guy who can help it rebound from
last year's 10-18 season. After all, the 38-year-old coach has
engineered quite a turn around of his own.
</P>
<P>
   As a prep All-American at St. Thomas Aquinas High in New
Britain, Conn., in the late 1970s, Foster said he had one dream:
``Since I'd been in the seventh grade, all I thought about was
playing in the NBA. Growing up, my idol was Julius Erving and I
tried to emulate him, even with the big Afro.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruited by everyone, Foster finally chose UCLA over Syracuse,
Louisiana State and Marquette: ``As soon as I walked around Pauley
Pavilion and saw those 10 national championship banners, I was in
awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster was a four-year starter for the Bruins. All-PAC 10 as a
freshman, he was on a team that played in the NCAA Final Four. It
was during a nationally-televised game against DePaul, as Foster
was streaking up and down the floor, that Al McGuire, the coach
turned commentator, tagged him Rocket Rod. By the time he was a
senior, the Rocket led the nation in free throw shooting percentage
(.950) and was All-PAC 10 again.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns drafted Foster in the second round of the 1983
draft and in three season's he was making a name for himself as a
three-point shooter. Then came the incident that forever changed
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it like yesterday,'' he said. ``It was a Sunday in
March in 1986. The night before we'd come back from playing the
Utah Jazz and we had the day off. Two of my teammates, Ed Pinckney
and Mike Sanders, went with me in my Jeep to drive around some
desert trails out by Lake Pleasant beyond Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was toward evening an we came over a hill and I lost
control of the Jeep. For some reason, as it was tipping over on
it's side, I stuck out my leg like I was on a bicycle and the Jeep
landed on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster suffered major fractures of the tibia and fibula in his
left leg. Nobody else was hurt in the accident, but because the
Jeep flipped in the remote foothills of the Bradshaw Mountains, it
took his teammates four hours to get him to a hospital, where he
underwent three different surgeries and one total ``change in
perspective,'' as he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember thinking this had to have happened for a
reason,'' Foster said. ``I was so dependent on my legs. Speed was
my trademark and I had stuck my leg out. After a while, it all came
to me. And it was pretty humbling. God had a different plan for me.
I had lost my way and he did the one thing to get my attention.''

 &HT;    Some adventures are meant for the great indoors
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Come on out and we'll go camping in the
mountains,'' she says. ``We'll sleep on the ground and cook over an
open fire,'' she says. No trace of a giggle and it's not as if she
doesn't know better. She's seen me in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to come to spider heaven and sleep out in the
woods?'' I ask in disbelief. She assures me there will be no bugs
where we're going. I ask for proof. ``You've got a contract with
Terminix? They're going to tent the mountain and fog it?''
</P>
<P>
   Gail, an old friend from Georgia who transplanted herself, a
basket of books, and a 15-year-old Volvo to the coast of Oregon
after her husband jumped ship, loves nothing better than to crawl
into a sleeping bag and make like Nature Girl. We've had this
discussion before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so-oo beautiful this time of year,'' she coos. ``Mornings
are crisp. We can hike before breakfast and cook over an open
fire.'' She's ecstatic; I'm silent. ``We can stretch out beside a
rushing stream and just read and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Unmoved by the scenario, I suggest, ``We can read in your living
room and grill chicken on the deck, and if it's sleeping bags you
want, what's wrong with the bedroom floor?'' An exasperated sigh
works its way through the cross-country hookup. I decide it's time
to remind her of our history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember St. Augustine?'' I ask trying to jolt her memory a
bit. She admits she'll never forget it. Neither will I.
</P>
<P>
   It was June, 1981, and our 13-year-old sons were away at camp.
Gail and I planned a trip to Miami for my 30th class reunion with a
stopover in St. Augustine. We took a small suite in a 200-year-old
inn in the heart of the town's enchanting historic district.
Idyllic, I had assured her, and she wasn't disappointed. Until
dark, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   We were lying in bed reading, when out of the corner of my eye I
spotted movement. ``There's a bug in here,'' I announced. ``It's on
the blinds.''
</P>
<P>
   Without looking up from her book, Gail mumbled something that
sounded like, ``Um-mm, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   My voice shot up an octave to where even the stony Sphinx
couldn't have missed the terror in it. ``It's a flying cockroach.''
Eyes riveted to the print, she informed me there was no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, I'm a pretty easygoing sort; kind of a steady hand at
the helm thing. Heck, I've survived tornadoes, hurricanes, and kids
throwing up in my trash can, but there was no way I was sharing
digs with a prehistoric winged behemoth. Gail admits to total
recall of the night in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatta' you know from bugs,'' I asked shortly. ``You're from
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing what she quickly determined to be the inevitable (find
it, annihilate it, and show Elizabeth the lifeless carcass), she
rolled out of bed, picked up a slipper, and went into her dauntless
defender act. ``Where is it?'' She sounded testy. I mumbled a
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pull your head out from under that sheet and show me where the
(adjective deleted) bug is.'' I reached out one arm, pointed toward
the window, then quickly retreated into my percale cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable thrashing, crashing, and a few choice words
that would have appalled the children, she declared the search was
over. I demanded to see the body. She said there was no body and
suggested the repugnant critter was a figment of my imagination. I
pulled my head out from under the sheet and
</P>
<P>
   clearly stated my position. ``Find the bug or we're outta'
here.''
</P>
<P>
   She laid an icy stare on me, kicked off her other slipper, slid
back into bed, and opened her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whirr! Zi-ip!'' I ducked. Gail leaped out of bed. One quick
look assured me the worst (or best from my point of view) had come
to pass. My ``imagination'' had just made a three-point landing on
her pillow. She beat it to death with her book and life went on.
</P>
<P>
   Hesitantly, I remind her I'm still the same woman who inspired
her to confess after the fact: ``For a moment there I had a tough
time deciding which to slap with the book - you or the bug.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks it over and changes the subject. I guess that means
the trip is off.

 &HT;    `Mars, Venus' author wants peace on Earth between the sexes
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You know you've heard of it _ the whole
Mars/Venus
intergalactic-gender-warfare-why-can't-we-all-just-get-along deal.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was created by romance swami John Gray, whose first
book _ Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus in 1992 _ gave rise
to five spinoffs (Mars and Venus Starting Over; In Love; Together
Forever; On a Date; and In the Bedroom). Nowadays, he has videos,
seminars, CD-ROMs, counseling centers, audio tapes and a steady gig
on Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd have guessed this guy is a former Hindu monk who practiced
celibacy for nine years? Not to worry. He's been married to his
second wife, Bonnie, since 1985. (Three kids.)
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line of Gray's philosophy is simple: The sexes are
different. Women: If a man needs time alone in his ``cave,'' back
off. Men: If a woman needs you to listen, really listen, then shut
up and lend an ear already.
</P>
<P>
   While Gray, 46, is beloved by millions, others are less swooned.
A Web site tagged ``Rebuttal from Uranus'' rips his ideas as
``sexist, patronizing, male-centered invective which does little
more than perpetuate long-held negative gender stereotypes.''
Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But his empire continues to grow. Today, in fact, he launches a
syndicated column.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a man on a mission,'' Gray has said. ``I help men and
women understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame a guy for trying.

 &HT;    In the shadow of `short people'
 &HT;    By Scott Benarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Singer-songwriter Randy Newman is
resigned that his 1977 hit Short People may be his legacy as a pop
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I died tomorrow, my tombstone would say: `Composer of Short
People and others.' That's the way it is,'' says Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 105-cut, four-CD career retrospective, Guilty: 30 Years
of Randy Newman (Rhino Records), that hits stores todaymay not be
hefty enough to overcome the towering shadow of Short People.
</P>
<P>
   A wildly misunderstood commentary on the absurdity of prejudice,
which happened to use vertically challenged folks as an example, it
is the sole Top 40 hit of Los Angeles resident Newman's lengthy
recording career. And, unfortunately, the only song most people can
identify him with.
</P>
<P>
   Few people realize that Newman, 54, also wrote Three Dog Night's
No. 1 hit Mama Told Me Not to Come; that his I Love L.A.
</P>
<P>
   was the theme song for the 1994 Olympic Games; that Harry
Nilsson recorded a complete album of Newman's songs; that British
singers Dusty Springfield, Manfred Mann, Eric Burdon, Ringo Starr
and others turned to Newman for material.
</P>
<P>
   His next album of ``pop'' tunes, (his first since 1995's
underappreciated musical updating of Faust), is tentatively titled
Bad Love and set for release in 1999. It includes songs about
European colonialism, Karl Marx and aging rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   Newman has also enjoyed simultaneous artistic success as a film
scorer (though he gets more satisfaction from his records). He's
written music for The Natural (winning a 1984 Grammy for Best
Instrumental Composition), Ragtime, Avalon, Awakenings, The Paper,
Parenthood, Maverick, Toy Story and James and the Giant Peach. His
music is featured in the current Pleasantville and the forthcoming
A Bug's Life. (This is not surprising, considering he cut his
musical teeth watching his uncles, noted film scorers Alfred,
Lionel and Emil Newman, do their work.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the above music, as well as one CD of previously
unreleased ``odds and ends'' is included in Guilty (a project
Newman says he was reluctant to take part in because he dislikes
looking back, but now happily endorses because the material has
held up.)
</P>
<P>
   But it's all relatively unknown when stacked against Short
People.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad because _ Short People included _ Newman's body
of work is as morally weighty and provocative as any modern
American songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Brimming with sarcasm and humor, cast with thoughtless, selfish,
ignorant, all-too-real characters, Newman's songs play like
mini-tragedies and dramas set to music. Collectively, they're one
big plea for tolerance and dignity. (``Treat a man like dirt, give
him no respect, oh yeah, and expect something dirty in return,'' he
sings in Can't Keep A Good Man Down.)
</P>
<P>
   But many of Newman's songs have been misinterpreted. That's
partly because he is a painstaking lyricist who refuses to state
the obvious, who sucks listeners in with bizarre characters making
outrageous (but what they think are logical) statements.
</P>
<P>
   His song Rednecks, which caught almost as much flak as Short
People, was not just about racism in the South. It chastised the
nation for bigotry. The character in Political Science, making a
case for dropping ``the big one'' on countries that don't
appreciate the good ol' U.S.A., is no patriot. The man declaring,
``My life is good'' in the song of the same name is really in a
bittersweet state of denial as his family falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think audiences recognized my people are wrong and
wrongheaded and stupid and ignorant and self-absorbed,'' explains
Newman, who excels at subtle, dry wit and finds letting characters
do the talking a lot more interesting than mouthing off himself.
</P>
<P>
   What throws listeners off, Newman says, is that ``the bad people
in my songs make a case for their behavior; they're not just
cardboard cutouts to be knocked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion is a favorite topic, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion is the biggest hit in human history, an enormously
successful idea that's had a big effect on everything.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter the subject, however, the purpose of his songs remains
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I trying to tell people to be nice to each other by
pointing out what is not nice? You could accuse me of that and not
be wrong,'' Newman says.

 &HT;    ShortTakes: Standards we set for others
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's official. What was long suspected is true. DNA tests prove
that our third president, Thomas Jefferson, fathered at least one
child with his young slave, Sally Hemings. It was Jefferson who
told a new nation that all of us were _ and would be _ created
equal. But even his great intellect could not accommodate the
principle to his own life. He owned slaves, several hundred, found
them commercially valuable, then continued to dither famously over
the gap in his logic.
</P>
<P>
   Not much is known of the Jefferson-Hemings relationship, whether
it was warm and affectionate or conventionally master and slave.
One would like to think the former, but it makes little difference.
Thomas Jefferson, great man though he was, knew better. When it
came to cases, he was a creature of his time and place. Like most
of us, he held higher standards for others than for himself.
</P>
<P>
   We know something about that, observing the public ordeal of a
young president who knew better. For a long time, you could hardly
avoid the scandal. Some could hardly get enough of it. Others would
have preferred to seal themselves in a dark, empty room than hear
another word.
</P>
<P>
   You hear less now. Most Americans, according to the polls,
prefer it that way. Most people came to realize that it was the
furious, unbuttoned pursuit of the matter that humiliated them
more. We all, like great Jefferson, tromp about on feet of purest
clay. Having understood that well enough could well be what our
generation is remembered for.

 &HT;    The key to relax: quiet Summerland
 &HT;    By Bryon Rivers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I was halfway to Summerland Key when I
realized I had forgotten to bring shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Green flip-flops hung on my feet and from the strap of my green
backpack, a pair of sports sandals. As it turned out, they were
enough. In the Keys, shoes are extraneous.
</P>
<P>
   On my first Keys vacation I saw my first shark and first pod of
dolphins in the wild, took part in a wedding and got caught in a
thunderstorm black as death while on a sailboat. But I also did
more relaxing than I've done in a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   Summerland Key is small - really small. You have to leave it to
do any real shopping (food or otherwise) and besides what you
concoct, recreation opportunities are minimal. That's a good thing.
No tourist traps, no shopping plazas, little traffic.
</P>
<P>
   What it does have is lots of quiet streets and houses (like the
one where we stayed) that sit on the waterways that lead to the
ocean. Our party consisted of myself, my girlfriend, Erica, her
sister Adrian, their dad, Lee, and his girlfriend, Sylvia. For
seven days we inhabited a pretty house with three bedrooms, living
and Florida rooms and a big kitchen which, thanks to Sylvia and a
nearby fresh fish market, got a lot of use.
</P>
<P>
   Our house had indoor and outdoor showers and a shaded patio with
stairs that descended to a low-traffic canal where we swam,
snorkeled and sunbathed every day. There were even a pair of kayaks
left specifically for our use.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of spot I used to dream about after watching
Flipper. For the record, at age 10 I wanted to be Bud Ricks,
Flipper's young human friend in the old TV series.
</P>
<P>
   If you like to do nothing while on vacation you can do that
here. The place radiates a lazy summer feeling.
</P>
<P>
   We chose to be a little more adventurous and found the
surrounding area accommodating.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles north of Summerland is Bahia Honda State Park, a
perfect place to sprawl on the sand, snorkel through the turtle
grass or kayak (rentals are available) through motionless
blue-green water.
</P>
<P>
   Since all five of us are scuba certified, we also took advantage
of the picturesque diving the area offers. For $42 a person, the
Undersea Dive Shop in Big Pine Key set us up with equipment and
boat ride to Looe Key National Underwater Marine Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The coral formations alone could leave you breathless (a state
you don't actually want to experience while diving) and there are
hundreds of species of fish, numerous anemones, turtles, lobster
and other sea life to view as well.
</P>
<P>
   For those who just have to see the southernmost point in the
continental United States or check out Jimmy Buffett's
Margaritaville Restaurant in Key West, it's a short drive - only 30
minutes as long as traffic isn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Sylvia decided we should make the trip but instead of
roaming the streets for hours on end (yawn) we chartered a
catamaran (The Echo) for a sunset sail.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie West, a ``friend'' of Sylvia's, met us at the pier and
we cruised toward the open water. It turned out West was actually a
notary public and to the surprise of everyone but West, Tyrone
(Echo's captain) and the bride and groom, we found ourselves in the
middle of Lee and Sylvia's wedding at sea. The ceremony was
absolutely perfect and received an extra blessing in the form a
fiery sunset.
</P>
<P>
   We were so enthralled by our first sunset sail that we booked
another. Captain Tyrone guided us to an outer island for some
kayaking and sightseeing, then later we moored over a pretty little
patch reef and dropped in for an hour of snorkeling (this is where
we spotted a small nurse shark).
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to shore we snacked on fresh fruit and reclined
on the boat's trampoline. As the sun began dipping toward the
horizon, we spotted a dorsal fin breaking the surface of the
darkening water. Tyrone ``floored it'' and within a couple of
minutes we were surrounded by a playful pod of dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   After watching them frolic we caught another sunset and headed
back to Summerland, where the last two days of our stay were spent
snoozing by the water. Who knew paradise was only four hours from
home?
</P>
<P>
   If you go to The Keys
</P>
<P>
   Rental agency: Accommodating the Keys, (305) 745-1072, rents
seven houses from Big Pine to Cudjoe in the lower Keys. We stayed
in the three-bedroom house called Tropical Reflections on Big Pine,
which costs from $650 to $800 (depending on number of people). The
houses had only minor damage from Hurricane Georges and are
repaired. For other house rental agencies throughout the Keys call
(800) FLA-KEYS.
</P>
<P>
   Rates: The agency's seven houses range from $550 to $1,200 for
seven nights plus taxes. All houses are water-front.

 &HT;    School letters spell more than sports
 &HT;    By By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After practice last week, three Cardinal
Newman High School football players got a lesson in ancient high
school history. The chapter about earning a letter.
</P>
<P>
   Way back when, only boys could earn letters and in very few
sports. There was a Lettermen's Club. Letter sweaters. Football
players were Big Men on Campus. Every campus. They swaggered. Girls
swooned.
</P>
<P>
   The three kids hear this and offer a quizzical look, that
cocked-head gaze that comes when teens hear how it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   That enduring rite of passage _ earning a letter _ is nothing
like it used to be. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   Today, girl jocks rule at many schools, thanks to the
26-year-old Title IX, the equal-opportunity enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, schools started going Title IX one better.
</P>
<P>
   How about letters awarded for competitions in air-conditioned
rooms?
</P>
<P>
   Today's students can earn a letter in debate, band, chorus,
drama or any number of brain ``sports.''
</P>
<P>
   This flood of democracy caused changes _ none more dramatic than
the deflation of the Big Man on Campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people know who the quarterback is,'' says cross-country
and soccer letter winner Samantha Woodhouse at Spanish River
Community High School in Boca Raton, ``but they don't part when he
comes down the hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls don't parade around school in their boyfriend's letter
jacket. They have their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch old movies from the '80s and you see the cool guys
in letter jackets,'' says Jenny DeBee, a three-letter winner for
volleyball. ``It's just not like that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   So many ways to earn glory, such a dim spotlight for football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could always get 125 kids at tryouts for football, but today
you get 50 and you're doing well,'' says Bill Massey, athletic
director at Boca Raton's Spanish River with 2,890 students. He
coached football at the school a dozen years ago and sees game film
from other schools. Same story. Fewer players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are irate if their kids are interested in
(playing) football,'' he goes on. ``It's not seen as the kind of
endeavor to aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Massey, who earned high school letters for football, wrestling
and track in the mid-'60s, adds that many students say football
players are the least popular jocks. ``Teen-oriented movies don't
portray football players in a very flattering way.''
</P>
<P>
   Each school can decide which letters to award, and the
proliferation of letters has added weight to academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm more proud of my academic (letter),'' says Lane
Wilson, a junior at Lake Worth High School, with letters in
academics (top 5 percent of her class) and volleyball. ``I play
sports for fun. Getting that academic (letter) is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect the kids to wear their letter. ``It's an honor
but not something you show off,'' offers Susie Brown at Spanish
River.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny DeBee's Spanish River volleyball letter ``is home in a
drawer somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline of letter jackets can be traced to kids being
practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have one but it's so expensive,'' says Cardinal
Newman quarterback Abram Elam. Adds his Crusaders teammate, Matt
Falloretta, ``It's $100 and you're only going to get to wear it for
two or three weeks it's so hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Elam's letter is in a trophy case at home. Falloretta's is on a
bulletin board in his bedroom. Their teammate, Nick Rojo, does have
a jacket for his wrestling and football letters. ``But I only wear
it in the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth baseball player Eric Ballard says his dad told him if
he lettered, he'd spring for the jacket. A lot of kids get jackets
for Christmas, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   On any high school campus, when you do see an athlete wearing
the traditional jacket, a letter dripping with medals, there's a
good chance it's a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth High junior Katie Painter's jacket tells you she has
earned letters in volleyball, soccer, cheerleading and academics.
There's no stigma being a girl jock, she says, because fame is
earned equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two best athletes last year were runners, a girl and a
boy, Edna Caraballo and Michael Reed.''
</P>
<P>
   High school administrators say these changes in high school
culture are good for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   At Spanish River, says athletic director Massey, ``It's much
better today. The value of athletics is shared with all the
students. Before it was exclusive.'' At his school, winners are
applauded equally _ whether it's for debate or track.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Perry, Lake Worth's assistant principal, agrees: ``There
are many things for kids to do well and excel. We can create
leaders and celebrities in all areas.''

 &HT;    Pianist's cd makes humble keyboards sound grand
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ William Coakley flew to London last year to
sit in a recording studio and listen to a most remarkable sound:
the grand Steinway piano from Palm Beach Community College.
</P>
<P>
   It was remarkable because the Steinway was back in Lake Worth.
Only Coakley's fussy brilliance with computers allowed its rich
tones to join a recording by members of the London Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley isn't the first to electronically reproduce the sound of
a piano. But his gold-color CDs, which allow a $3,000 electronic
keyboard to sound like a $70,000 concert grand, may be the first to
satisfy the music industry's most critical ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried most of the other piano CDs out there, but
Coakley's is the warmest, best-sounding I've found,'' said Danny
Lux, a Hollywood composer who writes and performs the scores for
several TV series. ``I'm using it in every show I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means that when you hear an acoustic piano on Ally McBeal
or Sliders or Profiler, you're hearing an electronic keyboard echo
Coakley's long hours in the heat and near-darkness of the Watson B.
Duncan Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   What he did sounds deceptively simple, recording each of the
piano's 88 notes two times: once played hard and then once softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But each note had to be a masterpiece,'' he said. ``There
can't be any distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The crackle of overhead lights and the buzz of air-conditioning
could be eliminated. Passing planes, cars and thunderstorms
couldn't. He spent hours one afternoon firing bug spray into the
stage's hydraulic controls, trying to silence a cricket.
</P>
<P>
   His 176 near-perfect samples took nearly six months to complete,
long past what a more commercially minded technician would have
considered the point of diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley was driven by something stronger: the need for a tool he
couldn't buy, something vital to his goals as composer. He needed a
way to fix his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are creating, you don't always hit the note you want
to,'' he explained. ``But you don't want to stop. You want to be
able to go back later and change it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the wonder of electronically produced music: It is
infinitely and easily changeable.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley, 52, demonstrates at the electronic keyboard in his
workshop/recording studio/home in a bunker-like building on an
industrial side street in Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the keyboard from the front door demands careful and
constant maneuvering around old computer parts, cardboard boxes,
business orders and musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley sits facing three computer screens and a wizard's array
of controls stacked above his Kurzweil 2500 keyboard. As he plays,
twin speakers relay the sounds of the Steinway while the screens
display them as peaks and waves.
</P>
<P>
   It does indeed sound like a grand piano. The keyboard even
responds properly when Coakley softens his touch, as the computer
interpolates between the hard and soft samples.
</P>
<P>
   Pianos are among the most difficult instruments to record
properly, but electronic keyboards require no microphones. The
music Coakley plays is recorded directly, digitally and
distortion-free on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley makes intentional mistakes and then clicks into a
computer program that isolates each note. He listens to the
computer replay the tune and points to the errant notes. He uses
his mouse to edit them out as easily as if he were correcting a
misspelled word.
</P>
<P>
   When he hits the replay button again, the tune is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can add any note, take any note out,'' he said. ``And you
can't tell by listening.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no mere parlor trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a whole orchestra in the recording studio, and
the hours are ticking away, it can get very expensive,'' said Chris
Caswell, who wrote the piano-based score for the animated feature
The Ugly Duckling.
</P>
<P>
   He used Coakley's sampler to record and edit the piano in his
home studio, then took the recording to London (along with Coakley)
to complete the recording. That trip opened Coakley's eyes to the
scope of his accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Although he produces the CDs with his own machine and sells them
directly through ads in trade magazines and an Internet home page
(www.williamcoakley.com), he's not always aware of what happens
once they're in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from other people that certain musicians are using
them or that they're showing up here and there, but I have no way
of knowing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has sold 718 of them so far at $299 each, but he gets no
royalties for their use in concerts or multimillion-dollar
productions. His license agreement requires only a liner-note or
screen credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's paid for itself, and I'm happy about that, but I didn't
set out to become rich,'' he said. ``Music is a funny goddess. I
have real regard for anyone who tries to make a living at it, and I
wouldn't try to take advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley traces his admiration for musicians to his father, a
violinist with the Louisville Symphony. He still cherishes his
violin, which he keeps in its case on top of an empty Perrier
carton behind a drum set.
</P>
<P>
   His own musical experience began with piano lessons at age 4 and
picked up momentum at 12, when he began playing the church organ.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organ was the first synthesizer,'' he said. ``It's like
having a whole orchestra at your fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   His perfect pitch allowed him to become a successful piano
tuner, but Coakley didn't settle into a comfortable career path for
a long time. He studied electronic engineering, earned a commercial
pilot license, played keyboard in nightclubs and even ran for local
office.
</P>
<P>
   He never found time to earn a degree. He was selling instruments
in a West Palm Beach music store in the 1970s, when his boss turned
away a salesman who came in to pitch the then-new Moog synthesizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew I had to get my hands on it,'' Coakley said. ``I
ran after the guy and told him I wanted to work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm won him a chance to sell Moogs on his own, which
came with the loan of a $1,500 synthesizer. Fascinated by the
instrument's possibilities, he was also frustrated by its
limitations. Coakley suggested a method of expanding its
capabilities, which brought a chance to meet and befriend the
inventor.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, he was determined to keep step with every
development in electronic music. ``I filled my mother's living room
and Florida room with recording equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   About 10 years ago, he took a part-time job teaching music at
PBCC, where the sound of the Steinway became his standard for
emulation, but his experiments were all frustrated by the
limitations of personal computers. Until the early 1990s, none had
enough memory to duplicate the full tone and range of a complex
instrument like a piano. He thought the barrier had been broken
when he saw the first CD-ROM piano samples advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought one, and I was shocked at how awful it was,'' he
said. ``Bad notes. Clunkers. Things anyone would notice. I called
and asked if I got a bad disc.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley tried other discs with no better results. He diagnosed
the problem as human, not electronic. ``They just weren't taking
the samples properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he did it himself: lights low, heat rising, crickets be
damned. And he's done it again by sampling an even grander piano, a
10-foot Fazioli, for a second series of discs.
</P>
<P>
   He's enjoying the critical praise (one magazine called his
samplings ``as much works of art as they are feats of technical
mastery''), but he's unlikely to hear his piano on any television
soundtrack. He spends his days producing CDs and his nights at the
keyboard. Now that he has his tool, he intends to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of unfinished work,'' he said, opening drawer
after drawer of tapes in a chest-high cabinet _ all original
compositions.
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to complete a major work that he can release, but
he'll let someone else produce the recording. It will be the
producer's job to decide which mistakes to leave in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Coakley said, ``mistakes are beautiful.''

 &HT;    Faith-healing guru brings her `love power' to audiences
 &HT;    (EDS: cq Thursday in 2nd graf Nov. 5th)
 &HT;    By By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The desire to slake spiritual hunger
seems insatiable. And there is no shortage of menus.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's most popular gurus of the healing power of
love, Marianne Williamson, comes to West Palm Beach Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The noted author will speak at 7 p.m. at Unity Church of the
Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance is a benefit for the Palm Beach Center for Living
and kicks off a three-day conference on the enduring New Age
classic, A Course in Miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson will draw attention to the center's programs and
raise money for its $11,000 monthly budget, said Charlotte
McGinnis, the founder and director of the center. But it's her
teaching that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about how God's love heals,'' Williamson said in a recent
interview from her home in Michigan. ``It's about forgiveness, the
power of forgiveness, the power of surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, 46, will speak of the growing acceptance of
spiritual healing. The role of prayer in healing the body has been
accepted by many traditional physicians who once rolled their eyes
at the idea, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming to a deeper appreciation that that which uplifts
the spirit uplifts the immune system,'' Williamson said.
``Ultimately, that which lifts the spirit uplifts all processes of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest book, The Healing of America (Simon &AMP; Schuster 1997,
$24), suggests that the spiritual healing of individual illness
applies as well to the healing of communities and countries.
</P>
<P>
   The book invokes the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and
Gandhi and suggests that collective prayer encourages the healing
of collective wounds, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's love applies equally to the common cold and the healing
of nations,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   She draws much of her philosophy from A Course in Miracles,
which she first promoted in 1992 through her book, A Return to
Love.
</P>
<P>
   The Course is a form of spiritual psychology. Love is a better
motivating force than acting from fear. And the unity of all things
is a more accurate understanding of life than the idea that people
are separate from one another, McGinnis said.
</P>
<P>
   A Course in Miracles is a record of voices heard between 1965
and 1972 by Helen Schucman, a Jewish agnostic psychologist from New
York. She claimed the voice was that of Jesus teaching his true
Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe it is the teaching of Jesus saying, `This
is my message that you have misunderstood,''' McGinnis said. ``It's
about true forgiveness, unconditional love, nonjudgment,
relinquishing fear and aligning our thoughts with God.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Living offers several opportunities to engage in
A Course in Miracles as well as other healing programs, McGinnis
said. And many of the 250 people who use the center weekly
participate in a wide range of community service projects.
</P>
<P>
   The center recently relocated from Palm Beach Gardens to a
facility on the Unity church campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolutely wonderful blending of loving energies,''
said Craig Keller, acting president of the church's board of
directors. ``I have never seen so many people who are unconditional
in their capacity to love.''
</P>
<P>
   Weekend speakers include Brent Haskell, an emergency-room
physician and author of Beyond Worlds and Other Voices; the Rev.
Taylor Stevens, senior minister at the center, Charlotte McGinnis
and others.
</P>
<P>
   But Williamson is the star of the conference. In addition to her
writing and lectures, she is the spiritual leader of a 2,000-member
Unity church, the Church of Today, in Warren, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, though, she is on the road, spreading a gospel
of love. She hopes to give people a sense of peace and some hope on
Thursday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I really kick the ball out of the field, there will be a
sense that the touch of God's hands came upon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to hear Williamson Thursday at 7 p.m. are $40; the
Friday evening program is $40; the Saturday conference is $75. Or a
package for all three days is $125. Call (561) 833-9226.

 &HT;    Better to live with a skunk than any snake
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A friend of mine who has a house down on the Gulf
Coast not too far from Panama City was delayed in returning home a
couple of weeks ago by a coral snake.
</P>
<P>
   His next-door neighbor found one _ a 2-footer _ between their
houses. The neighbor killed it, and that was a proper conclusion to
the snake episode, they seemed to think, but not for me. I'll be
looking for coral snakes under every vine and bush between our Dog
Island beach house and Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you got a lot of woods around your house?'' I asked my
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to like woodpiles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, me, I'm a collector and an enthusiastic acquirer of
woodpiles. But I have never seen a coral snake. All my life I have
heard that they were the most deadly of snakes and usually found in
the South. It didn't keep me out of the pine woods and swamps when
I was growing up, but it made me cautious for years. I finally
stopped looking timorously around me when I moved to North Georgia.
It was my theory, probably erroneous, that coral snakes prefer a
more tropical venue.
</P>
<P>
   Now I don't know what coral snakes fancy. They certainly haven't
any business haunting my friends' woodpile, not with fall coming on
and a good fire in the fireplace one of the joys of a place on the
beach. And to have survived so long ... that snake was 2 feet long!
Everything you read says he is a ``small snake,'' with poisonous
fangs and handsome colors. I don't care if he is diamond-studded, I
want him to stay away from my door.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how when you grow up and the world seems full of
complications, you forget snakes. They were the villains of my
childhood. And yet I wasn't terrified of cottonmouth moccasins when
one would drift by in a coil like an inflatable snake in my
swimming space in the millpond. I would splash water at him and
wait till he had drifted on before I dived in. It was our theory
that it was safe to swim with them because a snake couldn't bite
you underwater. By the time I learned better, I had moved away from
that lovely millpond (it also harbored alligators) and encountered
city swimming pools. They are hybrid structures, not beautiful and
cypress-fringed with lily pads and fragrant white lilies within
reach, but at least they are snake-free.
</P>
<P>
   Or are they? I wouldn't be surprised if a coral snake showed up
in one someday.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters in our family are more civilized about snakes
than I am. They find them interesting and not repulsively
threatening. When they go to the mountains, they actually search
for snakes, interested as they can be if they encounter a
copperhead or a rattler. They have looked up snakes in books (I
usually skip those pages), and they think they know the difference
between the friendly and the poisonous. I don't even aspire to the
friendship of a snake, but they try to instruct me on how to pick
one up and they discuss the way his scaly hide feels as if they are
describing Elizabeth Arden wrinkle cream.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine divorced his wife and married another woman. I
thought I knew why. His wife, who was terrified of snakes herself,
allowed their sons to catch the so-called harmless ones and keep
them as pets in their room. Could you bear to live in a houseful of
snakes?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Georgia's divorce law provides for that as a
grounds for ending a marriage, but it should. I could put up with
possums, and maybe skunks, but either the snake or I would have to
go.

 &HT;    What others say about Robert Prechter and his theory
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Scott Lilienfeld, an Emory University psychologist who teaches
a course on pseudoscience: ``Are these patterns in the data, or in
his head? Given his highly uneven track record in predicting the
rises and falls of the stock market, the latter seems more
likely....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that Prechter is an extremely intelligent and
ingenious individual. Nevertheless, intelligence does not immunize
people against pseudoscientific or unsubstantiated beliefs. To the
contrary, some data suggest that members of Mensa may have even
higher rates of pseudoscientific beliefs than average.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Psychologist Stuart Vyse of Connecticut College: ``Humans are
pattern-seekers, and when we have a theory that we care about, we
seek patterns that support our theory. Intelligent people are
particularly suited to this task. They can take random events and
find a kind of order in them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Phil Larkins, an owner of the Atlanta investment firm Legacy
South: ``Bob Prechter is a bright, cerebral investment professional
who has a keen and passionate grasp of the Elliott Wave Theory.
Unfortunately, when your basic investment forecast has been so
wrong for so long, your credibility will ultimately suffer. In this
business, if you are right, but too early, you are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ricky Harrington, a market analyst for Interstate/Johnson Lane
in Charlotte, N.C.: ``Just because you've been wrong doesn't mean
you don't know what you're talking about. I agree with him that the
bull market is over. I will say, it's dangerous to laugh at Bob
Prechter.''

 &HT;    He predicted problems for Bush, Clinton
 &HT;    (EDS: Sidebar to STOCK-GURU package.)
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bob Prechter is best known in financial circles these
days for gloomy predictions during a record bull market. Several
times during the '90s he was convinced the run-up in stock prices
would end, but wasn't right any of those times.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other, more successful predictions, and a couple
that are yet to be tested:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1982: Predicted in the midst of long bear market that stocks
were about to explode upward. They did, and kept rising for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1987: Warned his newsletter subscribers Oct. 5, 1987, to sell
stocks, two weeks before the biggest one-day stock market crash in
history.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1989: Suggested President Bush might not be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1992: Predicted that President Clinton would leave office in
the middle of a term.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1992: Two years before the Major League strike, predicted that
baseball's popularity would begin to wane.
</P>
<P>
   _ Today: Predicts that the fitness craze will vanish in the next
half-dozen years. ``You'll see people coming up with all kinds of
reasons not to be physically fit. It won't be cool to be fit
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Today: Says basketball has either peaked in popularity or will
soon. ``I'm convinced that this last season, where Michael Jordan
wins in the last second, was probably the peak.''

   GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Fame can be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Bob Prechter was world-famous, the top stock
market forecaster on the globe. Operating from his home on Lake
Lanier, his every utterance made Wall Street roil.
</P>
<P>
   But after correctly predicting the October 1987 crash, his
vision blurred. He forecast a catastrophic drop in stocks and the
worst depression in 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dow Jones average bounced around for a while, then
began the historic climb that peaked at 9,337 in August. All the
while, Prechter stuck to his guns, insisting the end was still
nigh, living in virtual obscurity, a Chicken Little in a big
chicken town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was predictable, my fall in fame,'' he muses, staring at
the image of a spiral-shaped nautilus shell in his office. ``In
fact, I did predict it. Popularity waxes and wanes, as does
everything else in nature. All collective social behavior is
predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the essence, the central notion, of the mathematical
theory known as the Elliott Wave Principle, which Prechter uses to
make all his forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Prechter, 49, is a funny, handsome guy, wired but not outwardly
weird. He's given to brown sandals that make him look like the rock
drummer he once was.
</P>
<P>
   His fall from grace hasn't ruined his life. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, he's still well off, though you wouldn't know it
from the faded 1981 Dodge Ram van he drives. And he has more
privacy. Prechter's profile is so low, in fact, that City Manager
Carlyle Cox says: ``I wouldn't say people know him if they see him
on the street. He's fairly bright. He's not involved in local
politics. Just say he's an upstanding citizen who pretty much keeps
to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been able to help his wife, Robin, a petite, pretty woman,
rear their two handsome teenagers _ daughter Dana, 16, and son
Elliott, 14 _ in relative normalcy. Dana just got her driver's
license, and Elliott, an accomplished athlete, has turned into a
computer buff.
</P>
<P>
   Like many families, they lead hectic lives. But they still find
time to squeeze in Wednesday night dinners at Chef Wang's Chinese
Restaurant, where the talk is of sports, safe driving and music _
not stocks. Robin Prechter, echoing many a busy wife or husband,
says of the Wednesday dinners: ``This is the only way we seem to be
able to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Prechter hasn't just faded away from the prognostication
business. Far from it; he's been working long hours for months on
his latest book, ``The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior,''
which he says will lay out enough proof for his theories to convert
all but the most close-minded skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   He faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   This is typical of what scientists say: ``The human mind has a
tendency to make sense out of nonsense,'' says Emory University
psychologist Scott Lilienfeld, an expert on pseudoscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologists have shown that people will often see meaningful
patterns, even in meaningless data. Prechter is detecting intricate
patterns in the vicissitudes of the stock market, and then fitting
complex mathematical models to account for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such criticisms don't faze Prechter. In fact, his fall from fame
has given him more time to explore his theory's application in
other fields. He still forecasts markets, but has also turned his
interest to researching what makes people tick. He's dived headlong
into the study of neurology, physics, fractal geometry and chaos
and complexity theory _ all of which he claims support the wave
principle.
</P>
<P>
   Now he talks less about finance than the brain's limbic system
and cerebral cortex, the study of which has convinced him that the
wave principle is a universal law of nature _ a long-overlooked
secret of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   He feels his new knowledge will make him a better forecaster
than he was in the 1980s, when he became famous for a long string
of uncanny predictions. At a time when Wall Street was in a state
of despair, he predicted in 1982 that a great bull market was
starting. Everybody scoffed, but he was right. He rode the bull for
five years, jumping off _ again to ridicule _ just two weeks before
1987's Black Monday, the worst one-day stock crash in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of his stardom, his market newsletter, the Elliott
Wave Theorist, rose in circulation to 20,000, at $233 a year.
That's $4.6 million in revenue, just for the newsletter. His fame
fed on itself. He was profiled by The Wall Street Journal, by
Fortune, Time, People, The New York Times, all the major TV
networks, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other outlets. He
appeared on such TV programs as ``Good Morning America'' and ``The
Today Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the market climbed higher and higher after the crash,
incoming phone calls tapered off proportionately. He felt
humiliated when Louis Rukeyser, the host of ``Wall Street Week'' on
PBS, ridiculed him as a tea leaf reader. So he buckled down to find
out how his charts could have been so wrong. He decided it was him,
not them. He made a conscious decision to become, in his words, a
``recluse.'' In 1989, he stopped flying around the world to make
speeches, which gave him backaches anyway, and all but vanished
from Wall Street's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, he set out to rebuild his company, Elliott Wave
International, concentrating on institutional investors, not
individuals, and branching out into other investment areas,
offering advice not just by the month but hourly via the Internet.
He wrote five books.
</P>
<P>
   Though still derided by many on Wall Street, he must be doing
something right, because he now has 70 employees analyzing markets
and advising clients, up from 20 in '87, and leases two floors in a
building on the Gainesville square. After falling to 4,000 a couple
of years ago, his subscriber list has grown again to 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation, he says, will rise again _ the wave principle
tells him so. In fact, Wall Street is starting to show interest in
him again.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 25, Barron's magazine ran a long article on Prechter,
based mostly on a speech he made at an investment conference in New
Orleans. It noted that he's so sure he's right he's changed the
chart on the front of his main newsletter from ``Depression Ahead''
to ``Depression Beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, because of the Dow's recent skid to 7,400 and
subsequent 1,000-point rally, many on Wall Street are starting to
ask: ``What about Bob?'' He's getting more nervous calls from
people who remember his heyday and still consider him a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he is one, as certified by Mensa. But even geniuses,
Prechter concedes, can be wrong. And he's been wrong for a long
time, at least in stocks. But in the long run, he shrugs, it won't
matter. He'll be vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes it's going to be hard to sell science on his
theories, in part because what he preaches sounds like mysticism.
His work builds on that of his own guru, Ralph Elliott, an
accountant who, before he died in
</P>
<P>
   1948, developed ``evidence'' that social behavior explained
stock market gyrations. Elliott believed human progress was
inexorable, moving ahead in waves of alternating optimism and
pessimism that could be measured and predicted.
</P>
<P>
   After studying Elliott's ideas, Prechter became a convert and
took his psychology degree to Wall Street as a forecaster. He
equipped himself with tools Elliott lacked, such as computers and
historical numbers dating back to the South Sea Bubble of 1720,
when equity prices collapsed in Britain, throwing the world into a
64-year bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he claims Elliott's ideas can be used to predict everything
from stock gyrations to cycles of popularity, war and peace. His
newsletters used the same techniques to predict as early as 1989
that George Bush would not be re-elected, that his own star would
flame out, as would Michael Jackson's, that attendance at Major
League baseball games would fall after the '92 season, and, six
years ago, that Bill Clinton would probably be forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Prechter says he can predict the future because people _ like
cattle _ sense how those around them feel. And they react, he
believes, unconsciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impulsive herding behavior of people is something that
comes from the limbic system, the cerebral cortex of the brain,''
he maintains. ``It's not something you think about. There are waves
of cooperation, waves of setback, waves of optimism and pessimism,
waves of adulation, and it's all part of that same herding impulse
that people share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what the focus is. It's still the same
patterns over and over again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another law of nature we need to pay attention to.
It's the reason behind crazes for Beanie Babies, Slinkys or pogo
sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, he urges, get ready for bad times in the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to go down until the year 2003, to below
1,000 on the Dow. We're in the most overvalued market in history.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned that the public is going to get hurt,'' he
says. ``So many people are telling people to put retirement money,
college money, into stocks, into 401(k)s. I think this is terrible.
It's like putting your life savings on a roulette wheel. Except
it's worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Should people sell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' he says. ``I don't own a single share
of stock.''

</P>
<P>
   And so, it's another Thursday night, and I'm driving to Clematis
(derived from the ancient Greek meaning ``all women are 19 and look
like Vendela''), and I'm switching my wide gold ring _ often
mistaken for a wedding band _ from hand to hand.
</P>
<P>
   On the left, no, I'll look married. On the right, no, I'll look
obvious. Back on the left (I'll be more approachable if they think
I'm married), back on the right (why lie?).
</P>
<P>
   So I drop the ring in the ash tray. The minimalist approach. Au
courant.
</P>
<P>
   What I need is a bracelet that says What Would Bridget Jones Do?
(Like those What Would Jesus Do? wristbands some kids are
sporting.) WWBJD?
</P>
<P>
   Jones, you see, is a fictional 30-ish ``Singleton'' _ as she
dubs herself _ created by author Helen Fielding. Bridget Jones's
Diary, a bestseller in England for more than two years, is a
compilation of columns written by Fiel$6$VK$ 3/84e British
newspaper, the Independent.
</P>
<P>
   In the book _ which hit the States this summer _ Jones tallies
daily ``alcohol units,'' cigarettes, calories and lottery tickets.
Occasionally she throws in thigh circumference, panic attacks and
``minutes wanting toZll mother.''
</P>
<P>
   If I were to do it, I'd tally ``Yoo-Hoo units'' (the stuff's so
smooth you can down a whole can in one swig, I swear), number of
catalogs received (enough already with the singing bird clock) and
speeding tickets. Then, I'd throw in thigh circumference, panic
attacks and ``minutes wanting to kill mother.''
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah, number of boyfriends lost between Labor Day and my
birthday, which is Oct. 21. I'm four for four since '94. (Mother:
``Can't you at least get a present out of them first?'')
</P>
<P>
   What Jones fears most is dying alone in an apartment, only to
have her remains found three weeks later half eaten by an Alsatian.
This doesn't concern me because my condo forbids pets.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminists i''EM!''!-

</P>
<P>
   5''UQIQeA9z R,RkKK R) 3/8R.H3unny. ``Only a week till impending
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's Day humiliation,'' Jones whines. ``No way will I get
any cards. Toy with idea of flirting energetically, but will
dismiss as immoral. Will take total indignity on c 7/8 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Also a hoot are Jones' New Year's resolutions: ``I will not
waste money on books by unreadable literary authors to put
impressively on shelves. I will not sulk about having no boyfriend,
but develop inner poise and authority and sense of self as woman of
substance, complete without boyfriend, as best way to obtain
boyfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go to gym three times a week not merely to buy
sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Mine include: ``I will not waste money ordering a la carte, but
will instead choose combo meal. I will nnd sulk about having no
boyfriend, but will slit tires of former amours to reduce stress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will go to gym three times a week not merely to gaze at
bench-pressers.''
</P>
<P>
   However, if I catch one's eye, I'll jot his name (i.e., Beck,
Thorn or Sterling) on my roster of Valentine prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Four months, for me, is more than enough time to rustle up some
cards.

 &HT;    Advice for recent grads: Eliminate debt
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As this year's college graduates settle into the work world, a
powerful thing is happening: They are worrying about money.
</P>
<P>
   Not just about income, which is the usual worry for beginners,
but also about saving, investing and planning far ahead, even to
their retirements. That's new.
</P>
<P>
   We saw platoons of those thoughtful young strivers at The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Money&AMP;More Investment Conference in
September. They hustled from one seminar to the next, took notes
and asked probing questions.
</P>
<P>
   One question that came up repeatedly is this: I've got some
disposable income. Should I use my money to pay down my college
loans faster, or should I start investing for the future?
</P>
<P>
   It is an interesting question, mainly because there is no one
easy answer for every person or family. But the experts I posed the
question to were able to lay out enough ground rules to help most
people find their own answers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what they had to say:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay off credit card debts first. They typically come at very
high interest rates, perhaps 15 percent to 18 percent. That's a
tremendous load to carry around. It is much higher than the cost of
college loans. It also is much higher than you can reasonably hope
to make on investments.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have access to a 401(k) retirement plan, use it. The
main reason is employers typically match part of your contribution.
</P>
<P>
   If you put in 6 percent of your salary, for example, companies
typically put in another 3 percent. Let's say you make $40,000 a
year and put 6 percent, or $200 a month, into a 401(k). In a
typical plan, your employer would add another $100 to your account.
That's a 50 percent gain, and it's a freebie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider the tax consequences of your choices. For example,
federal income taxes are deferred on contributions to a 401(k). You
don't pay the taxes until you start withdrawing money from your
account after age 59 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, starting next year you may be able to get a
tax deduction on interest you pay on student loans. The maximum
deduction during 1998 will be $1,000, and there are other limits.
For a complete rundown on income and other limitations, go to
http://www.usagroup.com
</P>
<P>
   /students/taxbreak.htm on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Each individual will have to figure out how much those factors
would mean in his or her circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decide whether you have enough set aside for emergencies. Most
experts recommend a rainy-day fund big enough to pay your basic
expenses for three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you get fired from your first job, or you find out you
can't bear to do the work. If you have an emergency stash, the job
loss is merely a problem. If you don't have the money, you're in a
crisis. Thus your first priority may be building up your emergency
fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Factor in any major purchases you intend to make. If you plan
to buy a house, for example, lowering your debts can make it easier
to qualify for a mortgage. And the interest on home loans is
deductible, assuming you itemize.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going into an immediate family situation or other
big obligations, I would suggest paying off debt as quickly as you
can,'' said Robert Errico, the president of Alliance Capital's
mutual funds division.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have passed all those hurdles and still have disposable
income, use at least a portion of it to start your investment
program. The sooner you start investing, the more your earnings
will compound.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of motivation. The longer you wait,
the harder it is to start saving. The sooner you start, the quicker
you will see the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once young people see their quarterly statements and see the
balances growing, they want to put even more in,'' observed Charles
Frazier, a certified financial planner in Suwanee. ``I think
encouraging the habit of saving is going to help a lot more over
time than paying off a low-interest loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Errico suggested splitting up disposable income _ using part to
make extra payments on student loans and part to invest. ``It's
important to pay debt down, especially when you're just out of
college and are on your first job,'' he said. ``But even if you can
put away only $25 or $50 or $100 on a regular basis, it instills a
discipline and commitment to long-term investing that will benefit
you.''
</P>
<P>
   All these factors mean there's no single answer for every
individual. But at least they give you a framework for deciding.

 &HT;    Dave Marcis: Still truckin'
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's Saturday morning at North Carolina Motor
Speedway, and the garage area is a circus. Past champions of the AC
Delco 400 are gathering for a photo shoot. Pit crews are dressing
for their annual contest to see who can change tires the fastest.
Mechanics are tinkering with their cars for the next day's race,
and some of the drivers are being interviewed by television
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Marcis has his hands full, too. His No. 71 Chevrolet has
been loaded into his hauler, which is trying to back out from the
remote area where NASCAR's have-nots must park _ back behind the
Union 76 fuel pumps, where one vendor is selling ear plugs for $1
from his truck.
</P>
<P>
   Marcis' 71 car was too slow to make the 42-car Delco field, but
he's still working, bouncing from one team truck to another,
looking for parts, information, anything that will keep him from
going through this early-exit routine again.
</P>
<P>
   Team Realtree is Team RealUnlucky. The only traffic it can beat
these days is that leaving the race track. A week earlier, Marcis
went to Phoenix and failed to qualify for the Dura Lube/Kmart 500.
This season, he qualified only 12 times in 31 tries.
</P>
<P>
   But there is always next week. And this week is next week.
Atlanta. Fresh opportunity. It's enough to restore Marcis'
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some great races in Atlanta over the years,'' Marcis
said. ``I won the race there in the fall of '76, led the majority
of the laps that day, I think. We were racing David Pearson that
day very hard in the K&AMP;K Insurance Dodge. I expect to do well
there. We're going to have a Hendrick engine. I hope that helps us.
We got our car in pretty good shape to go to Atlanta. It's been a
good race track for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon was five years old when Marcis had that memorable
Atlanta run. Marcis has no trouble remembering his victories; he
has had five since he began his Winston Cup career in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   But he does have a wonderful history at Atlanta Motor Speedway _
the victory in '76, two seconds ('75, behind Buddy Baker; '78,
behind Bobby Allison), a third ('78, behind Donnie Allison and
Richard Petty) and a fourth ('80).
</P>
<P>
   He's won only once more since the Atlanta race, but Marcis
retains the spirit of '76. He still finds silver linings amid the
darkest of storm clouds.
</P>
<P>
   At 57, he is the last of the independents, a one-car operation
owned with his wife, Helen. They have no chance, really, against
the megabucks multi-car teams. In his black leather wingtipped
shoes and disappearing silver hair, Marcis fits the role as
stock-car racing relic. He gets by on his wingtips and a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   His first NASCAR race was the 1968 Daytona 500. His best year
was 1975, when he finished second to Petty in the Winston Cup
standings. Since 1983, he has been in 419 races with these results:
two third-places finishes, three fourths and a fifth. He last won a
pole in 1981, last won a race in 1982 at Richmond, 459 races ago.
</P>
<P>
   His best finish this year was 12th at Talladega, in the Winston
500 three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Marcis crew, in fact, has become quite efficient in packing
up early. Yet when he fails to qualify, the team seems stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, crew chief Lee Leslie slumped against the front tire
of their car in the garage at the Rockingham track, looked at
Marcis, shook his head and wondered why they had the slowest
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm puzzled as to what the other guys do to pick up (speed)
and I can't,'' Marcis said. ``I practiced in the first session at
24-flat, basically, and the second session at 24-flat and I
qualified at 24-flat. I don't know. I'm holding my own, but I'm not
improving. I can't seem to come up with what it is they do to
improve for qualifying. I just don't know where I'm coming up
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating. I'm pulling my hair out, and I don't
have a lot to pull out. I don't know what way to turn. I mean, you
can't hardly work no more hours during the week than what we work,
trying to have things right.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the first hour and 15 minutes of practice, we
were the 19th quickest car, and that's respectable. However, we
didn't gain anything in the second session. And we made several
pretty good changes, but we don't seem to be able to pick up. So,
it's quite puzzling to us as to why or what's happening. I just
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcis' sponsor, a company that makes hunting camouflage,
announced last week it was renewing its deal. ``But nobody's happy
when we miss the show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The folks at Team Realtree have been really great sticking
with us,'' Marcis said. ``We expect to be together next year. But I
am plagued with qualifying problems. We are working on them. I
guess we're going to try to get more aggressive on our qualifying
engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport has changed drastically since I got into it. All the
emphasis nowadays is in qualifying. The race has become sort of
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA has John Glenn. NASCAR has Dave Marcis, the only driver to
have been behind the wheel in the '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s. When
he started racing, perhaps 35 of the active 40 drivers were
independents who ran their own shop. But NASCAR evolved intoteam
racing, and Marcis was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   He always has gotten by on a shoestring. He has eight employees
and competes with borrowed engines. In comparison, there are 35
employees on Gordon's championship team and an inventory of 300
engines at Hendrick Motorsports. Some teams invest more in research
than Marcis does on his entire operation.
</P>
<P>
   Marcis has won $6 million in his career. Gordon has won that
much this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dave and Helen lived in a trailer the first 24 years of their
marriage. They finally bought a house near Asheville, N.C., in
1990. He put two kids through college.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are days when you say to yourself, `Is it worth it?' or
`I'm tired of this deal; I'm not competitive.' It's hard to keep
going,'' Marcis said. ``But then there are days when you run
really, really good. Those are the good days and the fun days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess sometimes I look at the situation and I say, `What am
I doing? Why am I fighting this thing?' But I've got five Winston
Cup wins and 14 pole positions, and I've had a good career. There's
a lot of guys out there today with big teams and big money behind
them that still don't have any wins.''

 &HT;    Finally, I conquered A piece of the rock/Oregon rock climbing
 &HT;    (EDS: Sidebars below story.)
 &HT;    By Jennifer Podis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I'm pinching a chicken head (more on
this later) with an excruciating force between my thumb and
forefinger.
</P>
<P>
   My 110 pounds teeter on my right big toe, the edge of which is
clinging, no ... sticking to a slight bump on what I swear is an
otherwise smooth, vertical rock wall.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty feet below me are piles of more rocks and boulders and a
hot, hard ground. Above is the rest of the tortuous stone face and
an intense azure sky.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, vacation.
</P>
<P>
   An insatiable yen for adventure has taken me to central Oregon
for two days of climbing at Smith Rock State Park. Towering walls
of volcanic rock make this one of the best places to climb in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Why spend $165 a day for a private guide to help me climb a
bunch of rocks? Maybe it was the vivid memory of a monthlong
session at survival school when I was 15. Or maybe I just never
outgrew the childhood desire to climb over obstacles instead of
going around them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was, at age 31, I found myself on a wall at On The
Rocks climbing gym in Riviera Beach. And after testing my strength
and nerve (with cushioning below), it was time to face the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the small town of Terrebone, Ore., on Highway 97, I
see the rust-and-orange peaks of Smith Rock jutting above an arid
pasture. They look like an irregular heartbeat on a long, flat EKG
line.
</P>
<P>
   I pull my rental car into the park, where, for $4 a night, I can
pitch my tent and camp for the two nights I'm here. The campground
hosts about 40 campers, a roguish group, all of whom understand the
allure of the rock.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers wrap bandannas about their heads and wear tattered
T-shirts and battered hiking boots. Ropes and metal rings hang from
their backpacks, and their hands and knees bear the scars of battle
with the unforgiving rock. Their duffel bags bulge with clothes and
climbing gear, food and toiletries. I want to be like them.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to face ``Spiderman,'' our first climbing route.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m., I meet Tom Broxson of First Ascent Climbing Services,
my guide for the two days, and Mary Galloway, a beginner like
myself. We hoist our packs onto our shoulders and set out on the 1
1/2-mile hike to our destination.
</P>
<P>
   When I first see the cliffs from the road, I think I'm
approaching them at their base. When I enter the park, I'm stunned
by the canyon that drops a couple hundred feet to the aptly named
Crooked River.
</P>
<P>
   Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can. I certainly
could use a few extra legs right now. This route is rated 5.7 in
the Yosemite Decimal System scale, which is considered a beginner
climb, but it might as well be Mount Everest from my point of view.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder whether Spiderman, and all the other routes - some
called Heinous Cling and Widow Maker - were named to entertain or
to intimidate climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where we get our first and only structured lesson. Mary
and I will be top-rope climbing - that's when an anchor is rigged
at the top of the climb. A climbing rope runs up through the anchor
and back down to the ground. One end is attached to a harness that
wraps around the climber's waist and legs. The other is controlled
by the ``belayer,'' the person responsible for making sure the
climber doesn't fall.
</P>
<P>
   I look high up the rock to the anchor, which is a couple of
bolts drilled into the wall, and then at the belay device, called
an ATC or Air Traffic Controller (a real confidence-builder), which
fits in the palm of my hand. Whose idea was this, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, who's first?'' Tom cheerfully asks.
</P>
<P>
   That's it? What happened to the lesson in how to rock-climb?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're best at climbing when you turn your head off and let
your body flow,'' he says. ``It's intuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh-huh, sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me,'' he says, ``Climbers are more receptive to hints
and suggestions when they're at a standstill - when they're
stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. Just what I hoped not to be.
</P>
<P>
   But this is what I've come here for, so no being a sissy. I'll
go first.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting off the ground onto Spiderman is difficult. I have
to lift my right foot waist-high and squeeze my toes into a crack.
Then I have to hop up from the ground with my left foot in order to
grab a secure hold that's about 12 inches out of reach. But I'm on
the wall!
</P>
<P>
   I become instantly and completely focused. I shut out the entire
environment around me - the spectacular view of the gorge, other
climbers on nearby routes and the voices of Tom and Mary below. The
only outside influence I'm aware of is the taut rope attached at my
waist. It is a comforting feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as I want to display finesse and grace while
advancing up the rock, I can't. My moves are clumsy and insecure,
as insecure as I'm beginning to feel about my ability to reach the
top.
</P>
<P>
   I'm looking for large knobs to grasp and gaping footholds,
because, after all, this is a beginner's route. There aren't any.
Panic spreads, like goosebumps across skin. I think of the cliche
``stuck between a rock and a hard place'' with an entirely new
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   With each maneuver, I am afraid to slip. It's not that I don't
trust my belayer, Mary, to save me. It's that I don't trust my two
fingers jammed into a quarter-sized pocket, or a single toe bearing
my full weight on a knob no bigger than the toe itself.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Now I've reached the point where I don't want to be. Stuck.
Fatigue cripples my arms and numbs my fingernails. Muscle spasms
set in, and my leg begins to tremble.
</P>
<P>
   I'm 50 feet up, but my profanities still echo to the ground. I
guess Tom decides that I've reached that point where suggestions
might help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead and grab that edge, then smear the rock, and you'll
be able to reach a good toehold with your right foot,'' he shouts.
</P>
<P>
   I look again across the angular fragments to which I am clinging
like Spider-Man himself. I am not going to fail.
</P>
<P>
   So I ``smear'' the rock - I point my feet up the face and brace
myself so that I actually ``adhere'' to the rock. (Here, I discover
the benefit of the specialized climbing shoe, which has a sticky
rubber sole.)
</P>
<P>
   It works! I reach that toehold and find another secure knob to
grasp. I literally inch my way up the rest of the wall, and, in
what feels like an hour but is really only about 20 minutes, I make
it 100 feet to the top.
</P>
<P>
   The top, however, is not a ledge at the top of the wall. It is,
instead, where the climb ends at the anchor in the middle of the
rock face.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I am overwhelmed by my pure strength and grit. And
I feel pride, with the same passion I did 16 years ago on my very
first climb in survival school.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my other climbs this time include Scary Llamas (5.8),
Bunny Face (5.7) and Five-Gallon Buckets (5.7). And on In Harm's
Way (5.7), I came face to face with the chicken heads: knobs no
bigger than 1/4-inch across.
</P>
<P>
   As I pinch them, they bite into my fingertips. All I want to do
is lean back and let Tom lower me to the ground. Yet his gentle
cajoling keeps me going.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberation, patience and sheer grit coax me to the top. I
would whoop with bravado up here, were I not so whipped.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: That cheese grater really hurt!
</P>
<P>
   Before you hit the cliffs, learn some rock-speak:
</P>
<P>
   ATC (AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER) _ A Belay device (ropes and a hook)
that keep you from falling
</P>
<P>
   BOMBER, OR BOMB-PROOF _ Fail-safe (as in a very solid anchor)
</P>
<P>
   CHEESE GRATER _ A fall on something that's not completely
vertical
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN HEAD _ A small knob protruding from the rock wall
</P>
<P>
   LOGGING AIR TIME _ Falling
</P>
<P>
   GOBIS _ Hand abrasions
</P>
<P>
   HANGDOG _ When a leader of the climb rests on the equipment,
then continues on without lowering back to the ground
</P>
<P>
   MANKY _ Opposite of bomber, not fail-safe
</P>
<P>
   WHIPPER OR SCREAMER _ A bad fall
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR: Rock your world
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of ways to educate, train and prepare for
your climbing experience:

<P>
   A climbing gym is an excellent place to learn basic climbing
techniques and how to use climbing equipment, as well as to
practice in a less intimidating environment.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiovascular fitness is important for strength and endurance
in climbing, and can be accomplished in a number of ways, including
running, biking, swimming and stair-climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching exercises will help increase your flexibility, and
weight training will build muscle and contribute to overall
conditioning. You rely heavily on the latissimus dorsi, or
``lats,'' in climbing, but since the chest, trapezius and
abdominals function together with them, they all should be
strengthened to provide a balanced muscle group. Most important,
this will help prevent injury. It's also important to work the
forearms.

<P>
   If you go to Smith Rock State Park
</P>
<P>
   About the area: Smith Rock State Park is located in a
geographical region of Oregon known as the `high desert.' It lies
just east of the Cascade mountain range and, therefore, is spared
the infamous rainstorms of the Pacific Northwest coast by this
natural barrier. The park is about 135 miles southeast of Portland,
outside the small town of Terrebone. The larger city of Bend, which
is considered home to the climbing community, is 27 miles south of
Terrebone.

you can camp in the park's bivouac area for $4 a night (includes
entrance fee into the park), which even offers well-maintained
bathroom and shower facilities. ... There is no lodging in
Terrebone, so you'll need to travel to Redmond or Bend. In Redmond,
there are about a dozen choices, with an average cost of $45. For
more information call the Redmond Chamber of Commerce, (541)
923-5191. ... You'll find a complete selection of motels, hotels
and bed-and-breakfasts in Bend, which is the recreational and
economic hub of Central Oregon. For more information, call the Bend
Area Chamber/Visitor &AMP; Convention Bureau, (541) 382-3221.

 &HT;    Stock exchange tour offers a bird's-eye view of capitalism at
work
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``And on Wall Street today ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Is that where you tune out, too?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. You've heard enough about the stock market to know
that ``bull'' means good, ``bear'' means bad and ``Alan Greenspan''
means ``Calm down, already.''
</P>
<P>
   You wonder why the people at the New York Stock Exchange are
clutching slips of paper and pushing each other. Maybe you own
stock. Maybe you make jokes about calling your broker. But you
really don't have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   Come take the tour. It's free.
</P>
<P>
   Can you get up early? If you want to see the day's opening bell,
they suggest you get to the ticket booth on Broad Street before 9
a.m. The booth is on the same block as the exchange, a little to
the south.
</P>
<P>
   Take the ticket and head around the back of the building. Wait
in line to have your bags X-rayed. Listen to the repeated requests
of ``no photos, please.'' Follow the group into a glassed-in area
that looks over the main room of the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Worm your way to the window. The headphones have explanations of
what you see in English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese
and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   As you wait for the 9:30 a.m. opening bell, you listen to facts
about the stock exchange. You learn that 3,000 people work here,
that more than 3,000 corporations are listed and that the workday
is
</P>
<P>
   6 1/2 hours long.
</P>
<P>
   You learn that in less than three minutes, 8 million shares of
stock can change hands. You can think of them as mini-auctions
happening all over the floor. The average transaction lasts 22
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Out the window and to your left you will see the balcony where
they ring the bell. Sometimes famous people ring it. Rosie
O'Donnell rang it the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, it is the CEO of the Orix Corp., a Japanese company
that is about to be listed on the exchange for the first time. That
means the men and rare women on the floor below can now buy and
sell Orix stock.
</P>
<P>
   Two men on the balcony with the CEO are wearing bright red wigs
and Japanese costumes and playing drum and flute. They are
celebrating the opening. A few weeks ago there was a lion on the
balcony, when the people from the MGM Grand rang the bell.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there is no longer a bell to ring. As the clock
reaches 9:30 a.m., the CEO presses a button to activate the sound.
The people on the balcony have been applauding for the last
half-minute.
</P>
<P>
   The people on the floor do not change stride. You notice that
some wear color-coded jackets. Clerks wear blue. Floor supervisors
wear green. You are now asked to leave the room so the next group
can come in.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the short film on the stock market, which is pretty much
an advertisement. You learn that the New York Stock Exchange is a
corporation, too. You watch a little girl in the film hug her teddy
bear and look up at the stock exchange building as music plays.
</P>
<P>
   You are free to wander, to look at the time line that tells you
that the stock market is more than 200 years old. You learn that in
1792, 24 men set up the stock exchange under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the different interactive displays and look at the
stock exchange Web site. You can buy a souvenir bull ($24.95) or
bear ($15.95) in the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Head outside and talk to the brokers on their smoke breaks. If
you are a woman, ignore the winks. ``Women have it tough,'' a clerk
explains. ``They walk in and 800 heads turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to one of the new guys, a runner who takes the paper slips
back and forth. ``I've been here a month,'' he says. ``I've worked
in restaurants, and it's sort of like that. You're always behind
but you're always working.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guys get pranked, he says. You get sent to look for the
box of upticks or downticks, which aren't objects at all. They're
slang. Or you are sent to find the keys to the clearinghouse, which
doesn't exist either.
</P>
<P>
   If you work on the stock exchange, you can't use hand signals to
say ``buy'' or ``sell,'' they say. You can't get caught cursing, or
you can be fined or suspended. In certain jobs, you can't ask
others how the market is doing.
</P>
<P>
   So how is the market doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going down,'' one clerk says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' his smoke buddy says.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange visitors' gallery is at the corner
of Wall Street and Broad Street. The center is open from 9 a.m. to
3:30 p.m. Call (212) 656-5168.

what you see in English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese
and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   As you wait for the 9:30 a.m. opening bell, you listen to facts
about the stock exchange. You learn that 3,000 people work here,
that more than 3,000 corporations are listed and that the workday
is
</P>
<P>
   6 1/2 hours long.
</P>
<P>
   You learn that in less than three minutes, 8 million shares of
stock can change hands. You can think of them as mini-auctions
happening all over the floor. The average transaction lasts 22
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Out the window and to your left you will see the balcony where
they ring the bell. Sometimes famous people ring it. Rosie
O'Donnell rang it the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, it is the CEO of the Orix Corp., a Japanese company
that is about to be listed on the exchange for the first time. That
means the men and rare women on the floor below can now buy and
sell Orix stock.
</P>
<P>
   Two men on the balcony with the CEO are wearing bright red wigs
and Japanese costumes and playing drum and flute. They are
celebrating the opening. A few weeks ago there was a lion on the
balcony, when the people from the MGM Grand rang the bell.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there is no longer a bell to ring. As the clock
reaches 9:30 a.m., the CEO presses a button to activate the sound.
The people on the balcony have been applauding for the last
half-minute.
</P>
<P>
   The people on the floor do not change stride. You notice that
some wear color-coded jackets. Clerks wear blue. Floor supervisors
wear green. You are now asked to leave the room so the next group
can come in.
</P>
<P>
   Watch the short film on the stock market, which is pretty much
an advertisement. You learn that the New York Stock Exchange is a
corporation, too. You watch a little girl in the film hug her teddy
bear and look up at the stock exchange building as music plays.
</P>
<P>
   You are free to wander, to look at the time line that tells you
that the stock market is more than 200 years old. You learn that in
1792, 24 men set up the stock exchange under a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the different interactive displays and look at the
stock exchange Web site. You can buy a souvenir bull ($24.95) or
bear ($15.95) in the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Head outside and talk to the brokers on their smoke breaks. If
you are a woman, ignore the winks. ``Women have it tough,'' a clerk
explains. ``They walk in and 800 heads turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk to one of the new guys, a runner who takes the paper slips
back and forth. ``I've been here a month,'' he says. ``I've worked
in restaurants, and it's sort of like that. You're always behind
but you're always working.''
</P>
<P>
   The new guys get pranked, he says. You get sent to look for the
box of upticks or downticks, which aren't objects at all. They're
slang. Or you are sent to find the keys to the clearinghouse, which
doesn't exist either.
</P>
<P>
   If you work on the stock exchange, you can't use hand signals to
say ``buy'' or ``sell,'' they say. You can't get caught cursing, or
you can be fined or suspended. In certain jobs, you can't ask
others how the market is doing.
</P>
<P>
   So how is the market doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going down,'' one clerk says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' his smoke buddy says.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange visitors' gallery is at the corner
of Wall Street and Broad Street. The center is open from 9 a.m. to
3:30 p.m. Call (212) 656-5168.

   1. YOUNG VOICES OF IRAN .... THE POST-KHOMEINI GENERATION
Sixty-five per cent of Iran's population is 25 or younger, and most
of these young people want normal, Western lives. In a country
where it is illegal to hold hands in public or watch foreign
television, that's revolutionary. By Elaine Sciolino. From The New
York Times Magazine. Full-length (2,800 words) + edited article
available. 2. AMERICA'S HOLLOW HEGEMONY Exhausted by its long
struggle with the Soviet Union, without fears of war or depression,
America still wants to transform the world, but not to work the
transformation itself - or to pay for it. America is full of
unilateral declarations, righteous rhetoric and spasmodic
interventions. Economic sanctions and air power have become the
indispensable handmaidens of U.S. foreign policy because they offer
gratification without commitment. Washington is eager to lead on
any problem that can be solved quickly and on the cheap. Just as
the world admits that the American dream is their dream too,
America has lost interest. By Fareed Zakaria. From The New York
Times Magazine. Full-length (4,000 words) + edited article
available. 3. EUROBASHING IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE American
commentators castigate their European allies as economic dinosaurs,
hopelessly incoherent in their foreign policy and shamefully
irresponsible in their duties to NATO. As Europe prepares to launch
its single currency, U.S. critics have found yet another target.
But smug assumptions of American supremacy are wildly overdone.
Europe's economies are robust and their cooperation increasingly
productive. Today's Eurobashing endangers the transatlantic
relationship as much as European anti-Americanism once did. America
should address its own inconsistencies in foreign policy while
granting its European partners the respect they deserve. By William
Wallace and Jan Zielonka. Foreign Affairs magazine. 2,000 words. 4.
'SUNSHINE' JOURNALISM Some news organizations are responding to
complaints about their negative focus by publishing more good news.
The trend includes civic journalism, so-called feel-good stories
and solution columns. On TV, it takes the form of admissibility
standards for crime coverage. Right now, this journalism is on the
fringes of the mainstream media culture, burdened with sceptics and
the perception that the public finds it more snooze-worthy than
newsworthy. Yet what is at stake here is something as fundamental
as the definition of news - as well as the long-term survival of
the business that packages and delivers it. By Mark Jurkowitz. From
The Boston Globe Magazine. Full-length (2,800 words) + edited
article available. 5. THE WOMEN WHO FEED AFRICA In a few weeks'
time, 16 months of hard work by the inhabitants of Bagadadji will
culminate in their first big rice harvest. It will mark a memorable
victory over the malnutrition that has long been endemic in this
village of 500 inhabitants in the heart of Casamance. In this part
of Senegal, rice-growing has always been an exclusively female
responsibility. The women have been aided in their task by
Vietnamese agronomists. This year the Food and Agriculture
Organization has chosen to highlight the key role played by women
in agriculture. It says that women produce 60-80 per cent of basic
foodstuffs in sub-Saharan Africa. By Philippe Bernand. From Le
Monde. 1,800 words. (English translation available.)

DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY GONE HAYWIRE: HOAX AND REALITY Review by
Scott O. Lilienfield of the book ``Hoax and Reality : The Bizarre
World of Multiple Personality Disorder'' by August Piper Jr.
Psychologist Lilienfeld describes Piper's book as ``provocative and
superbly written'' as it traces the root of multiple personality
disorder to the diagnostic and treatment practices of clinicians,
expectations communicated by the media, and widely available
information regarding MPD's diagnostic features. From Skeptical
Inquirer magazine. 1,500 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
HISTORY IS NOT BUNK There is nothing unusual about Russia's flawed
transition, it repeats the experience of many other weak states
plundered by their own corrupt elites. Utopian capitalist
ideologues, inside and outside Russia, have made things worse by
justifying corruption in the name of the greater free market good.
By Anatol Lieven. From Prospect Magazine. 2,000 words. (N/A U.K.)

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 3. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gruesome refiguring of the Central American toll for Hurricane
Mitch _ now revised to be upwards of 7,000 deaths _ leads at USA
Today, the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post leads with the news that the Washington D.C.
financial control board will redelegate most of the local
government's executive powers _ stripped from Marion Barry _ back
to the new mayor chosen Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Post's top nonlocal story is that the Supreme Court has
agreed to review the criminal statute banning a wide range of
gratuities to public officials. The statute was used to convict
Sun-Diamond Growers for its largesse towards former Secretary of
Agriculture Mike Espy, a conviction that was then overturned.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what exactly must the link be between a gift and any
subsequent act by the official receiving it before it constitutes
an illegal quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit by Mitch were Honduras and Nicaragua. The papers all
quote the president of Honduras' on-scene assessment: ``There are
corpses everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The NYT reports that mudslides were a big killer, quoting a
Nicaraguan rescue worker saying he could do nothing for the people
buried in the debris he could hear begging for help. The Times says
at least five Nicaraguan villages were ``entombed'' by the slides.
The LAT reports that 70 percent of Honduras' crops were destroyed.
The NYT says it's 70 percent of the country's entire infrastructure
that was wiped out. By Monday, the LAT reports, the region was
experiencing food shortages and price gouging. USAT says that if
the death count is confirmed, Mitch will end up as the second
deadliest Central American storm ever.
</P>
<P>
   USAT and the LAT front fresh Commerce Department data showing
that in September, Americans spent more money than they earned _
$100.20 going out, explains the LAT, for every $100 that came in.
The papers report that this hasn't happened in ages. (USAT says
it's been at least 50 years, the LAT says 65.)
</P>
<P>
   The consensus explanation is that the roaring stock market has
made people feel more prosperous and willing to spend. The LAT
quotes this economic analysis from a man who just dropped $170 on
sweaters at the Burbank GAP: ``If all the consumers keep getting
more and more into debt and keep spending, nothing bad is going to
happen....''
</P>
<P>
   The NYT, and WP front the much-awaited playing in court Tuesday
of the Bill Gates deposition videotape. The LAT and USAT put the
story on their business section fronts. The Wall Street Journal
flags it in its front-page news box. The NYT finds that in his
confrontation with DOJ lead attorney David Boies, Gates was
``evasive and uninformed, pedantic and taciturn,'' (USAT and WSJ
also opt for ``evasive''), and observes that when confronted with
company e-mail he'd authored, he frequently said he did not
recognize the messages or recall the circumstances behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The Times and WSJ observe that sometimes Boies' questions were
met by more than 20 seconds of silence before Gates responded. The
Post notes that Gates-on-video is a staple of Microsoft trade show
presentations, but in the court tape there was this difference:
Gates was a ``scowling, slouching man.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers note that much of Monday's questioning focused on
whether or not Microsoft threatened canceling its version of
``Office'' software for the Macintosh as a means of forcing Apple
to promote MS's Internet browser. The Post and Journal report that
at one point Boies showed Gates an e-mail sent to him by a
Microsoft executive that said, ``Mac Office is the perfect club to
use on them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post doesn't give Gates' account of that e-mail, but USAT
says he testified that he didn't recall receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT front reports that the federal government has chosen an
odd way to save some money: By eliminating the only program
designed to test the ability of the nation's commercial nuclear
plants to protect themselves against terrorists. The program was
established after the Gulf War and, reports the LAT, had in its
short lifespan identified serious security lapses at 47 percent of
the nation's 104 commercial nuclear reactors. For instance, in one
mock attack, an agency team was able to simulate bringing about a
core meltdown. And last March, an inspector was able to smuggle a
fake pistol into the nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the shutdown? The LAT suggests it's that the
nuclear power industry doesn't like shouldering the extra cost of
participating in the security exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the videotape: The WSJ makes it seem that Bill Gates may
have been influenced by another famous testifier named Bill. When
asked by David Boies if Microsoft was competing with an Apple video
technology, the paper reports that Gates answered, ``Depends on
what you mean by compete.''

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ It has come to this: An old friend from their
high school days is suing President Clinton for slander because he
has said he didn't have sex with her. That's ``didn't,'' as in
``did not.'' (Tom Teepen is national correspondent for Cox
Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ I have no doubt that almost all of us can see
through the word-twisting and planted innuendoes of today's
American politics. But I'm not so sure about the people who appear
on the Jerry Springer show, for example. Who are they and why do
they act in the manner they do? Are they the ones who elected
people to Congress, to City Hall, or to the bench? (Howard
Kleinberg is a columnist for Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.

<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN _ MONTE CARLO TO MILAN _ Everyone knows Monaco's
real-life fairy tale of love and romance, movie queen marries

between Monte Carolo and Milan. Close your eyes and it's as if you
were listening to Greta Garbo. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED
MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ What was long suspected is true. DNA
tests prove that our third president, Thomas Jefferson, fathered at
least one child with his young slave, Sally Hemings. Like most of
us, he held higher standards for others than for himself. (Arnold
Rosenfeld is editor-in-chief of Cox Newspapers.) MOVED.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Come on out and we'll go
camping in the mountains,'' she says. ``We'll sleep on the ground
and cook over an open fire,'' she says. No trace of a giggle and
it's not as if she doesn't know better. She's seen me in action.
``You want me to come to spider heaven and sleep out in the
woods?'' I ask in disbelief. She assures me there will be no bugs
where we're going. I ask for proof. ``You've got a contract with
Terminix? They're going to tent the mountain and fog it?''

   LETTER-SWEATERS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After practice last
week, three Cardinal Newman High School football players got a
lesson in ancient high school history. The chapter about earning a
letter. Way back when, only boys could earn letters and in very few
sports. There was a Lettermen's Club. Letter sweaters. Football
players were Big Men on Campus. Every campus. They swaggered. Girls
swooned. The three kids hear this and offer a quizzical look, that
cocked-head gaze that comes when teens hear how it used to be. That
enduring rite of passage _ earning a letter _ is nothing like it
used to be. Not even close. (Lomartire, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MARIANNE-WILLIAMSON _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The desire to

power of love, Marianne Williamson, comes to West Palm Beach
Thursday. (Gushee, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   DIGITAL-PIANO _ LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ William Coakley flew to
London last year to sit in a recording studio and listen to a most
remarkable sound: the grand Steinway piano from Palm Beach
Community College. It was remarkable because the Steinway was back
in Lake Worth. Only Coakley's fussy brilliance with computers
allowed its rich tones to join a recording by members of the London
Philharmonic. Coakley isn't the first to electronically reproduce
the sound of a piano. But his gold-color CDs may be the first to
satisfy the music industry's most critical ears. (Kalajian, Palm

   SIBLEY-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ A friend of mine who has a house down
on the Gulf Coast not too far from Panama City was delayed in
returning home a couple of weeks ago by a coral snake. His
next-door neighbor found one _ a 2-footer _ between their houses.
The neighbor killed it, and that was a proper conclusion to the
snake episode, they seemed to think, but not for me. I'll be
looking for coral snakes under every vine and bush between our Dog
Island beach house and Acapulco. (Sibley, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   TRAVEL-KEYS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I was halfway to
Summerland Key when I realized I had forgotten to bring shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Green flip-flops hung on my feet and from the strap of my green
backpack, a pair of sports sandals. As it turned out, they were
enough. In the Keys, shoes are extraneous. (Rivers, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ROCKCLIMB _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ I'm pinching a
chicken head (more on this later) with an excruciating force
between my thumb and forefinger. My 110 pounds teeter on my right
big toe, the edge of which is clinging, no ... sticking to a slight
bump on what I swear is an otherwise smooth, vertical rock wall.
Fifty feet below me are piles of more rocks and boulders and a hot,
hard ground. Above is the rest of the tortuous stone face and an
intense azure sky. Ah, vacation. (Podis, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   TRAVEL-STOCKEXCHANGE _ NEW YORK _ ``And on Wall Street today ...
`` Is that where you tune out, too? You've heard enough about the
stock market to know that ``bull'' means good, ``bear'' means bad
and ``Alan Greenspan'' means ``Calm down, already.'' You wonder why
the people at the New York Stock Exchange are clutching slips of
paper and pushing each other. Maybe you own stock. Maybe you make
jokes about calling your broker. But you really don't have a clue.
Come take the tour. It's free. (Anna, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   RANDY-NEWMAN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Singer-songwriter Randy
Newman is resigned that his 1977 hit Short People may be his legacy
as a pop star. ``If I died tomorrow, my tombstone would say:
`Composer of Short People and others.' That's the way it is,'' says
Newman. (Benarde, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MARS-VENUS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You know you've heard of it
_ the whole Mars/Venus
intergalactic-gender-warfare-why-can't-we-all-just-get-along deal.
Well, it was created by romance swami John Gray, whose first book _
Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus in 1992 _ gave rise to five
spinoffs. Nowadays, he has videos, seminars, CD-ROMs, counseling
centers, audio tapes and a steady gig on Oprah. Who'd have guessed
this guy is a former Hindu monk who practiced celibacy for nine
years? (Grantham, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

``You want me to come to spider heaven and sleep out in the

   LETTER-SWEATERS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ After practice last

lesson in ancient high school history. The chapter about earning a
letter. Way back when, only boys could earn letters and in very few
sports. There was a Lettermen's Club. Letter sweaters. Football
players were Big Men on Campus. Every campus. They swaggered. Girls
swooned. The three kids hear this and offer a quizzical look, that

TALKING TO GRADE SCHOOL GIRLS ABOUT PUBERTY AND SEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Deanna Socaris is prepared. The 10-year-old knows
she's growing up and doesn't want any surprises.
</P>
<P>
   So she paid close attention when health educator Pam Skripak
talked about puberty and periods at a recent Upper Hudson Planned
Parenthood workshop for moms and their budding 9- and 10-year-old
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that's too young to talk to your grade-schooler,
think again.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a dialogue between parents and children has never been
more important, experts say. Girls, in particular, are maturing
earlier than they did in the past. At the same time, they are
getting more candid information and sexual imagery through
television, movies, magazines and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents get a little blind-sided by how quickly it happens to
girls,'' said Dr. Timothy Landis, the assistant chief of adolescent
psychiatry at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, the average age at which girls
started menstruating was 15. Today, doctors say it's closer to 12.
Although the age of first menses hasn't changed much in recent
decades, experts say other developmental changes, like breasts and
pubic hair, appear earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide study of 17,000 girls published last year in
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Pediatrics Association,
revealed that nearly half of all black girls and 15 percent of
white girls had started developing breasts and pubic hair by age 8.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the physical changes occur even earlier, with 3
percent of black girls and 1 percent of white girls showing signs
of sexual development as early as the age of 3, a condition known
as ``precocious puberty.''
</P>
<P>
   The study did not look at boys and researchers say there's no
evidence that the age of puberty for boys, usually around 12, has
changed significantly.
</P>
<P>
   When girls develop earlier than most of their peers, ``it
complicates things enormously,'' Landis said. ``While their bodies
are developing quickly, their ability to reason, think and plan for
the future develops less quickly. ``You have all the adult
possibility for sexuality, pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease,
yet the child is still thinking and acting as if she is still a
child.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have only theories as to why the overall age of
puberty appears to be dropping for girls. In blacks, there's been
some speculation that hair products used by the young girls may be
to blame because they contain the female hormone estrogen. Others
cite growth hormones and estrogen-like substances in everything
from chicken to plastic wrap.
</P>
<P>
   While the link to those types of environmental factors is
unclear, physicians believe that recent improvements in nutrition
may offer a partial explanation as does better access to medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that when a girl's percentage of body fat reaches
between 18 to 22 percent, the body begins producing the hormone
leptin, which triggers the brain to start the mechanisms for
puberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have normal pubetal development, it's very
important you have a normal weight to height,'' said Dr. Lauren
Lipeski, a pediatric endocrinologist at Albany Medical Center.
``Certainly, obesity is likely to increase your risk'' of early
puberty, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet parents shouldn't believe that weight alone will determine
when puberty starts.
</P>
<P>
   Another predictor is family history, according to Dr. Harry
Miller, a pediatrician with Kaiser Permanente.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother's age of first menarche (period) is fairly
predictive of when the daughter is going to start,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every child is different and puberty is very much an
individual event. The process usually begins with ``secondary'' sex
changes, such as budding breasts and pubic hair. Next is a growth
spurt, when girls add weight and height.
</P>
<P>
   The culmination, when hormones and body fat reach a certain
level, is the start of the menstrual cycle. As a time frame,
doctors say it usually takes three years from the start of breast
development to the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said parents frequently worry if they see signs of
puberty in the daughters at age 8 or 9.
</P>
<P>
   As a general guideline, physicians say that sexual development,
beginning at age 8, is appropriate. Anything earlier should be
brought to the attention of a doctor, who may suggest an evaluation
by a pediatric endocrinologist to rule out any underlying medical
condition, such as an enzyme disorder or ovarian tumor, that may be
causing the early development.
</P>
<P>
   Girls who develop early are especially vulnerable to teasing by
peers and to problems with depression and low self-esteem, Landis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies have also shown that early maturers are two to four
times more likely to smoke, drink, have sex or become disinterested
in school. They also have the potential for more eating problems
and negative body images.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever puberty starts, parents can help ward off problems by
talking with their daughters about the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It begins with parents recognizing that it's happening and
accepting that it's happening,'' Landis said.
</P>
<P>
   But talking about sexuality is a source of anxiety for many
parents, especially those who fear their daughters are growing up
too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Socaris' mother, Debbie, is determined her 10-year-old
daughter, who is already showing the normal signs of puberty, won't
endure the journey alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get her ready,'' said Socaris, 43, explaining why
she decided to attend the puberty workshop. ``I want her to know
that it's OK to be open.''
</P>
<P>
   Skripak spends her time framing those types of discussions in
workshops for parents and their children, gearing the information
to the particular age. With fourth- and fifth-graders, that means
spending a lot of time on basic anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus in on enhancing communication,'' she said. ``We try
to impress upon parents that there isn't one talk. You can start
laying the groundwork when they're toddlers. I don't think parents
should wait until their children bring up the questions.''

DOCTORS RETHINK TREATMENT FOR INFANT EAR INFECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Linda Carlson's three babies don't cry or squirm
when their ears get checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the best patients you'll ever have,'' she told a
group of doctors at an ear infection conference here two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson's babies are fake, not flesh. They're perfect dolls for
physicians who need to fine-tune their skills at diagnosing ear
infections, according to Carlson, an Atlanta pediatric nurse
practitioner and a national consultant on ear infections.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a parent, you might think you have it down: after
crying all night, your child tugs on her ear.
</P>
<P>
   You head into the pediatrician's office, make known your opinion
and wait for the doctor to write a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't be surprised if your doctor is more skeptical than
in the past, refuses to prescribe an antibiotic or at least
suggests a delay.
</P>
<P>
   More health workers are listening closely these days to a
growing movement of experts who say ear infections too often are
misdiagnosed and overtreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all guilty of it,'' said Christine Gragnano, a
physician's assistant for Amsterdam Family Practice near
Schenectady, N.Y. ``Parents come in and expect an antibiotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gragnano was one of 150 health professionals who attended a
workshop in the Albany suburb of Colonie to improve how they
determine when an ear infection is really an ear infection, and not
just ear pain.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that ear infections in children account for
about a third of the visits to pediatricians and cost an estimated
$5 billion annually. By age 7, 65 to 95 percent of all children
have at least one ear infection and are routinely given
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet health experts claim antibiotics are used too often, in 90
percent of children, and contribute to drug-resistant infections. A
study of 5,400 children in 1994 showed that six out of seven
children improved on their own.
</P>
<P>
   To start, doctors are trying to improve their skill at
diagnosing an ear infection, not just ear pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a skill that's easy,'' said Dr. Sylvan Stool, a
national consultant and ear expert from Children's Hospital in
Denver, who led the skills workshop in Colonie. ``I still don't
find it easy to do ears but I find it easier than I did a long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the secret is for physicians to change their
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Since well before ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' physicians have been
using an otoscope to peer into the ear. But looking at the ear, no
matter how astute the physician, isn't enough to make an accurate
diagnosis, Stool said.
</P>
<P>
   He advocates that doctors go a step further by using a pneumatic
otoscope to test the mobility of the tympanic membrane _ the
eardrum. If the eardrum is sluggish, you have pretty good evidence
of a problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Stool has found wide variation in the quality of
otoscopes used by physicians and in their skills at using them.
He's even come across some with burned-out lightbulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Trying not to over-prescribe antibiotics isn't easy when parents
put up a resistance.
</P>
<P>
   JoAnn Merriman, a pediatric physician's assistant in the Albany
area, spends a lot of time explaining the benefits of a
wait-and-see approach, usually 24 to 48 hours. To help ease
symptoms, parents can use some over-the-counter remedies, including
antihistamines, decongestants and acetaminophen.
</P>
<P>
   If the ear pain goes away by itself, the child is spared a
10-day course of antibiotics and may respond better to the drug
when she really needs it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try very hard not to overtreat,'' she said.

GROUPS BANK ON POLITICAL DONATIONS TO PAY BIG DIVIDENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Teachers, doctors, insurance companies, prison
guards and five ultraconservatives in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the heavyweights in California politics _ the
deep pockets who have gambled most heavily in the state's electoral
game, contributing millions of their own dollars to get candidates
elected and to get access to those already in office.
</P>
<P>
   In the 8 1/2 years that began with Gov. Pete Wilson's first
gubernatorial campaign, California's top 25 special interest groups
have poured more than $76 million into the election coffers of
state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big money dominates the process,'' said Tony Miller, co-author
of Proposition 208, a measure intended to overhaul California's
campaign finance system that was thrown out by a federal judge this
year. ``At the very least, big contributions buy access and with
that access comes the power to influence decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   While both the donors and the politicians they support deny
there are any direct ties between their money and their influence
on laws, each group has left its mark on what happens in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the state's highest-contributing special interest
group, the California Teachers Association, helped get Democrats to
kill a proposed state income tax reduction, which would have cut
into the growth of school spending.
</P>
<P>
   Prison guards, whose union has contributed more than $600,000 to
Wilson and is the second-largest contributor to campaigns, got a 12
percent pay increase this year. Other state employees, who have not
received a pay increase since 1995, didn't.
</P>
<P>
   This year the California Medical Association, the doctors' group
that ranks as the third-highest contributor over the past 8 1/2
years, was able to thwart a state attempt to investigate doctors
accused of endangering patients by killing a fee increase that
would have covered the costs of the inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Five ultraconservative millionaires from Orange County founded
the Allied Business Political Action Committee, which contributed
nearly $4 million over eight years in a bid to elect conservatives
to the state Assembly and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of California Insurance Companies, which
contributed $3 million to state candidates, won the creation of a
state insurance pool to cover homeowner earthquake losses in 1996,
even though public interest groups screamed that it would leave
consumers paying high prices for minimal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Each group sees political contributions as a way to make sure it
has a voice in running the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers don't have the money to make big contributions,''
said Tommye Hutto, spokeswoman for the California Teachers
Association. ``So they pool their money and give it to candidates
in hopes that those candidates will listen when they get into
office. Access is all you can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike federal election rules, which limit a political action
group's campaign contributions to $5,000 per election, California
laws don't restrict how much donors may give.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably no contributing group that can claim more
success than the California Correctional Peace Officers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents California's 27,000 prison guards,
solidified its role as one of Wilson's top campaign allies with
$666,550 in contributions, on top of $1 million in ``independent
expenditures'' devoted to bashing Wilson's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the union thrived, with generous salary increases for
its members and increased spending on state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The association lobbied for tougher prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The correctional officers are one of the scariest groups in
California politics,'' said John Irwin, a retired San Francisco
State University sociology professor and former convict, who has
written four books on the prison system.
</P>
<P>
   At the union's urgings, he said, ``the state has increased its
prison population from 17,000 in 1960 to 160,000 today. That's a
10-fold increase _ and, since 1972, the crime rates haven't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Wilson took office in 1990, the state has opened 11
prisons as part of a $5 billion construction boom starting in the
early '80s. That meant jobs for the prison guards union. Since
1983, the number of state correctional employees has jumped from
15,000 to more than 44,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wilson, the top pay of a correctional officer has
increased 31 percent to more than $50,000, outstripping most
teachers and some college professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until 1980 or so no one paid attention to the men and women
who work behind the walls'' of state prisons, said Don Novey, the
union's president. ``But we managed to synergize and find a way to
communicate with the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the prison guards surprised many political observers
when they endorsed Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, to succeed
Wilson. Wilson, who was barred by law from running for a third
term, is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Novey said the group found Davis to be more labor-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found that if you go neutral on these races, it doesn't
get you access on either side,'' Novey said. ``It's all about
making a statement.''

SUVS MAY COLLIDE WITH CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The same sport-utility vehicles advertised as
the go-anywhere, do-anything luxury trucks for trips to hell and
back may be shut out of California beginning in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The state Air Resources Board on Thursday is expected to make
California the first state to impose regulations forcing light
trucks to meet the same anti-pollution standards as cars. Board
spokesman Jerry Martin said New York and Massachusetts might follow
suit, and the federal government might eventually as well.
</P>
<P>
   The issue pits environmental and public health concerns against
the right of vehicle manufacturers to sell their products and the
right of California consumers to drive their vehicle of choice.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 25 years, light trucks _ including SUVs, vans and
pickups _ have been exempt from the state's strict exhaust-emission
standards for cars.
</P>
<P>
   But as their popularity has soared, so has the damage they do to
the environment. SUVs emit up to three times more nitrogen oxides,
a key precursor to smog, than passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are high,'' said Bonnie Holmes-Gen, senior lobbyist
for the Sierra Club in California. ``It's important that we make
sure and really tighten down these loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   But automobile manufacturers say the proposal is unreasonable
and unrealistic, and a sure way to drive up the price of SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   As the state continues to tighten emission standards for cars,
they say, SUVs can't keep up because the necessary technological
know-how does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we don't have a clue how to make these trucks meet
the same standards,'' said Sam Leonard, General Motors Corp.'s top
expert of air quality.
</P>
<P>
   But the state air board contends the technology is available and
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it possible to meet these standards, we've done
it,'' said Martin. The board got a light truck to reach the
emission standards proposed for 2004 using an advanced catalytic
converter, he said. And it only cost about $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't ask manufacturers to do something not technologically
feasible,'' Martin said. ``We're talking about right-off-the-shelf
technology, right now. And we're even giving them five years to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While California already has the nation's strictest pollution
laws, it still is home to the worst air: 75 percent of all cases of
health-threatening levels of pollutants occur here, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all air pollution comes from motor vehicles,
even though passenger cars are 95 percent cleaner than 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before the boom in the popularity of light trucks, particularly
SUVs _ and the consequent replacement of family station wagons _
the difference in emission standards did not amount to much, Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past two decades, light trucks' share of the market
has climbed from 20 percent to about 50 percent. The extra
pollution these vehicles produce amounts to tons more smog-forming
chemicals each day, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to invent a lot of new technology if we're
going to have a chance of meeting these new standards,'' said Sara
Tatchio, spokeswoman for Ford Motor Co., which cut emissions in its
1999 SUVs and minivans by 40 percent, to well below federal
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Tatchio said the new state standards might force Ford to raise
the price of each vehicle by about $1,500. It's hard to estimate
costs because the technology to meet those standards hasn't been
invented yet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Steed, president of the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, a
lobbying arm of the automotive industry, said California's plan
effectively would eliminate another valuable type of automobile,
just like federal fuel-efficiency requirements killed the
heavy-duty family station wagon of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``People buy these vehicles because they are not cars,'' Steed
said. She noted that in 1970, 68 percent of the passenger cars on
the road could tow a ton, but now only 5.8 percent can.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the industry was resistant to anything that might
affect its big moneymakers. Manufacturers make about $10,000 in
profit on each SUV sold, he said, but less than half of that on
many cars.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Douglas, a staff engineer for the American Automobile
Manufacturers Association, said the AAMA has offered the board an
alternative, which Douglas said would achieve 90 percent of the
emission reductions proposed for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Under the manufacturers' plan, trucks weighing less than 6,000
pounds would be subject to passenger-car standards, but those
weighing more _ large vans, full-size pickups and SUVs like the
Chevrolet Suburban and Lincoln Navigator _ would face less
stringent regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the vehicles used by farmers and ranchers, people
who need their size and power,'' Douglas said. ``It's really not
scientifically reasonable to demand large vehicles meet the same
standards as smaller ones.''

`EVEREST' SETS IMAX BOX OFFICE RECORBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two climbers, their exhausted faces hidden
behind oxygen masks, take the final steps along an icy ridge to the
summit of Mount Everest. Behind them we can see the Earth falling
away dramatically in all directions. We're looking down on the tops
of clouds and lesser Himalayan giants marching away toward the
horizon; for a few breathtaking moments we're on top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The transcendent beauty of this scene from the IMAX movie
``Everest,'' which opens this week at the new Tech Museum of
Innovation in San Jose, is perhaps as close as we'll ever get to
answering the question: Why would people risk their lives to leave
their footprints on the summit of the world's highest mountain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' comes to the Bay Area after setting box-office
records throughout the rest of the country. It is already the
top-grossing IMAX film of all time, and its $58 million in revenues
_ from only 62 screens _ puts it in a league with Hollywood films.
In May it became the first-ever large-format film to join the list
of top 10-grossing films for the week in North America. (IMAX films
can only be shown in specially built theaters, projected inside an
82-foot-high dome.) ``The IMAX format allows us to give people a
sense of the scale and majesty of Everest that they're not going to
be able to get from a television or conventional movie,'' said
filmmaker David Breashears. ``I think the film is also an insight
into human drama and character. You see that there are serious
consequences up there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a bit of an understatement. Breashears and his crew were
filming on the mountain in May 1996, when a fierce storm killed
eight climbers, a tragedy recounted in Jon Krakauer's best-selling
``Into Thin Air.'' The IMAX climbers and film crew played a
significant role in rescuing the survivors, and the disaster is a
key part of the 44-minute film.
</P>
<P>
   The film is narrated by actor Liam Neeson from a script
co-written by Tim Cahill. Much of the music is supplied by George
Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   It stars Jamling Tenzing Norgay, whose father, the renowned
Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, made the first ascent of Everest in 1953
with Sir Edmund Hillary. Jamling sets out, literally, to follow in
his father's footsteps. Climbing Everest is the family business:
Jamling is the 10th member of his clan to stand on the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Jamling is the film's entree into the Tibetan Buddhist culture
that is so much a part of Everest lore. We see him receiving
blessings from the monks living at Tengboche Monastery in the
shadow of the mountain (the monks also blessed the IMAX camera) and
giving thanks after his ascent by lighting 25,000 yak-butter lamps
at a temple in Kathmandu _ a hauntingly lovely image.
</P>
<P>
   The other summit climbers are Ed Viesturs, arguably America's
top Himalayan climber; and 26-year-old Araceli Segarra, an
easy-on-the-eyes Spanish woman who was included, one presumes, to
give the film an extra box-office boost in Europe. (A fourth summit
aspirant, Sumiyo Tsuzuki of Japan, turned back after she cracked a
rib during an altitude-induced coughing fit.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' makes stunning use of the IMAX format. The film is
projected inside an eight-story-high dome, filling your entire
field of vision and more _ you've got to turn your head to see it
all. In one vertigo-inducing scene, a climber crosses a yawning,
bottomless crevasse on a spindly aluminum ladder set down as a
bridge. We look straight down as chips of ice fall off his boots
and spiral straight down to the blue abyss. In another memorable
scene, a massive avalanche thunders down the mountainside, right
into the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Breashears, who has previously transmitted a live television
picture from the summit of Everest for ABC Sports, said filming
with an IMAX camera presented unprecedented challenges. A standard
IMAX camera weighs 80 pounds, but Breashears worked with producer
Greg MacGillivray to create a specially modified camera that
weighed 35 pounds and could withstand the mountain's extreme
temperatures. A single 500-foot roll of film weighs 5 pounds and
lasts only 90 seconds; Breashears discovered during a shake-down
climb that film simply couldn't be loaded while wearing mittens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't leave much of our summit-day footage on the
cutting-room floor,'' he said. ``Pretty much everything we shot is
up on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Breashears plays it straight as a documentary filmmaker,
refusing to punch it up with false emotional moments, ``Everest''
succeeds where a number of recent dramatic films about climbing _
``K2,'' ``Cliffhanger'' and the laughable, made-for-television
version of ``Into Thin Air'' _ have tripped over their own feet.
The climbers in ``Everest'' are not angst-ridden people with an
ill-disguised death wish; they're supremely confident athletes at
the tops of their games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' is a remarkable film about the fierce beauty at the
very limits of human endurance, and the razor-thin line that
separates that beauty from tragedy.

VETERAN JOURNALIST PROVIDES A WEIGHTY SNAPSHOT OF U.S. HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On the page opposite Harold Evans' preface in
his big book of popular history, ``The American Century,'' is a
photograph of a street cop at a parade. Behind him, onlookers jam a
sidewalk and gaze with frank curiosity at the camera. No wonder.
The shot, taken in 1889, was one of the first photos ever made with
the novel device developed by George Eastman: the consumer-friendly
Kodak camera.
</P>
<P>
   The photo is one of 900 black-and-white images in ``The American
Century,'' newly published in hardcover by Knopf ($50, 710 pages, 4
pounds). Evans' book, written for the general reader, covers the
century from 1889, the centenary of George Washington's
inauguration, to 1989, when America _ democratic, technocratic,
media-mad and middle-class _ had become the world's most powerful
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book was No. 1 on Amazon.com last week,'' says an
obviously pleased Evans, 70, the author of 11 books. The former
editor of the Times of London and the Sunday Times _ where he
feuded famously with proprietor Rupert Murdoch _ Evans is a protean
figure: He is now editorial director for Mortimer Zuckerman's New
York Daily News, U.S. News &AMP; World Report and The Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Evans is self-deprecating and a little elusive about his
editorial legerdemain for Zuckerman: ``I spend very little time in
the trenches. I sit in the field marshal's tent sipping whisky and
sending men to their deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Many editors do the same, but few describe their role so wittily
and well.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, a British-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, talks about
``The American Century'' (a notion popularized by Henry Luce) over
tea in his hotel room. A compact man, soft-spoken, with
elder-statesman gray hair, he's rumpled in an open-necked shirt and
suspenders. His talk is seemingly casual but focused, full of
dates, numbers, names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started the book in 1986, between jobs,'' he says. ``I
thought it would take six months, not 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   With a sly hint of theatricality he asks ``It is 1998, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   From 1986 to 1998 came more jobs: Founding editor of Conde Nast
Traveler. President of Random House. With his wife, Tina Brown,
former editor of the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, there was much to
do _ including much entertaining _ as he and Brown became one of
New York's preeminent power couples.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the book kept changing, going from a big picture book
with some text to a big picture book with a lot of text.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to explain more and explore more,'' Evans says of
``Century,'' which borrows from magazine design what he calls
``self-contained spreads'' on topics as disparate as the Scopes
``monkey trial,'' the Populists and LBJ's deceptive Gulf of Tonkin
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``a browser's history'' of the past 100-plus
years.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a newspaper reporter in his hometown of Manchester, England,
Evans first came to America in 1956 on an academic fellowship. He
covered the civil rights movement, studied at Stanford University
and lived in San Francisco's Union Street.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the United States with Brown in 1984, he
thought it would again be temporary. ``I didn't expect to become a
citizen. I expected to be a green-card carrier. But there was a
certain awkwardness about living off the fat of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatching the idea for ``The American Century'' shortly after his
return, Evans decided he wanted it to be more than a beautiful
coffee-table book. Hence, the personality profiles that drive the
text are prefaced by thematic essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were intended as one-page chapter introductions became
10-page introductions. There are little threads and hooks that take
you back to the essays. I wanted to tell a good story, but a story
with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   A broadly liberal book with a calm but engaged tone, ``The
American Century'' celebrates the growth of democratic rights and
criticizes U.S. jingoism and unfulfilled promises to women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Evans makes it clear in our interview that he is no
champion of dogmatically liberal multiculturalism, which he likens
to destructive tribalism: ``There could be good reasons for anxiety
if the melting pot doesn't melt.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that the melting pot paradigm of Americanism is very
much out of favor in academic circles, Evans fairly bristles. ``I
think the academy is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the 20 million Americans born in foreign lands,
Evans says, ``Let's take a newcomer from New Delhi. While his past
may be interesting, he has a responsibility to learn about his new
country. I certainly reject the notion that the study of history
should be Asian history, or African history, or that `identity
history' is central to the study of the history of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   And that history, he insists, is worth knowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, where do you get the idea of the rule
of law and individual rights? Many societies do not go in that
direction. If a journalist in Egypt writes something even vaguely
critical of the Koran, that journalist can get shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The right to think critically ``is the intellectual sinew of
this country. Otherwise, we end up as Yugoslavia.''

BIG BROTHER WANTS TO WATCH YOUR BANK ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He works for a big banking outift in Albany, and
he's fairly high up in the organization. But he isn't looking for
trouble, especially with the feds, so I'll keep his name to myself.
</P>
<P>
   He was telling me about a new proposed federal banking
regulation called the ``Know Your Customer'' program. The thing had
just hit his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still waiting for my blood pressure to go down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it do?` I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll require financial institutions to do six things _ some
of which we already do. The first one is to determine the true
identity of a bank's customers. In a business situation, that's
just common sense. If Dan Lynch walks into XYZ Bank and says, `I
want to open a checking account,' it's good, prudent business sense
for XYZ Bank to determine that Dan Lynch is really Dan Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it goes on. It's going to require a bank to determine a
customer's source of funds for transactions involving a bank,
including the types of instruments used and where the funds were
derived or generated. OK, Dan Lynch goes into the bank and opens an
account. He has a thousand bucks he wants to put in the account.
Now, we're going to ask Dan Lynch where the money came from.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about drug dealers,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, the drug dealer thing is the whole basis for this
... Then we're going to determine the particular customer's normal
and expected transactions involving the bank. Based on a bunch of
questions we're going to ask you, we're going to find out how much
money is regularly going to go into your account, how much money is
going to come out, and when these transactions are going to take
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we're going to monitor all of your transactions to
determine if such transactions are consistent with normal and
expected transactions for that particular customer or that class of
customer. We're going to identify all customer transactions that
don't appear to be consistent with what we expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, based on this monitoring of your account, we're going to
determine if any of your transactions are unusual or suspicious.
And, if any of them appear to be, we're going to report them to the
appropriate authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   This banking executive is fairly horrified that the federal
government wants his bank to serve as a law enforcement arm of the
federal government _ as snitches, essentially, who'll surely end up
siccing the feds on a whole squad of people who've done nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   What's odd about this is that I have a friend, whom I will also
not name, who worked for years for a large federal agency that I
won't name, either. That agency has a strong interest in how much
money people put in bank accounts. If a suspected drug dealer made
a big deposit, then my friend and his fellow computer geeks would
go into the bank's computers, grab the money and keep it until the
suspected drug dealer decided to explain to the authorities where
he got the cash. Many of them of course, never bothered. The
federal government grabs millions of dollars in drug money that way
every year.
</P>
<P>
   Under this plan, though, the feds would end up with a whole new
list of names and bank accounts to watch, based only on the fact
that you or I won a football pool or a private bet on a prize
fight. Get lucky on something like that _ and put the money in the
bank _ and you could have a bunch of guys in Drug Enforcement
Agency windbreakers on your doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   My friend the banker says that this possibility makes his blood
run cold.
</P>
<P>
   How about yours?

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Recently, after President Bill Clinton, Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat signed the Wye Memorandum, my mother called from the United
States to enthuse. ``Looks like the peace process is back on
track,'' she said. ``Maybe you'll be able to stay in Israel after
all.''
</P>
<P>
   She is referring to the fact that, ever since the assassination
of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin three years ago
today(11/4), I've seriously considered moving from Jerusalem back
to the United States. This would not be a simple move, however. I
arrived here six years ago single, and am now married to an Israeli
and have a 1 1/2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has always been my second home. I spent six years here
with my family as a child and, after graduating from college,
decided to try Israeli life as an adult. The Oslo Accords that were
signed by Israeli and Palestinian leaders in 1993 made me feel more
confident in the choice that I had made. Soon, I believed, Israel
would truly be a land of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Rabin's assassination and Netanyahu's election. And,
after a long, excruciating 2 1/2 years, the interim agreement that
emerged from the nine-day summit at the Wye River Plantation in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   I told my mom that the Wye signing made my husband, Nati, and
myself feel scared and depressed. She was surprised. After all,
wasn't Wye a direct continuation of Oslo?
</P>
<P>
   That is what Netanyahu would like us to believe. It's also what
a large part of the Israeli public thinks. I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, however, is not Rabin and Wye is not Oslo. To me,
such comparisons are painful and offensive, particularly now, as we
mark three years since Rabin's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin was wholeheartedly invested in the attempt at peace
embodied in the Oslo Accords. Netanyahu signed the Wye agreement at
best half-heartedly and after 19 months of wasted time, during
which the Israeli-Palestinian trust and friendship that had just
begun to take root in Rabin's time were obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Netanyahu was one of the most vocal and vehement
opponents of Oslo and Rabin. He, along with leaders of Israel's
extreme right wing, contributed much to the atmosphere of hate and
hysteria following the post-Oslo bus bombings that culminated in
Rabin's assassination at the hands of an Israeli extremist. At the
time, Netanyahu proclaimed that terrorism precluded peace.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin knew that war -- not terrorism -- is the real threat to
Israel's security, and this was the guiding principle behind the
Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
   In Rabin's day, hope and horror co-existed.
</P>
<P>
   While horrified by the images of mangled bus remains and
blood-stained sidewalks, I could still fantasize about the
advantages peace would bring. I dreamed of being able to board a
train in Tel Aviv and ride all the way through Lebanon, Syria and
Turkey to Athens, Rome and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement at Wye did nothing to revive that hope and little
to prevent the horror. The attempted bombing of a bus full of
Israeli children last week illustrates yet again that no security
arrangement can ever be entirely terror-proof. The prevailing
belief in Israel is that if the children on the bus had been hurt,
the Wye agreement would effectively have been nullified.
</P>
<P>
   This is why my fear of terrorism now is greater than ever: I
dread not only the immediate explosion but also the final blow to
the peace process that it will ultimately represent.
</P>
<P>
   I will probably not attend any of the memorial events marking
the three-anniversary of Rabin's assassination. Not because I do
not mourn his death. To the contrary, I mourn it deeply.
</P>
<P>
   However, a campaign is being waged by Netanyahu and his
right-wing coalition to co-opt Rabin's legacy. The false
presentation of the Wye Memorandum as a continuation of Oslo, and
Netanyahu as the ideological successor of Rabin, is part of that
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When I explained this to my mother, she chided me for being so
pessimistic. ``Maybe Netanyahu really does believe in what he's
doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could believe it.

 &HT;    GAZA AIRPORT TANGIBLE STATUS SYMBOL FOR PALESTINIAN RULE
 &HT;    With photo placed in the International folder on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAFAH, Gaza Strip _ Consider it a sign of progress that the
Palestinian cause, once spearheaded by airline hijackings, will
soon be celebrated with a brand new international airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaza International Airport could open here as early as this
week. The runway has been ready for a year, big enough to
accommodate a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. The small, Moroccan-styled
terminal -- complete with mosaics and facade of interlocking arches
-- awaits.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $80 million airport has long been ready, but
equipment was held up in Israeli ports while the peace talks
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   According to people involved in the talks, the opening was
delayed at times by Israel and at other times by Palestinian
leaders who did not want to settle for just the airport when other
issues were pending.
</P>
<P>
   The final details were worked out in the recent peace talks at
the Wye River Plantation in Maryland. Among the last issues:
Whether the international code letters for the airport (as used on
luggage tags) would list the facility as being under Israeli
jurisdiction. They won't, satisfying the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Those symbols matter, as the airport is an important step toward
sovereignty for Palestinians who seek their own state.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important in a practical sense. Travel is a constant
source of irritation for Palestinians, most of whom are refugees
with unclear citizenship and a myriad of passports.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded Gaza Strip, captured by Israel in the war of
1967, they feel especially penned in. They need special permission
to fly out of Israel's airport and often face hours of
interrogation on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Salman Abu Halib, director of the Palestinian National
Authority's civil aviation agency, acknowledges the irony in the
idea of the Palestinians running an airport.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a billboard near the airport features Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat with the wish, ``Safety be with you.'' But, three
decades ago Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) used
hijackings to put their cause in the international spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a stage of our struggle,'' Halib said. ``Now, we're
in a different stage, a stage of progress. We are working to make
peace for our children. We are in the construction stage.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Halib himself was a Palestinian fighter pilot
for Arab armies that used to battle Israel. Now, he is a bureaucrat
who hopes that President Bill Clinton will use the airport on a
planned trip to the region in December.
</P>
<P>
   If former fighter pilot Halib is a legacy of the Palestinian
past, 24-year-old Omar Al Nabeen hints at the future.
</P>
<P>
   He was raised in a refugee camp but will now see the region as a
flight attendant from the new airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' he says, ``is what we will breathe from.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still work to do. For example, a sign outside still
calls it, The Yasser Arafat International Airport. Arafat
reportedly asked that the name be changed to Gaza International.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians do have experience managing commercial
aviation. The PLO's vast investment holdings, Halib said, have
included past ownership of two small airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian Airlines, with two propeller planes, has been
operating for about two years from an airport in Egypt. A Boeing
727, the gift of a Saudi prince, awaits in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The airport itself is a chance for Palestinians to put their
mark on travel in the region. Near the terminal is the ornate VIP
lounge, domed to resemble Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock shrine,
which is holy to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   There are practical touches, too. Fed up with questioning
sessions, friskings and delays faced in travel from Israel,
Palestinians promise that their airport will have state-of-the-art
but unobtrusive security.
</P>
<P>
   Halib said passengers can be ``relaxed,'' but will be surveyed
by more than 100 video cameras in the small terminal and, of
course, pass through metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis will still be involved. They approve the flight plans
and will be hidden but on-hand to monitor who is travelling. They
can X-ray luggage coming in. Arafat's personal plane will be
exempted from inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Halib acknowledged that, ``there are people who want us to fail
in this,'' hinting that tight security will be needed against
threats from both Israeli or Arab extremists.

 &UR; BOOKS OF THE CENTURY &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Here is what the ``New York Times Book Review'' (then the
``SaturdayBook Review Supplement'') had to say about Willa Cather's
``O Pioneers!'' on Sept. 14, 1913: ``Possibly some might call it a
feminist novel, for the two heroines are stronger, cleverer and
better balanced than their husbands and brothers _ but we are sure
Miss Cather had nothing so inartistic in mind.'' And in 1950, about
Ernest Hemingway's ``Across the River and Into the Trees'': ``Not
one syllable of what Hemingway has written can or will be missed by
any literate person in the world.'' It's fun, not fair, to focus on
these faux pas, because beyond the errors in judgment that its
editors have included, this expansion of the centennial issue of
the ``New York Times Book Review'' (it appeared in October 1996 to
mark the ``Book Review's'' 100th anniversary) is pure delight. It
includes Reynolds Price on Toni Morrison's ``Song of Solomon'';
Joan Didion on Norman Mailer's ``The Executioner's Song''; Eudora
Welty on E.B. White's ``Charlotte's Web''; essays by Gabriel Garcia
Marquez on Ernest Hemingway, Jay McInerney on Raymond Carver,
Philip Roth on Bernard Malamud; interviews with D.H. Lawrence,
Vladimir Nabakov and Allen Ginsberg; letters from Jack London,
Joseph Conrad and Timothy Leary; and so much more _ an

daughter's creation, a puppet that seems to have a mind and a voice
of its own. In ``The Sepulchre,'' a woman searches her parents'
huge Victorian house for her elderly father, who has disappeared.
Here, ladies and gentlemen, is the dark side of Joyce Carol Oates:
27 new ``tales of the grotesque'' (a follow-up to her 1995
collection, ``Haunted: Tales of the Grotesque''). Unlike Oates'
novella ``Zombie,'' in which the horror was laughably overplayed,
these stories are effective because they recognize the power of the
mere suggestion of fear, or of the danger that lurks beneath the
surface of ordinary existence. Oates has released two other books
this year, a novel, ``My Heart Laid Bare,'' and a book for
children.  &QL;

 &UR; BALLS &QL; 
 &UR; Nanci Kincaid (Algonquin, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid uses no less than 16 narrators (all women) in this
funny, touching novel about college football Coach Mac Gibbs, his
marriage, his players and his drive to win. The main narrator is
Dixie Gibbs, who marries Mac in 1968 (she is 19) and quickly
becomes a football widow. But Dixie loves Mac, who is a decent and
amiable man, and like him she has been bred to the fiercely
competitive rule of Southern football: Winning is everyone's goal,
and the coach's wife is there to support her husband, even if it
means she has no identity of her own. Also lending their voices to
this scenario are the Gibbses' mothers, the wives of fellow coaches
and the mothers and sisters of the players Mac tries to recruit.
The narrative shifts are sometimes confusing, but the inside look
at high-stakes football is fascinating, funny and ultimately sad.
Kincaid has an ear for the Southern voice and a first-hand
knowledge of her subject: She was married for 23 years to Al
Kincaid, now a coach at Temple University, and her current husband
is Dick Tomey, head coach at the University of Arizona. &QL;

 &UR; HOT SEAT &QL; 
 &UR; Frank Rich (Random House, $39.95)
</P>
<P>
   This is worth its cover price just to read Rich's jabs at
Broadway phenomenon Andrew Lloyd Webber, whom Rich calls ``a canny,
melodic pastiche artist.'' Theater people have been known to fire
back _ David Merrick called Rich ``a savage dog,'' and there were
many who thought he was too kind. This book has more than 1,000
pages, about a quarter of Rich's output for the ``New York Times''
during his 13 seasons as chief drama critic. It's enough to give
you an idea of what Merrick and Lloyd Webber were up against. What
was the worst play Rich ever saw? ``Moose Murders,'' which opened
and closed on Feb. 23, 1983. Rich wrote: ``From now on there will
always be two groups of theatergoers in this world: those who have
seen ``Moose Murders,'' and those who have not. Those of us who
have witnessed the play that opened last night will undoubtedly
hold periodic reunions, in the noble tradition of survivors of the
Titanic. Tears and booze will flow in equal measure, and there will
be a prize awarded to the bearer of the most outstanding
antlers.'' &QL;

 &UR; ART OF THE STATE: ARIZONA &QL; 
 &UR; (Abrams, $12.95)
</P>
<P>
   This little book is part of a series that eventually will
provide quick studies of the 50 states. Included in each volume are
color illustrations (wear your glasses _ they're small),
milestones, a rather shallow profile of cultural life, and a
perennial calendar of events and festivals. Tourists might want
more than this, but the books are perfect stocking-stuffers for
your relatives back East, or for people who are planning to visit
someday. Other states in the series so far are California, Iowa,
Maryland, New Mexico, Louisiana, Vermont and New York. &QL;

TB FINDS FERTILE BREEDING GROUNDS IN RUSSIAN PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A fearsome killer is stalking the crowded, stuffy cells
of Russia's notorious penal system. But unlike a mafia hitman, it
cannot be stopped by prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike loose nuclear weapons, arms to Iran or other
post-Soviet time bombs that remain disasters waiting to happen, the
killer is already claiming victims at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is tuberculosis, or rather a drug-resistant strain of the
deadly disease that health specialists and other officials say can
only be cured with money Russia does not have.
</P>
<P>
   They said Russia's prisons, overcrowded, underfunded and lacking
the medicine to properly care for patients, have become a breeding
ground for the new strain of TB.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, health specialists said, is not restricted to the
former Soviet Union. A recent report by the World Health
Organization cites an increased risk caused by Russia's TB epidemic
for Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the very serious self-interest of the world community
to join together and solve this problem,'' said Alex Goldfarb, head
of the Russian TB project of the New York-based Public Health
Research Institute. The project works with several Russian prison
hospitals to train doctors in Western techniques for treating TB.
</P>
<P>
   Goldfarb said 100,000 of Russia's 1 million inmates suffers from
TB. Of these, he estimates, 30,000 have developed the deadly
drug-resistant form. According to his estimates and those of other
health specialists, 5,000 inmates are expected to die this year.
Many more will die next year because of lack of food, heating and
drugs caused by Russia's recent economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The larger danger, health experts said, is that drug-resistant
TB, if not stopped in Russia, could easily spread beyond the
borders of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only a matter of time before drug-resistant tuberculosis
from Russia becomes a daily reality in other countries worldwide,''
Dr. Nicolas Banatvala, of the Medical Emergency Relief
International said in a statement issued Thursday as part of an
appeal for $100 million in new funds to fight the epidemic.
``Multidrug-resistant TB is a deadly airborne infection: it has
been called `ebola with wings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis was believed to be wiped out this century, but the
disease has made a comeback and now claims 3 million lives each
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, TB was brought under control by antibiotics. By the
1970s, the Soviet Union also claimed to have conquered the disease
with a centralized system that included regular mandatory X-rays
and immediate isolation in a sanatorium for up to two years for
anyone found carrying the disease.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union and its command economy collapsed, so did
TB prevention.
</P>
<P>
   As state funding for medicine dwindled, X-ray equipment fell
into disrepair. As millions of workers left their Soviet-era jobs
for the private sector, enforced X-ray tests became impossible. As
the Soviet social safety net came undone, fewer people could afford
to spend time away from their jobs. Health experts fear many
Russians with TB hide their illness from doctors.
</P>
<P>
   And as poverty and homelessness increased, so did the number of
TB cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the average incidence of new cases was 7.7 per 100,000
Russians, about the same figure as in the United States. By 1997,
that ratio was 79 new cases per 100,000 Russians, and increasingly
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 2.5 million of Russia's 145 million citizens suffer from
TB, according to Deputy Health Minister Gennady Onishchenko. He
conceded that health authorities were losing the battle to control
drug-resistant strains.
</P>
<P>
   International medical specialists thought they had a solution: A
treatment that relies on cheap and quick diagnostic techniques,
such as analyzing phlegm under a microscope instead of taking a
chest X-ray. It involves a small army of social workers making sure
TB sufferers take their medicine, four different antibiotics, every
day. The treatment promises that in a few weeks a person will stop
being contagious and in six months will be cured.
</P>
<P>
   But when Goldfarb's project and the Belgian-based Doctors
Without Borders began studying Russian prison populations, they
found the treatment worked only in two-thirds of TB sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldfarb said the bacteria that causes TB is capable of adapting
to medicines used against it, which is why Western treatments
employ four drugs at once. But Russian prison authorities often do
not have enough antibiotics and end up treating patients only
partially. The drug-resistant TB bacteria is the result.
</P>
<P>
   Often inmates diagnosed with TB have to stay in regular colonies
awaiting a spot in the hospitals. These inmates use the same
cafeteria and bathhouse facilities as healthy inmates, spreading
their infection. As more people become infected, prisons are forced
to spread their supply of medicine even more thinly, causing the
drug-resistant strain to spread more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   While ordinary TB can be cured for the cost of $50 per patient,
the treatment of one case of multidrug-resistant TB would be
$10,000, a prohibitive cost for Russia's cash-strapped health
system. In other words, while medically the disease is curable,
said Goldfarb, ``from an economic standpoint, it is incurable.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is not all. Vezhnina said in each of Russia's 89
regions an average of 100 people with contagious TB are released
every year. They rarely seek medical care and continue to spread
the infection. Other people become ill, people who have the money
to travel to other cities and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Colonel Mikhail Berin, head of prison hospitals in the Moscow
area, said if Westerners ``don't find the money, in two or three
years this problem will be theirs, too, and then it will cost them
billions.''

silicosis-weakened lungs of stonecutters.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Pacini was 18. When her neighbor's three children fell
ill and their own mother could not care for them, Pacini did what
had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took care of those kids two weeks. I kept putting ice water
on top of their heads and bathe them all over, and give them cold
water and drinks all the time. After two weeks, the girls got
better,'' Pacini, now 98, said recently. The third child, a boy,
died.
</P>
<P>
   Word traveled fast that Pacini was not afraid to care for the
sick. She spent the epidemic going from house to house. She gave
patients a mixture of hot water, honey and brandy.

   Finally, it subsided. In New England, the worst of the epidemic
had passed by Thanksgiving. Church bells ceased their tolling. The

bones and delivering babies.

   The flu of 1918-1919 killed 28,870 in Massachusetts, 3,618 in
New Hampshire, 2,325 in Vermont, 4,878 in Maine, 4,399 in Rhode
Island, and 10,834 in Connecticut, according to census figures
cited by Crosby.

   That ghastly fall of 1918 would slip, oddly, from the collective
consciousness.

that there was this godawful event that had been left out of all my

does not seem altogether inexplicable.

</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still trying to figure out why the 1918 influenza
virus that swept the globe was so deadly.
</P>
<P>
   What they do know, according to Dr. Nancy Cox, head of the
Influenza Branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta, is that another pandemic could happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``we cannot predict when.''
</P>
<P>
   However, advances made in the last 80 years probably mean fewer
people would die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, now, antibiotics that we didn't have,'' Cox said.
``And we have much better supportive care'' _ like respirators.
</P>
<P>
   Flu vaccines, which protect against predicted strains of flu,
antiviral drugs, and rapid detection and diagnosis would also help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope it wouldn't kill nearly so many people,'' Cox said.
``We know that in 1918 a lot of people did die of secondary
bacterial pneumonias, and those would be treatable today.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the recent avian flu scare in Hong Kong was ``a wake-up
call.'' That virus never did gain the ability to spread efficiently
among humans, said Cox, and was swiftly contained. But even with
the availabilty of modern technology, she said, six of the 18
people infected died.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never know why the virus (of 1918-19) did what it did,
but the fact that it was able to cause such widespread devastation
continues to give us pause,'' said Cox. ``And what happened in Hong
Kong reinforces the feeling that we need to be prepared for such an
event.''

SPECIALISTS WORRY ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF HIGH-TECH TOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erik Strommen, a designer for Microsoft, looked delighted as he
demonstrated his company's Interactive Arthur doll. Gently squeeze
the arm, foot, or ear of this cuddly $99 computerized character,
and it converses with its holder; add a device for another $60 and
it communicates with an Internet Web site, so it can be used for
playing and learning simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of toy is going to complicate children's worlds in
lots of interesting ways,'' Strommen said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   But some child psychologists, researchers, and academics are
worried about what those ``interesting ways'' may include. While
they think toys like Arthur have positive aspects, they point out
that there's no way to shut them off, so kids can't do things they
instinctively love to do with dolls _ like cuddle with them while
falling asleep.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, a growing number of specialists in childhood
development worry that high-tech toys, games, and Web sites _
including ones intended principally for education _ are
proliferating at such stunning speed that no one knows what effects
they could ultimately have on users. The specialists also complain
that the studies being done are overwhelmingly instigated by
industries with a vested interest in their outcomes, rather than by
governments or educational institutions whose sole objective would
be to examine the developmental repercussions for children.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers worry that _ like television _ the nascent,
computer-based media might grow and thrive without systematic
attempts to shape or steer them in ways beneficial to their
youngest users. Already, they say, these media are proliferating
without basic knowledge about how long children should use them,
whether they get in the way of forming friendships, and what
effects various games _ especially violent ones _ have on behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technical innovations are moving more quickly than the
market can keep up with, and certainly more quickly than the family
can keep up with,'' said Sheri Parks, who is conducting research at
the University of Maryland on children's use of so-called new
media. ``And therein lies the rub.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Turkle, a sociology professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and one of the only psychologists in the
world specializing in computer culture, lamented that more
researchers aren't moving into her field, particularly since the
most significant changes in the ways children use new technologies
have occurred in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   When she began studying the subject 20 years ago, Turkle said,
children saw computers as ``evocative objects'' that they could
``think with.'' Today children essentially perceive computers as
``sort-of alive'' with thoughts and feelings, said Turkle, who
called computers an ``incredibly psychological technology.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others said this metamorphosis has potentially major
reprecussions for children's learning techniques, views of life and
emotions, and an array of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   They say that without guidance for both the creators of new
technology and the parents who buy it, market-driven research could
become the only determining factor in what products become popular,
or even available. Indeed, so little research has been conducted
that no consensus has developed on questions as basic as whether
computers can be ``seductive,'' in a negative way akin to being
mesmerized by television, or are inherently positive because of
their interactive nature.
</P>
<P>
   Prestigious firms like Microsoft, along with ones that
specialize in educational toys and software, insist that they take
their responsibility to children seriously. They explain, for
instance, that they use psychologists and focus groups to determine
the appropriateness of products before releasing them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, these companies generally agree that most
destinations on the Internet, as well as many items on store
shelves, don't receive such scrutiny before they're launched _ and
few, if any, are the subjects of serious research into their
long-term effects on psychology, behavior, or socialization.
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of interactive games and sites with lurid or violent
content are subjects of particular concern, as is the blurring of
lines between information and advertising on the Internet. But even
such seemingly innocuous activities as participating in on-line
chat rooms raise questions in the minds of many specialists, who
wonder whether the computerized conversations may impede children
from learning social and verbal skills that have always been honed
through contact with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Uncharted territory &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the enormous impact that everyone agrees these
technologies will have on our children's lives ... isn't it amazing
that there's no groundwork, no real basis for our assumptions, no
real knowledge base for what their impact's going to be?'' asked
Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education in
Washington, D.C. ``Studying the impact of these emerging media on
our children just isn't a field yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean there's no research being done. A wide array
of tests are being conducted in venues as diverse as college
education departments nationwide, some of which accept corporate
backing and some of which don't; the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's vaunted Media Lab, which has numerous marketplace
tie-ins; and the Children's Television Workshop, which produces
shows like ``Sesame Street'' and is collaborating on experimental,
on-line projects with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Few children's psychologists or other behavioral specialists are
doing in-depth work on this subject, though, and those who are have
not linked their efforts or attempted to form a database for use by
fellow researchers or parents. Moreover, specialists point out that
neither the federal government, large philanthropic organizations,
nor major scientific groups have weighed in with ongoing resources
or money.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Media Education and the Communications Department
of the University of Texas at Austin recently sponsored a
conference in Washington in an effort to connect diverse research
projects, stimulate broader ones, and develop strategies for
convincing national politicians and funding groups that there is a
problem that needs to be addressed. The attendees included some of
America's most prominent psychologists, educators, scientists,
researchers, and industry representatives who deal with children
and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, there was little disagreement among the diverse
participants, regardless of their backgrounds or areas of
expertise. Some who came from the profit sector defended their work
against complaints that they aren't sufficiently focused on
children's developmental needs, but no one spoke against the idea
of more targeted, coordinated research, especially into long-term
consequences for children.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants expressed confidence that major players in the
marketplace would try to take children's needs into account on
their own, partly because business schools today stress ethics and
social responsibility more than they did in the past. At the same
time, they provided examples of games with gruesome and violent
content, and decried the lack of research to determine their
effects on users.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Computers are childhood staple
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the experts agreed that children are growing so
reliant on computers for education and recreation _ a trend that is
certain to accelerate _ that parents and teachers shouldn't rely on
the good intentions of the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Idit Harel, an alumna of Harvard's Graduate School of Education
and the MIT Media Lab, said many children born in the 1990s, in
particular, are being raised with computers as an integral part of
their lives rather than as an adjunct that they must learn to
master.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, computers are the fifth food group,'' said Harel,
the founder of MaMaMedia Inc., one of scores of companies
nationwide that devise and market educational products for the new
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must determine, while this technology is still in its
infancy, what its effects are and where we should be going with
it,'' added Joanne Cantor, the author of ``Mommy, I'm Scared'' and
a University of Wisconsin communications professor who has long
studied the effects of movies and television on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' she said, ``emotions are never checked at the
door when you interact with anything, including a computer.''

RACE TAKES ON A NEW LIGHT IN BRAZIL'S POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO _ A walk along the muscular avenues of this fast-paced
industrial metropolis leaves little doubt that Brazil's Big Apple
is a multicultural miracle.
</P>
<P>
   In this city of 16 million people, the world's third largest,
nearly equal numbers of blacks and whites hustle together through
work and play. Included in this sassy, self-assured mix are large
pockets of Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, and Jewish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But race relations in Latin America's largest democracy, of a
different complexity than those in the United States, have taken on
a new edge since Celso Pitta became the city's first black mayor.
</P>
<P>
   It's not because the athletic-looking, 52-year-old,
Harvard-trained economist is a passionate spokesman for blacks in a
country where nearly half the population is dark-skinned. In fact,
for Brazil's small but increasingly vocal community of black
activists, that is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his term, Pitta has played down his race while
preaching a message of individual responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I see it, I was elected by a majority of voters,''
Pitta said during an interview in his office at City Hall, a
building that used to be a prison. ``The votes came from blacks,
whites, yellows and others who feel comfortable with my political
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the country is home to the world's second-largest black
population, few blacks occupy positions of power or prestige. And
those who do often prefer to keep away from uncomfortable
discussions about race and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pitta, another famous black Brazilian figure, the soccer
player Edson Arantes do Nascimento _ better known as Pele _ has
been criticized for not being more of an advocate for black rights
in Brazil. In March 1995, legislators in the state of Brasilia
voted against making Pele an honorary resident partly because of
his unwillingness to talk about racism in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   According to government census figures, more than 44 percent of
Brazil's 164 million residents consider themselves mulatto, a mix
of white and black. Only 6 percent of Brazilians say they are
black.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the racial debate are those like Pitta, the son
of a white father and black mother, who say that racial tensions
aren't as volatile in Brazil as they are in, say, the United States
because blacks and whites have more easily integrated into one
society. Interracial marriages are more common in Brazil than in
almost any other Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil ended slavery in 1888 _ more than 20 years after the
United States _ but without a divisive civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say there are no issues here, but you don't find the
hard feelings here like you do in the States,'' said Pitta, who,
like Pele, married a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   But those who support a more active black movement, an idea that
is gaining momentum in parts of northern Brazil, compare Brazil
today to the United States before the Civil Rights movement of the
1960s, where whites held power with little resistance from blacks
and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Two national commissions have been formed in Brazil to improve
the progress of blacks. The country's top human rights official
said the federal government may soon introduce diversity hiring
programs into state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to predict whether these strategies will lead to
large US-style black political organizations in Brazil. Because so
many Brazilians are of mixed blood, racial issues are not as
clear-cut here as they are in the United States, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of blacks and (mixed races) fall in the lower income
categories,'' said Breno Fontes, a sociologist at Pernambuco
University in the country's northern region. ``For them, questions
of race are minor compared to other civil rights issues, like
economic survival, citizenship, and access to government
services.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate over racial politics heated up just a few months
after Pitta took office, when a group of senators accused him of
authorizing fraudulent bond deals while he was the city's top
finance official, allegedly funneling millions of dollars in
commissions to friendly banks. Pitta and his wife were also the
subject of a federal tax probe.
</P>
<P>
   Pitta maintains his innocence and says the scandals were the
work of political rivals. But many leading black leaders remained
noticeably absent during the episode, opting not to defend a mayor
who had drawn much of his support from many of the city's black
voters.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, the national magazine Republica ran a
scathing cover story on Pitta, calling him ``The Colorless Man.''
The black reporter who wrote the story said the new mayor displayed
the ``necessary invisibility for a Negro in a land of whites.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cleary, a history lecturer at Harvard University who
specializes in Brazilian culture, attributes Pitta's historic
election more to the Chicago-style political machine of Paulo
Maluf, the former mayor, who hand-picked his successor, rather than
to the votes of blacks or minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maluf is like Brazil's version of Mayor Richard Daley,'' of
Chicago, Cleary said, adding that ``there isn't large-scale
political organizing along racial lines. It's much different from
what one finds in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is aware of the criticism, Pitta, who counts
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Colin Powell, the
former chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, among the leaders
he most admires, says it doesn't bother him.
</P>
<P>
   With roughly one-fifth of the city's residents either homeless
or living in sub-standard housing, Pitta has pledged to double the
number of public housing units, to 20,000, in the city's poorest
slums. He also plans to launch citywide public education
initiatives on health and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve the traffic that daily chokes the city's major
arteries, the mayor said he will add electric trolleys, and he is
offering tax incentives to attract more companies to Sao Paulo's
impoverished east side.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turbulence he has faced in his first elected
position, Pitta hasn't ruled out running for a higher office. But
he knows that if he does, whites and blacks alike will be watching
him closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my color brings me more attention, although I don't
believe it should,'' Pitta added. ``But I'm very comfortable with
my skin.''

DNA TESTS PROMPT REVIEW OF JEFFERSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, before the DNA tests would prove Thomas
Jefferson's sexual relations with a slave, a slightly less
authoritative voice offered an opinion on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The source: an underground punk rock band named Thomas Jefferson
Slave Apartments. Its message: hypocrisy, captured with ballad
titles such as, ``Talkin' bout Miscegenation.''
</P>
<P>
   The release made fewer waves than the announcement this week
that Jefferson fathered at least one child by Sally Hemings, a
slave who had come to live with him as a teenage girl.
</P>
<P>
   But as the subsequent furor has shown, the band tapped into a
long-running theme: Jefferson as lightning rod for the national
debate over race.
</P>
<P>
   Now, from the classroom to the streets of Boston, people are
struggling with the implications of Jefferson's affair. To some,
conclusive proof of the Jefferson-Hemings relationship is evidence
that the third US president was not as vehemently opposed to
interracial mixing, or, even, as racist as some of his writings
made him sound.
</P>
<P>
   To others, their liaison is _ and, for years, has been _
emblematic of far worse: the slave master's iron control of even
the most intimate aspects of a slave's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Lincoln, Jefferson is a symbol of the basic meaning of
our country,'' said Eric Foner, author of ``The Story of American
Freedom'' and a history professor at Columbia University. ``I think
blacks have always pressed this (affair) forward to illustrate the
depths of racism in American society, the depths of hypocrisy, if
you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Documentary filmmaker Ken Burns, who last year produced a
two-part miniseries on Jefferson, described the relationship as
``an amazing paradox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, he owned her,'' Burns said. ``When we're
distracted by sex, we forget the fact that he could have killed
her, and there was no law in America to protect her.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for years, that has been the larger, hypocritical
message of Jefferson, within some sectors of the black community
and among black descendants whose tales of their ancestral roots
were long ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the romanticized Jefferson ideal swelled in recent years
_ with the celebration of the 200th anniversary of his birth and
the release of several books, documentaries, and films, including
the Merchant-Ivory feature ``Jefferson in Paris'' _ academics
largely soured on the Declaration of Independence author, deriding
him as a man with two faces, an intellectual who spread the notion
that ``all men are created equal'' and a country squire who lived
in splendor among 200 slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is proof of something that many people had long assumed
to be true: that Jefferson had an ambivalence'' on questions of
race and morality, said Harvard Law professor Christopher Edley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, this doesn't tell us very much new about slavery or
Jefferson,'' Foner added. ``Most historians are well aware that the
sexual relations, abuse, and assault on slave women by masters was
a persistent feature of the institution. Sally Hemings was not a
willing partner. She was a slave.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to others, the Jefferson-Hemings affair allows far more
sympathetic conclusions. Despite his written remarks, including an
1814 letter in which he condemned interracial relationships as ``a
degradation,'' Jefferson's relationship with Hemings may eventually
be interpreted as a sign that he was at worst tortured, or
intellectually inconsistent, some said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Annette Gordon-Reed _ whose ``Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings: An American controversy'' was among the books that
predated the DNA tests with its conclusion that the affair had
truly taken place _ said Monday that his relationship with a slave
will ultimately require a ``more nuanced vision'' of Jefferson's
racial beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson is clearly a racist,'' Gordon-Reed said. ``But this
will make people think more deeply about his racism and how strong
it was, the basis for it, how much a part of his life it was. The
predominant question is, if Jefferson is such a racist, how could
he have done this?''
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs, she said, that the relationship consisted
of more than sex.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the amount of time Jefferson and Hemings spent
together _ as many as 38 years _ several of Hemings's children were
given names that were important to Jefferson. There are also ``not
any statements about his involvement with any woman but her,''
Gordon-Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the factual evidence, the meaning of the affair is no
closer to being settled than it was a week ago, when the historical
debate still carried the caveat ``if true.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Edley said, the most scholars can hope to accomplish is
a ``careful accounting of Jefferson as an individual, like an
accounting of America itself.''

AFTER 12 YEARS, A FAMILY CATCHES A KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRVIEW HEIGHTS, Ill. _ Shot in the neck, the shoulder and the
side, Walter Taylor was down to his last breath. Stumbling, falling
to the floor, he choked out a final plea: ``Bro.''
</P>
<P>
   His kid brother Cedric got the message.
</P>
<P>
   On that day in 1986, Cedric Taylor began a 12-year quest to
catch his brother's killer _ crisscrossing the country, paying
informants, offering rewards, joining police raids, pestering
detectives, staging all-night stakeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Once, for a moment, he stood alongside the murderer in a bus
station, but the man slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cedric Taylor's obsession paid off: A hard case
named Ernest Mosby was hauled before an Illinois judge and pleaded
guilty to killing Walter Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   But the story doesn't end there. Cedric Taylor has learned that
justice, when it comes, doesn't always look the way you hoped it
would. And closure, if it ever comes, can be more elusive than a
killer on the run.
</P>
<P>
   The police did what they could, but finding Walter Taylor's
killer was always more important to his family. Taylor was a black
man with a record, and his death appeared to flow from a drug
dispute, though his brother adamantly denies that.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he died, Nov. 22, 1986, Taylor was 29. A talented
piano player with a passion for chess and basketball, he had
attended Southern Illinois University and hoped to be a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Saturday, and he was relaxing in a house trailer on
Paradise Road in East St. Louis, Ill., a city on the wrong side of
the Mississippi River, where drugs and death were within easy
reach.
</P>
<P>
   With him were his girlfriend, Kelly Davis, and their daughters,
4-year-old LaShonda and 1-year-old Derissa. Davis was also eight
months pregnant with a boy. He would be named Walter Jr., and today
he is 12, the spitting image of the father he never met.
</P>
<P>
   Answering a knock at the door, Walter Taylor was confronted by
Mosby and two other men. According to the statements the other men
later gave police, Mosby believed Taylor had sold him $30 of baby
powder masquerading as cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernest told him, `Man, what you sold me ain't no good. Man,
can I get my money back?''' said Barry Bonner, who had accompanied
Mosby to Taylor's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter said, `Man, I don't know you,''' Bonner added in a
police statement taken the day after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   As Taylor tried to shut the door, Mosby pulled out a silver
.32-caliber pistol and began shooting, according to a statement by
the other companion, Willie Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard three shots,'' Kelly Davis told police. ``And as I was
coming out of the bedroom, I heard Walter say `Bro' and I saw
Walter down on the floor.'' LaShonda stood crying over him.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Taylor was pronounced dead an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   When he died, Taylor was trying to turn his life around after a
past conviction for drug possession, Cedric Taylor said. Walter had
completed a rehab program, had been working steadily and had made a
clean break from the drug life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members are convinced that someone else sold Mosby the
bad drugs _ they name him, but cannot prove the charge, and that is
one reason they have a lingering sense of unfinished business. The
family claims the real drug dealer deflected blame from himself,
and onto Walter Taylor, out of fear of Mosby.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother wasn't a saint, but to gun somebody down in front
of their kids, over something they don't even know anything about,
that's what hurt the family most. And that's why we had to find
this guy,'' said Cedric Taylor, a nightclub owner and real estate
investor, surrounded by his wife and children in their upscale home
in this southwestern Illinois suburb.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now 39, Cedric Taylor was 27 when his brother was killed. Just
eight months earlier he had lost another older brother, Stanley, to
heart disease, and the wound was still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The three had been inseparable as boys, known in their East St.
Louis neighborhood as ``The Three Stooges.'' Two other brothers and
three sisters survive, and all contributed financially and
emotionally to the search for Mosby.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years before Walter's death, in 1976, their cab driver
father was killed during a robbery. He was also named Walter, and
he also was shot with a .32-caliber gun. Their mother, a house
cleaner, held the family together.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Walter Taylor's death, police were seeking
Mosby. With a lengthy record and a face scarred from a bullet
wound, he was a poster boy for ``armed and dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was clever about avoiding arrest. And so, with Mosby
eluding police, Cedric Taylor decided to do it himself. His account
of his efforts has been substantially verified by law enforcement
officials and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Taylor wanted Mosby's penalty to be Biblical _ an eye
for an eye. ``We wanted to go on a mission,'' he said. ``We wanted
to go get him ourselves and bring justice.''
</P>
<P>
   That taste for vengeance soon waned, however, when Taylor
realized that killing Mosby would neither bring back his brother
nor answer the nagging questions about why Mosby sought out Walter
Taylor in the first place. ``You can't talk to a dead man. That
made me want to get him alive,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric's partner from the very beginning was his nephew, Ron
Malloyd, now 37, the son of an older Taylor sister. Malloyd
attended high school with Mosby _ so Malloyd knew his prey. ``I
knew how slick he was, how slick he thought he was,'' Malloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after the shooting, Taylor and Malloyd spent
most of their days scouring Mosby's haunts, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Then, several weeks after the shooting, Taylor was driving home
when he spotted a 1977 Cadillac Coupe de Ville that belonged to
Mosby's uncle _ with Mosby inside. Taylor followed the car to a St.
Louis bus station _ calling Malloyd on his cellular phone en route
_ and stopped only to pull on a bulletproof vest purchased from a
Sam's Warehouse.

<P>
   ``I stood right beside him,'' said Taylor, who had seen photos
of Mosby but had never met him in person. ``He was wearing the same
beige corduroy jacket he had on when he killed my brother. That was
creepy. My heart was pounding. I didn't know what for sure to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked for a police officer, but couldn't find one. Then
Taylor watched Mosby head toward the buses, apparently boarding one
for Springfield, Ill. By then Malloyd had arrived, so the two men
jumped into Taylor's car and followed the bus, calling Illinois
State Police from the car phone.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty miles outside St. Louis, Illinois troopers caught up with
the bus _ with Taylor and Malloyd right behind _ and ordered
everyone outside at gunpoint, Taylor said. When the last person
stepped off, Taylor realized they had followed the wrong bus. Mosby
had taken another bus, to California, ruining Taylor's best chance
to catch him for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt stupid because I stood right beside him,'' Taylor said.
``If I had it to do again, I would have tackled him, held his hands
so he couldn't get his gun, and just held him there as long as it
took.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade, Taylor and Malloyd worked at finding Mosby.
It became a like second job, sometimes part-time, sometimes more.
</P>
<P>
   Neglecting their own businesses and even sometimes their
families, they hung thousands of ``wanted'' posters with Mosby's
mug shot. The earliest posters offered a $1,500 reward, but with
time and frustration, that grew to $5,000, then $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five years, they ran a weekly ad _ also offering
the reward _ in an East St. Louis newspaper. Tips poured in to a
dedicated phone line, but none panned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Thursday for years, when the paper came out, the whole
city knew we were looking for him,'' Taylor said. ``We ran the ad
especially around Christmas. Around that time, people would turn in
their own relatives for a reward.''
</P>
<P>
   They paid thousands of dollars in informant fees _ most often
$100 or $200 at a time, but on two occasions $500 to a neighbor of
Mosby's girlfriend who was watching out for him. Sometimes, they
suspected tipsters were lying, but they kept handing out money,
hoping the next lead would be the one.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts inside the phone company slipped them billing records
for Mosby's family. That created leads Taylor and Malloyd followed
to Indiana, Mississippi, California, Arkansas, Kentucky, and
numerous Illinois and Missouri communities.
</P>
<P>
   While on the road, Taylor and Malloyd set up stakeouts, complete
with binoculars, walkie-talkies and copies of Mosby's arrest
warrant. Over the years, police hauled them out of their car seven
or eight times, in response to calls about two ``suspicious
characters'' casing the neighborhood, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Several times they joined police on raids of places Mosby was
thought to be hiding, and once they took part in a stakeout at a
drug rehabilitation center, Taylor said. A tipster had insisted
Mosby was inside, registered under a false name. It wasn't him.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1996. The disappointment nearly broke Taylor's
spirit. And yet, more out of habit than hope, he continued his
practice of asking East St. Louis police to check national crime
computer records to see if Mosby had tangled with the law
somewhere, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, Taylor stopped by the police department to check
the computer one more time. He was owed good news; his mother had
died a day earlier after years in a stroke-induced coma.
</P>
<P>
   He waited, as he had so many times before, but this time
something was different: The request came back positive. An Ernest
Mosby was serving a 22-year murder sentence in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped for joy. I didn't believe it. We thought the computer
was wrong, thought it must be a different Ernest Mosby,'' Taylor
said. ``I must have asked a thousand times, `Are you sure, are you
sure?'''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, the right Ernest Mosby. Not long after, Mosby
was at last brought back to Illinois to face trial for Walter
Taylor's murder. But what happened next wasn't in Cedric Taylor's
script.
</P>
<P>
   State's Attorney Robert Haida, the chief county prosecutor, had
charged Mosby in Taylor's death 12 years earlier when Haida was an
assistant prosecutor. But now, when he looked closely at the case
against Mosby, he didn't like what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that our chances of conviction were impaired
by the passage of time,'' Haida said in an interview. He worried
that some of the witnesses against Mosby _ including the men who
accompanied him to Taylor's home _ had criminal records of their
own, and their testimony might have been suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There also was a very real possibility the defense would have
been that Walter Taylor was engaged in criminal activity at the
time that resulted in his death,'' Haida said.
</P>
<P>
   So Haida accepted a guilty plea from Mosby, now 38, in exchange
for a 20-year sentence, which likely will be cut to 10 for good
behavior. Moreover, it will be served in Florida, concurrently with
his sentence there, meaning Mosby will not spend a single extra day
in prison for Taylor's death.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Taylor's family sat in the courtroom, restraining
themselves as county Judge Jan Hiss accepted the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives the opportunity for the family to have closure,''
Haida said. ``It may not be perfect, but it's something I hope they
can ultimately be satisfied with.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At his kitchen table, surrounded by police reports and his
homemade ``wanted'' posters, Cedric Taylor said he understands the
reasons for the plea bargain. He doesn't blame Haida for the
outcome, and even praises the police who could never find Mosby.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also said he is glad he can tell his nieces and nephew
that their father's killer has pleaded guilty and is in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Walter Jr. appreciates that. ``I like to know that
when I get older, he's in jail, he wouldn't be out, to kill me,''
the boy said, looking to his uncle for approval.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, two thoughts still threaten to rob Taylor of sleep.
``The only thing we hated is he's not doing any time for my
brother's death. It's like he's doing free time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as troubling is his belief that the man who pointed Mosby
toward his brother's door still walks free.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since Mosby was brought to the St. Clair, Ill.,
County Jail from Florida, Taylor has tried repeatedly to speak with
him _ even offering to pay Mosby _ but Mosby refuses to see him.
Mosby also declined to speak with a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's bittersweet. If I could today, I'd fly to
Florida, whatever, to talk to him. We could talk through the glass.
He'd know I'm not trying to hurt him. I just want to find out what
truly happened that night,'' Taylor said.

   TAKE-BOS  
 ALEXANDRIA, Va.: ... political word.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Molinari and CBS seemed to write the whole thing off as a
good idea that didn't work, opinion on the venture varies. Like
many who were upset that the network's hiring of Molinari blurred
the line between politics and the press, Marvin Kalb, former CBS
correspondent and director of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard,
called the move a ``journalistic obscenity'' when she was hired.
Howard Kurtz, media critic for the Washington Post, said ``too many
people were waiting for her to stumble as she invariably did.''
Stephen Hess, analyst with the Brookings Institution, said Molinari
let herself be flattered by the network into making ``a very unwise
career choice as it turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Molinari made her decision last summer, she had some
reason to go. A political moderate who favored gun control and one
of few Republicans to vote for the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993, Molinari found that things had changed a lot since she took
office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there was Suby. Molinari said she cried every time
she left her daughter at home. Even with cribs and changing tables
in both her and Paxon's offices, time with her child was precious.
And when one night, as the clock neared midnight on the House
floor, Molinari looked down at her tiny daughter asleep in her lap
under the brillant lights, she knew something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through life and you wonder if you will ever have
children,'' Molinari sighs, watching her daughter clamber up the
stairs. ``For people who have gone through that, it's not hard to
understand my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that her beloved Republicans were beset with
infighting in the summer of 1997. Her political star, which had
glittered so in 1996 in the shared light of her mentor Bob Dole,
now seemed in near eclipse. Paxon, the congressman from Buffalo who
famously proposed to her on the House floor and then married her in
1994, had become Gingrich's protege and a Republican mover. What,
some wondered, was left for Molinari?
</P>
<P>
   ``When push comes to shove and two people are on the leadership
track and one happens to be the husband and one happens to be the
wife, it's the husband who moves,'' said Geraldine Ferraro, former
New York congresswoman and the first female vice presidential
nominee. ``I'm sorry, but that's true. She was not going to be the
one to move in House leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But if she took the CBS job, perhaps she could do even better.
``She would make twice the money, work a hell of a lot fewer hours,
be able to live like a real wife and mom, and with her husband in
the House leadership, she could hang out with political bigwigs and
be a celebrity,'' added Ferraro. ``She could have the benefits of
being in Congress without being in it. She would have it all. It
was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was one problem. Paxon wanted out, too. After 21 years
in politics, 10 in the US House, Paxon was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Determined, genial, and one of the House's most conservative
members, Molinari says, ``He's so straight he wears a belt with his
T-shirt.'' Paxon calls working in Congress ``the greatest job in
the world.'' For a man who hit the campaign trail at 5 _ his father
was a town supervisor and judge, his mother a state committeewoman
_ and who at 23 became the youngest member ever of the Erie County
Legislature, it was a choice that went to his core. But, as Paxon
saw it, if he stayed he wouldn't see Suby until she was 10. And he
would likely not have another child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would have been fair to have Susan take on
that responsibility alone,'' said Paxon, leaning forward earnestly
in jeans and a pressed plaid shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Did Molinari oppose his bid for leadership?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No. I would never do that,'' Molinari said fervently,
shaking her head. ``It was what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at one time he seemed to want it so much that, when he
announced he would not run again so he could be with his family, a
lot of people didn't believe him. As chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, Paxon had not only been
instrumental in many of the House Republican victories in 1994 and
1996, but had earned himself a coveted leadership slot. In the
aftermath of the coup against Gingrich in mid-1997, the
archconservative Paxon began exploring a run for House majority
leader _ which would position him to bid for speaker _ and by the
end of the year had visited more than 40 congressional districts on
behalf of colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the notoriously ambitious Paxon dropping out at the
start of 1998? Was it that he didn't have enough votes to topple
Majority Leader Dick Armey? What about that rumor that he was gay,
that he'd had an affair with a local journalist? Had someone made
it worth his while to quit?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, his decision made absolutely no sense,'' said Ferraro.
``I am baffled by his leaving. We all are. I do not think he wanted
to be with his kid. I mean, people do not quit jobs at the height
of their career to stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`They won't be hurting'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, then, maybe they do. ``Maybe it was just time to do
something else,'' said Marshall Wittmann, director of congressional
relations for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in
Washington. ``One commonality between Sue and Bill is they've spent
their entire adult lives in politics. Now neither one has a job.
But they won't be hurting. They'll both be sought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxon believes he might have taken Armey. As for the gay rumor,
he dismisses it with a wave of the hand. In fact, he says he really
made up his mind to step down two years ago. Shortly after the 1996
election, Paxon began to question his future. What was he going to
do next? Sit around and wait for 30 years to be chair of the
Commerce Committee? His daughter was only a few months old. His own
father, who died in 1997, was 42 when Paxon was born and he'd
seemed an old man to his son. Paxon thought hard about not running
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was committee chair, I thought, `This is why I am
here.' That was my epiphany. My moment,'' recalled Paxon. ``I had
pretty much decided to announce in 1997 I would not run again.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic events of 1997 caused Paxon to falter. Many were
urging him to run for majority leader. Headlines speculated he
would be the next speaker. But every time Paxon headed out on a
fund-raising trip, leaving Suby and Molinari behind, he knew it was
not what he wanted to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard Wesley, associate judge of the New York State
Court of Appeals and a friend of Paxon's who discussed the
possibility of Paxon's not running over several dinners at their
favorite Italian restaurant, said Paxon also decided it was
important that he leave while he was at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he realized that Armey had more votes, he realized if
ever he was to move to the private sector this would be the time at
which his earning power was at its peak,'' said Wesley. ``Clearly,
he recognized this was an opportunity in which he could maximize
his earning ability.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Paxon said, the choice was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I want to forgo my family and travel around the country,''
said Paxon. ``Or stick with the decision I had made in 1996? The
answer was easy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Politics, but not as usual
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Politics still pervades the house where Bill and Susan live. On
this day when the House will vote on a budget bill, Paxon glances
briskly at his watch several times in between changing a diaper and
answering the phone. In a back room, Gingrich is fulminating on CNN
but it is hard to hear him over the cartoon that has Suby screaming
in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   It is the height of campaign season, and normally on this
Columbus Day holiday, both Molinari and Paxon would be hip deep in
parade bunting and spaghetti up in New York. Instead, Paxon is off
to attend to his new ``house thing'' _ as Molinari distinguishes it
from his old ``House thing'' _ supervising the installation of a
sprinkler system at the house they are moving into. Molinari is
fresh back from a walk with the dog. Neither seems to particularly
miss the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't miss it at all,'' declares Paxon. ``I
thought I'd be a lot more angst-ridden about it, but I'm not. These
days, I'd much rather be with my daughter at the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely where Molinari is walking with Suby this
morning. And as Paxon pulls himself into their minivan, Molinari
calls out over the tricycles and balls and children playing on the
street and asks whether he will be home for dinner. He will be.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ It is late on a balmy fall morning, and in the
nation's capital, the air is crackling with crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trim dome of the Capitol, legislative leaders are
fiercely negotiating partisan differences that have percolated for
more than a year. Staffers citywide are gearing up for proceedings
that threaten to topple the American president. Elections that
could recast the nation's political balance loom large.
</P>
<P>
   In a modest stone house a few miles to the south, US
Representative Bill Paxon, R-New York, former party luminary and an
architect of the Republican revolution, is lounging on the couch
sucking on his daughter's red lollipop. His wife, Susan Molinari,
the former Staten Island congresswoman who addressed the 1996
Republican convention and was briefly a CBS anchor, is pregnant and
appropriately shoeless in the kitchen admonishing the dog, George
(named for Bush though she is a girl), for eviscerating a squirrel.
Suddenly, Paxon sits bolt upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you go poopie?'' Paxon quizzes his 2-year-old daughter,
Susan Ruby Paxon, who has perhaps made more political appearances
than any other toddler in America.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these people at home? Why will they be on television on
Election Day talking about everyone's election but their own? Why,
after decades of campaigning, of two lifetimes, really, inured in
politics, are they out of the game?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just over a year ago that Paxon and Molinari were the
golden couple, young Republicans on the rise, one of them destined
perhaps for high office? She was the ranking woman in Congress, the
ebullient pro-abortion-rights moderate who even Republicans liked
to love. He was the artful Republican angler, Speaker Newt
Gingrich's lieutenant and loyalist. Their courtship was fan mag
fodder, their wedding illuminated by scores of tabloid camera
bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   But then the story line swerved abruptly as the political power
couple flew too close to the sun, or so some would say. Last
summer, Molinari abruptly quit her seat of seven years to coanchor
``CBS Saturday Morning.'' The show was a bust. Molinari, 40, was
dumped in July after 10 months. Equally astounding, Paxon, 44, quit
too. Last summer, Paxon partook in a failed coup against Gingrich,
turned the situation around to become a lead candidate for speaker
himself only to declare in February that he would not run for
office again in order to spend more time with his wife and
daughter. Although the slender strategist said he wanted to spend
more time with his family, many suspected he quit because he
couldn't win. Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are two people with no job having a baby!'' trilled
Molinari, now in her fifth month. ``We are so insane.''
</P>
<P>
   The first part is not exactly true. Molinari, who got a generous
settlement from CBS to break her contract, is a fellow at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Government, where she is teaching a
course called ``Mr. and Ms. Smith Now Run Congress.'' An immensely
telegenic, chronically upbeat woman, she is considering several
lobbying and advocacy positions, and continues to appear on several
TV talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Paxon, however, will easily get the ranking lobbyist post of the
two of them when his term expires in December. Whatever firm he
joins _ and the latest rumor is that he will team up with outgoing
veteran US Representative Vic Fazio, D-Calif. _ he will continue to
wield enormous political clout while earning many times his
congressional salary. Which is a good thing as the couple is moving
to a new house to accommodate a growing family.
</P>
<P>
   All of which sounds a lot like a happy ending. Molinari and
Paxon will likely remain a Washington power couple of sorts,
although both insist they will not run for office again. But it
leaves many still wondering just why the two of them dropped out
when their political careers looked so astoundingly promising. Were
their wings, in fact, scorched by their own white-hot ambition? Or
did the couple's first child teach them something about priorities?
Or is it a more complex thing altogether, rooted in the polarities
of public and private life and perhaps even middle age itself?
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I have wanted to be married and have children. Now
I am,'' says Paxon, crossing his stockinged feet on the glass
coffee table. ``Who ever knew what Discovery Zone was? I love it.
This is where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to believe him. But not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Comfortable in Cambridge
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Susan Molinari is sitting at her empty desk at Harvard on the
first day of school looking nothing like the Susan Molinari who
beamed down at her 3-month-old daughter from the Republican podium
just two years ago. Her trim professional suit has been replaced by
a black maternity jumper and black flats. Her sculpted golden
coiffeur is now a self-ruled brunette pixie. Another Harvard fellow
walking down the hall stops dead at her doorway and looks at her
uncomprehendingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hair,'' she calls, pointing a frosted nail at her head.
</P>
<P>
   Later she explains she dyed her hair because her swelling body
has made it impossible for her to dress very creatively. ``So I
said to myself, `Neck up, we'll play!'''
</P>
<P>
   So, it is Molinari after all, the same diminutive (5-foot-2)
forthright, chatty, always-got-a-joke, retired cheerleader who
charmed New York voters and then Republican leaders. That it did
not work so well with a TV audience, that she seemed stiff and
saccharine and ill at ease all at once, that the ratings of her
``CBS Saturday Morning'' show were dismal, that her failure ended a
lifelong dream of a TV career, does not seem to have had a
particularly ruinous effect.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of commuting to New York, she now spends two nights a
week at a Cambridge, Mass. hotel so she can teach and meet with her
colleagues at the Institute of Politics, where she is a fall
fellow. The rest of the week she works from her cozy suburban home
with a gray minivan parked out front and a red barbecue parked out
back, while a nanny cares for the curly-headed Susan Ruby, a.k.a.
Suby.

   Molinari's course, a kind of congressional primer cum current
events seminar, not only allows her to look for a real job but to
talk politics. Cracking jokes and political one-liners, Molinari
seems more at ease behind the Harvard podium than she ever did
seated in her pumpkin-colored anchor's seat. At her second class,
she showed a few of her CBS broadcasts, warning the class of about
60, ``No one is allowed to laugh at my performance on television!''
</P>
<P>
   Giving it the most positive political spin, Molinari, in fact,
said she's glad the show is over. A third-generation politician,
she was the youngest member to serve in the New York City Council.
The coanchor job had her preside over a bland mix of political
featurettes and soft interviews while barring her from partisan
battle. But when the story was politics she itched for the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood what the job was about going in,'' she explained.
``What I didn't understand was how much I would miss being engaged
in the system. Politics is not just a job for me. It's my husband,
my father, my friends. It's my lifeblood. All of a sudden it's
election night and I'm watching it on CNN. I can't contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone understands how Molinari feels about all this, it may
be her father, Guy V. Molinari, former five-term congressman and
now Staten Island borough president, whose seat she filled in 1990
and with whom she lived in Washington in the early 1980s. Molinari
senior says his only child has never been happier. When Susan
stopped to visit her parents on her way to Harvard recently,
instead of talking politics the two of them watched a videotape of
her most recent ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is totally and completely enthralled by her baby,''
Molinari said. ``Before, we would have talked all politics. This
time I don't think we said a political word.''

BE SINGULAR IF YOU LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of readers were shocked _ and unpersuaded _ by my reply
last month to a question about the proper verb to use in the
sentence, ``He's one of those boys who (is/are) always boasting.''
My ruling was that are is the verb of choice; the sentence means
the same thing as ``He is among those boys who are always
boasting,'' and nobody would argue for a singular verb there.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters argued that one is the subject of the verb _
hence, one ... who is always boasting. Not so, though, if you
diagram the sentence: He is the subject, is is the verb, one is the
predicate nominative (hey, you in the back row, no yawning!). So
``he is one'' what? ``One of those boys who are (the whole group of
them) always boasting.'' The who refers to boys, not to he or one.
But parsing is almost beside the point: As I argued earlier, if all
the verbs go with that one boy, what's left for those boys to do in
the sentence? The sense seems to demand that they get their verb
too.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of full disclosure, though, I'd like to add that
English speakers do very often go for the singular verb in such
constructions _ and have done so for as long as the language has
existed. English is full of examples of ``notional agreement'' _
instances where we allow the meaning, rather than the singular or
plural form of a noun, to govern the verb. A family is bereaved, or
are divided, as the case may be; a crowd of people waits
expectantly, or jostle the doors, depending on whether unity or
division is the dominant idea.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way, a speaker who feels that the one is the main
idea in our sentence about those boastful boys is entitled, by long
tradition if not by strict logic, to use a singular verb. And to
the correspondents who made the original query, I hope your bet on
the outcome was both small and friendly.
</P>

Just rude, or also crude?

   Alfonse D'Amato, New York's big-mouthed and decidedly non-Jewish
senator, made headlines recently when he called his opponent in the
election race a putzhead _ to a gathering of Jewish supporters, no
less. Was this Yiddish slang (altered from the more usual putz) an
especially rude insult, or just the usual political mud?
</P>
<P>
   Putz, from the German for ``ornament,'' means ``penis'' in
Yiddish, but also, more broadly, ``fool, dope.'' Thirty years ago,
it would have been unspeakable in a campaign, even by Al D'Amato.
In ``The Joy of Yiddish'' (1968), Leo Rosten called it ``more
offensive than schmuck,'' a word with similar uses; it was ``not to
be used lightly, or when women or children are around,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Today, seeing words like putz and schmuck and dreck (with the
root meaning ``excrement'') often bothers readers who know them as
taboo words, and who may suspect non-Yiddish speakers of trying to
get away with vulgarities they wouldn't use in English. But these
words are following the same path as native English slang, evolving
from ``vulgar'' to ``slang'' to ``colloquial'' to, sometimes, just
plain English.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, judgments on slang's status can vary, both among
usage mavens and everyday people. The dictionary used at the Globe
calls putz only ``sometimes considered vulgar,'' but labels as
simply ``slang'' all the nonliteral uses of the s-word (hits the
fan, not worth a, and so on). That doesn't mean it's slang we want
to use every day, or even every week.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, my search turned up a surprise relating to the s-word.
It has always been allowed in the Globe in certain contexts, but
for some reason, usage hit its peak in 1979 (at 26 times for the
year). Was it the spirit of the age, or a Norman Mailer novel, or
some Nixon tapes that drove up the totals? Or did it dawn on our
collective unconscious that some words had to be kept in the taboo
drawer, or we'd have nothing to use when we really, really needed
to say something bad?

Copywriter's blues

</P>
<P>
   The epidemic of weird color names for clothes _ J. Crew had
perhaps the worst case _ had just about died out, it seemed. But a
flareup hit a local department store last weekend, infecting an
advertising circular that showed sweaters in ``nordic dusk,''
``pinkest,'' and _ hmm _ ``perineal blue.'' Perhaps a cross between
``periwinkle'' and ``teal'' was intended, or simply ``perennial.''
But ``perineal,'' in fact, refers to a part of the anatomy that is
not usually blue _ except, maybe, in mandrills.

   RUTLAND, Vt. _ Young Mary Miller wondered what the men were
doing with the big boxes.
</P>
<P>
   She stood in a crib by a window in Pittsfield, Mass. Her entire
family _ father, mother, 2-year-old brother _ was sick with
influenza, and strictly quarantined. It was autumn of 1918. Mary
was 4.Her paternal grandmother, aunt, and uncle would be dead of
influenza before the ordeal was over. But for now, she stood in
that crib and watched as men carried oblong wooden boxes from
houses next door and across the street. She wondered why there were
flowers on the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Caskets.
</P>
<P>
   She listened as church bells tolled, tolled, tolled. She
wondered why they didn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Mary _ now Mary Crandall _ survived the flu, as did her parents
and brother.
</P>
<P>
   Many others were not so lucky.

<P>
   They called it the ``Spanish influenza,'' this hideous pandemic
80 years ago this autumn. There was nothing Spanish about it _ in
truth, it seems to have begun mutating from animals to humans in
the Midwest _ but no matter.
</P>
<P>
   It killed a half-million Americans in 1918 and 1919, more than
died fighting World War I. It killed at least 20 million worldwide
and possibly as many as 40 million, more than died in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It killed fast, it killed horribly and it killed people most
unlikely to die of influenza as we know it: young and strong
between the ages of 15 and 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``It killed 25 million people in the world and half a million in
the United States, and then we forgot it,'' said historian Alfred
Crosby, author of ``Epidemic and Peace, 1918.''
</P>
<P>
   The first wave of the flu passed over the nation in spring,
nearly unnoticed. The second wave got people's attention.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1918, the flu hit simultaneously in Boston; Freetown,
Sierra Leone; and Brest, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``And suddenly it is a real killer, an unprecedented killer for
influenza,'' Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   It killed with ferocious speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very significant percentage died of straight viral
pneumonia,'' Crosby said. ``Their lungs would just fill up with
fluid and they would drown in 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, a few cases were reported among military personnel
at Commonwealth Pier &UR;  &LR; in Boston. Three days later, 58 men were
sick. It took seven days for the flu to spread to the civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public health warnings to avoid crowds, said historian
Thomas O'Connor of Boston College, a huge crowd gathered at Fenway
Park on Sept. 11 to see the Red Sox win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 24, 109 people died of the flu and pneumonia in Boston.
Two days later, 156.
</P>
<P>
   ``It moved through Boston so fast that people didn't know what
the hell was happening,'' Crosby said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, author of ``South Boston, My Hometown,'' said that in
some neighborhoods, black funeral wreaths hung on every door.
Boston didn't have enough gravediggers to keep up with the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can recall my father telling me of people going through the
streets with carts, knocking on the doors of houses and asking, `Do
you have any dead?''' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals were so full, and resources so depleted, that a ``flu
train'' was sent to Boston, its cars fashioned into hospital wards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In Somerville, half of all public school children had the flu.
Boston area schools were shut down. Thea-ters, churches and other
public gathering places were closed across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 6,508 Bostonians died of the flu and pneumonia in the
epidemic, according to census figures cited by Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Devens, with its overcrowded barracks, got clobbered. By
Sept. 24, the Globe reported, nearly 11,000 men there were sick.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 800 died. Corpses were stacked, it has often been said,
like cordwood.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sadie Philbrick and her infant child of a few days died
today at the Waltham Hospital from influenza. Mrs. Philbrick was 28
years of age and was the wife of Edward F. Philbrick, who is in
France with the 101st Infantry.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Boston Daily Globe, Sept. 20, 1918.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Boston and Ayer, the flu sped along railroad routes through
New England and eventually the nation. Soon, obituary columns in
newspapers from Pittsfield to Portland, Maine, swelled with reports
of deaths from the flu and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Osberg, her baby sister Louise, and her cousin Myrtle
all got the flu at the same time in Manchester, N.H., and were sent
into quarantine at a local hospital.

BIG SPRING TREND MAY BE NO TREND AT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gray pantsuits. Black ankle boots. Black turtlenecks.
In the fashion world, everyone dresses like clones for New York
fashion week. Like soldiers in an army, fashion editors sit in
identical black chairs and eagerly watch the models strut out in
next season's new uniform. Will it be pink sheath dresses this
time? Or white jumpsuits?
</P>
<P>
   Forget all that. On the first day of the spring fashion shows,
the biggest trend was no trend _ no uniform, no must-have trendy
item, no chic color. As the economy teeters and the millennium
approaches, some designers are acknowledging that women want to
dress the way they feel. And we all feel different.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Carolina Herrera presented images of a self-confident
woman who appreciates understated luxury, like a soft-pink leather
jacket or a beaded bustier. At the other end of the spectrum,
design houses Malibu, Boss Jr., and To The Max! embraced Generation
X and Y with funky garments like rhinestone jeans and Ca-pri pants
covered with zippers. The contrast is a great illustration that
fashion doesn't have to be predictable or universal. More than
anything, it can be fun and individualized.
</P>
<P>
   At the Girls Rule! show, which consisted of showings by six
companies, street chicness was the unifying theme. Malibu presented
an urban cowgirl with jeans covered with studs and stones and with
slits straight up the back of the legs. Design house Rgb unveiled a
black hooded sleeveless nylon dress with neon pink details and
purple sneakers. Its Ca-pri pants have zippered pockets at the knee
and the model wore huge Jackie O. sunglasses to complete the look.
</P>
<P>
   Boss Jr. was notable for its cool accessories: a four-star
general's cap, a belly chain, armbands, and gypsy-looking head
scarves in various colors. Buggirl's segment was the most
entertaining part of the show. First break dancers appeared, then a
skateboarder, a surfer, and a biker. One model walked while sucking
on a lollipop, another with a portable CD player strapped to her
hip. Their funky clothes included pants with one leg falling to the
ankle and one hemmed at the knee, drawstring hems, and hooded
pullovers.
</P>
<P>
   It was refreshing and energizing to see a group of design houses
not only targeting, but influenced by, younger consumers who are
gaining spending power. Precious few other designers will be
focused on younger generations this week; the majority of them are
still focused on the all-powerful baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Take Herrera's show, which was more classic, geared toward an
older customer. The designer used leather in pink, lilac, and
fuchsia. She paired it often with wide-leg pants and silk shirts.
Halter tops and gowns _ as well as bustiers _ were common, as were
sleeves rolled up to the elbow. One of the most striking outfits
was a bronze embroidered pant, paired with an ivory stretch-satin
top _ a sure head-turner. Another glam look was a 1950s-style beige
organza dress with a full skirt and black embroidered floral
pattern. It sure beats the gray pantsuit uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's audience reflected this fashion eclecticism. One woman
sported fuchsia hair while another made do with pin curlers. It was
only the first day of fashion week, but so far, anything goes.

   ALEXANDRIA, Va. _ It is late on a balmy fall morning, and in the
nation's capital, the air is crackling with crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trim dome of the Capitol, legislative leaders are
fiercely negotiating partisan differences that have percolated for
more than a year. Staffers citywide are gearing up for proceedings
that threaten to topple the American president. Elections that
could recast the nation's political balance loom large.
</P>
<P>
   In a modest stone house a few miles to the south, US
Representative Bill Paxon, R-New York, former party luminary and an
architect of the Republican revolution, is lounging on the couch
sucking on his daughter's red lollipop. His wife, Susan Molinari,
the former Staten Island congresswoman who addressed the 1996
Republican convention and was briefly a CBS anchor, is pregnant and
appropriately shoeless in the kitchen admonishing the dog, George
(named for Bush though she is a girl), for eviscerating a squirrel.
Suddenly, Paxon sits bolt upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you go poopie?'' Paxon quizzes his 2-year-old daughter,
Susan Ruby Paxon, who has perhaps made more political appearances
than any other toddler in America.
</P>
<P>
   Why are these people at home? Why will they be on television on
Election Day talking about everyone's election but their own? Why,
after decades of campaigning, of two lifetimes, really, inured in
politics, are they out of the game?
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just over a year ago that Paxon and Molinari were the
golden couple, young Republicans on the rise, one of them destined
perhaps for high office? She was the ranking woman in Congress, the
ebullient pro-abortion-rights moderate who even Republicans liked
to love. He was the artful Republican angler, Speaker Newt
Gingrich's lieutenant and loyalist. Their courtship was fan mag
fodder, their wedding illuminated by scores of tabloid camera
bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   But then the story line swerved abruptly as the political power
couple flew too close to the sun, or so some would say. Last
summer, Molinari abruptly quit her seat of seven years to coanchor
``CBS Saturday Morning.'' The show was a bust. Molinari, 40, was
dumped in July after 10 months. Equally astounding, Paxon, 44, quit
too. Last summer, Paxon partook in a failed coup against Gingrich,
turned the situation around to become a lead candidate for speaker
himself only to declare in February that he would not run for
office again in order to spend more time with his wife and
daughter. Although the slender strategist said he wanted to spend
more time with his family, many suspected he quit because he
couldn't win. Or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are two people with no job having a baby!'' trilled
Molinari, now in her fifth month. ``We are so insane.''
</P>
<P>
   The first part is not exactly true. Molinari, who got a generous
settlement from CBS to break her contract, is a fellow at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Government, where she is teaching a
course called ``Mr. and Ms. Smith Now Run Congress.'' An immensely
telegenic, chronically upbeat woman, she is considering several
lobbying and advocacy positions, and continues to appear on several
TV talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Paxon, however, will easily get the ranking lobbyist post of the
two of them when his term expires in December. Whatever firm he
joins _ and the latest rumor is that he will team up with outgoing
veteran US Representative Vic Fazio, D-Calif. _ he will continue to
wield enormous political clout while earning many times his
congressional salary. Which is a good thing as the couple is moving
to a new house to accommodate a growing family.
</P>
<P>
   All of which sounds a lot like a happy ending. Molinari and
Paxon will likely remain a Washington power couple of sorts,
although both insist they will not run for office again. But it
leaves many still wondering just why the two of them dropped out
when their political careers looked so astoundingly promising. Were
their wings, in fact, scorched by their own white-hot ambition? Or
did the couple's first child teach them something about priorities?
Or is it a more complex thing altogether, rooted in the polarities
of public and private life and perhaps even middle age itself?
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I have wanted to be married and have children. Now
I am,'' says Paxon, crossing his stockinged feet on the glass
coffee table. ``Who ever knew what Discovery Zone was? I love it.
This is where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to believe him. But not impossible.

   Susan Molinari is sitting at her empty desk at Harvard on the
first day of school looking nothing like the Susan Molinari who
beamed down at her 3-month-old daughter from the Republican podium
just two years ago. Her trim professional suit has been replaced by
a black maternity jumper and black flats. Her sculpted golden
coiffeur is now a self-ruled brunette pixie. Another Harvard fellow
walking down the hall stops dead at her doorway and looks at her
uncomprehendingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hair,'' she calls, pointing a frosted nail at her head.
</P>
<P>
   Later she explains she dyed her hair because her swelling body
has made it impossible for her to dress very creatively. ``So I
said to myself, `Neck up, we'll play!'''
</P>
<P>
   So, it is Molinari after all, the same diminutive (5-foot-2)
forthright, chatty, always-got-a-joke, retired cheerleader who
charmed New York voters and then Republican leaders. That it did
not work so well with a TV audience, that she seemed stiff and
saccharine and ill at ease all at once, that the ratings of her
``CBS Saturday Morning'' show were dismal, that her failure ended a
lifelong dream of a TV career, does not seem to have had a
particularly ruinous effect.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of commuting to New York, she now spends two nights a
week at a Cambridge, Mass. hotel so she can teach and meet with her
colleagues at the Institute of Politics, where she is a fall
fellow. The rest of the week she works from her cozy suburban home
with a gray minivan parked out front and a red barbecue parked out
back, while a nanny cares for the curly-headed Susan Ruby, a.k.a.
Suby.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari's course, a kind of congressional primer cum current
events seminar, not only allows her to look for a real job but to
talk politics. Cracking jokes and political one-liners, Molinari
seems more at ease behind the Harvard podium than she ever did
seated in her pumpkin-colored anchor's seat. At her second class,
she showed a few of her CBS broadcasts, warning the class of about
60, ``No one is allowed to laugh at my performance on television!''
</P>
<P>
   Giving it the most positive political spin, Molinari, in fact,
said she's glad the show is over. A third-generation politician,
she was the youngest member to serve in the New York City Council.
The coanchor job had her preside over a bland mix of political
featurettes and soft interviews while barring her from partisan
battle. But when the story was politics she itched for the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood what the job was about going in,'' she explained.
``What I didn't understand was how much I would miss being engaged
in the system. Politics is not just a job for me. It's my husband,
my father, my friends. It's my lifeblood. All of a sudden it's
election night and I'm watching it on CNN. I can't contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone understands how Molinari feels about all this, it may
be her father, Guy V. Molinari, former five-term congressman and
now Staten Island borough president, whose seat she filled in 1990
and with whom she lived in Washington in the early 1980s. Molinari
senior says his only child has never been happier. When Susan
stopped to visit her parents on her way to Harvard recently,
instead of talking politics the two of them watched a videotape of
her most recent ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is totally and completely enthralled by her baby,''
Molinari said. ``Before, we would have talked all politics. This
time I don't think we said a political word.''

DISCS FROM U2, STONES OFFER NO SATISFACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Superstar albums are an essential part of the holiday retail
season, but here's some news: You don't need to rush out to buy the
latest CDs by the Rolling Stones and U2. Those bands may be
stadium-level acts, but their new albums _ a live set from the
Stones and a double-CD of hits and B sides from U2 _ are pronounced
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Both records arrived in stories this week, but both are just
holding patterns for the next albums of original material.
</P>
<P>
   The Stones set, titled ``No Security,'' comes at a time when the
Stones are planning yet another tour _ of American arenas, rather
than stadiums, next spring. Look for the Stones at the FleetCenter
in Boston in March, says a source. And look for expensive tickets
that will top out at $300 (reported in the latest Daily Variety
magazine) and run from $150 to $50 for the nosebleed seats. The
Stones got similar prices when they played Madison Square Garden
last year, so they're giving it a go at other selected arenas.
</P>
<P>
   If the Stones release a live disc from the coming tour, one can
hope it will be better than the new ``No Security,'' culled from
shows on their ``Bridges to Babylon'' tour _ in Amsterdam, Buenos
Aires, St. Louis, Nuremberg, and MTV's ``Live From the 10 Spot.''
The music feels antiseptic, as if it's been cleaned up in the
studio. The tour was widely received as a fantastic event _ the
best Stones tour in years _ but the album is anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't even include ``Satisfaction,'' the potent opening
tune during the American leg of the tour. The live album opens
instead with ``You Got Me Rocking,'' which sounds generic by
comparison. There are some highlights as the set progresses _ a
soulful ``Gimme Shelter'' and scarifying ``Sister Morphine'' stand
out _ but there are only 14 songs and the live experience feels
truncated. And there are a lot of filler song versions (of ``Flip
the Switch'' and ``Memory Motel,'' for instance) that belie the
excitement of the tour.
</P>
<P>
   U2's new set, ``The Best of 1980-1990,'' also has its drawbacks.
One CD is devoted to the hits of that era and there's no quibbling
with it, as the Irish band moves from ``Pride (in the Name of
Love)'' through ``I Will Follow,'' ``Desire,'' and ``When Love
Comes to Town,'' with B.B. King. There's also a singles remix of
the R&AMP;B-inflected ``The Sweetest Thing'' (recently released to
radio), but this bass-boosted version is fake next to the original.
</P>
<P>
   The other CD, consisting of B sides, is a mess. True fans and
collectors will argue that it's important to release all of these B
sides onto one disc, but their general quality is an embarrassment.
Singer Bono makes up a lot of lyrics as he goes along, and most
songs are just sketchy demos. The best B sides are cover versions
of ``Everlasting Love'' and the Righteous Brothers hit ``Unchained
Melody.'' The worst are an acoustic ``Trash, Trampoline and the
Party Girl'' (``I know she wants more than a party,'' Bono sings of
a groupie); the watery ``Best Rap''; and the New Age truffle,
``Three Sunrises,'' with Bono singing, ``Spirit of the rising sun,
lift me up.'' It's almost as if a different band came in and did
some of these. It might have been better to release just a single
CD of hits.

SHARP CAT WITHDRAWAL WILL IMPACT BREEDERS' CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The withdrawal of Sharp Cat from the $2 million Distaff will
have a profound effect on Saturday's Breeders' Cup program at
Churchill Downs, on the track and at the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Cat, who suffered severe muscle cramps after galloping at
Churchill Saturday, has won all four of her races this year with
ease. She has gone wire-to-wire on each occasion and her tallies
have come by a combined margin of 23 lengths. The 4-year-old
daughter of Storm Cat easily would have been the biggest favorite
on the Breeders' Cup card. The Daily Racing Form listed her at
even-money in its early line for the mile and one-eighth Distaff,
while no other horse on the program was held lower than 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup is introducing the $5 million guaranteed Pick
6 this year and some had suggested that big bets might not be
forthcoming on the wager, in large part because the Distaff was not
competitive and most players would single Sharp Cat on their
ticket, reducing the Pick 6 to a Pick 5. Now, all of the Breeders'
Cup races appear wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Waly Dollase thinks Sharp Cat ``tied up,'' the racing
term for cramping, after becoming highly nervous when a siren went
off just as she was about to enter the track for her work. The
siren sounds when a rider is down and a horse is loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so bright and so smart and I think that's one reason
that she's a little more nervous than normal horses,'' said
Dollase. ``She holds it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Noted veterinarian Alex Harthill worked on Sharp Cat at length,
administering fluids to alleviate the pain. ``We went from 9:15
a.m. to 2 p.m. and we didn't know what was going to happen,'' said
Dollase. ``It was a life-threatening situation. Dr. Harthill did a
hell of a job and my help did a terrific job.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorite in the Distaff now will be 3-year-old Banshee
Breeze, who has won three straight Grade I races. She's a top
sophomore, but she's no Sharp Cat, the leading candidate to be the
female handicap champion. ``Sharp Cat may run again this year if
she makes a remarkable recovery,'' said Dollase. ``But she would
have to tell me she's ready to run.''

   Skip Away, who will have to be at his best to handle Silver
Charm and the powerful entry of Awesome Again, Touch Gold, and
Coronado's Quest in the $4.4 million Breeders' Cup Classic, is
working like gangbusters at Belmont Park. The big gray went a half
in :46 1/5, the fastest move of the morning, on Sunday under
regular rider Jerry Bailey, and will be shipped to Kentucky
Tuesday. ``I was tickled pink by what I saw,'' said trainer Sonny
Hine, whose charge remains the favorite for the Horse of the Year
title. ``I want to sharpen him up. We're putting a little pressure
on him this time. I think I was a little lackadaisical with him the
last couple of races. He responds better to faster training. It
makes him do better.'' ... Victory Gallop, winner of the Belmont
Stakes, worked 5 furlongs in 1:01 at Churchill Sunday in
preperation for the mile and one-quarter Classic. ``He went
great,'' said trainer Elliott Walden. ``He finished up better than
he started off, and that's really all we were looking for.'' The
3-year-old, who recently underwent minor surgery to correct an
entrapped epiglottis, will be facing older horses for the first
time in the Classic. ``It's probably the toughest race of all time
as far as depth goes,'' said Walden. ``I'd say we've got a real
chance. I do realize we're a sophomore playing against seniors,
but, on another note, he gets four pounds (older horses carry 126
pounds in the Classic, 3-year-olds 122). I think we're the best of
the 3-year-olds going in at this distance on this racetrack. Silver
Charm is going to be awfully tough to beat, but I think we've got a
chance to come late and pick up the pieces.'' ... Affirmed Success,
the likely choice in the $1 million Sprint, drilled 3 furlongs in a
rapid :34 4/5 on his way to a bullet work of :59 2/5 for 5 furlongs
at Churchill Sunday. ``He did it easily,'' said trainer Rick
Schosberg.

   Buffalo Dan, owned by the B E Stable and trained by Bill Perry,
was withdrawn from the Sprint after an old ankle injury flared up
following a workout at Monmouth Saturday. The 7-year-old gelding,
who has raced six times at Suffolk Downs during his career, would
have been a longshot in the Sprint. However, he had been in rare
form of late, winning four straight stakes before the flareup.
Perry, a leading trainer in New England for years before moving on
to greener pastures, also trained Formal Gold, who might have been
the favorite in last year's Classic, won by Skip Away, had he not
injured himself training at Hollywood Park the week of the race.
``The Breeders' Cup hasn't been real kind to me,'' said Perry ...
Suffolk will offer seven live races before the Breeders' Cup, with
first post at 10:30 a.m. The first race of the Breeders' Cup card,
the $1 million Juvenile, expected to feature Rick Pitino's The
Groom is Red, will go at 1:25 p.m. Suffolk will simulcast the
entire card from Churchill, including the local stakes, and offer
two pools on the Breeders' Cup races, the New England pool and the
national pool, which will allow shopping for odds ... Russell Baze,
the king of the Northern California circuit, moved into 10th on the
all-time victory list when he rode his 6,350th winner on Friday's
card at Bay Meadows. Baze passed the retired Carl Gambardella, who
rode in New England for most of his career. Bill Shoemaker leads
all riders with 8,833 victories.

ROOKIE EDWARDS HAS THAT GOAL-LINE TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The object of the game, lest we forget, is
to somehow or other advance the ball into the expanse of real
estate we fondly refer to as the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   There is always the cowardly way to score, of course. We call
this method kicking a field goal. No offense toward kickers,
especially our great friend Gino Cappelletti (who also managed to
score 42 touchdowns), but the older I get the more I hate field
goals. A game like that fiasco in Miami nine days ago shouldn't
even count. There is no way an overtime should be decided by a
field goal. That is most decidedly (itals)not(unitals) what the
game is all about. They should do away with placekicking entirely.
That's right. Run or pass for 1 extra point. Period. The goal
posts? So who cares about the goal posts? Anyway, there is another
way to score. Ever heard of a safety?
</P>
<P>
   So where were we? Oh yeah, touchdowns. They're supposed to be
the point. Push those other guys around until somebody emerges into
the end zone with the ball in his possession.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while a guy arrives in town who seems to have
the knack of scoring. You don't think it's that big a deal until
someone starts doing it with regularity. You may think that, hey,
once you get close to the end zone (itals)somebody(unitals) will
get in there, but it doesn't work that way. Some people just
naturally have a better idea how to get to the football version of
the Promised Land, and it is possible that Robert Edwards just
happens to be one of those people.
</P>
<P>
   The young man from Tennille, Ga. (arch-rival Captain, Ga.,
perhaps?) has played in eight National Football League games and he
has scored eight touchdowns. You probably know that's good, but the
chances are it's a lot better achievement than you think.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those eight touchdowns have come on the ground, and, in
Patriots lore, that's significant. After eight games he is tied for
the seventh-highest one-season rushing touchdown total in team
history. That's not bad for eight games, especially your first
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   His seven rushing TDs already tie him with Leonard Russell
('93), John Stephens ('89), Mack Herron ('74), and Jim Nance ('67
and '70). He is one behind Marion Butts ('94). He is two behind Don
Calhoun ('80) and Sam Cunningham ('75). He is three behing Tony
Collins ('83).
</P>
<P>
   When he hits 11, he'll have tied Nance (1966) and Horace Ivory
(1978). Next up will be Steve Grogan, who ran for a fairly amazin'
12 in 1976. On the distant horizon he can see all-time leader
Curtis Martin, who scored 14 touchdowns in both 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   I know what some of the younger set is thinking. Horace
(itals)Who?(unitals) There is no doubt the name doesn't belong with
the others. Horace Ivory was a running back out of Oklahoma who
played for the Patriots from 1977-81. For some reason, he was a
regular TD machine in '78, scoring 11 of his 14 career rushing TDs
that year. If there was some Joe Hardy thing going on, no one ever
heard about it, nor was there a Broadway musical, not even if you
count Broadway in Everett or Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has gotten most of his touchdowns the old-fashioned way
_ bulldozing his way through the big turkeys stacked up in his
path. Five of his scores have gone into the books as 1-yard runs,
which can mean anything from 1 inch to 2 feet 11 1/2 inches, but
which always constitute the toughest yardage on the football field.
His other two scores have come from 7 and 8 yards, and, again, this
is extraordinarily tough yardage to come by. It's a lot harder than
having a play break perfectly, having a defensive guy or two blow
an assignment, and finding yourself flying home from 46 or 73
yards, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is listed at 5-11 and 218, so he's neither real small
nor real huge. It's a fairly typical physical package, but the
early returns suggest we might be talking about a somewhat more
than typical player, as befits a No. 1 draft pick. The truth is
that the basic Robert Edwards talent was not questioned by many.
The trick for the team that drafted him, according to the
draftniks, would be to keep him healthy enough to play in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   There was more individual pressure on him than on anyone in the
lineup, since he was the replacement for the much-beloved Martin.
I'm not going to say he has made people forget Martin, but let's
just say that running back is nowhere near the issue it could have
been, and that it's no issue at all when the team gets close to the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would classify him as a slasher,'' says Pete Carroll. ``He
runs the ball well inside and he attacks the line of scrimmage.
When he goes outside, he has shown the ability to make a change of
direction, although that's not really his game. He does a very nice
job of deflecting tacklers. He's also got hands. He definitely has
the ability to catch the football. Put it all together and he's a
pretty complete football player.''
</P>
<P>
   He has made life easier for both quarterback Drew Bledsoe and
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese, because when the team drives
inside the 10-yard line (can we call this the Infrared Zone? I'm
just asking) they have options that weren't available last year. Go
ahead. Ask me how many rushing touchdowns the Patriots had in 1997.
The answer is 6.
</P>
<P>
   It may be simplistic to suggest that Robert Edwards is the
difference, but it may not be, either.

 ALEXANDRIA, Va.: ... political word.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Molinari and CBS seemed to write the whole thing off as a
good idea that didn't work, opinion on the venture varies. Like
many who were upset that the network's hiring of Molinari blurred
the line between politics and the press, Marvin Kalb, former CBS
correspondent and director of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard,
called the move a ``journalistic obscenity'' when she was hired.
Howard Kurtz, media critic for the Washington Post, said ``too many
people were waiting for her to stumble as she invariably did.''
Stephen Hess, analyst with the Brookings Institution, said Molinari
let herself be flattered by the network into making ``a very unwise
career choice as it turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Molinari made her decision last summer, she had some
reason to go. A political moderate who favored gun control and one
of few Republicans to vote for the Family and Medical Leave Act of
1993, Molinari found that things had changed a lot since she took
office in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there was Suby. Molinari said she cried every time
she left her daughter at home. Even with cribs and changing tables
in both her and Paxon's offices, time with her child was precious.
And when one night, as the clock neared midnight on the House
floor, Molinari looked down at her tiny daughter asleep in her lap
under the brillant lights, she knew something had to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through life and you wonder if you will ever have
children,'' Molinari sighs, watching her daughter clamber up the
stairs. ``For people who have gone through that, it's not hard to
understand my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that her beloved Republicans were beset with
infighting in the summer of 1997. Her political star, which had
glittered so in 1996 in the shared light of her mentor Bob Dole,
now seemed in near eclipse. Paxon, the congressman from Buffalo who
famously proposed to her on the House floor and then married her in
1994, had become Gingrich's protege and a Republican mover. What,
some wondered, was left for Molinari?
</P>
<P>
   ``When push comes to shove and two people are on the leadership
track and one happens to be the husband and one happens to be the
wife, it's the husband who moves,'' said Geraldine Ferraro, former
New York congresswoman and the first female vice presidential
nominee. ``I'm sorry, but that's true. She was not going to be the
one to move in House leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   But if she took the CBS job, perhaps she could do even better.
``She would make twice the money, work a hell of a lot fewer hours,
be able to live like a real wife and mom, and with her husband in
the House leadership, she could hang out with political bigwigs and
be a celebrity,'' added Ferraro. ``She could have the benefits of
being in Congress without being in it. She would have it all. It
was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was one problem. Paxon wanted out, too. After 21 years
in politics, 10 in the US House, Paxon was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Determined, genial, and one of the House's most conservative
members, Molinari says, ``He's so straight he wears a belt with his
T-shirt.'' Paxon calls working in Congress ``the greatest job in
the world.'' For a man who hit the campaign trail at 5 _ his father
was a town supervisor and judge, his mother a state committeewoman
_ and who at 23 became the youngest member ever of the Erie County
Legislature, it was a choice that went to his core. But, as Paxon
saw it, if he stayed he wouldn't see Suby until she was 10. And he
would likely not have another child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it would have been fair to have Susan take on
that responsibility alone,'' said Paxon, leaning forward earnestly
in jeans and a pressed plaid shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Did Molinari oppose his bid for leadership?
</P>
<P>
   ``No. No. I would never do that,'' Molinari said fervently,
shaking her head. ``It was what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at one time he seemed to want it so much that, when he
announced he would not run again so he could be with his family, a
lot of people didn't believe him. As chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, Paxon had not only been
instrumental in many of the House Republican victories in 1994 and
1996, but had earned himself a coveted leadership slot. In the
aftermath of the coup against Gingrich in mid-1997, the
archconservative Paxon began exploring a run for House majority
leader _ which would position him to bid for speaker _ and by the
end of the year had visited more than 40 congressional districts on
behalf of colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   So why was the notoriously ambitious Paxon dropping out at the
start of 1998? Was it that he didn't have enough votes to topple
Majority Leader Dick Armey? What about that rumor that he was gay,
that he'd had an affair with a local journalist? Had someone made
it worth his while to quit?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, his decision made absolutely no sense,'' said Ferraro.
``I am baffled by his leaving. We all are. I do not think he wanted
to be with his kid. I mean, people do not quit jobs at the height
of their career to stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`They won't be hurting'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But, then, maybe they do. ``Maybe it was just time to do
something else,'' said Marshall Wittmann, director of congressional
relations for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in
Washington. ``One commonality between Sue and Bill is they've spent
their entire adult lives in politics. Now neither one has a job.
But they won't be hurting. They'll both be sought out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxon believes he might have taken Armey. As for the gay rumor,
he dismisses it with a wave of the hand. In fact, he says he really
made up his mind to step down two years ago. Shortly after the 1996
election, Paxon began to question his future. What was he going to
do next? Sit around and wait for 30 years to be chair of the
Commerce Committee? His daughter was only a few months old. His own
father, who died in 1997, was 42 when Paxon was born and he'd
seemed an old man to his son. Paxon thought hard about not running
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was committee chair, I thought, `This is why I am
here.' That was my epiphany. My moment,'' recalled Paxon. ``I had
pretty much decided to announce in 1997 I would not run again.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic events of 1997 caused Paxon to falter. Many were
urging him to run for majority leader. Headlines speculated he
would be the next speaker. But every time Paxon headed out on a
fund-raising trip, leaving Suby and Molinari behind, he knew it was
not what he wanted to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Richard Wesley, associate judge of the New York State
Court of Appeals and a friend of Paxon's who discussed the
possibility of Paxon's not running over several dinners at their
favorite Italian restaurant, said Paxon also decided it was
important that he leave while he was at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he realized that Armey had more votes, he realized if
ever he was to move to the private sector this would be the time at
which his earning power was at its peak,'' said Wesley. ``Clearly,
he recognized this was an opportunity in which he could maximize
his earning ability.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Paxon said, the choice was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I want to forgo my family and travel around the country,''
said Paxon. ``Or stick with the decision I had made in 1996? The
answer was easy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Politics, but not as usual
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Politics still pervades the house where Bill and Susan live. On
this day when the House will vote on a budget bill, Paxon glances
briskly at his watch several times in between changing a diaper and
answering the phone. In a back room, Gingrich is fulminating on CNN
but it is hard to hear him over the cartoon that has Suby screaming
in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   It is the height of campaign season, and normally on this
Columbus Day holiday, both Molinari and Paxon would be hip deep in
parade bunting and spaghetti up in New York. Instead, Paxon is off
to attend to his new ``house thing'' _ as Molinari distinguishes it
from his old ``House thing'' _ supervising the installation of a
sprinkler system at the house they are moving into. Molinari is
fresh back from a walk with the dog. Neither seems to particularly
miss the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't miss it at all,'' declares Paxon. ``I
thought I'd be a lot more angst-ridden about it, but I'm not. These
days, I'd much rather be with my daughter at the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely where Molinari is walking with Suby this
morning. And as Paxon pulls himself into their minivan, Molinari
calls out over the tricycles and balls and children playing on the
street and asks whether he will be home for dinner. He will be.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... exaggerated style.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of Gould's playing and conception, the
aforementioned spirit of adventure shines through on the new CD.
But no one better symbolizes the restless, artistic quest in the
latter half of the 20th century than jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.
Actually, his career as a group leader (and trendsetter) began
right before the mid-century mark in 1948, when he formed the nonet
known as the Birth of the Cool.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the title of the Capitol LP that remains one of
the most influential recordings in jazz history, considering that
it led to the West Coast sound of Gerry Mulligan, the
jazz-classical fusions of John Lewis's Modern Jazz Quartet and
Gunther Schuller's third stream, and Gil Evans's orchestral
explorations with Davis and others. All those musicians were part
of the nonet, along with Max Roach, Lee Konitz, J.J. Johnson, and
Kai Winding.
</P>
<P>
   As Gary Giddins writes in his new book, ``Visions of Jazz,''
``Its musicians redesigned jazz in the '50s, calming bop's fevers,
soothing its brow, bringing wreaths to the entombment. Counterpoint
and polyphony reappeared, tempos slowed, timbre lightened.''
</P>
<P>
   What one hears on the remastered studio sessions is an uncanny
warmth not often associated with CD transfers, a warmth owing to a
style of playing and arranging. There's a calmness that feels
vibrant on these sides, not the transcendental calmness of
Gregorian chant, but that of walking out after an all-night poker
game into the cool dawn of a city just starting to come to life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Live performance, too
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Capitol didn't stop at reissuing the studio sides,
but also material from the nonet's live performances at the Royal
Roost, the only live session except for a brief reunion at the
Clique Club the following year. On this recording one hears the
opposite of Dylan's Manchester concert. Instead of self-righteous
agitation, there's something completely different happening with
the Royal Roosters _ the chatter of indifference. The music was so
different from jazz's twin towers of swing and bop that the
audience, and Capitol Rec-ords, didn't know what to make of it, and
the musicians went their own revolutionary ways.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, one does hear the same thing on ``The Complete Birth
of the Cool'' as on ``Dylan 1966'' and Gould's performance of
Brahms _ artists and musicians who are so sure of themselves that
the audience's reaction is nothing but background noise. The
playing is so tight, whether by the nonet, the Band, or Bernstein
and the Philharmonic, that it's obvious how aware everyone onstage
is that something important is happening and whether Mr. Jones
knows it or not, it couldn't matter less. (``Ballad of a Thin Man''
is one of the highights of the Dylan set.)
</P>
<P>
   Not all musical history is made on the concert stage. While it's
great to have the Birth of the Cool appearances at the Royal Roost,
it's still the studio sessions that define the Cool's cool. A
couple of new CDs extend the resurrection of the late Argentinian
artist Astor Piazzolla. Because of the popularity of the cheesy
``Forever Tango'' and Yo-Yo Ma's enervated ``Soul of the Tango,''
we tend to think of Piazzolla as a rather static artist, who made
pleasant enough tango music. ``Tango: Zero Hour,'' a re-release of
Piazzolla's own quintet, on Nonesuch, and ``Maria de Buenos
Aires,'' violinist Gidon Kremer's re-recording of the composer's
operita, Piazzolla emerges as an artist who, like Dylan, Davis,
Gould, Bernstein _ and, lest we forget, Brahms _ never stopped
searching for new modes of expression.
</P>
<P>
   The Nonesuch CD, a re-release of the 1986 CD on American
 &UR; gfspanish &LR;  Clave, is the tougher of the two _ dissonant and
angular, like a losing night at the aforementioned poker game. In
his liner notes, former Globe colleague Fernando Gonzalez writes
that Piazzolla imagined zero hour, or la hora cero, as the time
after midnight, ``an hour of absolute end and absolute beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gorgeous playing
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kremer is Piazzolla's most musically articulate champion, and
after two excellent CDs, also on Nonesuch, he has crossed the
Warner Music hallway to Teldec for what emerges as a real
revelation, a re-recording of Piazzolla's tango operita, ``Maria de
Buenos  &UR; gfspanish &LR;  Aires.''
</P>
<P>
   Kremer's playing is unspeakably gorgeous, simultaneously joyful
and sorrowful, passionate and thoughtful, sexy and violent. His
group, Kremerata Musica, has expanded from the quartet of the first
two recordings into an octet of like-minded and extremely talented
Euros who sound as if they were weaned on the tango. (Don't go
getting huffy about musical colonialism _ Piazzolla was nothing if
not a one-worlder, having studied with Nadia Boulanger and honing
his craft in New York City.) At any rate, Argentine singers Julia
Zenko and Jairo joined librettist Horacio Ferrer and a Buenos Aires
chorus for what Kremer calls, with more than passing justification,
the Schubert Ninth of Piazzolla's career. The production is as
overpowering as the music.
</P>
<P>
   Maria is the central character in the opera, a prostitute whose
allure combines Carmen and the Virgin Mary. Kremer writes that
Ferrer's surreal poetry is untranslatable, although a friend whose
Spanish is much better than mine says that it's just plain
pretentious. My advice is to read the synopsis and listen to the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Piazzolla and Kremer's group, like the Davis nonet, Dylan and
the Band, and Gould, may all be working in different genres, but
these CDs, all made at the height of their artistry, take us into a
parallel universe where all things are possible as long as the
quest is handled with single-minded passion. In opening their
vaults to the past, we can only hope that these record companies
are taking us back to the future.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1966, Bob Dylan gave a series of concerts that literally
electrified the history of popular music. As bootleg copies of one
of these concerts began circulating a few years later, it seemed
like only a matter of time until he and his record company,
Columbia, would release it to the public.
</P>
<P>
   With the release of ``Bob Dylan Live 1966'' we can join along as
he sings, ``This is what salvation feels like after a while.''
Since the ``after a while'' is 32 years, it is both overstating _
and understating _ to say that it has been worth the wait. Dyl-an's
concert isn't the only blast from the past that's getting attention
these days as recording companies of every musical stripe have been
entering their vaults in search of new old product. &UR;  &LR; And after
listening to several of the results recently _ the infamous Glenn
Gould-Leonard Bernstein recording of Brahms's Piano Concerto No. 1,
Miles Davis's ``Birth of the Cool,'' a pair of Astor Piazzolla CDs,
and Dylan's _ such musical archeology makes everything old seem new
again.
</P>
<P>
   There has been criticism of these re-releases as living in the
past and pandering to baby-boom nostalgia. I have to admit that
Dylan's double CD does bring back a flood of memories from his
Boston stop on the tour, when it seemed as if the now-demolished
Back Bay Theater on Massachusetts Avenue was going to erupt in
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   As you may have read by now, Dylan split all these concerts in
two, the first half being a warmly and politely received set of
some of his most poetic songs like ``Desolation Row'' and ``Mr.
Tambourine Man.'' Always in the audience's sightline, though, were
the drums, electric guitars, and keyboards signaling that this was
the calm before the raise-the-roof second set. The CD is subtitled
``The `Royal Albert Hall' Concert,'' because the bootleg was
mislabeled; the concert was actually in Manchester, England, about
six months after the Boston date. But wherever they played, Dylan
and the band that would later be the Band ripped through the set
like the Allied army. Some of the crowd acted like they wanted to
stone the invaders for betraying their precious folk music, and the
others realized that the hour of liberation was at hand. In Boston,
one of the fascist folkies (guess which side I was on) yelled out
``Play `Long Tall Sally,' Bobby'' _ as if that would be
confirmation of Dylan's ``sellout'' _ while a brave defender yelled
back, ``If you don't like the music, you should have left at
intermission.'' It seemed only a matter of time before a fight
broke out, but it was only a war of words and Dylan calmly cut
through it. At the end, a stunned Mr. Jones in front of me turned
to his girlfriend and hissed, ``Phil Ochs won't have a rock 'n'
roll group with him next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD is a brilliant evocation of those times with sensational
sound (compared with the bootlegs), Dylan in fine voice and even
finer attitude, and Robbie Robertson providing the precise but
passionate fills he'd become famous for.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gould, Bernstein, Brahms
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You didn't have to live through that era, of course, to
appreciate the historical importance of this recording (thanks in
part to Tony Glover's great liner notes). One of the great boons of
the CD era is to bring musical history of all kinds to life,
whether that history was formed by quiet storms or the bottled
lightning of ``Dylan '66.''
</P>
<P>
   Dylan's parent company, Sony, also has released a concert that
has been as eagerly awaited by classical buffs as ``Dylan 66'' was
by his fans _ the performance of Brahms's first piano concerto by
Glenn Gould and Leonard Bernstein during the 1962 New York
Philharmonic season.
</P>
<P>
   This concert created as many headlines as Dyl-an's, not because
Gould came out in a leather jacket or played an electric piano, but
because he chose such broad tempos that Bernstein felt compelled to
disassociate himself from the effort. Sony _ or Columbia, as it was
until recently _ never released the concert, because Schuyler
Chapin, director of Columbia Masterworks, decided it wouldn't stand
up to repeated listening. (``What a truly big mistake I made,'' he
confessed on a promotional LP that led to some CD bootlegs. The
liner notes are repeated on this CD. One thing all these recordings
share is great liner notes putting the music in historical
perspective.)
</P>
<P>
   As legend has it, Bernstein's actions were churlish and
egotistical. The feeling was that he should have just shut up or
recruited someone else to accompany Gould. The new CD suggests
otherwise on almost all counts. First, the conception is not all
that radical by contemporary standards. Gould must have been
smiling down from his celestial keyboard when Bernstein recorded
the piece in 1984 with Krystian Zimerman in 54 minutes and 3
seconds, 23 seconds longer than the Gould version. Secondly,
Gould's playing is quite wonderful in spots, so, of course, it
bears repeated listening. And Bernstein was hardly a churl. Sony
smartly has sandwiched the performance with Bernstein's opening
remarks and an interview with Gould saying that Bernstein spoke
``full of the best of intentions'' and that far from being
offended, he, Gould, ``could hardly stop laughing'' when he came
out &UR;  &LR; onstage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The soul of expression
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what these two CDs have in common is the sense that they
contain the very soul of artistic expression and exploration, what
Bernstein called in his remarks ``that factor of curiosity,
adventure and experiment.'' He could have been talking about Dylan,
or any other major artist. Glover points out how Dylan's '66 tour
had arisen from the previous one, chronicled in ``Don't Look
Back,'' when Dylan was boring himself half to death by playing the
same songs night after night on solo guitar and mouth harp. Gould,
too, was after something different, which he explains in the
interview _ ``getting away from the virtuoso showing off'' and
connecting to the composer through a more baroque, less exaggerated
style.

UNIVERSAL GETS READY TO ROAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything from leaping dinosaurs to jumping night spots will
soon be part of a transformed Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla.
The property is expanding from a single theme park into an entire
resort destination called Universal Studios Escape. Here's what it
will contain, and the approximate timetable:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _CityWalk. &LR;  Opening later this year, CityWalk will be a 30-acre
mix of shops, restaurants, clubs, restaurants, and movie theaters.
Among them: All Star Collectibles, Fossil, Bob Marley _ A Tribute
to Freedom, Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville, the Motown Cafe, Pat
O'Brien's, the Hard Rock Cafe and Hard Rock Live, and the
20-screen, 5,000-seat Universal Cineplex.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Islands of Adventure. &LR;  This is the one that theme-park fans
have been waiting for, and a summer 1999 opening is planned. The
five islands _ Seuss Landing, Marvel Super Hero Island, the Lost
Continent, Jurassic Park, and Toon Lagoon _ will be the happy home
of what Universal calls the most technologically advanced
attractions ever. Among them: Dueling Dragons, the world's first
dual racing roller coasters; The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man,
which uses 3-D film, live action, and a new kind of motion
simulator; the Hulk Coasters, which will hurl riders (who hopefully
won't ``hurl'') upward, then send them careening in zigzags 10
stories above the ground; Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls, which
will send flume riders plummeting 75 feet downward, going beneath
the surface of the water; and gentler, vibrantly colored
attractions such as the Cat in the Hat ride.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Universal Studios Florida. &LR;  This is the theme park that has
been saluting the movies with rides, shows, and other attractions
since 1990, and it's still fun. Among the favorites: Twister ...
Ride It Out, Terminator 2 3D, E.T. Adventure, Back to the Future:
the Ride, Jaws, and A Day in the Park with Barney. Coming next
summer: Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone. (I nearly slugged Woody once,
but that's another story.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Portofino Bay Hotel and the Hard Rock Hotel. &LR;  These will be
the first of five hotels on the property. Opening in summer 1999,
the 750-room Portofino Bay will seek to re-create the charm and the
harbor setting of the Mediterranean seaside village. The Hard Rock
Hotel, coming in 2000, will have 650 rooms and be styled like a
California mission. To no one's surprise, rock 'n' roll memorabilia
will abound.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Universal Studios Escape will encompass more than 840
acres. You can walk from area to area or take a water shuttle. Plan
on at least two full days to see it all. Combination ticket deals
are being offered, including some that also allow admission to Sea
World and Wet and Wild, the water park now owned by Universal.
Orlando continues to amaze.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; And speaking of Universal: &LR;  Universal Studios has acquired a prime
stake in the Port Aventura theme park in sunny Tarragona, Spain,
near Barcelona. The complex will be expanded from its current 300
acres to 2,000 acres, making it Europe's largest theme park, with
many new rides and attractions. Some say that Spain, and not
France, is where Disney should have built its Euro-park.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Travel Trivia: &LR;  OK, many of us know that Mount Everest is the
highest point in the world and Mount McKinley is the highest point
in the United States and North America. But what's the highest
point in the continental United States? (Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``A bouquet of flowers to France.'' _ Claude Monet,
whose art is on exhibit at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts through
Dec. 27, and whose favorite food is being featured at special
five-course dinners at Julien, the Hotel Meridien's signature
restaurant. For more information on the ``Monet in the 20th
Century'' exhibit, call 617-542-MFA. For more information on the
$95 Monet dinners, to be served Oct. 29 and Nov. 5, call
617-451-1900, ext. 7120.

needs to WIN a price when you pay $11 American for a hamburger?'')

 &UR; In a name:  &LR; The Big Island is aptly named: It's more than twice the
size of all Hawaii's other islands combined. (With thanks to the
``Berlitz Hawaii Pocket Guide.'')
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Fighting back: &LR;  Puerto Rico was hit hard by HurricaneGeorges, but
recovery efforts have been herculean, and now there's a lot for
visitors to enjoy while at the same time further boosting the
island's recovery. As Reinhard Werthner, managing director of the
Westin Rio Mar Beach Resort &AMP; Casino, puts it, ``The quickest and
best way to get this island back on its feet completely is to fill
every guest room on the island.'' The Rio Mar is doing its part by
offering a $155 per room per night ``Puerto Rico Now'' rate through
Dec. 23. That's barely more than half the standard rack rate at
this deluxe resort, which includes a wide beach, two top golf
courses, a tennis club, and several kinds of restaurants. For more
information, call 800-WESTIN-1 or 787-888-6000, or visit

 &UR; Always a good rule: &LR;  Tokyo's subway stations offer storage lockers.
But posted rules request that no bodies be stored in them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Freebie: &LR;  To commemorate Veterans Day, Boston Duck Tours is
offering free rides to all wartime and peacetime veterans Nov. 9
through 13. Vets need only show proof of service, preferably
discharge papers or a membership card in a veterans' organization,
but a uniform, medals, ribbons, or signed statements from former
superior officers will do. The land-and-sea tours of Boston are
conducted in the same amphibious vehicles that helped to liberate
Europe and the South Pacific in World War II. For more information,
call 617-723-DUCK or visit www.bostonducktours.com.

TODD HAYNES MINES GLITTER OF GLAM ROCK'S ENDLESS PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a time of flamboyance and hedonism, of bisexual chic and
open drug use. It was a scene caught in a hazy zone between
innocence and decadence. It was when a segment of rock 'n' rollers
was moving away from scruffy ``reality'' (T-shirts, jeans, long
hair, a blues basis) and toward something a little sexier and
sleazier, something more evocative and provocative. It was a sound
tinged with cabaret and show-music aesthetics, imbued with wit and
irony. The players were all dressed up for the endless party.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't last long and, with a few exceptions, it never
happened aross the United States. It was a London phenomenon, to a
lesser degree a New York one.
</P>
<P>
   It was glam rock, and it flickered during the early to
mid-1970s. As a pre-teen growing up in California, Todd Haynes was
fascinated by the faraway sounds and images of David Bowie, T. Rex,
Roxy Music, Slade, and the Sweet in England, the New York Dolls and
Lou Reed in New York, Iggy and the Stooges in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Haynes, now 37, began filming ``Velvet Goldmine,'' an
homage to the glam rock era. The movie finds a New York-based
British reporter, Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), researching a
story on the rise, fall, and disappearance of a fictional
glam-rocker named Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Stuart is
tracking down the players in 1984, but he revisits the time when he
was a young, star-struck glam fan.
</P>
<P>
   What attracted Haynes to glam rock and unearthing its beautiful
corpse?
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is implicit in the question,'' says Haynes, at the
Four Seasons recently. ``It was a singular period in rock
experience, and it's the most startlingly overlooked period in
terms of films, the only exception maybe being `The Rocky Horror
Picture Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Real-life counterparts
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Bowie's ``Ziggy Stardust'' story _ the rise and fall of a
rock star/alien _ is woven throughout the film, and we also meet
characters based on real-life counterparts. There's Curt Wild, an
Iggy Pop/Lou Reed composite played by Ewan MacGregor; Slade's
manager, Jerry Devine (comic Eddie Izzard), based on Bowie's Tony
DeFries; Slade's wife, Mandy (Toni Collette), based on Bowie's
former wife, Angie. The film liberally features original period
music from Roxy Music and Brian Eno _ as well as cover versions of
songs from the Stooges, T. Rex, and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film takes a fanciful view, the way it plays with real
history and takes figures like this and turns them into space
invaders,'' says Haynes. ``Nothing in the film should be taken in
any (literal) way, in the tradition of bio-pics where people look
for behind-the-scenes dirt on things. That's not what this film is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the film plays with reality, suggests Haynes, might be
analogous to the way glam rock toyed with what was real and what
was artifice. ``To put too much emphasis on the `truth' is
something that I think is an impossibility,'' he says, ``and is
also to miss the point of glam, which is suggesting for the first
time in rock that truth and authenticity is not the point. ... Glam
rock offered an active role on the part of the audience. It really
did inspire kids to dress up and make themselves up and change
themselves and try new things.''
</P>
<P>
   For Haynes, ``Velvet Goldmine'' was a reinvention, a leap
forward. He came to underground fame in the mid-1980s with the arch
``Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story,'' using dolls as actors.
Later came ``Poison,'' inspired by the writings of Jean Genet. His
latest was 1995's ``Safe,'' with Julianne Moore, about a housewife
who becomes allergic to the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine,'' he says, is by far the most complex film
he's done and, at a cost of $7 million, ``dramatically
underbudgeted. I felt more constrained than I ever had. We just
didn't have enough money to do what we wanted to do.'' Haynes, who
started shooting the movie in the spring of '97 in London, says the
movie has about 220 scenes, compared with the 100 of most movies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A musical tribute
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The music, of course, is essential to the story. As much as
anything else, Haynes calls the movie an unabashed tribute to Roxy
Music's first album. Co-executive producer Michael Stipe of R.E.M.
worked as a liaison between Haynes and various artists, helping
secure the rights to numerous songs and gathering musicians.
Members of Radiohead, Placebo, Pulp, Sonic Youth, Mudhoney,
Elastica, Spacehog, and Shudder to Think, among others, either play
the music or are in the film. But Bowie's music is not in the
movie, and, yes, they fought hard to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in the film there's Bowie-isms in and out of it, up
and down,'' says Haynes, but not the six Bowie songs he wanted,
especially the definitive glam classic, ``All the Young Dudes,''
which Bowie wrote for Mott the Hoople.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowie read the script several times,'' says Haynes, ``and
watched all my films on tape and definitely put a great deal of
thought into the quest, but ultimately said no. At the time, his
business manager implied there was going to be a `Ziggy Stardust'
revue and he wanted to keep the music for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a bit haunted by the film at this point,'' Haynes
adds. ``I've heard rumors that have to do with his ambivalence
about his past, his personas and experiments.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes suggests that the film is less about a story than an era.
``In a film like this, the story, to me, is almost like the story
in a musical,'' he says. ``It's not really why you go to a musical,
the story. But you get a complex sense of the character, a
psychological depth. It's almost a series of gestures that are
larger than life. The emotion is in the music and in the
spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   The whatever-happened-to-Brian-Slade question, says Haynes, ``is
more the McGuffin, the false pretense for telling this story and
ultimately setting up Arthur's past and his memories.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Breaking down boundaries
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' is, in part, about self-discovery and hero
worship, the bond between fans and their idols. It's also about the
risks fans take when they adopt a controversial figure as their
own. The young Arthur is taunted by some boys in a record shop
about his sexuality as he's seen purchasing a Brian Slade album.
Haynes says the bisexual cool of the period was ``ultimately
unnerving to gays and straights, because it throws everything up
for grabs and implicates all of us. Whatever safety or security you
assume is out of the question. It was really about breaking down
boundaries and blurring the lines between opposites. And I love
that about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes admits, with a laugh, that a passionate kiss between
Slade and Wild might just be greeted with a shrug. ``It's very hard
to give it the shock value it deserves,'' he says, ``because we've
seen it all before and out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did the glam era fall apart? ``So much of it was cultural
changes,'' posits Haynes. ``Even within the glam era there were all
these lurking fantasies of a future that was going to be very bleak
and doomed. In some ways, it killed itself off and didn't allow for
that slow petering out of energy that often happens in other genres
of music. And they were right: A different time was around the
corner, this decadent free-for-all wasn't possible to keep
afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   As to its intended audience, Haynes says he hopes it will grab
baby boomers: ``People who lived through the period will have a
knowledge they can bring to the film _ if they can get a baby
sitter. But I'm most excited about the younger audiences. I was
inspired by films I saw as a teenager _ almost as an equivalent to
my glam experience _ like `Performance,' `A Clockwork Orange,' and
`2001.' Films that were real trips and took you somewhere you'd
never been before. They don't make movies like that anymore, and
that is so important to teenagers, the way movies enter your
imagination, the way they make you want to interact with them. ...
I think this is a radical offering to kids. It turns identity into
something constructive and says, `Maybe it was never real to begin
with.'''

WHEN TIMES ARE GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Election Day turnout was expected to be only about a third of
all eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Not when times are as good as these.
</P>
<P>
   Among political pundits, the conventional wisdom is that this
election is not like others _ that voters have been turned off by
Washington scandals and negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the impeachment question has dominated
commentary for most of 1998. It may be, though, that fair play is
the great unstated issue of the campaign. (At least this seems to
be the hinge upon which key elections are turning in New York and
California.)
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that the last three months have been somewhat
nervous-making in financial markets. Something like $1.5 trillion
of capitalization vanished between August and October, according to
the Federal Reserve Board. But a good deal of that value has been
restored through timely action by the Fed and Congress. Third
quarter economic growth came in stronger than had been anticipated.
The Fed may yet succeed in extending the current US business
expansion until it becomes the longest ever _ longer even than the
9-year boom of the 1960s, which had the Vietnam War at its back.
</P>
<P>
   Thus to understand voter turnout, as well as the vote itself, it
is necessary to remember how well things are going underneath _ and
why.
</P>
<P>
   The current expansion began in 1991. It was inherited from
George Bush and his team, who paid a stiff political price for
their willingness to begin to balance the budget in 1990 on the eve
of the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, of course, was merely carrying on and improving the
economic housekeeping measures whose promise had won Jimmy Carter
election in 1976. Ronald Reagan had adopted them even more
enthusiastically in 1980. Bill Clinton has been forced to follow
the script, often against his instincts, at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton brains-truster Robert Reich sought to rally support
for an out-sized stimulus after the election in 1992, Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen insisted on a ``down payment on the
deficit'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1994 Hillary Rodham Clinton sought to reoganize, largely
in secret, the provision of American health care _ one sixth of
gross national product _ the Democrats lost control of Congress for
the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   When newly elected House Speaker Newt Gingrich sought to force a
balanced budget in 1995, Clinton outmaneuvered him. The president
gained the lion's share of credit for submitting budgets that ended
the deficits that had been at the center of American politics for
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   And when a sizeable budget surplus materialized in 1998, Clinton
sought to use it to restore the long-term balance to the Social
Security system _ a fundamentally conservative measure little
different from the rebalancing that had been previously been
undertaken in 1982 by Reagan, Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, and Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been pursing a bipartisan economic policy, in other
words, extending all the way back to 1974. Against this, the
Republican Party has been powerless to rally.
</P>
<P>
   This is the context in which the low turnout numbers should be
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Around half of all eligible voters have voted in every
presidential election from 1932 until 1996. Before 1972, turnout
was well over half _ sometimes nearly 60 percent. After 1972, it
often was somewhat less _ as little as 45 percent in 1988. It was
51 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout in midterm congressional elections, however, dropped
from a level of around a half of all eligible voters to a third,
starting in 1974 _ the first year in which the antigovernment
backlash made itself felt. It has stayed there ever since _ in the
off-years of 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994. Only in 1942 and
1946, when Americans were utterly preoccupied with the beginning
and end of of World War II, were comparably low levels recorded.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to voter interest in the 1970s? Quite simply,
economics took over from foreign policy. The nation turned away
from the great public issues of the Cold War to pursue private
prosperity instead.
</P>
<P>
   There was a great inflation in the 1970s; an asset boom in the
1980s; a more widely shared prosperity in the 1990s. More people
tended their portfolios. Fewer voted.
</P>
<P>
   Good markets make for lackluster politics _ and vice versa.

   No one has to tell Brian Stack that small stocks are on a tear.
Hardly anyone has benefited more.
</P>
<P>
   Stack's two small-stock mutual funds, MFS New Discovery and MFS
Emerging Equities, have ridden the kind of performance roller
coaster that make money managers sweat. Hammered weeks earlier, his
funds have rebounded dramatically in the current small-stock rally
to gain back all of the millions lost in early fall, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   That's only over the last two months. After a year of volatile
highs and lows, Stack's funds are within fractions of break-even
for 1998. &UR;  &LR; In this particular year, with the blood of small-stock
managers splattered up and down the Street, breaking even makes
Stack the best small-stock manager in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Fred Kobrick, whose new Kobrick-Cendant
Emerging Growth fund has slightly better 1998 performance but
modest assets under management so far, this is an easy call.
</P>
<P>
   MFS New Discovery ranks among the top 4 percent of all
small-stock funds this year and over the last 12 months, according
to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. MFS Emerging Equities is well
within the top 10 percent of the same class over those periods.
</P>
<P>
   No one said it was easy. Even the rocky market of early 1998 was
poor preparation for what has happened over the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   MFS New Discovery fund had plunged 20.8 percent in just over two
weeks, during a small-stock free fall between Sept. 24 and Oct. 8.
The same fund hit bottom that day and then roared back with even
greater velocity, climbing 28.4 percent over the next three
weeks. &UR;  &LR; Stack's larger MFS Emerging Growth fund followed a similar
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as volatile as I've seen it,'' Stack said. ``The
first instinct is that the world is coming to an end, that these
companies are going out of business. I think anyone who acted on
that by raising cash has really, really paid a price.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its benefits, Stack isn't so sure the current small-
stock rally still has legs. He's upbeat on the future of small
issues over the next 12 months, but warns that those same stocks
have come a long way quickly _ the Russell 2000 small-stock index
jumped 25 percent since Oct. 8 _ and could get hurt by
disappointments elsewhere in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether we get another spate of earnings
disappointments from the blue chips,'' he said. ``If the likes of
Gillette are reporting disappointments, it will cast a pall on the
market that cuts across asset classes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Stack is a believer in the idea that small stocks
will eventually become appreciated for their greater growth
potential and relative cheapness.
</P>
<P>
   His MFS portfolios are geared for the day when small stocks with
predictable growth are back in vogue. About half his assets are
divided between technology stocks and business services. Another 15
percent is invested in health care.
</P>
<P>
   But the same small-stock case has been made for the last several
years and fallen on deaf ears. Within Stack's portfolios, a mix of
winner and losers over the last year reflect the difficulty of
following through on a relative simple idea.
</P>
<P>
   A big winner: Gemstar International Group Ltd., which makes
software used in televisions, VCRs, and other consumer electronics.
Strong earnings have pushed the stock ahead 124 percent this year,
up 68 percent since Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A loser: Concentra Managed Care Inc. of Boston, which manages
plans to limit workers compensation costs. It has fallen from a
springtime high of 35 to 10 1/4, mostly on growth disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Although Stack's funds remained fully invested in the darkest
days of this fall's slump, they sold several investments for the
chance to buy other clobbered stocks considered to have better
long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Among those sold were a few stocks that Stack believed had the
prospect of takeover built into their prices, including New York
drugstore chain Duane Reade Inc. and Citadel Communications Corp.,
a radio broadcast company. Another stock sold: Renaissance
Worldwide Inc. of Newton, Mass..
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases they were good companies, but they didn't have
the dramatic upside that was developing in others. We were buyers
of a lot of stocks that were nothing less than crucified,'' said
Stack, once a computer services analyst at what was then known as
Robertson Stephens &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology Partners was among the buys. A darling in
the technology service business until recently, the company's stock
had plunged from 58 1/8 to 15 1/8 &UR;  &LR; in just over three months.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge Technology Partners has already bounced off the lows,
where Stack was buying shares two weeks ago, and would appreciate
further by just climbing back to half its peak price.

PATRIOTS' DESTINATION UNCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The midpoint of the NFL season has arrived
and what do we know about the New England Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   If we are honest, we know we don't know much, but what we do
know makes us roll ball bearings in our hand like Capt. Queeg.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe has been around long enough to be in the honesty
business _ even in the often self-delusional world of the National
Football League _ so when he stood by his locker Sunday
contemplating his team's 21-16 victory over the lowly Indianapolis
Colts, he took it for what it was: not much beyond a brake on a
two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're 1-7 and they gave us a battle,'' Bledsoe said, rolling
verbal ball bearings between the fingers of his mind as he spoke.
``What can we take from that? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   From the way he said it, you sensed he did know and he wasn't
particularly elated with the information.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to look at the position the Patriots are
in this morning. If you are a sunny optimist with an advanced
degree from the Dale Carnegie School in Marin, Calif., you can say,
``We're tied for first in the division. We have a game left with
the Jets and Dolphins and two with the Bills. We hold our destiny
in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   You roll no ball bearings between your fingers if you think like
that. You also don't look both ways when you step into traffic.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are a New England Calvinist who thinks
your glass not only is half-empty but also leaking from a small
crack in the side and two more along the bottom that have resulted
from your sins, then you will rail against the night and roll your
ball bearings back and forth in your sweaty palm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 5-3 and tied with the untalented lunkheads on Long
Island who play for Bill Parcells and the unpolished Bills who play
for our mystical prodigal son, Doug,'' you say. ``Flutie is like
Merlin. He will punish us for banishing him to the frozen tundra of
the North Land for so long when we should have clasped him to our
breasts and let him play here.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, oh, the Jets! We have to go there two days after
Christmas just so a man named Tuna can ruin our holiday by giving
us a case of football botulism. Lord help us when Doug and this man
called Tuna show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a person rolls bowling balls, not ball bearings, and
consumes bottles of Maalox to sooth his worried stomach. Every
cloud is a storm cloud to such a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you are simply a realist, you say you do not know
yet who these Patriots are. You roll the ball bearings back and
forth between your fingers and you fear you know too much, just
like Bledsoe as he walked out of the RCA Dome after a most
unfulfilling victory over an opponent even his injury-weakened team
should have handled far more easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it through the first half and we're tied for first,''
Bledsoe said. ``Now we start from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what he has learned at the season's midpoint, and he is
right. They start from scratch with a team already scratched by too
many injuries to defensive linemen and wide receivers, and if you
are honest, you think back across the past two or three years when
so few of them were hurt until late last year and you sense not
some crisis of physical fitness but rather the Gridiron God evening
things out, as always. And you roll the ball bearings.
</P>
<P>
   You look at a defense that is not quite what you thought it
would be, even when all its practitioners are healthy, and an
offense that has weapons but no longer nuclear ones.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who will say that 5-3 at the halfway point is
nothing to shake your fist at. It's halfway to 10-6, and 10-6
usually gets you to the playoffs, and then they will remind you
that these same Patriots had the same record a year ago and came
within 2 points of playing for the conference championship with
their biggest guns on the sidelines, so what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Such people forget one thing: Those Patriots had only one
division loss at this juncture, a road defeat in New York, not two.
That is a difference with a distinction, because the Patriots may
be tied on paper with the Dolphins, Bills, and Jets at 5-3 (which,
let's face it, is absurd in itself) but in fact they trail all of
them in an area that seems likely to be of importance.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, one doesn't talk about tie-breakers with eight games
to go, but anyone who watched the Patriots fail to knock out the
Colts when they should have knows they could well have lost that
game against a better opponent, as they did to the Jets and
Dolphins the previous two weeks. If that is the way it is going to
be this season, then these Patriots will need tie-breakers.
</P>
<P>
   They are two division losses behind the Jets, one behind
Buffalo, and trail the Dolphins by virtue of having lost to them.
That means this 5-3 record is not like last year's. This 5-3 record
has left the Patriots little room for error the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   You understand this whether you are an optimist, a pessimist, or
a realist. And so you begin to roll the ball bearings as your team
rolls the dice.
</P>
<P>
   After eight games, if you are honest about these New England
Patriots, what you know is only this: Their fate will be decided in
their remaining four division games, and you have been given no
reason to believe they will sweep them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they will find themselves between now and then and
become what so many, including Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson, once
thought they were: the most talented team in the division. Perhaps
they will get their blitzing defense in high gear and their
Bledsoe-powered offense running on high-test and destroy their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they will.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps you'll need to roll the ball bearings in your sweaty
palms and wait to see who they really are.

EUROPE: AN OFF-SEASON BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the final figures are in, the number of Americans visiting
Europe this year is expected to reach almost 11 million. During the
peak season _ May through September _ the figure is expected to be
around 5.65 million. For the '97-'98 off-season, 5.08 million
discovered Europe. While the fair-weather crowd tops the off-season
one, which group has the smarter travelers?
</P>
<P>
   If you like your weather warm and sunny, obviously you'll side
with the peak-season crowd. If you like to save money and go during
a more lively season, you'd best place your money with the
off-season gang.
</P>
<P>
   Europe off-season can be a budget-traveler's dream. Air fares
become almost ridiculously low _ Boston to London round-trip fares
were down to almost $200, less than the cost of flying to New York.
</P>
<P>
   You don't go to Europe for the beach _ you go for its culture,
history, regal surroundings. So you may not be able to sit sipping
coffee outside a Paris bistro or hike through the English
countryside, but you can stroll through some of the grandest
museums, enjoy the theater and other cultural life, sightsee, and
dine elegantly, all at a lower cost than during high season.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious from the travel figures that Americans are not only
going to Europe in greater numbers but also discovering the
off-season as well. Since 1983, the number of Americans visiting
Europe has jumped from 4.81 million to more than 10.10 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   While many an American tourist may find it hard to believe, the
majority of tourists in summer in Europe are Europeans, not
Americans. And, come fall, just as Americans return to work, so do
the Europeans. This all adds up to a less crowded tourist season.
</P>
<P>
   Off-season means a lively new season of performing arts, harvest
and wine festivals, and the Christmas seasons _ the Christmas
markets in Germany and elsewhere are world famous _ and in
February, Carnival season takes stage front with parades and
parties. Winter sports also take off in the Alps and Scandinavia.
Oh, yes, there are also some famous after-Christmas sales in London
and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   No matter when you are planning on visiting Europe, a handy and
free guide with tips on saving money and sightseeing is the 68-page
``Planning Your Trip to Europe.'' The '99 edition will be available
in January. For a copy, call 800-816-7530, write to European
Planner/ Dept. C, PO Box 1754, New York, NY 10185, or check out
www.visiteurope.com, where the information is regularly updated.

</P>
<P>
   Next summer will be the last chance to catch a solar eclipse in
this century. And one of the best places to catch the Aug. 11,
1999, event is Turkey. The path of the eclipse will be from the
Black Sea across central Anatolia. A number of travel firms are
planning excursions to catch the event. Travel agents should have
information on these packages, which range from around $2,500 to
almost $5,000, depending on tour length and accommodations. Among
tour operators having packages are Far Horizons at 800-552-4575;
Holbrook Travel, 800-451-7111; Megatrails, 800-547-1211; and The
World of Oz, 800-248-0234.

NO EXCUSES FROM BC COACH O'BRIEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If he chose to, Tom O'Brien could point to a rash of injuries,
to a missed field goal, or to a missed tackle as the reason Boston
College is 3-5 and will take a five-game losing streak into
Saturday's contest against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien has chosen not to follow that course. What good would it
do anyway? The Eagles' season is on life-support. One more loss and
they will be officially eliminated from bowl consideration, the
faint hope of a winning season also gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no excuses,'' said O'Brien Monday, two days after a
35-17 loss in Miami. ``Injuries have nothing to do with it. We have
to make some progress. We are what we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles are a team that can score points but one so decimated
on defense that beating even a mediocre team _ much less teams the
caliber of Miami and Notre Dame _ has been virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we haven't been able to stop people
and we're giving up too many points,'' said O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a positive note these days, it is that the medical
report on defensive back Pedro Cirino was good. Cirino, who has not
played since the Virginia Tech game Oct. 8 because of a neck
burner, has improved to the point where O'Brien feels he might be
able to play against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definite improvement,'' said O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   The word on linebacker Brian Maye (groin) is less definitive.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Shea will stay
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for an announcement that Rutgers is extending the contract
of coach Terry Shea. The Knights (4-4) are still thinking about an
over-.500 season, which is a far cry from last year's 0-11
performance that had most people figuring Shea as a lame duck this
season. After playing Navy Saturday, the Knights must close with
West Virginia at home and Virginia Tech on the road, which makes
6-5 appear out of reach. But you never know ... Virginia Tech has
been the most dominant team in the Big East the past four years,
with a record of 21-4 in its last 25 conference games ... Temple
coach Bobby Wallace has had his name mentioned for the Auburn job,
which became vacant when Terry Bowden resigned two weeks ago.
Wallace, who won three national championships at Northern Alabama,
said he is flattered, but that's all. ``There's nothing to consider
right now,'' said Wallace, still feeling some warmth in the
afterglow of the Owls' win over Virginia Tech two weeks ago ...
Every Big East team except Temple is averaging at least 20,000 fans
per home game. The Owls are averaging 14,806, but they are 1-7.
Rutgers, which is averaging only 22,608, has less of an excuse,
especially in a new stadium in a nice setting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitt stoppers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe: Temple has beaten Pittsburgh in two of the last
three meetings ... Pittsburgh defensive back Hank Poteat leads the
country in interceptions with five in six games ... The
Syracuse-West Virginia rivalry has been a battle of elite Big East
teams in recent years, but the edge has gone to Syracuse. The
Orangemen have won the last three by a combined 92-17 ... Here's
one clue as to why Virginia Tech has blocked a school-record nine
kicks this season. Head coach Frank Beamer is also the special
teams coach, so you know everyone is going to take that phase of
the game seriously ... West Virginia coach Don Nehlen knows how
much trouble his team is in with a 1-2 league record. ``I don't
think you need a degree from Carnegie-Mellon to know that if you
have two losses you have a problem in this league in winning the
championship,'' said Nehlen Monday... Syracuse comes into the West
Virginia game averaging 44 points per outing ... Last Saturday was
a true Big East day. It was only the sixth time in league history
that every team played a conference opponent. And it was the first
time in history that all four home teams won.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Floating a theory
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Navy must be positioning itself to become the ninth member of
the conference. Rutgers will be the third Big East opponent the
Midshipmen have played this season ... Rutgers has its most Big
East wins (two) since 1995 ... Shea took a shot at Sports
Illustrated, which in preseason labeled Rutgers the worst team in
Division 1-A. ``They can't pick the No. 1 team (every year),'' said
Shea.``So what makes them think they can pick the last?'' ... Miami
has five wins, but one was against Division 1-AA East Tennessee
State, so the Hurricanes must win two of their next four _ Temple,
Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and UCLA _ to get the six wins to be
bowl-eligible. Miami could be going to Hawaii for a Christmas game
in the Aloha Bowl.

RUNAWAYS TAKE SHORT COURSE ON LIFE SKILLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LESLIE SOWERS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaving the nest and entering the adult world is a tough
passage. But usually it's gradual, following the ritual of high
school graduation and transition time in the college dorm.
</P>
<P>
   Houston gymnast Dominique Moceanu ran away at 17 as the first
step in a legal battle with her parents to establish adult status,
joining a handful of teen-age stars who seek control of their
income or careers.
</P>
<P>
   For every celebrity like Moceanu, thousands of runaways explode
from their homes after battles that range from temper tantrums over
rules to traumatic, long-standing abuse. In some cases, far from
fighting for their children's return, parents refuse to allow them
back in the home.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, leaving home is legal and the police will not pick up a
child this age. But runaways under 17 may be placed on probation by
a juvenile court judge, who can also order family counseling.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Houston, runaways picked up by the police are brought to the
TRIAD staff at the Chimney Rock Center, where counselors work with
them and their families, hoping to smooth the rough waters and
reunite the family. TRIAD is a joint project of three county
agencies: Mental Health Mental Retardation, Juvenile Probation and
Children's Protective Services. It offers both crisis intervention
and family preservation counseling programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teens don't just automatically up and run off,'' said David
Reed, a seasoned caseworker at the CRC. ``None of this begins
overnight or in a vacuum, although the parents may not see it
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that in some cases, kids run away after failing to
follow rules set by parents who have done a fairly good job.
</P>
<P>
   More often, the situation involves impulsive, immature teens in
families where parents have poor parenting skills. Often they may
be abusive, alcoholic or both. Many times, the runaways live with
single mothers who are trying to do a tough job without backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids don't go far, maybe to a friend's house or a
neighbor. They leave for the night or for a few days and go home,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they find someone who will take them in for a more
extended period of time, often other family members or parents of
friends who feel sorry for them. Still others may leave the state
or end up chronically on the street. That's more rare, Reed said,
and often very dangerous to the teen who has no money or means of
support.
</P>
<P>
   Running away is a common fantasy for youths. Reed said they
often say they just want to be left alone, to find some place where
they won't feel pressured. He assures them that unless they have a
private island, they aren't going to find a place where total
harmony exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids may believe that if they just get away from school or
home that everything will be fine,'' Reed said. ``But it's their
inability to function at school or home that is the problem. If
they don't have the basic skills they need for that, what's going
to happen when they are 18 or 20?''
</P>
<P>
   That's where counseling can be very helpful. The TRIAD staff
encourages runaways to finish their education, at least to get a
GED. They offer therapy to help teens deal with authority and
resolve conflict. They extend help to parents who don't deal with
these issues well, either.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents want to send their children to boot camp, hoping
that there the severe consequences will correct their behavior,
Reed said. In fact, he said, this group of teens doesn't respond
normally to consequences. Instead of obeying the law, they drive
faster when they get a speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to burn their fingers on the stove over and over
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When family problems are severe or the child has serious
emotional problems, his job may be to find an alternative placement
for the child. In a small number of cases, CPS may take custody of
a teen when parents refuse to accept responsibility for them.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said teens may request a foster home, harboring the
illusion that these are readily available. He assures them that
there is not a long waiting list of people eager to take them and
their problems on.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who come in with a plan to drop out of school, get
an apartment and start working, Reed provides a reality check. He
has them start with a month's income at a minimum-wage job and
start subtracting. It doesn't take long to realize they'll be broke
when the month is half gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that plan is not going to work,'' he has said to many a
teen.
</P>
<P>
   Though teen-agers can legally leave home at 17, and police no
longer will pick them up, Reed said establishing independence at
this age is very difficult. That doesn't mean their problems are
over, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 17, they aren't adults in terms of civil law, so they can't
sign a lease, get a loan or be sued by landlords if they tear up an
apartment. So nobody is willing to rent an apartment to a kid,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   At 16 or 17, teens can file suit before a family court judge to
have most of the restrictions of minority removed. This action,
taken by Moceanu, is extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   The family court judge has the discretion to grant adult status,
if this serves the best interests of the child, said Tom Oldham, a
University of Houston law professor.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 years of family law practice, attorney David Fraga has
represented only one young man in such a petition. It was unopposed
by his parents who were moving overseas in his senior year of high
school.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows youths to obtain adult status so they can enter
contracts and control their own finances. It does not alter certain
other legal age limits that govern voting, drinking or smoking.
Youths who have been granted adult status can marry without
parents' signatures, make their own wills, enter the military
without parental permission and sue others as well as be sued.
Their parents are no longer responsible for them. Teen-agers who
are 14 to 18 also attain adult status when they marry, though they
need their parents' permission to obtain a license. They retain the
adult status even if divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The section of the Texas Family Code which allows this is
informally called ``the emancipation law''. Judge Eric Andell said
it was not designed to emancipate runaways. Its more common use is
when teen-agers have received a personal injury settlement and need
the ability to enter contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga said parents have legal rights to money earned by their
children to use in the child's best interests and sometimes in the
best interests of the family. In most cases, where a child earns
money from a part-time job, the parent will not take the money but
try to teach the child to use it responsibly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of kids with star status and huge earnings, like
Moceanu, or child actors such as Macaulay Culkin and Gary Coleman,
the family code laws offer little protection from parents who might
misuse the funds. Moceanu has accused her parents of squandering
her earnings, and has attained the adult status to pursue legal
remedy, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Teens who run away rarely attend school while away, and usually
do not have jobs. Their time away tends to be traumatic, and gets
them off course. A DePelchin Children's Center program tries to
work with youths and families before the situation escalates to
this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running away is like any other acting-out symptom, like
skipping school or taking drugs,'' said Lorraine Schroeder, a
counselor in the STAY (Services to At-Risk Youth) program. ``It's a
response to some kind of stress in life. They do not have adult
resources to handle the stress.''
</P>
<P>
   STAY counselors go to the home and try to reduce the stresses by
working with both parents and children. They help the teens develop
coping skills, find other sources of support and help parents focus
on areas where they need to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever possible, we try to preserve the family,'' said
Schroeder. ``Not all families are perfect, but we tell teen-agers
it's better than not having one.''

MORISSETTE'S `JUNKIE' NOT AS JAGGED AS `PILL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No female artist ever has had the debut success that Alanis
Morissette achieved with 1995's ``Jagged Little Pill:'' 16 million
sales domestically and another 12 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In part due to that, the follow-up, ``Supposed Former
Infatuation Junkie'' (Maverick/Warner Bros.), cannot win.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it sells 10 million copies, the album will be deemed a
commercial failure _ perhaps by the same critics who sneered that
her first album was too commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Or if by some miracle it passes ``Pill,'' the album will be
called crassly calculated, which is perhaps as far from the truth
as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be just the press talking _ a music press that is
mostly male and has dismissed Morissette for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it bugs them that's she's so young at 24, though
that doesn't seem to bother them when it comes to the teen-age
Hanson brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It also bugs them that she's female _ and not just that, but an
``angry young female,'' as she was quickly pegged thanks to one
song, ``You Oughtta Know,'' which didn't begin to sum up her first
album.
</P>
<P>
   Her fans know differently, and her fans should disregard the
backlash and take this for what it is: an ambitious album that
makes scant effort to re-create ``Pill,'' yet rings with
Morissette's special brand of lyrical eloquence, youthful themes
and sensational singing.
</P>
<P>
   Here she sings every note, including backing vocals, and plays
harmonica, flute and piano. She also wrote every lyric and co-wrote
the music with producer Glen Ballard, a major factor in ``Pill's''
surprise success.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Ballard has given Morissette more free rein than
she needed. ``Junkie'' is rambling, overwrought and overlong, at 17
songs and 71 { minutes. It would have made a far better 13-song CD.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, this is Morissette's equivalent to Fleetwood Mac's
``Tusk,'' an ambitious two-disc album that followed that group's
top-selling ``Rumours.''
</P>
<P>
   Like that band, Morissette has pulled out the stops. She seems
liberated by her success, responding to it recklessly rather than
safely.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by four studio musicians, she pours everything into the
mix. From rock, pop and hip-hop to R&AMP;B, metal, industrial, lush
strings and an acoustic folk feel, the album ranges widely and
confidently.
</P>
<P>
   But not always successfully. ``Junkie'' lacks the catchy
accessibility or upbeat, anthemic qualities of ``Pill.'' It's too
often dead-serious and needs lightening up.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrics almost make better reading than listening. They're
conversational and confessional _ an emotional and intellectual
torrent with scant adherence to song structure or rhyme schemes.
</P>
<P>
   But they definitely communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some knowledge of Morissette's life would help. The
album's first single, ``Thank U,'' makes sense only when you know
that she traveled India as she decompressed from her marathon tour
for ``Pill.''
</P>
<P>
   In India, Morissette became ill but rejected prescription drugs,
and she also learned to resist Western prejudices toward mere
physicality.
</P>
<P>
   Other songs are more personally focused in the vein of her
earlier work, or maybe even Carly Simon's ``You're So Vain.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, it sounds as if Morissette has gone through many men, and
she's bluntly honest about her loves gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have as much rage as you have,'' she sings in ``Sympathetic
Character.'' ``I have as much pain as you do. I've lived as much
hell as you have, and I've kept mine bubbling under for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, whose fault is that?
</P>
<P>
   Yet she also sings ``How about me not blaming you for
everything'' in ``Thank U'' and ``I am the biggest hypocrite'' in
``One.''
</P>
<P>
   All this stark soul-baring can be a bit much. If anything, it's
``Junkie'' that goes down like a jagged pill _ and not a little
one, at this length.
</P>
<P>
   But with its sensitivity comes ringing affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   A defining song is the self-aware ``One,'' in which Morissette
admits she's become ``a sexy treadmill capitalist'' and ``fabulous
freak of nature.'' But she doesn't trust fame; she trusts herself.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more true than on ``That I Would Be Good,'' an
exquisitely lovely song of tender yet fervent self-acceptance in
the face of human frailty.
</P>
<P>
   For Morissette's young fans, it's a beacon of spiritual calm,
and her beautifully belted voice becomes a voice of reason.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say she wants to be the voice of a generation.
Morissette does well enough just being the voice of herself.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can relate to it, climb aboard. Let the cynics sneer
_ the truth is in here.

FORGET ALL THE LABELS, SHANIA TWAIN PROVES SHE'S A TRUE
ENTERTAINER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Country queen or pop diva _ it doesn't really matter what label
you slap on superstar Shania Twain. When the lights go down, the
woman taking center stage is simply a dazzling entertainer.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours Saturday night, the athletic and stunningly
beautiful entertainer screamed, jumped and sang her heart out.
Twain was like a cheerleader during homecoming, squealing between
songs and urging the crowd to clap and sing along.
</P>
<P>
   Jack-o-lanterns decorated the stage to mark the Halloween
holiday, and Twain took the stage wearing a black bandit mask.
Coupled with her green-and-black outfit and cascading brown hair,
the look was more sexy comic-book heroine than female honky tonker.
</P>
<P>
   Twain's appeal, though, has never stemmed from a place of pure
country. Songs such as ``Man! I Feel Like a Woman,'' ``Honey I'm
Home and You Win My Love'' were nonstop doses of pop fun, matched
beat for beat by Twain's instantly likable energy.
</P>
<P>
   All those sassy hooks critics bemoaned on Twain's two
multiplatinum albums played surprisingly well live, and while
Twain's voice is no threat to Celine Dion, she can inflect a tune
with just the right amounts of wit, humor and emotion. The only
misstep was ``Black Eyes, Blue Tears,'' a jumbled mess of
incoherent lyrics and overwrought guitar licks.
</P>
<P>
   Twain's true talent, however, is her ability to connect with an
audience, and she did so many times throughout the evening. A young
local performer was selected to sing onstage; lucky fans with
glow-tape on their seats had their photo taken with Twain;
autographs were given throughout the show; and a nervous boyfriend
proposed to his sweetheart as Twain gleefully urged them on.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, Twain is unlike any other performer of her
multiplatinum caliber, except maybe Dion, whose stage banter is
also giddy and enthusiastic. Twain even managed a couple of rounds
of Happy Birthday for those celebrating in the audience, supervised
an impromptu pumpkin-carving contest and shot cans of Silly String
into the crowd. It made for a warm and familiar show.
</P>
<P>
   Twain calmed the mood for her solid rendition of ``You're Still
the One,'' the romantic ballad that solidified her crossover
success. Better was the Cajun-tinged ``I Won't Leave You Lonely,''
which found the performer center stage amid a swirl of smoke and
twinkling lights.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity also marked Twain's set in between the odes to
everyday women. ``Come On Over'' was a Caribbean-flavored treat;
``No One Needs To Know'' was a spirited moment of folksy fun; and
``God Bless the Child'' was an uplifting hymn featuring solid
backup from the Wheatley High School choir.
</P>
<P>
   But when Twain chants her feisty-female lyrics (``OK, so what do
you think you're Elvis or something?'' ``Why don't you take a pill
and put a little trust in me?'') the crowd comes alive. ``Any Man
of Mine,'' her first successful sampling of sass, was an
irresistible, hands-in-the-air anthem; and ``Don't Be Stupid (You
Know I Love You)'' was a carousel ride of fiddles, fun lyrics and
foot-stompin'. Twain even indulged in a bit of Riverdance-type
choreography with opening act Leahy during the song.
</P>
<P>
   ``From This Moment On,'' Twain's new pop single, was another
glittering ode to romance, and ``(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm
Outta Here!''saw the return of Wheatley High School, this time to
provide drum accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Twain's brand of exclamatory pop hooks and lush balladry
doesn't belong on the country charts. It hardly seems to matter to
the singer and her fans. The stage is the real home for Twain's
electric blend of charisma and free spirit. &QL;

DAUGHTER REMEMBERS ACTOR CLAUDE RAINS &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ``Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   That line from Humphrey Bogart's Rick to Claude Rains' Capt.
Louis Renault in ``Casablanca'' is one of the most treasured in
cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Classic Movies renews its beautiful friendship with Rains
all this month, with 24 movies starring this consummate character
and support actor. Every Monday in November, TCM will present
several Rains movies.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, what kind of character was this famous character
actor?
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated Hollywood,'' said Jessica Rains, daughter of Rains
and Frances Propper, his fourth wife (of six). ``As soon as he
finished filming he would go back to Chester County, Pennsylvania
to farm. He had a 500-acre farm we all lived on. To an Englishman,
land is everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got onto a tractor and did the books,'' his daughter said.
``I gathered eggs. The farm was built in 1780, and he wanted to
keep everything very authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Though born in London (in 1889), Rains became an American after
Hollywood lured him here.
</P>
<P>
   In the movies, Rains frequently played a sophisticated, rich and
educated man, with great dignity. His daughter said that was all
acquired, not what he really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was born one of 12 children on the wrong side of the river
Thames and all but three died from poverty-related illnesses as
children. He had a cockney accent, a lateral lisp and a stutter. He
got rid of all of them. I would say, `Do the cockney accent,' and I
couldn't understand a word he was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her dad's six wives, she said, ``He had great morals.
That's why he kept getting married. He didn't sleep with these
women until he married them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father was not a fan of seeing his own movies. ``The only
movie he saw, after he finished it, that I know of was (a reissue
of) The Invisible Man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's coincidence, but in that movie, Rains' major film
debut, his face is not seen until the end of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very shy, and he didn't want anybody to know he was
coming to see this film,'' his daughter said. ``It was winter, and
he bundled himself all up and wrapped a scarf around his head. He
went up to the box office, and the manager went berserk because,
from the voice, he knew who it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rains didn't like Hollywood, he did have great friends in
the business, such as Alfred Hitchcock and Bette Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew and adored Bette Davis and she him,'' she said.
``Every time a husband beat her up or left her, she would come and
stay on the farm a couple of weeks.'' Rains and Davis made four
films together, all showing on TCM Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my father died, she and I had meetings. She would have
somebody send for me, and I would go on the set, and she would shut
the door to her trailer and tell Claude Rains stories. She was
crazy about him. She told me that she wanted to marry him, and he
wouldn't marry her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows whether she was serious, about anything. She was
really a wacky one. She told me that he brought me to the set one
time, and she knew that it was to let her know that he was not
available.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter also said that Rains had great respect for Bogart _
they made two movies together, ``Passage to Marseilles'' and
``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her father's favorite stories concerns another frequent
co-star, Errol Flynn, one of Hollywood's most legendary womanizers.
(Their three movies together, ``The Adventures of Robin Hood,''
``The Prince and the Pauper'' and ``The Sea Hawk,'' show Nov. 30.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to tell me about doing a sword fight with Errol Flynn,
and he nicked his testicle. He loved to tell that story. He had
that sense of humor in life. He didn't tell jokes and carry on, but
there was a twinkle. I think you see that (in his movies).''

WISE BENEFITS USE CUTS HEALTH COSTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cost of employee health insurance is rising for companies,
so it's likely your employer will be raising your share of the
premium or increasing co-payments in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it even more important that you choose wisely when
sifting through employee benefit options and deciding which ones
you want next year.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect your company to offer a one-size-fits-all package.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no best plan anymore,'' said Michelle Miears, a
principal at Buck Consultants in Houston, an employee benefits
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Look at what your health care expenses were this year, how much
you anticipate spending next year and figure out which health plan
will mean the least amount of money coming out of your own pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the affordability of your coverage of the past year and
are you comfortable with that?'' said Wendy Rhodes, a consultant at
Hewitt Associates employee benefits consultants in Lincolnshire,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   If you're happy with your current medical coverage, see if it
will be available next year and at what cost. If your current
medical plan won't be available next year, look at the
alternatives. How much coverage can you afford?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, pay attention to the deadline for submitting
your benefit choices. If you don't enroll on time, you may be
automatically assigned to coverage you may not want, and you won't
be able to take advantage of spending accounts for health care or
dependent care.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One plan may suffice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't pay more for health insurance than you must.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been paying for two health insurance plans, you may no
longer have to, thanks to the federal Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That law allows workers to maintain health insurance coverage if
they change or lose their jobs. At the same time, it effectively
bans insurers from denying coverage to people who have pre-existing
medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many employees who have two working spouses, they would put
the whole family on both plans in case they lost coverage under
one,'' Miears said. ``Take a look at which plan is primary if you
have kids and have two working spouses. Who puts the kids on their
plan?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule of thumb is, if they're covered by both
spouses' plans, the plan that pays first is the plan of the parent
whose birthday falls earlier in the year,'' Miears said.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary plan rarely ever pays benefits anymore, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the health plans coordinate benefits is that the
primary plan pays first,'' Miears said. ``If the plans are alike,
you may be paying for a plan you may never collect on.''
</P>
<P>
   Make your choice based on the quality of doctors and services
available in a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have dependents, having one plan cover you and your
working spouse isn't as attractive.
</P>
<P>
   That's because many companies are charging more for covering a
working spouse who chooses not to be covered by an insurance plan
at his or her own employer, Miears said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cut out-of-pocket expenses &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for ways to reduce your out-of-pocket spending on health
care services.
</P>
<P>
   Take advantage of spending accounts for health care. These allow
you to set aside pretax dollars to pay for services not covered by
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   These accounts reduce your tax bill because the money is
deducted pretax from your paycheck and lowers your taxable income.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful not to have too much money withheld in a spending
account because you forfeit any balance left in your account.
</P>
<P>
   Use the money you save on health insurance to buy additional
life or disability insurance if you need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be able to say if something does happen, do I have
enough money to support my family?'' said Robert Wright, group and
health care practice leader at Watson Wyatt &AMP; Co., employee benefit
consultants in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planning experts said disability insurance is the most
overlooked type of coverage. You're far more likely to be disabled
than to die at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   If you were disabled and couldn't work, do you have enough
savings and other income sources that would enable you to pay your
bills?
</P>
<P>
   The recent layoffs at companies make it crucial that you ask
whether any of your group insurance coverages, such as life
insurance, can be converted into an individual policy.

   KUWAIT _ This is a city of gleaming towers and modern palaces.
Though men wear Arab robes and homes feature eastern designs, there
are few physical remnants of history.
</P>
<P>
   But on Kuwait City's Persian Gulf coast, at one of the six
five-star hotels, Kuwaitis are trying to reconstruct a piece of
their lost heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next two years, they should finish construction on a
mammoth replica of the long-gone family of cargo ships called dhows
(rhymes with ``now''), which were essential before Kuwait hit the
oil jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Bulky ships like these cruised the Persian Gulf and neighboring
waters until the middle of the century, laden with tea, spices,
sugar, rice, wood and even race horses.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis, living the hard desert life, even sent the ships to
Iraq next door for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars in oil money later, Kuwaitis can convert the
sea water into drinking water and oil tankers and U.S. aircraft
carriers are the kings of the waters.
</P>
<P>
   In character with the modern Kuwait, the big brown hull rising
off the grounds of the Radisson SAS hotel won't be hauling
anything, or even sailing. Rather, it will serve as an
air-conditioned conference hall -- complete with gold leaf
decoration -- more than six times the size of its ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   It's owners bill it as the largest wooden ship in the world and
have the Guiness Book of World's Records on notice. That claim may
depend on its specific classification or how it is measured, as the
U.S.S. Constitution and a handful of other old ships are larger.
</P>
<P>
   But, the ship, owned by the hotel's Kuwaiti owner, is an
impressive feat of engineering and striking blend of antiquity and
modern grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The ship will measure about 275 feet long and about 60 feet
wide. The main mast will be about 177 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Today, its hull is a curved and spiked collection of beams and
scaffolding dwarfing the 150 workers climbing around it.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the pressing and fitting of massive pieces of timber,
the project includes intricate, interlocking wood-carving to seal
the wood in place. The ship was designed on computers and every
piece is numbered.
</P>
<P>
   But the project is overseen by shipbuilder Mohammed Maskati, a
75-year-old Kuwaiti who used to sail the these ships. Back then,
trips could take six months and sailors, pressed for food and
water, were buffeted by the winds and sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the people is not the same now,'' Maskati said.
``You can't find people who want to suffer like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the new vessel, called the Al Hashemi II in
honor of an old ship, started in 1997 and is aimed at providing a
``new historical landmark'' for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on oil revenues, Kuwait is just starting to develop a
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   This ship will be the centerpiece of a freight and fishing
village. About 25 other ships will be portrayed in large-scale
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just to keep the heritage,'' says Maskati, who wears the
traditional white robe and head dress of the Gulf's Arabs. ``There
used to be 400 of these ships, now there are none.''
</P>
<P>
   And they were never this big.

WHAT IS GOETHE DOING ON MY PAPER TOWELS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In his ``Spruche in Prosa'' (``Proverbs in
Prose''), the monumental German poet-philosopher Johann Wolfgang
von Goethe wrote: ``The greatest happiness for the thinking man is
to have fathomed the fathomable, and to quietly revere the
unfathomable.''
</P>
<P>
   In which category do you suppose Goethe would have included
being quoted on thousands of rolls of paper towels? Fathomable or
un? I try to fathom him fathoming such a prospect, but I cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Frankfurt in 1749, Goethe was (and is) such an artistic
and intellectual giant, the Encylopaedia Britannica devotes nearly
six dense pages to him and declares: ``The bulk and diversity of
his output is in itself phenomenal ... He achieved in his 82 years
a wisdom often termed Olympian, even inhuman; yet, almost to the
end he retained a willingness to let himself be shaken to his
foundation by love or sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not exactly the sort of company one expects to find in a
sixpack of ``strong &AMP; absorbent'' Sparkle paper towels manufactured
by the Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific Corp. The wit and wisdom of
Roseanne perhaps or even Dr. Laura, but Goethe?
</P>
<P>
   For an instant, I thought I was hallucinating when I tore off a
white towel with green print the color of oxidized copper and read:
```Nothing is worth more than this day.' _ Goethe.''
</P>
<P>
   Flying all around the quote were little illustrated stars and
suns. I checked the other rolls in the sixpack. Two were covered
with little flowers in pots. Two others had pea pods, carrots and
tomatoes all over them and said ``Veggies.'' A third model sported
balloons on strings and ``It's time for a party!''
</P>
<P>
   Goethe's willingness to let himself be shaken by love or sorrow
helped produce some remarkable, romantic works such as ``Faust,''
``Egmont'' and ``The Sorrows of Young Werther.'' It also
contributed to the misapprehension by some that he was mainly a
lovesick, Byronesque sensitive type. The truth is much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   As the Britannica points out, Goethe's passion for science alone
produced a prodigious amount of writing _ 14 volumes _ about
everything from botany to the theory of color. His own drawings
graced some of the books. As part of a deep but deliberately
unconsummated love affair with the wife of a Weimar court official,
Goethe wrote some 1,500 letters. The daily correspondence between
him and fellow cerebral heavyweight Friedrich Schiller eventually
totalled four volumes.
</P>
<P>
   While he never stopped writing poetry, novels, essays, plays and
songs, at one time or another in his long, materially comfortable
life, Goethe inhabited dozens of vocational roles. Among them: mine
inspector, lawyer, financier, agriculturalist, actor, stage manager
and military administrator.
</P>
<P>
   In love often, he did not marry until 1806 when he was 57. Then
it was to a woman he'd brought back from Italy 18 years earlier and
with whom he'd already been living and having children. He deeply
believed that America was the best bet for a better, brighter,
enlightened society and that ``the Eternal Feminine'' is what draws
us all to greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He was one hip Renaissance dude.
</P>
<P>
   Like actor Harvey Keitel, who once named Goethe as his hero, I
have always admired the poet for the apparent ease with which he
handled paradox. As Elizabeth M. Wilkinson puts it in her beautiful
Britannica bio:
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was a skeptic ... he was a hopeful skeptic. He looked
deep into the abyss, but he deliberately emphasized light and life.
He lived life to the full at every level, but never to the
detriment of the civilized virtues ... Truth for him lay not in
compromise but in the embracing of opposites.''
</P>
<P>
   When I first encountered the Goethe towels, I went into
full-journalist mode and planned to call Georgia-Pacific. Who was
behind the unfathomable deed? Did they even know who Goethe was?
What had possessed them to include him with pea pods, balloons and
flower pots? Just a deadline and a book of inspirational quotes?
</P>
<P>
   Then I decided to let it go. Wilkinson says Goethe was ``wholly
committed to the adventure of science, but he stood in awe and
reverence before the mystery of the universe.'' I see the Goethe
paper towels as part of that mystery. Whether their creators
consciously realized it, something must have sparked inside and
maybe connected them to what Napoleon felt when he met Goethe and
enthused, ``THERE is a man.''

MONDAVI STILL KNOWS ONE WAY: HIS WAY
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one has been more closely associated with the California wine
revolution than Robert Mondavi. Probably because he started it.
</P>
<P>
   By the wine revolution I mean the seemingly overnight
transformation of the California wine industry from a stolid,
unimaginative business based on a blue-collar immigrant clientele,
into a sophisticated, often glamorous venture, catering to a newly
affluent and increasingly worldly segment of the American middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   With a tireless insistence on quality and a conviction that
California could produce wines equal to any in the Old World,
Mondavi inspired a generation of winemakers to reach heights no one
had thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered American
embassies to serve only American wines, he was ridiculed by
would-be connoisseurs here and abroad. But little more than a
decade later, California wines vanquished France's finest at a
now-famous tasting conducted by French experts in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The two top American wines had been made by men trained at the
Robert Mondavi Winery in the Napa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In a new book, ``Robert Mondavi, Harvests of Joy,''(Harcourt
Brace, $27), Mondavi, now 85, recounts the story of how, almost
single-handedly, he changed the way Americans think about wine.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissed in 1965 from his family's business, the Charles Krug
Winery, after too many arguments over its direction, he borrowed
heavily and opened the Robert Mondavi Winery a year later. Today,
with 900 employees, his company makes wine in California, France,
Italy and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Passion and hard work created a singular enterprise, but not
without casualties. Success destroyed his first marriage and
alienated his children for years. With admirable honesty, Mondavi
paints an unvarnished picture of himself as a man of towering ego,
relentless ambition and monumental self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague of his once observed, ``Bob has no rearview
mirror.'' Mondavi's opinion on that? ``He's right!'' he said. ``And
I also have only one speed: fast-forward. Heaven help anyone who
gets in my way or tries to slow me down; they'll probably get
steamrolled.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of court battles that began with his dismissal from
Krug and lasted through the mid-1970s, he fought his family, and
particularly his brother, Peter, over his share of the family
business.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the courts found in Robert Mondavi's favor, making him
relatively wealthy overnight. Eventually the brothers reconciled;
but just before the court ruling, their mother, Rosa, died of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, Mondavi divorced Marjorie, his wife of some
42 years. In 1980 he married Margrit Biever, a Swiss-born woman who
was ``full of passion, creativity, business savvy and a wealth of
European taste and culture,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Biever, who had worked at the winery in public relations,
became his right hand, serving as a interpreter as the winery's
business expanded into Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi continued to put the United States on the world's wine
map. In 1979, he acquired a large winery in Woodbridge, in the
Central Valley of California, for producing lower-priced wines.
That year, the first vintage of Opus I appeared, a super-premium
red wine produced in the Napa Valley by a joint venture between
Mondavi and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild in France.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Vichon Winery, an Oakville neighbor, was acquired, as
was the Byron Winery in Santa Barbara County in 1989. More
recently, joint ventures were arranged with the Frescobaldi family
in Italy and the Chadwick family in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Robert Mondavi stock was issued publicly; from $13.50 a
share, it has traded at more than $50 this year.
</P>
<P>
   I first met Robert Mondavi in the early 1970s on maybe my first
visit to the Napa Valley. A bandy-legged, rugged-looking little guy
with a high-pitched voice, he greeted me with a warm smile. ``Had
your lunch?'' he asked. ``I have a few friends here; come on in and
join us.'' Those were the days before phalanxes of functionaries
made casual meetings with winemakers all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I have interviewed him a dozen times and
concluded that his up-front California simplicity masks a complex,
often anguished personality. His book seems to offer the same view.
</P>
<P>
   Behind his ``and then I did'' bluster is a recurrent theme of
lost innocence _ with Mama Rosa once again presiding over the
kitchen at Charles Krug, surrounded by her doting husband and happy
kids, all eager for another of her simple but superb Italian meals,
topped off with simple but honest wine.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Norman Rockwell image of what might have been or should
have been as seen by a man who thinks of himself as a simple
winemaker but who has spent most of his life in airports and hotel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there is a strident, self-congratulatory tone to the book
and it wears after a while. What's missing is a little more about
the unknown acts of generosity, the endless small kindnesses he has
provided over the years to newcomers to the valley and to
old-timers down on their luck.
</P>
<P>
   But then, at his age and with what he's accomplished, perhaps a
little braggadocio is not out of order.

</P>
<P>
   As of 1996, the bureau reports, almost 69 million were under 18
_ 26 percent of the 265 million total population. Of these, 27.1

DON'T LISTEN TO TWAIN _ COOPER IS WORTH A READ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Mark Twain issued a devastatingly critical essay
titled ``Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offences,'' and perhaps even
before that, the reputation of the man who was our country's first
great popular novelist has ridden a downward curve.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fair bet that apart from the ``Leatherstocking Tales,''
Cooper is hardly read today. The ``Leatherstocking'' saga is
stabilized by a recognizable single hero, whether he is called
Natty Bumppo or Deerslayer or Pathfinder or Hawkeye or ``the
trapper.''
</P>
<P>
   These probably are Cooper at his best. The five novels taken in
historical sequence (rather than order of publication) somehow
become more than the sum of the parts. Cooper's vision of his young
nation _ what it had been, what it was, what it would become _ is
expressed with an eloquence that transcends his stylistic failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last of the Mohicans'' often is assigned reading at the
high-school level, and today rates as Cooper's best-known and most
widely read work. ``The Prairie'' _ last in the ``Leatherstocking''
chronology _ is a likely obligation for English majors in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Leatherstocking Tales'' _ also including ``The Pioneers,''
``The Deerslayer'' and ``The Pathfinder'' _ are complete in two
volumes in the Library of America series, which also offers two of
Cooper's seafaring narratives, ``The Pilot'' and ``The Red Rover,''
in a single volume. But although the Library of America directors
publicize a mission to issue the complete works of our nation's
greatest authors, I expect they'll mainly ignore Cooper henceforth.
</P>
<P>
   James Fenimore Cooper (1789-1851) was 30 when he took up a
literary career, and in three decades he produced at least one book
every year, including three dozen novels and several nonfiction
works, one being the first scholarly history of the U.S. Navy.
</P>
<P>
   I possess an old, handsomely bound, uniform edition of all of
Cooper's fiction, in 34 volumes given to me by a library that
didn't want them. I wonder if any living person has read every
novel, and I certainly don't intend to. Yet I also believe there
can be reward in reading any Cooper novel.
</P>
<P>
   Reading 19th-century fiction, certainly those American works
that preceded the Howells-Twain-James triumvirate, is heavy going,
a chore. The great Hawthorne, the great Poe, even the great
Melville: Allowances must be made for their venerable stylistic
appointments if we're to enjoy them. The same is true of Dickens
and the eminent literary Victorians. One must adjust the reading
tempo and also discard a schedule for absorbing rhetorical fiction
of the old tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper became a novelist on a dare. He deplored that Americans,
having gained independence, continued to read only novels with
English settings by English authors. When he claimed he could write
a better novel than the English one he was reading (possibly one by
Walter Scott), his wife put him to the test. Cooper's debut work,
the now-obscure ``Precaution,'' was set in England; but thereafter,
all of his works were based in America and revealed his mastery of
the history of his young nation.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cooper became ``the American Scott,'' as counterpart to
Britain's most popular author. Take my word: Scott remains Cooper's
superior; but like Edinburgh's master, Cooper is quite super in the
matter of plot-spinning.
</P>
<P>
   I've read just enough Cooper to know his qualitative
inconsistency. ``The Spy,'' the American Revolution tale that was
his first great popular success, is almost unreadable today. He's
better when Native Americans inhabit his narrative canvas, as in
such an entry as ``The Wept of Wish-ton-Wish'' _ actually my
favorite Cooper, placed above even the Leatherstockings.
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity over the title drew me to ``The Wept of
Wish-ton-Wish,'' an exciting, ultimately tragic story centered on
King Philip's War in late 17th-century Connecticut. Conanchet,
loosely based on a chief of the Narragansett tribe, exemplifies
Cooper's occasional flair for superb characterization. There is
also the Mohican chief Uncas, whose namesake grandson will appear
in ``The Last of the Mohicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was not a great writer, but he holds strategic importance
in our nation's literary life. And valid social critic Cooper was,
without qualification, a great American.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball museum may or may not lure you to beautiful
Cooperstown, N.Y., where young Abner Doubleday may or may not have
invented the game. Cooper lived there for a time, is buried there,
and the village on Lake Otsego _ the ``Glimmerglass'' in several
Cooper novels _ is named for the author's father.
</P>
<P>
   If you go there, commune with the spirit of James Fenimore
Cooper and admire the fine statue of him at Otsego Hall, once his
home. You may even be nudged to investigate his fiction.

BECK TO THE FUTURE: RENAISSANCE MAN OF '90S MUSIC REINVENTS HIS
SOUND AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1989, Beck (last name Hansen), a slightly built folkie from
the nothing-special Los Angeles suburb of Silver Lake, took a bus
to New York to play in Greenwich Village clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to April 1997: Beck is playing Edgefest, the annual alt-rock
festival in Dallas. The previous year he had released an
art/hip-hop CD called ``Odelay;'' now, dressed in a tight suit,
playing both electric and acoustic guitar, gyrating and jumping, he
charges through ``Odelay'' songs such as ``The New Pollution'' and
``Devil's Haircut'' like a conquering hero. The crowd goes nuts. By
the end of the year, Beck also has opened for Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after playing some stadium shows over the summer with
the Dave Matthews Band, he's releasing ``Mutations,'' a quiet,
small-scale, '60s-redolent folk/country CD that bears little, if
any, musical relation to ``Odelay.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, fans and critics are happily trying to figure out
what the tall, thin, dirty-blond-haired 28-year-old will do next.
It has been, after all, only four years since the blues-rap single
``Loser'' came out of nowhere and ``I'm a loser, baby, so why don't
you kill me?'' became a slacker/alt-rock catchphrase.
</P>
<P>
   But if Beck looked like a one-hit wonder then, he has since
established himself as one of those guiding lights of pop music
that comes along far too infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   In an age dominated by one-hit wonders and acts that repeat the
same sound time after time, Beck is restlessly inventive, as
comfortable offering up cutting-edge, fun, pop-friendly hip-hop as
blues guitar licks that sound lifted directly from a 78 from the
early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't resemble him stylistically, Beck has been
compared to Prince at his quick-change rock/funk/R&AMP;B '80s peak. In
both cases, each CD has a distinct flavor and feel; every song
seems to complement the whole, and none seems out of place.
</P>
<P>
   And as with the work of the Purple One in those heady days, each
Beck CD has added to our appreciation of him; there's a method to
the madness. We don't feel as though he's changing just for the
sake of it, but that he's really finding new things to say and new
ways to say them.
</P>
<P>
   Beck can put out songs that make very little, if any, literal
sense _ just what exactly is a devil's haircut? Does even he know?
Then, on ``Mutations,'' he can offer wistful, direct folk songs
brimming with brilliant imagery and pop melodies. He rocks the
house as hard as any rock band, but he doesn't sound out of place
(or self-consciously ironic) doing straight-ahead country, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He matters because he's not static,'' says John Timmons, owner
of ear X-tacy, a respected indie label in Louisville, Ky. ``One
minute you think you have him figured out, and the next minute he
totally changes. When I was growing up, I had to have every new
Beatles and Stones record _ each one was different. Nowadays kids,
if you ask 'em if they have the new Sheryl Crow, they'll say, `No,
I already have one by her.' Beck re-creates himself on every album,
and it always makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck also has endeared himself to indie rockers by cutting a
deal with Geffen Records that allows him to continue to release
products on Bong Load. The Beck catalog is studded with odd little
small-label offerings, such as the 10-inch ``A Western Harvest by
Moonlight'' and the pure folk of ``One Foot in the Grave,'' both
from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   This combination of various American-based styles has made Beck
a genuine hero overseas. In fact, Beck is held in such high regard
by Europeans that in December 1997 he was named the most important
person in the world in a poll of musicians and critics conducted by
London's ``Select'' magazine. He beat out Liam Gallagher of Oasis,
Thom Yorke of Radiohead, Alanis Morissette and Tiger Woods, among
many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally understand it,'' says Select editor John Harris of
Beck's top spot. ``As far as musicians, he's the name people drop
all the time. He's the most influential artist of the past three or
four years. He's the best lyricist in pop music today, and even
though he draws on older influences, he sounds completely modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris adds that because Beck's records are so steeped in
Americana (from blues to folk to hip-hop) he's seen as a
representative of American culture in a way hardly any other U.S.
artists are.
</P>
<P>
   ``He translates to Europeans in the same way David Lynch movies
do, because both work with such taste,'' Harris says. ``There's a
lot of romance about him _ he's the guy playing coffeehouses and
singing about root beer and shopping malls. English people live
vicariously through him. You get the same kick out of listening to
him as you did listening to Bob Dylan in 1965. He's an American
poet, as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what also makes Beck so attractive is that he lets
other people make these sorts of claims for him; he doesn't do it
himself. The biggest claim he made for ``Mutations,'' in England's
``The Observer,'' was that it was ``nice to listen to.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as his status as pop's leading and most interesting
chameleon, he told the Buffalo News that he's just trying to ``go
the opposite way of whatever the trend is. I find it's a beautiful
beach of life, and everyone flocks to one spot. It's so obvious
there's tons of beach left, where there's lots of room.''
</P>
<P>
   If, of course, you're looking for it. Beck is, and it's working
so far.

 &HT;    What others say about Robert Prechter and his theory
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Scott Lilienfeld, an Emory University psychologist who teaches
a course on pseudoscience: ``Are these patterns in the data, or in
his head? Given his highly uneven track record in predicting the
rises and falls of the stock market, the latter seems more
likely....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that Prechter is an extremely intelligent and
ingenious individual. Nevertheless, intelligence does not immunize
people against pseudoscientific or unsubstantiated beliefs. To the
contrary, some data suggest that members of Mensa may have even
higher rates of pseudoscientific beliefs than average.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Psychologist Stuart Vyse of Connecticut College: ``Humans are
pattern-seekers, and when we have a theory that we care about, we
seek patterns that support our theory. Intelligent people are
particularly suited to this task. They can take random events and
find a kind of order in them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Phil Larkins, an owner of the Atlanta investment firm Legacy
South: ``Bob Prechter is a bright, cerebral investment professional
who has a keen and passionate grasp of the Elliott Wave Theory.
Unfortunately, when your basic investment forecast has been so
wrong for so long, your credibility will ultimately suffer. In this
business, if you are right, but too early, you are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ricky Harrington, a market analyst for Interstate/Johnson Lane
in Charlotte, N.C.: ``Just because you've been wrong doesn't mean
you don't know what you're talking about. I agree with him that the
bull market is over. I will say, it's dangerous to laugh at Bob
Prechter.''

 &HT;    He predicted problems for Bush, Clinton

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bob Prechter is best known in financial circles these
days for gloomy predictions during a record bull market. Several
times during the '90s he was convinced the run-up in stock prices
would end, but wasn't right any of those times.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other, more successful predictions, and a couple
that are yet to be tested:
</P>
<P>
   _ 1982: Predicted in the midst of long bear market that stocks
were about to explode upward. They did, and kept rising for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1987: Warned his newsletter subscribers Oct. 5, 1987, to sell
stocks, two weeks before the biggest one-day stock market crash in
history.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1989: Suggested President Bush might not be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1992: Predicted that President Clinton would leave office in
the middle of a term.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1992: Two years before the Major League strike, predicted that
baseball's popularity would begin to wane.
</P>
<P>
   _ Today: Predicts that the fitness craze will vanish in the next
half-dozen years. ``You'll see people coming up with all kinds of
reasons not to be physically fit. It won't be cool to be fit
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Today: Says basketball has either peaked in popularity or will
soon. ``I'm convinced that this last season, where Michael Jordan
wins in the last second, was probably the peak.''

 &HT;    Predicting the wave: Stock analyst regains believers
 &HT;    (EDS: With sidebars _ STOCK-GURU-OPINIONS, STOCK-GURU-BIO,
STOCK-GURU-PREDICTIONS.)
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick

<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Fame can be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Bob Prechter was world-famous, the top stock
market forecaster on the globe. Operating from his home on Lake
Lanier, his every utterance made Wall Street roil.
</P>
<P>
   But after correctly predicting the October 1987 crash, his
vision blurred. He forecast a catastrophic drop in stocks and the
worst depression in 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dow Jones average bounced around for a while, then
began the historic climb that peaked at 9,337 in August. All the
while, Prechter stuck to his guns, insisting the end was still
nigh, living in virtual obscurity, a Chicken Little in a big
chicken town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was predictable, my fall in fame,'' he muses, staring at
the image of a spiral-shaped nautilus shell in his office. ``In
fact, I did predict it. Popularity waxes and wanes, as does
everything else in nature. All collective social behavior is
predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the essence, the central notion, of the mathematical
theory known as the Elliott Wave Principle, which Prechter uses to
make all his forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Prechter, 49, is a funny, handsome guy, wired but not outwardly
weird. He's given to brown sandals that make him look like the rock
drummer he once was.
</P>
<P>
   His fall from grace hasn't ruined his life. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, he's still well off, though you wouldn't know it
from the faded 1981 Dodge Ram van he drives. And he has more
privacy. Prechter's profile is so low, in fact, that City Manager
Carlyle Cox says: ``I wouldn't say people know him if they see him
on the street. He's fairly bright. He's not involved in local
politics. Just say he's an upstanding citizen who pretty much keeps
to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been able to help his wife, Robin, a petite, pretty woman,
rear their two handsome teenagers _ daughter Dana, 16, and son
Elliott, 14 _ in relative normalcy. Dana just got her driver's
license, and Elliott, an accomplished athlete, has turned into a
computer buff.
</P>
<P>
   Like many families, they lead hectic lives. But they still find
time to squeeze in Wednesday night dinners at Chef Wang's Chinese
Restaurant, where the talk is of sports, safe driving and music _
not stocks. Robin Prechter, echoing many a busy wife or husband,
says of the Wednesday dinners: ``This is the only way we seem to be
able to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Prechter hasn't just faded away from the prognostication
business. Far from it; he's been working long hours for months on
his latest book, ``The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior,''
which he says will lay out enough proof for his theories to convert
all but the most close-minded skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   He faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   This is typical of what scientists say: ``The human mind has a
tendency to make sense out of nonsense,'' says Emory University
psychologist Scott Lilienfeld, an expert on pseudoscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologists have shown that people will often see meaningful
patterns, even in meaningless data. Prechter is detecting intricate
patterns in the vicissitudes of the stock market, and then fitting
complex mathematical models to account for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such criticisms don't faze Prechter. In fact, his fall from fame
has given him more time to explore his theory's application in
other fields. He still forecasts markets, but has also turned his
interest to researching what makes people tick. He's dived headlong
into the study of neurology, physics, fractal geometry and chaos
and complexity theory _ all of which he claims support the wave
principle.
</P>
<P>
   Now he talks less about finance than the brain's limbic system
and cerebral cortex, the study of which has convinced him that the
wave principle is a universal law of nature _ a long-overlooked
secret of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   He feels his new knowledge will make him a better forecaster
than he was in the 1980s, when he became famous for a long string
of uncanny predictions. At a time when Wall Street was in a state
of despair, he predicted in 1982 that a great bull market was
starting. Everybody scoffed, but he was right. He rode the bull for
five years, jumping off _ again to ridicule _ just two weeks before
1987's Black Monday, the worst one-day stock crash in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of his stardom, his market newsletter, the Elliott
Wave Theorist, rose in circulation to 20,000, at $233 a year.
That's $4.6 million in revenue, just for the newsletter. His fame
fed on itself. He was profiled by The Wall Street Journal, by
Fortune, Time, People, The New York Times, all the major TV
networks, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and other outlets. He
appeared on such TV programs as ``Good Morning America'' and ``The
Today Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the market climbed higher and higher after the crash,
incoming phone calls tapered off proportionately. He felt
humiliated when Louis Rukeyser, the host of ``Wall Street Week'' on
PBS, ridiculed him as a tea leaf reader. So he buckled down to find
out how his charts could have been so wrong. He decided it was him,
not them. He made a conscious decision to become, in his words, a
``recluse.'' In 1989, he stopped flying around the world to make
speeches, which gave him backaches anyway, and all but vanished
from Wall Street's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, he set out to rebuild his company, Elliott Wave
International, concentrating on institutional investors, not
individuals, and branching out into other investment areas,
offering advice not just by the month but hourly via the Internet.
He wrote five books.
</P>
<P>
   Though still derided by many on Wall Street, he must be doing
something right, because he now has 70 employees analyzing markets
and advising clients, up from 20 in '87, and leases two floors in a
building on the Gainesville square. After falling to 4,000 a couple
of years ago, his subscriber list has grown again to 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation, he says, will rise again _ the wave principle
tells him so. In fact, Wall Street is starting to show interest in
him again.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 25, Barron's magazine ran a long article on Prechter,
based mostly on a speech he made at an investment conference in New
Orleans. It noted that he's so sure he's right he's changed the
chart on the front of his main newsletter from ``Depression Ahead''
to ``Depression Beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, because of the Dow's recent skid to 7,400 and
subsequent 1,000-point rally, many on Wall Street are starting to
ask: ``What about Bob?'' He's getting more nervous calls from
people who remember his heyday and still consider him a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he is one, as certified by Mensa. But even geniuses,
Prechter concedes, can be wrong. And he's been wrong for a long
time, at least in stocks. But in the long run, he shrugs, it won't
matter. He'll be vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes it's going to be hard to sell science on his
theories, in part because what he preaches sounds like mysticism.
His work builds on that of his own guru, Ralph Elliott, an
accountant who, before he died in
</P>
<P>
   1948, developed ``evidence'' that social behavior explained
stock market gyrations. Elliott believed human progress was
inexorable, moving ahead in waves of alternating optimism and
pessimism that could be measured and predicted.
</P>
<P>
   After studying Elliott's ideas, Prechter became a convert and
took his psychology degree to Wall Street as a forecaster. He
equipped himself with tools Elliott lacked, such as computers and
historical numbers dating back to the South Sea Bubble of 1720,
when equity prices collapsed in Britain, throwing the world into a
64-year bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he claims Elliott's ideas can be used to predict everything
from stock gyrations to cycles of popularity, war and peace. His
newsletters used the same techniques to predict as early as 1989
that George Bush would not be re-elected, that his own star would
flame out, as would Michael Jackson's, that attendance at Major
League baseball games would fall after the '92 season, and, six
years ago, that Bill Clinton would probably be forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   Prechter says he can predict the future because people _ like
cattle _ sense how those around them feel. And they react, he
believes, unconsciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impulsive herding behavior of people is something that
comes from the limbic system, the cerebral cortex of the brain,''
he maintains. ``It's not something you think about. There are waves
of cooperation, waves of setback, waves of optimism and pessimism,
waves of adulation, and it's all part of that same herding impulse
that people share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what the focus is. It's still the same
patterns over and over again,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is yet another law of nature we need to pay attention to.
It's the reason behind crazes for Beanie Babies, Slinkys or pogo
sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, he urges, get ready for bad times in the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to go down until the year 2003, to below
1,000 on the Dow. We're in the most overvalued market in history.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned that the public is going to get hurt,'' he
says. ``So many people are telling people to put retirement money,
college money, into stocks, into 401(k)s. I think this is terrible.
It's like putting your life savings on a roulette wheel. Except
it's worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Should people sell?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' he says. ``I don't own a single share
of stock.''

BADIA A COLTIBUONO CETAMURA CHIANTI 1996, TUSCANY, ITALY. ABOUT
$7. 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pricewise, Cetamura is near the lower end of the impressive
wines produced by Badia a Coltibuono, the 1,000-year-old abbey and
estate of the Stucchi-Prinetti family at Gaiole in Chianti. Roberto
Stucchi, who studied oenology at the University of California, is
the winemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Cetamura is a negociant wine; that is, a wine made from
purchased grapes or from bulk wine made elsewhere and finished in
the Badia cellars. The principal grape in this and other Chiantis
is sangiovese.
</P>
<P>
   Cetamura is never a profound wine but, at its best, can be a
light- to medium-bodied Chianti with good structure and lots of
flavor. It is meant for easy current drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 vintage admirably supplies all the wine's best
attributes and sells at a delightfully low price. In doing so, it
joins other reasonably priced Chiantis whose ratio of price to
quality should embarrass the producers of many California
sangioveses.

SPANDEX SHIRT IS FUEL FOR THE FIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The saying goes, ``You have to keep the home fires burning.''
Maybe they were talking about when there's a cold front, but my
feeling is that this old cliche alludes to domestic romance.
</P>
<P>
   Of course I've been wrong about these things before. My best
friend never tires of reminding me that I thought ``Hope'' was some
very ill woman who needed an operation. Remember Jesse Jackson and
his mantra, ``Keep hope alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I'm thinking about the temperature of my home fire
because another woman did something inappropriate with my husband.
</P>
<P>
   He says that it was just a misunderstanding, a faux pas.
</P>
<P>
   I beg to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Without my knowledge, he went to work one day wearing this
short-sleeved spandex shirt that clings to his body like lathered
up soap. I have asked him not to wear this shirt unless he is with
me, but he wore it anyway. Then, when I got home from work that
evening, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, some woman touched me on my chest today.''
</P>
<P>
   What a greeting.
</P>
<P>
   My eyebrows met in the center of my head and braced themselves
for what my mouth was about to say. ``First of all, do you mean to
tell me that you wore that shirt to work today? I thought you put
it on to greet me or something. What about our deal? I won't wear
the tube sock dress and you don't wear the muscle shirt unless
we're together.''
</P>
<P>
   He lowered his head and said, ``Well, I had a jacket on until it
got too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Humph, whatever. What woman was it exactly? What's her name?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know her name but her daughter is a friend of our
son's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you trying to tell me that some woman you can't even name
just walked up and touched your chest?''
</P>
<P>
   He blushed and said, ``She wanted to know if it was real. She
said that it looked like a breastplate.''
</P>
<P>
   If he was trying to get a rise out of me, he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if it is close to Halloween! What grown man wears
a breastplate to work? Why didn't she just ask you if your chest
was real? Wait a minute. What kind of a question is that anyway?
You would go to jail for asking HER that.''
</P>
<P>
   I reached into the desk drawer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's some paper and a pencil. Draw me a sketch of this
woman. I'll give it to my girlfriends to post around town. I'm
putting out an APB first thing in the morning. Someone needs to
tell sticky fingers the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What rules?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't reach over my plate to get the salt. Stay out of my
purse and don't ever touch my husband again.''
</P>
<P>
   That night I lay in bed wondering if it was my fault. Maybe he
looked like he hadn't been touched in a while or something. Some
men look like that, you know. Eventually, I fell asleep and dreamed
about a woman with eight arms who was doing a polka with my
husband. Really weird.
</P>
<P>
   I never did identify the culprit. His sketch was just a smiley
face with a green afro. Whenever I bring up the incident, he just
laughs and tells me to forget about it. Breastplate, my foot.
</P>
<P>
   As for that tempting shirt, well, it's gone. After all, you
gotta have some kindling to start a good fire.

<HEADLINE>
BOEING INADVERTENTLY LEFT TOOL INSIDE RUDDER OF 767 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In an embarrassing quality control incident for The
Boeing Co. somewhat akin to a surgeon leaving an operating room
instrument inside a patient, a manufacturing tool was left inside
the rudder of a 767 widebody jet before it left the Everett
factory.
</P>
<P>
   The tool, known as a ``bucking bar'' and used by riveters,
bounced and banged around inside the rudder for two years after the
freighter was delivered to United Parcel Service in September 1996.
It was only found during a recent maintenance overhaul when
mechanics noticed outward dents in the aluminum skin of the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the several-pound hunk of metal had caused enough
damage inside the rudder, a critical flight control surface on the
tail of an airplane, that it was replaced free by Boeing, according
to a Boeing investigation report of the matter obtained by the
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not clear how much of a safety hazard the tool
posed during the two years it went undetected in the rudder of
plane No. N309UP, the incident comes as quality and customer
service problems have raised concerns of Boeing customers such as
UPS, which recently opted to buy new Airbus planes over more 767s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that incidents like this hurt our customers'
perceptions and we don't want that to happen,'' said Mark Sanders,
Boeing's top quality assurance manager for Everett's 747, 767 and
777 production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly working to make people aware they need to
clean up the FOD (foreign object debris) and get stuff like this
out of the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since the plane was delivered to UPS, Boeing
has made significant progress in educating workers about the
dangers of foreign object debris, he said. Signs abound in works
areas throughout Boeing's production plants in Everett and in
Renton.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's not unheard of for work tools to have been left
inside an airplane during production, Sanders said ``it's very
rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Flocke, a spokesman for the Airlines Pilots Association,
said this is the first case he knows of a bucking bar being left in
the rudder of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this was an isolated incident,'' he said. ``It
should have been caught but was not .... I don't know the risk
involved to the plane, but to have something lose like this inside
the rudder does not contribute to the safety of the flight ....
It's like a surgeon leaving an instrument inside a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   A bucking bar is a hand-held tool used as a backstop for a
riveting gun. It causes the rivet to flatten out in the airplane
skin. Since the bars have to he held in different aircraft spaces,
they come in various shapes and sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The one found in the 767 rudder weighed about 5 pounds and
measured about 3 inches by 1 inch by 6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   C.O. Miller, retired chief of the aviation bureau of National
Safety Transportation Safety Board, said a bucking bar was once
found in the rudder of a jet fighter at an aircraft maker he worked
for many years ago. The incident happened during a time of labor
strife, he said, and the bucking bar was thought to have been
deliberately left in the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the bucking bar found in the rudder of the Boeing plane,
Miller said it should be considered a serious safety issue. ``Even
if this were confined to a compartment in the rudder, it could
still weaken the entire structure when the plane is buffeted by
turbulence,'' he said. ``And if it came into contact with a
critical rudder component, God knows what could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not so much safety but that Boeing's quality
control system broke down and the bucking bar went undetected
before the rudder was sealed and the plane delivered to a customer,
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something like this can occur, then other things that are
much more critical can occur and that should be be the concern,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plane No. N309UP was the 628th to roll down the Everett 767
assembly line, records show. It was delivered to United Parcel on
Sept. 20, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It returned to Everett last month for a major overhaul by B.F.
Goodrich and Tramco mechanics. That's when they noticed the outward
skin dents in the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further investigation uncovered holes and dents in the
vertical wall near the leading edge section,'' said a report by
Boeing's airline concerns team.
</P>
<P>
   A review of production records showed the rudder was inspected
before it was closed and ``no discrepancies noted,'' the report
stated.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the heavy bucking bar was apparently used by a
worker not for riveting but to tap down bolts that connect the
rudder to the huge tail of the 767.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no riveting in that area of the plane, so we are
pretty sure the bucking bar was being used by whoever was
installing the rudder to help them tap in some of the attaching
bolts,'' Sanders said. ``It's a fairly difficult installation.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Kuelpman, in charge of public relations for United Parcel
Service at the airline's corporate offices in Louisville, Ky., said
he was not aware of the bucking bar incident.
</P>
<P>
   UPS has an all-Boeing fleet of more than 200 planes. But at the
Farnbrough international airshow outside of London in September,
UPS announced that it had decided to buy its next 30 planes from
Airbus rather than from Boeing. It placed options with Airbus for
30 more The order is potentially worth more than $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   (United Airlines recently met with Boeing to express similar
concerns after the company ordered new planes from Airbus rather
than Boeing).
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Boeing vice president John Hayhurst met with about a
dozen UPS executives in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to other Boeing managers that was obtained by the
Post-Intelligencer, Hayhurst wrote of the UPS meeting:
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had lost on price, but that was only part of the
reason. ``Even if Airbus had offered a slightly higher net price
than we did on the 767, UPS would have chosen them anyway. Reason:
They are extremely frustrated over dealing with Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   He listed several examples of concerns expressed by UPS,
including 18 instances in which Boeing had to replace skin panels
on 757 planes delivered to UPS.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases,'' Hayhurst wrote to other managers, ``the
panels were changed under duress rather than our appearing
concerned enough about our own product quality to change damaged
panels without coercion ... The issue is their perception that we
are trying to force customers to take delivery of airplanes with
unacceptable quality levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuelpman, the UPS public relations manager, said yesterday that
the relationship between Boeing and UPS is like a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have everything good forever, but we all go
through ups and downs .... '' The meeting with Hayhurst, he added,
``was to talk about going forward, not stepping backwards.''

A DIRECTOR UNDER `SIEGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a long time since a major Hollywood movie has met as
much organized, prerelease opposition as ``The Siege,'' Edward
Zwick's what-if thriller about the effects of a fundamentalist
Islamic terrorist campaign against New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Even before production began, U.S. Islamic groups invited to
examine the script were denouncing it as a slur on Islam. Since a
Los Angeles screening for Islamic community leaders last month,
several groups have been holding press conferences, issuing press
releases and lobbying movie critics about the film's ``embedded
religious stereotyping.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter what it considers the negative effect of the film,
the Council on American-Islamic Relations has set up a toll-free
number (800-784-7526) and Web site (http://www.cair-net.org) and
intends to distribute leaflets outside theaters when the film opens
Friday. It will also host a series of ``mosque open houses'' around
the country on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But one week before the opening, the prime target, director
Zwick, seemed amazingly unruffled by it all as he strolled into
Seattle's Dahlia Lounge for a lunch interview. Asked if he had
considered hiring a bodyguard, or feared he might become the Salman
Rushdie of film, he looked genuinely surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding, right?''
</P>
<P>
   A thoughtful, bearded man in his mid-40s, Zwick said he expected
the fury to peak on Friday and then gradually disappear _ having
little or no effect on the film's box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie speaks for itself. I don't think any fair-minded
person who sees it can regard it as anything but respectful of
Islam and the U.S. Islamic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick said he had strained to be sensitive to the community's
concerns from the beginning, inviting its leaders to comment on the
script (``and changes were made from their suggestions'') as well
as giving them the early screening. But his accommodating attitude
seems to have only made them more angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame, shame, shame on Hollywood,'' one black Muslim leader
was quoted as saying after seeing the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' Zwick said, ```The Siege' is really not about
terrorism. That's a cliched subject that just doesn't interest me.
What the movie is about is us: our reaction to terrorism. It's
about what a serious outbreak of terrorism in the U.S. _ and the
imposition of martial law _ could do to our ideals, to the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his influences were films like Costa-Gavras' ``Z'' and
``State of Siege'' and particularly Gillo Pontecorvo's ``The Battle
of Algiers'' _ films about the social consequences of political
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to explore is the thin line that exists between
the civil rights of an individual and the premises of a free
society _ and the obligations of law enforcement to stop terrorism.
... The movie asks the question: do we have to become a monster to
fight a monster?''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick said one of the reasons he wanted to make the film was to
dramatize how the U.S. Islamic community could well become the
scapegoat of a determined campaign by a tiny minority of Islamic
terrorists, just as Japanese-Americans became incarcerated
scapegoats of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film takes (the community's) side, and has nothing but
sympathy for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, while the Council on American-Islamic Relations does
acknowledge some ``positive aspects of the film,'' it still doesn't
like the association of Islamic religious practices with terrorism
_ and at one point suggested to Zwick that he change the villains
to neo-Nazis or white militia groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I'd done that,'' Zwick said, ``it would have
invalidated the whole premise of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The council also doesn't like the manner in which some of the
Islamic characters are portrayed, especially the sympathetic
Lebanese FBI agent portrayed by Tony Shalhoub. In a section of its
press release subheaded ``Un-Islamic Behavior by the `Good Muslim'
Character,'' it objects to the character using the ``F'' and ``S''
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appears to drink and flirt with women in a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say about that (objection) is that it shows a lack
of sophistication on their part, a lack of understanding about how
we do things in America ... even what freedom of expression is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, such an unjustified protest could reduce the
effectiveness of the group, Zwick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes out so strongly against a film that goes out of
its way to take its side, who's going to believe it when a film
comes along that is genuinely harmful to U.S. Muslim interests?
It's like crying wolf.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Winnetka, Ill., in 1952, Zwick said he went to Harvard
and fell in love with movies in the Left Bank cinemas of Paris
while he was studying there in the '60s on a Rockefeller
Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practically lived in the Cinematheque Francaise. I even met
(its legendary founder Henri) Langlois.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint of free-lance journalism, he came to
Hollywood in 1975 to study at the American Film Institute and has
since made his name as a TV director (``Special Bulletin''),
TV-series creator (``Thirtysomething,'' ``My So-Called Life''), and
director of such high-profile feature films as ``About Last
Night,'' ``Glory'' and ``Legends of the Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributes part of his success to the stability he's managed
to maintain in a very unstable business. He lives a ``normal life''
with his wife, two children (``a son, 12, and a daughter, 5''), two
dogs and two cats in a '20s-era house in a modest Santa Monica
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm not off making a movie somewhere, I coach soccer and
carpool my kids to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he's very much a product of the '60s and a member of
the '70s movie generation described in Peter Biskind's ``Easy
Riders, Raging Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(That generation) grew up with a faith in what movies can do.
I've never quite lost that faith. I still have this notion that you
can and should tackle important issues within the framework of big
scale Hollywood entertainments _ movies about ideas. Unfortunately
this kind of movie is getting to be quite scarce in Hollywood,''
Zwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Is his experience with ``The Siege'' likely to make them even
more scarce? Will it discourage financiers and filmmakers from
making more films about controversial international issues? Are
China's economic threats against the producers of last year's two
Tibet movies, for instance, likely to discourage studios from
making any movie about China?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``I really don't think so. If the Tibet
movies had made money _ and they didn't _ you'd be seeing a half
dozen more right now, no matter how much China complained about it.
If `The Siege' makes money, you'll see other serious movies about
the issue. Hollywood is all about money. That's what's awful about
it _ but also what's wonderful.''

DESIGNERS PROMISE COLOR, BUT PRODUCE A TOUCH OF GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Color. They promised us color. And gray cleverly
described as baby blue is not color.
</P>
<P>
   Spring '99 fashions were going to be colorful. Women's Wear
Daily said so. So did Donna Karan, one of the New York designers
who jumped the gun and showed her collection early, just before she
visited Seattle in September to show her fall collection.
</P>
<P>
   Karan, known for her black on black collections with an
occasional dab of navy or brown thrown in, bragged that she had
used more than 30 different colors for spring '99.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority of designers previewing their collections here
this week to fashion retailers and media are barely giving color a
lick.
</P>
<P>
   Take Max Azria, designer for the BCBG line. He sees spring as a
gray season. But he calls it ``nickel.'' He dished out a little
``burlap,'' heather gray, and more nickel, with spoonfuls of
``sand'' and mauve to sweeten things up. Black and ``carbon'' were
very visible.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the 57th item in the show _ out of 64 total _
that there was any noticeable color _ a lavender camisole under a
geranium-red satin organza coat. It looked good enough to eat.
There was even a geranium evening gown _ an extraganza of tulle and
beads _ to end the show.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pale palette, Azria produced a fascinating
collection of sportswear as evening attire. He put embroidered
aprons, often chiffon, over capri pants and T-shirts. A cropped
trouser (that means several inches above the ankles) was shown with
beaded leggings and a tulle shell. A funnel neck top _ a style
usually reserved for cotton-fleece gym wear _ was done in silk
taffeta.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this was not a collection of wear-to-work
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Allard, designer for the Ellen Tracy label, is known for
being a friend to working women. That friendship could be strained
come spring.
</P>
<P>
   Like other designers here, she's into navel-displays. She's also
fond of strapless camisoles, as in camisoles prone to sliding down
over the breasts of models as they walked the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Allard has also opted for a neutral palette: Ivory, a gray she
calls ``mist,'' a tan she calls ``nude,'' silver, charcoal and
mocha. Although there are some serious gaps between tops and
bottoms in this collection, there are some very wearable pants,
jackets and skirts that could be paired-up and worn without
embarrassment in public. Even Safeco headquarters, with its
conservative dress code, would look favorably upon a few of these
designs _ assuming one wants to wear pale ivory to work.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the finale that some color appeared. But the
coral looked more like watered-down orange sherbet, and the
shocking pinks were truly shocking, the sort of memorable clothes
that can be worn only once before they become ``Oh, here comes Lulu
in her pink dress'' fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Allard's drawstring skirts and pants were slung way below the
navel. The good news is drawstrings make them very adaptable.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to imagine some of these navel-baring,
see-through evening clothes out in public. Even at PONCHO, that
glamorous Seattle party where almost anything goes, it would take
courage to appear in some of these costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Beene, one of the oldest, most establlished designers
in New York, knows how to give women glamour and coverage. His
clothes for spring are sublime and colorful.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his show with jersey tank-top dresses done in two
colors _ pink with yellow, or lavender with gray, for example. A
slim red skirt had a pale green linen top.
</P>
<P>
   Another dress looked like a Mondrian painting with blocks of
color outlined in black.
</P>
<P>
   When a garment didn't have color, the accessories did. Beene put
red and green gloves with a navy dress. A black dress was
ornamented with day-glo orange cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Chic. Tres chic.

SOMETIMES, DRIED CAN BE MORE FLAVORFUL THAN FRESH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FRESH-MUSHROOMS.) 
(af) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Freshness is so sacred these days that a sometimes misguided
reverence for it leads cooks to use fresh pasta no matter what,
even when dried is more suitable. And with all the exotic mushrooms
sold fresh in markets, they may ignore the dried. Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Dried mushrooms are not like dried herbs, a pale substitute for
the real thing. Think raisins instead of grapes, and you have a
better analogy for dried mushrooms. They have a personality all
their own, worth exploring, and they can add character to an
everyday dish. Omitting dried mushrooms from the shopping list is
an exercise in counterproductive food snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   Take dried shiitake mushrooms, for example. Often called Chinese
black mushrooms when dried, they no longer require a trip to
Chinatown to buy. Pretty they are not: they are hard, blackish
brown and sometimes a little scaly.
</P>
<P>
   But watch what happens after they are reconstituted by soaking
in water. They become supple and take on a satiny sheen. And once
cooked, they deliver a much meatier texture and a richer flavor
than the now-commonplace fresh shiitakes.
</P>
<P>
   Using them instead of fresh does not represent a compromise. On
the contrary: they are an improvement, especially in Chinese dishes
like stir-fried vegetables in oyster sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Their succulence and deep, earthy flavor do not limit their
appeal to Asian dishes. I once added dried shiitakes to a coq au
vin I was helping a friend prepare at her weekend house because
there were no fresh mushrooms on hand. The dish was no longer coq
au vin, which is usually made with cultivated white mushrooms, but
it was a succulent triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Dried morels are almost interchangeable with fresh, which have
become more available only in recent years. If you see morels on a
menu in fall or winter, you know the chef is using the dried ones
because morels are available fresh only in spring and early summer.
</P>
<P>
   If the dish is tasty, like the memorable chicken with morels in
cream sauce that Sally Darr used to prepare years ago at La Tulipe,
the highly regarded restaurant in Greenwich Village, N.Y., what
difference does it make?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when it comes to morels and certain other varieties,
especially porcini, there is an advantage in using the dried ones
because the liquid that results from soaking them for 30 minutes or
longer can be used in the cooking to intensify the mushroom flavor.
Reduce it, and add it to a beurre blanc, a red-wine sauce or a
vinaigrette, for example.
</P>
<P>
   When soaked, dried porcini and other kinds of boletus mushrooms
yield an essence that has a deliciously intense earthiness. Dried
porcini and cepes lack the rich, buttery texture of plump, freshly
gathered ones.
</P>
<P>
   But it's difficult to find them fresh, so where flavor counts,
as in a risotto, dried will do fine. My mother often tossed some
dried Polish mushrooms, which are a boletus variety similar to
cepes and porcini, into soups, barley and kasha dishes and stews.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese pantry, which probably contains more dried
ingredients than that of any other cuisine, includes black tree
ears, a kind of fungus used in some soups and dishes like moo shu
pork. These are only available dried.
</P>
<P>
   Certain mushrooms, like oyster mushrooms and chanterelles, are
definitely not as good in the dried form as the fresh. Dried oyster
mushrooms turn leathery when reconstituted and have very little
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Dried chanterelles are often woody no matter how long they are
soaked, and lack the lovely fruitiness of the fresh. But black
trumpets, called trompette de la mort (trumpet of death) in French,
a more delicate (and perfectly safe) mushroom, are fine to use
dried.
</P>
<P>
   It takes about 30 minutes to reconstitute dried mushrooms by
soaking them in warm water. (For Chinese black mushrooms, black tea
is an excellent soaking medium.) If you plan to use the liquid in a
recipe, it may require straining through a fine sieve, a cloth or a
paper coffee filter.
</P>
<P>
   After soaking, the mushrooms should be patted dry on paper
towels. For some varieties, like shiitake, the woody stems must be
cut off and discarded.
</P>
<P>
   And you can even make your own dried mushrooms. When you buy
fresh ones, store them in an open box or basket in the refrigerator
so that air can circulate; otherwise they will rot and may molder.
</P>
<P>
   If properly stored, they will dry out, darken and shrivel over a
period of days or weeks. They will not have the eye appeal to use
in a salad, but treasure them for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are an experienced forager and find you have gathered
more wood ear, puffball or fairy ring mushrooms than you can use,
drying is the best way to preserve them. Dried mushrooms will keep
indefinitely in air-tight containers, and tossing in some whole
black peppercorns may reduce the possibility of insect infestation.
</P>
<P>
   A few ounces of dried mushrooms will cost $2 to $5. And talk
about versatile: I once added a few feather-light packages of dried
morels to the backpacking supplies my husband and son took with
them hiking in the wilds of Utah. Campfire risotto, not baked
beans, was on their menu.

   ROAST CHICKEN WITH MORELS
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Sally Darr
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2{ hours
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces dried morels
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   { cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 3{-pound chicken
</P>
<P>
   \ cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   } cup creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the morels in a bowl, cover with warm water, and soak
for 1 hour. Rinse, and pat dry. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium-size skillet over
medium heat, add the morels, and saute 5 minutes. Add the cream,
and reduce it by half. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rub the chicken inside and out with most of the remaining
butter (save a teaspoon or so), and season with salt and pepper.
Spoon the morel mixture into the cavity, tuck the wingtips in back,
and tie the legs together.
</P>
<P>
   Use the remaining butter to grease a baking dish or roasting pan
just large enough to hold the chicken, one that can later be used
on top of the stove. Place the chicken in it, and roast for 45
minutes. Turn the chicken breast-side-down, and roast for 15
minutes more, then turn it breast-side-up, and roast 5 minutes
longer. Transfer the chicken to a carving board.
</P>
<P>
   4. Pour most of the fat from the baking dish, and place the dish
over medium-high heat. Pour in the wine, and cook, stirring, until
the wine is reduced to a glaze. Pour in the chicken stock, reduce
the liquid by half, then strain it into a skillet. Spoon the morel
mixture from the cavity of the chicken, and add it to the skillet,
along with the creme fraiche and any chicken juices from the
carving board. Simmer about 5 minutes, until the sauce is smooth
and creamy. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and add the lemon
juice.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cut the chicken into serving pieces, boning the breast
sections, and arrange on a warm platter. Spoon the morel sauce over
it, and serve.

</P>
<P>
   RISOTTO WITH DRIED PORCINI
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces dried porcini mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   5 cups chicken or vegetable stock
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   3 large cloves garlic, sliced thin
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   { cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the mushrooms in a bowl, cover with lukewarm water, and
soak for 20 minutes. Drain, and pat dry, then cut into 1-inch
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a saucepan bring the stock to a bare simmer.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a large, heavy saucepan, heat the oil and 2 tablespoons of
the butter. Add the onion and garlic, and cook over medium-low heat
until the onion is translucent. Stir in the rice. Cook, stirring,
about 5 minutes, until the rice is well-coated with the butter and
begins to whiten.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add the wine to the rice mixture, stir, then add about } cup
of the hot stock. Cook, stirring, until it has almost been
absorbed. Stir in the mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   5. Continue adding stock, about { cup at a time, stirring and
adding more as the rice absorbs the stock. Regulate the heat so
that the rice and stock cook at a steady simmer. After about 15
minutes, the rice should have swelled and become somewhat tender.
Continue adding stock for another few minutes, as needed, until the
rice is plump, offers slight resistance to the bite. The mixture
will now be thickened and creamy.
</P>
<P>
   6. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter, season to taste
with salt and pepper, and dust with parsley. Serve with Parmesan
cheese on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

THIS TELEPHONE NEVER LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's the phone to use next time Bill Clinton
calls. Sharper Image calls it the ``Truth.Quest'' phone. (Love that
trendy, high.tech.dot between the words.) When someone is on the
line, the $129 phone ``searches for telltale voice modulations that
indicate stress and lack of truthfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   When a band of lights flashes green, it indicates the caller is
telling the truth. When the lights flash yellow and red, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   Don't need one of those phones in my house. Nine out of 10
callers are telephone solicitors, and I'm already flashing red
about it.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, have you noticed that most telephone solicitors now
use automated dialers, so when you pick up the phone and say
``Hello'' there's a brief silence? It allows you just enough time
to hang up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth.Quest,'' indeed. I'm waiting for a phone that detects
solicitors and hangs up at the first ring, a phone called
``Dinner.In.Peace.Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A phony Clinton calls: The other day the phone rang at the home
of Examiner reporter Greg Lewis. His 5-year-old son Desmond
answered the phone, listened for a minute or two and then hung up.
His dad asked who it was, and Desmond said it was President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty cool,'' said dad. ``You got to talk to
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't,'' said the lad. ``I didn't get to say anything.
He just kept on talking.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been a recording, but you never know.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attention, San Francisco theatrical producers: How about
bringing ``Die, Die, Diana!'' up here after it closes in San Jose
on Nov. 7? Danny Scheie's production of the musical comedy about
``the murder'' of Princess Diana has been doing so well in San Jose
two more performances have been added. It's even gotten publicity
in the London Times.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Gibboney of the San Jose State University theater
department said they expected the play to be controversial, and
even had police on hand for opening night a week ago, but so far
there hasn't been one peep of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Renee Cunha bears a startling resemblance to the late
princess, better than any imitators seen on the streets of San
Francisco during Halloween. Camilla Parker-Bowles is played by
African American actress Michelle Jones. This is San Francisco's
kind of play.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life in the hacker community, according to the Associated Press:
</P>
<P>
   ``The men who claim to have masterminded an attack on the New
York Times' Web site in September said they did it because they
were bored and couldn't agree on a video to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's what the news story called it _ ``the hacker
community.'' Some community. They can't agree on a video.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This just in from Taipei: ``An opposition politician who tossed
live piglets at aides to Taiwan governor James Soong issued an
apology yesterday _ to the pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems Taiwanese politics exists to make
Californians feel better about their own. On the other hand, here
we just cast votes before swine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In honor of Election Day, the Avenue Grill in Mill Valley is
offering a ``menu inspired by President William Jefferson Clinton''
this week. You can order ``Embroiled Fish'' on a ``Bed of Wild
Denial Rice,'' ``Tripe a la Tripp,'' ``Wild House Leeks,'' ``Blue
Dress Cheesing'' on the salad, and certain other items I wouldn't
want to talk about without a stiff ``Houdini Martini'' or
``Arkansas Sour Mash Whiskey with Little Rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Special White House Breakfast Coffee'' goes for $10,000 a cup,
but what do you want in a three-Starr restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spotted in front of Nordstrom's: A woman pulling one of those
wheeled carry-on suitcases. Its brand name: ``Amelia Earhart.''
</P>
<P>
   What genius thought up that? Given the frequency with which
luggage is lost, I think I'd prefer ``Lucky Lindy.''

WHY THE BEACH TASTES OF A FRENCH CHILDHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
This is the fourth of eight columns by Francois Payard, the chef
and owner of Payard Patisserie and Bistro in Manhattan. Payard's
collaborator on these columns is Dorie Greenspan. 
 By FRANCOIS PAYARD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Chi-chi, beignets, glace et boissons fraiches,'' the French
vendors would call out along the beach in Nice: ``Crullers,
beignets, ice cream and cold drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The sing-song phrase is engraved in my memory from summer days
playing along the Mediterranean. I can't recall how we managed to
eat those beignets _ thin slices of apple dipped in batter and
fried _ with sandy, salty fingers. But I know we did, because each
time I make one I can see the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Most cultures have some form of beignet; I'm thinking of
American fritters, Japanese tempura or the fried puffs of dough
dipped in honey that my wife's Italian family serves after every
holiday meal.
</P>
<P>
   In France, beignets are considered a classic dessert, but they
can be savory, too _ what you dip in a beignet batter is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, I'm making beignets with quinces. Quinces are a lot
like apples, but the texture is firmer, so I poach them for a few
minutes in a citrus-infused sugar syrup to soften their bite and
add some extra flavor.
</P>
<P>
   When quinces are no longer in the market, you can substitute
apples or pears, or even bananas, which don't need to be poached.
And while some beignet batters are nothing more than flour, water
and salt, like a tempura batter, and others use both beer and yeast
to leaven them, I make a batter with beer as the leavening and an
egg for richness, flavor and more puff.
</P>
<P>
   It's your choice whether to serve the beignets hot enough to
burn a few fingers, or to stack them up and enjoy them at room
temperature. But hot or cold, they should be dusted with
confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   You can stop there, or you can make a wonderful creme anglaise,
a pouring custard, that I think is the best beignet dip. Too bad
the beach vendors didn't have this _ it would have made a great
thing even greater.
</P>
<P>
   ORANGE FLOWER CREME ANGLAISE
</P>
<P>
   Time:25 minutes, plus about { hour for cooling
</P>
<P>
   6 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   2 broad strips orange zest
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons orange flower water.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine egg yolks, sugar and flour.
Whisk together until thick and pale.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small saucepan, combine the half-and-half and orange
zest. Place over medium heat and bring to a boil. While whisking
the egg mixture, very slowly pour about half the hot cream over the
yolks. Pour yolk mixture back into pot.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, heat until the creme
anglaise is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 5
minutes; if you run your finger down the back of the spoon, the
mixture should not run into the track that is made. Remove from
heat immediately, and strain the creme anglaise into a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   4. Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the
creme anglaise. Refrigerate until cool, about half an hour, then
stir in the orange flower water. Serve chilled with quince
beignets.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 cups.
</P>
<P>
   QUINCE BEIGNETS WITH ORANGE FLOWER CREME ANGLAISE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 broad strips orange zest
</P>
<P>
   1 broad strip lemon zest
</P>
<P>
   1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   4 medium quinces, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 cup beer
</P>
<P>
   4 cups oil for deep frying
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar, for dusting
</P>
<P>
   Orange flower creme anglaise (see recipe).
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium saucepan combine 4 cups water, 1 cup of the
sugar, orange zest, lemon zest and vanilla bean. Place over high
heat to bring to a boil. In the meantime, cut each quince crosswise
into 4 slices. Using a thin, sharp knife, cut the core from each
slice.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add quince slices to boiling syrup, and reduce heat to low.
Poach slices until they can be pierced easily with a knife, about 8
to 10 minutes. Drain on a cooling rack.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, remaining 3
tablespoons sugar, a pinch of salt and the egg. Whisk together to
blend thoroughly. Very gradually add the beer, whisking until the
batter is smooth and the consistency of heavy cream.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil until a
bit of batter tossed in sinks, then pops up quickly. Working with 4
at a time, dip slices into batter to coat evenly, then drop into
the oil. Fry until golden on both sides, about 3 minutes. Drain on
paper towels, and continue with the rest of the quince slices. Dust
beignets with confectioners' sugar. Serve hot or at room
temperature, accompanied by orange flower creme anglaise for
dipping.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 16 beignets.

`THE WALNUT COOKBOOK': WALNUTS IN EVERY GUISE IMAGINABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUZANNE HAMLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The annual walnut harvest, a bountiful one, is under way in
California, the United States' walnut headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Walnuts are, hands down, the nation's favorite nut. In France,
the walnut is equally popular, particularly in the robust cuisine
of the Perigord region, in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Walnut Cookbook'' by Jean-Luc Toussaint (Ten Speed Press,
paper, $14.95) is a collection of about 100 well-known and
not-so-known Perigord recipes. Many are unusually appealing, and
some (walnut-husk liqueur and walnut-leaf wine) are intriguing. For
cooks with a walnut tree, there are even three recipes using green
(unripe) walnuts. As translated by Betsy Draine and Michael Hinden,
the recipes are marvels of clear writing.
</P>
<P>
   Toussaint is a chronicler of the Perigord, so there is plenty of
walnut folklore (including, this being France, a little walnut
flirting game).
</P>
<P>
   I found it difficult to stop testing recipes after the first
dozen or so triumphs, which included a Roquefort and walnut omelet;
a smoked trout, avocado and walnut salad; a diced cucumber salad
with walnut and yogurt dressing; walnut tapenade; duck with walnut
sauce; brandade with walnuts; pork chops with walnut sauce; walnut
and grape jam; banana and walnut sherbet; honey-walnut ice cream,
and several of the walnut cakes, the gateaux aux noix that seem to
be in every bistro and pastry shop in southwest France.
</P>
<P>
   Usually made without much flour, these little discs are rich
with butter and walnuts. It's a tossup for the best one in this
collection of 14, but my favorite is a deceptively modest walnut,
prune and almond cake, just as good for breakfast as it is for
ending a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   The book leaves out one cautionary note: Just harvested, walnuts
are meaty and moist, but most shelled walnuts are dried slightly to
facilitate shipping and storage.
</P>
<P>
   The thin membrane covering the nutmeat becomes more tannic when
dried. It's easy to get rid of that mouth-puckering taste simply by
blanching the shelled nuts for a minute or so in a pot of boiling
water. Then drain them, rub off the membrane with a towel and let
the nuts dry. For the deepest walnut taste, spread the nuts on a
baking sheet, and put them in a 350-degree oven for eight to 10
minutes, until they smell toasty.
</P>
<P>
   If you can resist eating them on the spot, you can freeze them
for six months or more in tightly sealed plastic bags. Or proceed
immediately to Toussaint's recipes.
</P>
<P>
   WALNUT-PRUNE CAKE from ``The Walnut Cookbook''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 65 minutes
</P>
<P>
   9 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   5 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup finely ground almonds
</P>
<P>
   2/3 scant cup sifted all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cognac or brandy
</P>
<P>
   1 cup walnut pieces, chopped fine
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pitted prunes.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour the side and
bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan.
</P>
<P>
   2. Using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter at medium
speed. Gradually add the sugar, and beat until creamy. Add the eggs
one by one, beating continuously. Add the ground almonds. Combine
the flour and baking powder, and sift them into the batter, beating
until smooth. On low speed, beat in the cognac.
</P>
<P>
   3. Using a food processor, chop the walnuts into fine pieces.
Dice the pitted prunes into \-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add the chopped walnuts and diced prunes to the batter. Pour
the batter into the prepared cake pan, smoothing the top.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place the pan at the middle level of the oven, and bake for
about 45 minutes, or until the top is rounded and golden. Remove
and let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Loosen the cake in the pan
by running a knife around the side. Turn the cake onto a cooling
rack; immediately reverse the cake, and let it cool top-side-up.
</P>
<P>
   6. Serve the cake alone or with a scoop of ice cream, fall
fruits or a snifter of brandy. Well-wrapped, the cake will keep at
room temperature for two days and in the refrigerator for three
days.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 servings.

A NEW IRON GIVES WAFFLES CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By AMANDA HESSER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The electric waffle iron is one appliance from the 1950s that
never really evolved. While newer items like the food processor
combine the tasks of many tools and gadgets, the waffle iron still
does just waffles.
</P>
<P>
   It must be pulled out of the closet and plugged in, it does only
a couple of waffles at a time and it is difficult to clean. And at
about $40, it seems a bit high for something people do not use very
often.
</P>
<P>
   But it may finally have some competition: the Nordic Ware
Belgian Waffle Iron. Its appeal? It is not electric, which means it
is more compact, and it is far easier to clean. Though it, too, is
about $40, it may get more use.
</P>
<P>
   To see how it performed, I tested it against an average electric
waffle iron, the Villaware Belgian Waffler. The Villaware iron made
a picture-perfect waffle. And making it could not have been easier.
I put the batter in, closed the lid and waited for the light to go
off.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting waffle was evenly browned, uniform in shape and
looked as if it had just come out of a factory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordic Ware waffle iron, on the other hand, took some skill
to use. The flat, square two-sided iron, which weighs a tad over
three pounds, must be heated for a few minutes on both sides on the
stove top before adding the batter. I cooked the waffle on one side
for a little less than a minute, then flipped the iron to brown the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Nordic Ware's greatest advantage became
apparent. It allows the cook to control the heat so you can have
dark waffles that are unevenly browned and rustic-looking, or pale,
soft and spongy ones. Which makes it perfect if you're cooking for
a fussy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Waffles cooked dark in the Nordic Ware iron were also crispier
than ones from the electric iron. If you heat up the pan enough, it
browns the outside of the waffles quickly and deeply while allowing
the center to stay moist. An electric waffle iron cannot do this,
as it has even heat. For a dark waffle, you must overcook it, and
then the interior ends up dry.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordic Ware Belgian Waffle Iron sells for about $40 in New
York City.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ Brad Pitt eats pancakes there. Sandra
Bullock asks for huevos rancheros. Nicolas Cage shows up with his
family for brunch. And Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, over numerous
cups of coffee, worked out the plot of the movie ``Swingers'' and
actually filmed a crucial scene there.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not some trendy cafe with an unlisted phone number and
a snooty policy of favoring celebrities, models and assorted
hangers-on. It's the thoroughly nondescript Hollywood Hills Coffee
Shop, (first come, first served) in a downscale Best Western Hotel
on Franklin Avenue near Vine Street _ a part of town in need of
urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   And what makes the coffee shop successful is not so much the
movie and television clientele but the high-quality comfort-style
food _ breakfast dishes all day _ which seems as unglamourous and
basic as the street outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We serve all day long because that, really, is the L.A.
lifestyle,'' said Susan Fine Moore, the coffee shop's owner, a
onetime chef, restaurant consultant and food writer. ``Here you're
always driving somewhere _ you can have a meeting at noon, go over
the hill to a studio in the valley and be finished at 2:30, and
you're hungry. You go to a fancy restaurant, and they say, `Oh, the
kitchen's closed.' I don't understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore took over the once-shabby restaurant with her husband,
Michael Moore, a former model, in 1994. The food, she said, was
``inedible, beyond crummy, embarrassing.'' Shaking her head, she
said: ``Half the time the lights weren't even on. There were dead
fake plants in the window.''
</P>
<P>
   But the feisty Ms. Moore said the place had ``good bones.'' With
a $50,000 investment, the couple repainted, cleaned up, bought new
dishes (``There wasn't a plate that matched,'' she said), built red
Naugahyde booths, hired a new staff and created a sort of diner-Mex
fusion menu. The dishes range from omelets and meat loaf to
burritos and the popular torta tortillas (omelets made with
tortillas and topped with salsa).
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly, Ms. Moore kept prices low (most dishes cost less than
$10), sent out flyers in the neighborhood (which is populated by
aspiring actors) and hung out a sign saying, ``Last Cappuccino
Before the 101.'' (Thousands of cars pass the restaurant en route
to the nearby Route 101, the Hollywood Freeway; it was a signal, of
course, that the coffee shop was coming up in the world.)
</P>
<P>
   Its coffee shop roots give it little tolerance for Hollywood's
diet fads. ``We kind of pride ourselves on being an oasis from all
that craziness,'' said Ms. Moore, who is planning to open another
restaurant, the Bungalow, nearby. ``There's a new diet, a new fad
every week, but actually people seem a little bit less obsessed
than they used to be about diets. Otherwise we wouldn't be so busy.
Generation X is lovely _ they'll eat anything. And the older
generation is figuring, I suppose, who wants to live to 108 if you
can't put butter on your potato?''
</P>
<P>
   In the first weeks of Ms. Moore's management of the restaurant,
and as word spread, customers began to drift in, especially actors
and others who live in the more affluent Hollywood Hills and
Beachwood Canyon areas nearby. The earliest customers were
noncelebrities in the film and television business who lived in the
neighborhood _ set designers, makeup artists, costumers,
cinematographers, writers, producers, mid-level executives. The
comedy team that created the CBS show ``Everybody Loves Raymond''
used a back room at the restaurant to write the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, celebrities began showing up _ Kevin Spacey,
Gwyneth Paltrow, Edward Burns, Jennifer Aniston, Johnny Depp,
Minnie Driver, Matthew McConaughey, Gary Oldman, Andy Garcia,
Quentin Tarantino. Brad Pitt's arrival caused a bit of a stir. ``It
was like meeting, well, Burt Lancaster,'' said Ms. Moore, who is
50. And the place is starting to show up in some of the customers'
material: Sandra Bernhard refers to it in her show opening Thursday
night at the Booth Theater in New York, ``I'm Still Here . . . Damn
It!''
</P>
<P>
   What do the customers like about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great food in a very relaxed atmosphere _ and you
don't feel like everyone's craning their heads to see who's having
breakfast with who,'' said Lorenzo Di Bonaventura, president of
worldwide production at Warner Brothers, who often eats there in
the morning on the way to work.

   Jon Favreau, the actor, who was living in a $470-a-month
apartment near the restaurant when Ms. Moore took it over, began
spending afternoons there drinking coffee at a table with his
friend Vince Vaughn, then another unemployed actor. They began
plotting the screenplay for ``Swingers,'' about unemployed actors
in Hollywood. A key scene in the hit film _ in which Vaughn matches
goo-goo eyes with a woman who turns out to be making faces at her
baby _ was shot at the coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a family atmosphere,'' Favreau said. ``We didn't
have a lot of money, and I lived in a tiny apartment up the block.
I loved the people who ran the place, who made you feel like a big
shot, even if you weren't. Very good portions _ you never left
hungry.''

   Favreau, who grew up in New York, added: ``It's a gathering
place. You always run into a dozen people you know. It reminds me
of places in Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's 2,500-square-foot dining area seats 88 people
at 15 tables and a 14-seat counter. The prime tables are the
half-dozen booths by the windows, but there are no reservations,
and even well-known actors wait in line.

   Sometimes people from as far west as Brentwood and Beverly Hills
take the long drive to Hollywood for Sunday brunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an inside joke,'' Ms. Moore said. ``People from
Brentwood come here, and if you take them to what we consider the
best table, they'll refuse it right away. They have to refuse the
first table you show them. We'll call them on it. We'll say, `Are
you from Brentwood?' They'll say, `How did you know?' ''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A LIBRARY GETS WIRED AND ORDERED, EN FRANCAIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (hlw) 
 By JOHN RUSSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Manhattan has many libraries, big and small, young
and old, and at least two of them are now much in the news. In the
renovated Rose Main Reading Room at the New York Public Library on
Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, the very act of bending over a book
now has a built-in majesty. Even first-time users may feel that
they have been co-opted among Shakespeare's ``potent, grave and
reverend seigniors.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manhattan also has a new and specialized library in which
efficiency and elegance go hand in hand. It is in the French
Institute/Alliance Francaise at 22 East 60th Street. You don't have
to be bilingual to have a wonderful time in this library.
</P>
<P>
   Even with elementary French, you can cruise the whole range of
French illustrated magazines. You can sing along, sotto voce, with
Charles Aznavour on CDs. You can turn to the CD-ROM and run the
gamut of France from the Champagne country to the high Alps. It
does not come quite free, but at $65 a year ($50 for the elderly)
you can get yourself a whole new persona.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, now generally called the FIAF, was founded
exactly 100 years ago by a group of private American enthusiasts.
Unlike its namesake in London, it has never been subject to the
French government and is to this day a not-for-profit institution.
</P>
<P>
   There had always been a library at the institute, and its
shelves harbored many a welcome surprise for the informed
researcher. In other respects, however, it had fallen far behind
the times by the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The spaces available to it rambled this way and that. Levels
were uneven, equipment antiquated, dead ends not unknown. The new
technology of information played no part, and the books soldiered
on with zero conservation control. Radical action was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's centenary in 1998 would clearly be the ideal
time for that rescue. Coincidentally, the French Ministry of
Foreign Affairs was reviewing the status of French libraries
abroad. New York in that context was an important center.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, the ministry for the first time gave money to a
private foreign institution when it awarded the institute a
matching grant of $1 million toward the renovation (or, more
exactly, the reinvention) of the library. That sum was matched
within six months by the institute's American board members. (The
entire project cost around $2.7 million.)
</P>
<P>
   It so happens that Michael Graves, one of the most gifted and
versatile American architects of the day, has a magical touch with
libraries both big and small. When asked to design a room for rare
books in the American Academy in Rome in a space that was 11 feet
wide, 40 feet long and 20 feet high, he was not deterred. His
feeling for materials, his feeling for nuance and his ability to
draw upon the past all came into play.
</P>
<P>
   His chairs in Rome paid homage to an English architect, Sir John
Soane, and in his handling of a very awkward space he tipped his
hat to a 15th-century library in Cesena, Italy. The wood used
throughout was pearwood, which in the words of the donor, Barbara
Goldsmith, ``has the soft color of melted caramel.'' In details
such as this, seduction lurks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Graves had also built a library in Denver, that was
almost literally ``as big as all outdoors.'' Completed in 1996, it
is a 405,000-square-foot extension of an existing building. It
gives both space and dignity to the standard disciplines that a
library must foster.
</P>
<P>
   But it also includes a separate Storytelling Pavilion for
children. There is nothing of the classroom about its high walls
and ceiling, every inch of which is covered, pajama-style, with
broad blue-and-white stripes. Boredom is banished thereby.
</P>
<P>
   Graves was just the man for the new French Institute library. He
designed every single thing about it, from the copper shades over
the lights in the magazine room to the emblem (a vine-leaf in
flower) on the pale blue carpet that turns up everywhere. What had
been a dingy, tumbledown interior is now rational, airy and filled
with a soft clear light that never digresses into shadow. One room
leads to another, gently and easily, and there are no second-rank
rooms that could be mistaken for jumped-up closets.
</P>
<P>
   He designed the children's furniture, and he made sure that the
screen on their computer was just the right size and height for 3-
to 6-year-olds. And he used maple everywhere, from the long wooden
poles that hold the latest French newspapers to the generous
form-fitting armchairs that nestle up to the big circular tables in
the reading room. It is one of the properties of maple that it does
not trap the light but catches it and passes it on.
</P>
<P>
   Even in France, there used to be libraries that appeared to be
made more for detention than for delight. In the new library,
spirits are raised and standards set high from the moment that we
get to the top of the stairs. All around us _ on open stacks, too _
is what looks like an almost complete set of major French writers,
past and present, in the monumental ``Pleiades'' edition from
Gallimard.
</P>
<P>
   Straight ahead, above the reception desk, is a bust of Marianne,
the archetypal free-spoken and fine-looking young Frenchwoman. Also
on hand are busts of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, who
figure as benevolent American greeters in what is almost entirely a
French scene.
</P>
<P>
   There are no cathedral ceilings in this library, which straddles
two buildings and has no natural light. But Graves has turned both
these handicaps into advantages. Just when we might notice that the
ceilings are rather low, he has opened up one of them with an
oculus, a large circular see-through hole with railings at the top
of it. This one gives us a glimpse of a world way above our heads,
where rare and ancient works of reference live in privileged
isolation. Illogical as it may be, we feel taller for having looked
up at it. As for the difference of level between the two buildings,
he has turned that, too, to advantage with a long, narrow, carpeted
slope that leads down into a rather mysterious room in which four
very large computers sit waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Auto-Apprentissage is the name for this department of the
library. It may sound like an upmarket driving school, but in fact
it is where we can improve our French (by appointment only) with
the help of a language program tailor made to our specific needs.
With the help of those massive machines, we shall soon know exactly
where we go wrong and how to put it right.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, we have instantaneous access to exact knowledge in
the Reference Center. Not only can we consult every dictionary,
encyclopedia and reference book that takes our fancy, but we can
call up any article, any name or even any one word on the screen.
This can be done in a matter of seconds. We can also look up
anything we need from the several years' run of Le Monde, stored on
a CD-ROM. Thanks to the CD-ROM, we can also tour the great museums
of the world as ``virtual'' visitors.
</P>
<P>
   While in the library, we can also play videos, listen to CDs and
look at ``bandes dessines'' (defined by the library as ``French
comics for adults.'') A hundred current French magazines and
newspapers are waiting. So is the online computer book catalog, a
marvel of contrivance. This, truly, is knowledge that sets us free.
</P>
<P>
   Institute members may also borrow classic French movies, books
on tape, audio cassettes, CD-ROMs, magazines and whatever they want
from the thousands of books on the open stacks. While they make
their choices, they will be in an indoor Arcadia where they will
never see anything ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet is that their evenings at home need never, ever, be
dull.

NONREACTIVE POTS  
 CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR  
 LARGE AND EXTRA-LARGE EGGS  
 CLUMPY, HEAVY RISOTTO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MELISSA CLARK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I've never been sure what a ``nonreactive'' pan is, and so
many recipes call for them. Could you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A. As the name implies, a nonreactive pan is one that will not
interact with any of the substances it holds. Technically, it means
anything that is not made of metal, since all metals react to some
degree with heated liquids. But some metals are much more reactive
than others, and when a recipe calls for a nonreactive pan or bowl,
it basically means you should avoid one made from unlined aluminum,
copper or cast iron.
</P>
<P>
   This is because these three metals react quickly and noticeably
with foods, especially those high in acid. In the case of aluminum
and cast iron, light-colored ingredients can turn dingy and gray;
in the case of copper, they can turn green. In fact, Harold McGee,
in his book ``The Curious Cook'' (North Point Press, 1990), says
that at one time cooks were advised to boil vegetables in copper
pots for the lovely green color the metal imparted.
</P>
<P>
   In the past there had been some concern about possible health
risks associated with copper and aluminum pots and pans. But
current research seems to show that while ingesting huge amounts of
copper and aluminum can cause illness, cooking in unlined reactive
pots does not appear to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, nowadays most pots and pans are manufactured to be
nonreactive. Copper and aluminum pans are routinely lined with
stainless steel, which is virtually inert, and stainless steel can
be used all by itself (although it doesn't conduct heat as well as
when combined with copper or aluminum). Anodized aluminum (a
hardened aluminum alloy), heat-resistant glass, and enameled
stainless steel are some other nonreactive options.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing to keep in mind, though. Occasionally, a
reaction is desirable. Such is the case with cast iron, since the
iron that leaches into the food cooked in the pan is a beneficial
dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to beating egg whites in a copper bowl, as
pastry chefs discovered hundreds of years ago. This makes the eggs
much more stable, lessening the chance that they will break down.
That is because the proteins in the egg whites bond with some of
the acids in the copper and create a stronger, more flexible
egg-white foam.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a copper bowl, you can achieve a similar
effect by beating an acid into the whites: A pinch of cream of
tartar or a drop of vinegar or citrus juice will do nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' Sugar
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know that confectioners' sugar normally contains a small
amount of cornstarch _ 2 percent to 3 percent. In several
situations where I have used confectioners' sugar, I thought the
cornstarch added an undesirable taste or texture. Is it possible to
buy (or make) powdered sugar without the cornstarch?
</P>
<P>
   A. Unfortunately it isn't. The cornstarch is added to
confectioners' sugar to keep it from caking; without it, the fine
sugar crystals would meld into a solid block, making the sugar
nearly impossible to use.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some pure powdered sugar made for pharmaceutical
use, it is never sold for cooking, since special equipment is
required to uncake it.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it possible to make confectioners' sugar at home. While
you can whirl granulated sugar in a blender until it's powdery, it
will never have that melting, floury texture of true confectioners'
sugar, and it will not thoroughly dissolve in butter creams and
glazes. (It can, however, be used as a garnish in a pinch if no
confectioners' sugar is at hand.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing to keep in mind about the cornstarch in confectioners'
sugar is that it sometimes helps the recipe: It can make some types
of cookies (shortbread, for example) and meringues crisper and some
butter cakes melt-in-the-mouth tender.
</P>
<P>
   Large and Extra-Large Eggs
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been told that extra-large eggs are what you should
use in recipes because today's large eggs are smaller than they
used to be. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A. According to the American Egg Board, it's not. Egg sizes have
been standardized since the 1940s, and eggs are measured according
to their average weight per dozen.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been around long enough might have noticed that
eggs look smaller in the skillet than they did before the
widespread use of refrigerated trucks and before eggs were commonly
refrigerated in supermarkets and kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Because eggs stay fresher longer than they did a generation ago,
the whites are firmer and more coagulated. Thus, when a fresh egg
is broken into a frying pan, its white spreads less than whites
used to, and therefore the egg looks smaller.
</P>
<P>
   So when a recipe calls for using large eggs, which most of them
do, that's what you should use. But if you already have extra-large
eggs on hand, you can use five of them for every six large eggs
called for in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Clumpy, Heavy Risotto
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does my risotto always seem denser and clumpier than the
risotto in restaurants, where every grain of rice seems distinct? I
use arborio rice and stock, and follow directions, but I always
have this problem.
</P>
<P>
   A. Making a perfect creamy risotto _ in which individual grains
of rice are soft enough and the consistency is somewhere between
oatmeal and a cloud _ definitely takes practice. There are several
things that can go wrong along the way, producing the results you
describe: a heavy, sticky dish.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviness that plagues you probably comes from adding either
too much liquid overall or from adding the right amount of liquid
but adding it all at once. In either case, the rice will absorb the
liquid too quickly and become dense and weighty. Better to add the
liquid gradually, about a half a cup at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Add only enough to cook the rice through: To test if it's done,
bite into a grain; it should be firm yet tender, and not at all
chalky.
</P>
<P>
   The sticky clumps come from not stirring enough. Stirring the
risotto helps break down the rice, releasing its starch. The starch
binds the sauce, making it creamy and smooth. Traditionalists have
a point: They contend that risotto must be stirred constantly for
its entire cooking time, which can run to 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Some other hints for making a successful risotto: Don't rinse
the rice (you want to preserve as much of the starch as possible).
Sauteing it first in butter or oil until it is translucent is an
important step _ don't try to bypass it. Another vital point is to
add only simmering liquid to the rice: Keep your liquid at the
ready on another burner. Once your risotto is done, serve it
immediately. Letting it sit makes it heavier.

WHAT REAL HATE SPEECH SOUNDS LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for the News-Record and all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prochoicers were quick to link the cold-blooded murder of
Barnett Slepian, the New York abortion doctor, to ``hate speech''
from the prolife mainstream. On the CBS Evening News last week, Dan
Rather raised the charge that ``rhetoric from the anti-abortion
movement is helping to incite this kind of murderous violence.'' A
New York Times editorial warned, ``Frequent accusations by some
anti-abortionists that abortion providers are committing murder can
only fuel more terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   This variety of guilt by association _ blaming decent if
passionate prolifers for the awful crimes of a fanatic on the
fringe _ has become routine. When John Salvi killed two abortion
clinic employees in Brookline on the last day of 1994, the Planned
Parenthood spokesman promptly censured the ``inflammatory
rhetoric'' of abortion opponents for having ``fostered this
climate.'' The National Organization for Women declared, ``The
National Right to Life Committee, the Pro-Life Action League and
Operation Rescue ... are responsible for these shootings.'' Slepian
himself vented the same outrageous accusation. ``These nonviolent
people who are clasping their rosaries,'' he said then, ``... bear
some responsibility for the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it only in the context of abortion that such charges are
made. When Matthew Shepard was beaten to death in Wyoming, the
``homophobia'' of anyone who disapproves of homosexuality was
blamed for the atrocity. The lynching of James Byrd in Jasper,
Tex., was the fault, in part, of ``racism'' from those who oppose
racial preferences. The terrorist attack on the federal building in
Oklahoma City? That was laid to ``extremism'' from conservative
radio talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   It amounts to a kind of intellectual blackmail: Keep your
opinions to yourselves, the Left threatens its critics, or we will
condemn you and your ``hate speech'' for encouraging homicide. (The
bullying is almost always one-way _ conservatives did not indict
environmentalists for the crimes of the Unabomer, or hold antiwar
protesters liable for the murders of the Weather Underground.) But
that is not the worst of it. Those who play the hate-speech card as
a way of demonizing people they disagree with are not only
poisoning public discourse, they are trivializing the power of
speech that truly (ital) is (unital) lethal.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good month to reflect on the toxicity of words meant
to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 9 marks the 60th anniversary of (ital) Kristallnacht,
(unital) the 1938 ``Night of Shattered Glass'' unleashed by the
Nazis to terrorize Germany's Jews. The date was chosen specially by
Josef Goebbels, Hitler's propagandist, to honor the birthday of
Martin Luther, the 16th century monk who was a father of the
Protestant Reformation and the founder of what became the Lutheran
church.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler greatly admired Luther: ``He saw the Jew as we are only
beginning to see him today.'' Indeed. Luther saw the Jew as
``hopeless, wicked, venomous, and devilish ... our pest, torment,
and misfortune.'' Initially certain that his version of
Christianity would appeal to Jews, he expected large numbers of
them to convert. When that failed to happen, he turned violently
against them. In 1543, Luther published ``On the Jews and Their
Lies,'' a work that would become known throughout Germany _ perhaps
the most widely disseminated work of antisemitism by a German until
the rise of the Nazis 400 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``What then shall we Christians do with this damned, rejected
race of Jews?'' Luther asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, their synagogues should be set on fire, and whatever
does not burn up should be covered or spread over with dirt, so
that no one may ever be able to see a cinder or stone of it....
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, their homes should likewise be broken down and
destroyed....
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirdly, they should be deprived of their prayer-books and
Talmuds, in which such idolatry, lies, cursing, and blasphemy are
taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourthly, their rabbis must be forbidden under threat of death
to teach any more....
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifthly, passports and traveling privileges should be
absolutely forbidden to the Jews....
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixthly, I advise that ... all cash and treasure of silver and
gold be taken from them....
</P>
<P>
   ``Burn down their synagogues, forbid all that I enumerated
earlier, force them to work, and deal harshly with them.... If this
does not help we must drive them out like mad dogs, so we do not
become partakers of their abominable blasphemy and all their other
vices. I have done my duty. Now let everyone see to his.''
</P>
<P>
   (ital) That (unital) is hate speech.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years ago next Monday, on the night of Luther's birthday,
Nazi gangs rampaged across Germany. In every Jewish neighborhood,
windows were smashed and buildings were torched. All told, 101
synagogues were destroyed, and nearly 7,500 Jewish-owned business
were demolished. On that night, 91 Jews were murdered; 26,000 more
were rounded up and sent to concentration camps. It was the
greatest pogrom in history. And it was nothing compared with what
was to come.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, words can kill. There is such a thing as deadly rhetoric,
and its effects can be long-lived and murdereous. But one is not
guilty of lethal hate speech merely for voicing an opinion that Dan
Rather or Planned Parenthood don't share. The assassination of Dr.
Slepian was bad enough. No one should be using his death as an
excuse to slander others.

JUSTICES CRITICAL OF UNCHECKED AUTHORITY OF POLICE IN SEIZING
PROPERTY OF MOTORISTS  

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An intensely skeptical Supreme Court on Tuesday
questioned whether police may search the cars of motorists they
cite for traffic violations and to what extent law enforcement
personnel must tell people how they can recover property seized
under a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, hearing the appeal of an Iowa motorist, often took
the state's lawyer to task as she sought to defend the
constitutionality of a police officer's search of the car. In the
other case, an appeal brought by West Covina, Calif., the high
court urged the city's attorney to explain why police failed to
give property owners enough information to enable them to recover
their seized items.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases presented variations on the constitutional right
of people to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures,
embodied in the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Iowa Attorney General Bridget Chambers said police
acted reasonably in searching Patrick Knowles' car after citing him
for speeding. David Lawrence, a private attorney representing West
Covina, argued that city police officers had no constitutional
obligation to spell out how Lawrence and Clara Perkins could
recover goods the police seized.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iowa case, several justices appeared critical of the
seemingly unchecked authority of Iowa police officers to search
cars of motorists cited for traffic violations. Under intense
questioning, Chambers conceded that Iowa police could search people
who have been cited for other minor offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you be strip searched for jay walking?'' Justice Antonin
Scalia asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, Chambers responded. But, she said police may conduct more
limited searches of people suspected of committing an offense for
which an arrest can be made, such as a traffic violation or jay
walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty good situation for the police,'' Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg interjected. People would be better off if they are
arrested because at least then the police would have to inform them
of their rights to remain silent and to an attorney, Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers was urging the justices to affirm an Iowa Supreme Court
decision upholding Knowles' drug conviction. He was convicted of
possession after a police officer, who cited him for speeding,
searched Knowles' car and found marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles challenged his conviction, arguing that the officer
found the drugs during an illegal search. The Supreme Court has
ruled that police may search a car after arresting the motorist but
has not upheld searches following citations.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, posing a hypothetical situation,
asked Chambers whether a police officer could constitutionally
arrest a motorist temporarily, conduct a search and then release
the driver if the examination yields no incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be good public policy,'' Chambers responded, but it
would not be unconstitutional. The response drew a humorous aside
from Justice John Paul Stevens, who suggested that Iowa police
might use that controversial tactic sparingly. ``They might save it
for out-of-state motorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers defended the actions of Iowa police, saying the
legislature would curb that authority if abuse occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Chambers, Knowles' attorney said police officers may
search a motorist's car only after arresting the driver. However,
some justices asked whether a police officer has in fact
``arrested'' a motorist simply by pulling him over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police officer is telling you, `Go no further,' '' Scalia
said to the attorney, Paul Rosenberg of Des Moines, Iowa. Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor added that a motorist stopped by a police
officer is not free to leave even if the driver has not been
formally arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg responded that court decisions involving searches have
distinguished between arrests and traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   The West Covina case involved the Perkinses' effort to recover
items the police seized as part of their investigation of a tenant
in their house who was suspected in a fatal shooting. A note the
police left to inform the Perkinses of the seizure failed to
include a search-warrant number, which the court said they needed
in order to recover their property.
</P>
<P>
   The Perkinses sued West Covina, saying their constitutional
due-process rights were violated by the police's failure to provide
complete information on how they could retrieve their property,
which included a starter pistol and $2,469 in cash. The U.S.
District Court for Central California ruled for the city, but the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of appeals reversed, concluding the police
should have spelled out more extensively what the Perkinses would
have to do to get their property back.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, the city's attorney, told the justices the 9th Circuit
failed to consider the bulk of information the police gave the
Perkinses about their property, including what items were taken, by
whom and what officers they should contact if they had questions.
But, that list apparently did not assuage O'Connor's concern that
the Perkinses lacked the required information, the search-warrant
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder why the city doesn't want to help its citizens''
recover seized property, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, of Pasadena, Calif., responded that the Perkinses
could have made a motion to the court to recover their property
even if they did not have the number.
</P>
<P>
   However, attorney Patrick Smith of Los Angeles, pressing the
Perkinses' case, countered that people should not have to go hire a
lawyer to recover property seized by the police. The justices are
expected to render their decisions in the two cases, West Covina,
Calif. vs. Perkins and Knowles vs. Iowa, by July. &QL;

HDTV WILL MAKE YOUR CURRENT TV SET OBSOLETE IN NEXT DECADE OR TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something big happened with television in the past couple of
days. Really big. As in the medium will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Missed it? We all did. But it happened.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV is here.
</P>
<P>
   This is not some new cable channel dedicated to home decor.
Rather it is high-definition television, which will, within the
next decade or two, make your current television as obsolete as the
eight-track player in your attic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a different television-viewing experience,'' says
Richard Parsons, president of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The first HDTV broadcast was last Thursday of the launch of John
Glenn and the space shuttle Discovery. If you thought the picture
on your screen looked the same as always, you were right.
</P>
<P>
   You probably don't have a TV set capable of receiving HDTV. Only
42 stations will be transmitting high-definition signals at first.
</P>
<P>
   So what is high-definition, or digital, television? In a word,
amazing. Here's the layman's explanation of how it works: Instead
of transmitting signals by wavelengths, they go out digitally,
coded like a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, more information can be transmitted in less space,
which creates additional channel space. For the individual, it
means your television's picture and image will be more vivid. HDTV
images arrive with more depth and color. Background images that
often are blurred come into sharp focus. It's not three-dimensional
viewing, but it's close. (Memo to news stations: Time to ditch the
fake wood backdrops.)
</P>
<P>
   If you want to run out and get a high-definition television, go
ahead. While you're at it, buy a Corvette, some Dom Perignon and
Rhode Island. Because if you are able to afford spending $3,000 to
$18,000 on a television, you can afford anything.
</P>
<P>
   Towne TV Audio &AMP; Appliances in Rotterdam, N.Y., has a sale for
you: a ``three-gun'' high-definition projection unit (no
traditional box units are commercially available yet). Just for
you, the store will take three grand off the asking price _ which
now makes it a hair under $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a song,'' says Paul DeMilio, who has been sales store
manager at Towne for 21 years. Demilio has seen all the
technological changes over the years but was blown away when he
first saw a digital presentation of a Mike Tyson fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought you were in the first row and could reach out and
touch them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When will HDTV actually really matter to us? Probably not for
another 8 to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   While satellite dishes can pick up digital signals, broadcasters
will not be required to transmit them until 2006. The costs to the
cable television industry alone to make the necessary upgrades has
been pegged in some reports as high as $33 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take to at least the year 2006,'' Parsons estimates.
``The tricky part is when.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the prices for consumers for these units will drop
dramatically, just as they did for personal computers. And
converter boxes will be available for older televisions as well. If
you want to get one now, it should be for
being-the-first-on-your-block purposes only. The box won't make a
difference in what you're watching. If your local station isn't
broadcasting digital, you aren't going to get it. But eventually
you will get it. We all will.

EMERIL LAGASSE: FALSE PROPHET?

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emeril Lagasse _ restaurateur, author, cult figure _ was carving
turkey on the Thanksgiving episode of his hit cooking show ``Emeril
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to slice the breast,'' he instructed, ``so that it's,
like, edible.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience _ 150 packed into the Metropolis Studios in
Manhattan for the taping last month _ nodded, captivated.
</P>
<P>
   He laid down a thick slice of bread, spread it with creole
mustard, topped it with a slice of turkey, then a slice of orange
cheese, another slice of turkey, a brush of mustard, and another
piece of bread. Then Lagasse dipped the turkey tower into beaten
egg, fried it and put it into the oven.
</P>
<P>
   When it was done _ no time or temperature was given _ he cut it
into quarters and set it on a plate spread with cranberry sauce.
The audience oohed, aahed and applauded, impressed by his genius.
Samples got passed out to a lucky few.
</P>
<P>
   I was one of them. I took a bite. It was a bad turkey sandwich.
A very bad turkey sandwich. The bread was greasy, the turkey was
dry and the orange mystery cheese wasn't even melted.
</P>
<P>
   I passed it on to another audience member, who could hardly
contain herself. Between bites, she turned to me and said, ``This
is like my dream come true _ I got to eat Emeril's food!''
</P>
<P>
   Emeril Lagasse, more jester than cook, is catering to legions of
gleeful fans. Who can begrudge all the joy he seems to bring?
</P>
<P>
   Lagasse reaches more people than Julia Child _ a wondrous cook,
of course, who expanded the culinary appreciation of her audience _
could ever imagine in her heyday on television.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Emeril Live,'' the Food Network's highest rated
show, he's on hours a day, watched by viewers. He makes weekly
appearances on Good Morning America as the show's food
coorespondent. He is about to open his fifth restaurant. William
Morrow has just published his fourth cookbook, ``Emeril's TV
Dinners.'' This month, readers of GQ magazine chose him as Chef of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   And yet with all that potential influence, Lagasse, as he
barrels through his frantic shows and churns out his books, is the
antithesis of the thoughtful, methodical Ms. Child. So maybe, he's
not so funny after all _ not to everybody, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of professional foodies are a bit dismayed at the tone
of the program,'' said Michael Batterberry, the founder of Food
Arts magazine. ``It really smacks a little bit of the wrestling
ring or the roller derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dorothy Cann Hamilton, president of the French Culinary
Institute: ``Julia was a missionary. And Emeril is not a missionary
preaching haute cuisine to the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   But his followers are fervent nonetheless. Recent book signings
have been utter mob scenes. While most cookbook writers would be
ecstatic if they sold 100 books at a signing, Lagasse sold 2,000 on
a swing through Poughkeepsie, N.Y., last month. (A few days before,
he sold another 9,000 in 20 minutes on QVC.)
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, when the Food Network opened its phone lines to
sell tickets to ``Emeril Live,'' over 500,000 people called. The
1,500 tickets were gone in 21 minutes, and by 2 p.m. that day, the
flood of calls had crippled the network's phone lines. His Website
_ www.foodtv.com _ gets an estimated 1.2 million page views per
month.
</P>
<P>
   Before his meteoric rise on television, Lagasse, 39, had a
fairly modest culinary career. He started at the age of 12 working
in a Portuguese bakery in Fall River, Mass., and went to cooking
school at Johnson &AMP; Wales University in Providence, R.I. After
working at a string of restaurants on the East Coast, he got his
first break when Ella Brennan hired him to replace Paul Prudhomme
as the head chef at Commander's Palace in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he opened his own restaurant, Emeril's, in New Orleans.
But it wasn't until someone discovered that he was a natural on
television that his career shifted into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Lagasse captivates his audiences with a loud, high-octane
dialogue. He works the stove, feeds his clamoring audience like a
zookeeper _ tossing cubes of salami and bags of potato chips to
them _ and spews cooking tips at random. While most cooking shows
putt along, for his, the accelerator is pushed to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He even has his own cooking language. ``Bam!'' he yells when he
slams chiles into a sizzling pan. ``Bam!'' he cries as he hurls
herbs irreverently onto a slab of grilled steak. ``Bam!'' he says
when he has nothing else to say about a dish. He gives cooking a
charged athletic, accessible quality, even if you wince every time
you know a ``Bam!'' is coming.
</P>
<P>
   And he relentlessly preaches a gospel of empowerment. ``We're
not building rocket ships here, folks,'' he will say as he begins a
new recipe. Or, ``It ain't that difficult,'' as he carves a piece
of meat with ease.
</P>
<P>
   But Lagasse rarely starts and finishes a recipe in a linear or
comprehensive fashion. He uses no measurements, skips key steps and
is extremely vague in his instructions. Placing a chicken in a pot
of water, he once said, ``Now you cook it for a very long time,''
leaving viewers to wonder whether he meant an hour or days.
</P>
<P>
   And he throws around terms _ like deglazing, rendering and
chinois _ used mainly by professionals. So viewers are left
confused about what he is saying _ and what he is doing. And yet,
they continue to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Lagasse is most widely credited for making sophisticated cooking
accessible to mass audiences. But in doing so, he often dumbs down
recipes so much that he removes all the intellectual effort that
goes into creating subtle flavors in a dish.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than an informative show like David Rosengarten's
``Taste'' on the Food Network, where you learn to make a dish
systematically from beginning to finish, his has become like a
prime-time sitcom filled with quick hits of humor and lots of
action.
</P>
<P>
   Lagasse insists that to improve a dish you need to ``kick it up
a notch'' and add extra flavor, usually in the form of garlic,
bacon or Essence, his own brand of spice mix, which is an
incredibly bitter mixture of garlic powder, onion powder, dried
thyme, dried oregano, cayenne, sweet paprika, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   And by bam-ing everything, from crispy-fried redfish to beef
tenderloin, with chopped garlic and Essence, the underlying message
is that simple, well-prepared food is not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for instance, the Southern fried chicken with mashed
potatoes in ``Emeril's TV Dinners,'' a dish that can be
extraordinary on its own. Lagasse, though, insists on seasoning it
with Essence no less than three times during the recipe. What will
it taste like then? Essence, not buttery, salty chicken.
</P>
<P>
   With the same irreverence, he regularly abuses classic recipes.
His recipe for quail with forcemeat in his book ``Louisiana Real &AMP;
Rustic'' (William Morrow, 1996) is kicked up beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it an ``old time French dish,'' then proceeds to
include his Rustic Rub, which contains garlic powder and onion
powder, in the forcemeat and as as a spice rub on the quail. He
does the same to cassoulet, adding Rustic Rub to both the meats and
the breadcrumb topping.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His style is loose to the point of sloppy. A ``panzanella'' he
made on one recent show looked disturbingly like a heap of food
headed toward the garbage disposal, a gloppy jumble of salami,
cheese, radicchio and mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   As a finishing touch, he dumped the croutons over top, and added
one last ``Bam!'' as croutons and cheese tumbled on to the counter
surrounding the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lagasse's appeal has been his ability to make people
feel liberated about eating. But he takes that approach so far that
it almost seems perverse. After reading his books, all I wanted was
a salad.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Emeril's TV Dinners,'' which includes recipes from ``Emeril
Live,'' one chapter is called ``Pork Fat Rules.'' Sure, it provokes
a laugh, but who really wants to eat pork burgers in gravy with
French-fried sweet potatoes?
</P>
<P>
   His recipe for smashing smashed potatoes recipe in ``Louisiana
Real &AMP; Rustic'' is downright suicidal. For one and a half pounds of
potatoes, he calls for a stick of butter, a cup of roasted garlic
and a cup of heavy cream.
</P>
<P>
   A variation suggests covering this ghastly mixture with a cup of
grated cheddar and baking it in the oven. What you get is soupy
mashed potatoes that taste of garlic and cream and not at all of
potato. And if you make the variation, your extra effort is
rewarded with a layer of cheese and grease that rises to the top.
</P>
<P>
   His roasted turkey calls for TWO sticks of butter (shoved into
in slits in the flesh of the bird). I'm not sure anyone has lived
to tell whether or not it's good. The same book contained just one
lettuce-based salad, maw-maw's slaw, whose eight servings are bound
with one and a quarter cups of mayonnaise. The vegetable chapter of
``Emeril's TV Dinners'' is no better. All but one recipe contains
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   So many of his dishes somehow boil down to the same thing: meat
and potatoes. Which brings to light another of Lagasse's deceits:
he has not brought haute cuisine to a wider audience. He has simply
repackaged the pillars of the American diet.
</P>
<P>
   But Lagasse show no signs of stopping, or changing. On the
contrary, his fifth restaurant, Emeril's of Orlando, is scheduled
to open in Florida this December. A sixth restaurant, which will be
in Las Vegas, is in the works for 1999. And television fans will
soon have yet another morsel to gnaw on: a documentary called ``The
Making of Emeril Live,'' which debuts Dec. 6 on the Food Network.
</P>
<P>
   His fans are blind to any faults he might have. They even take
the blame for failed recipes, a show of tolerance that is
practically unheard of in the cookbook world. Barbara Ninos, a
self-described ``Emerilyte'' who cooks from his books each and
every Sunday night, still can't get the filling to set on the
banana cream pie from ``Emeril's New New Orleans Cooking'' (William
Morrow, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not his fault,'' she said. ``I know it's mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. When this newspaper tested the recipe, not only did
the cream not set, but there was also far too much pie dough, too
many bananas and two and a half cups too much filling for the
nine-inch pie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ninos is just one of many Emeril fanatics, who faint in
front of him, watch his show religiously, and send him stuffed
animal pigs. Mrs. Ninos and her family, who were at the turkey
taping wearing T-shirts from Nola, one of Lagasse's restaurants in
New Orleans, had just returned from a two-day trip there. A trip
they made solely to eat in Lagasse's restaurants. ``Why else would
you go to New Orleans?'' Mrs. Ninos wondered.
</P>
<P>
   But why exactly do fans continue to watch, when beneath his
frail facade there is so little? Perhaps as Eileen Opatut, the
senior vice president of programming at the Food Network,
explained, it is the fans themselves. People feel guilty about
food, she said, but they don't feel guilty about watching
television. ``So in some ways,'' she said, ``People can get an
access to food and comfort on television.''
</P>
<P>
   And with ``Emeril Live,'' they can let their hair down, take in
the butter and cream, and let out a big holler _ ``Pork fat!''
</P>
<P>
   If you're hoping to learn much from Emeril, don't get your hopes
up too high. Here's a sampling of what the fans are served on
``Emeril Live'' and in a recent book.
</P>
<P>
   Poor cooking skills: On one episode of ``Emeril Live'' _ the
theme was cooking in diners _ Lagasse made a simple patty melt.
First, he burned the onions on the griddle. As the camera zoomed in
on the jet-black strands, he said, ``I love when the onions are
like that.'' Then he charred the bread.
</P>
<P>
   Bad technique: In his book ``Emeril's Creole Christmas''
(William Morrow, 1997), a recipe for truffle risotto with parmesan
croutons instructs the reader to heat the stock and dump in all the
rice at once, without stirring. Traditional, creamy risotto is made
by sauteeing the aromatics and the rice, then adding the heated
stock in small increments and stirring until the rice is tender.
</P>
<P>
   Mangled tradition: ``Now this is not a traditional panzanella
like if you're a panzanella expert,'' Lagasse said on ``Emeril
Live.'' ``Hey! What can I say?'' It might be nice if he would say
what an actual panzanella is: a peasant salad of dry bread,
tomatoes, olive oil, red onion and sometimes basil. Legasse's
version isn't a matter of creative license. He's just making
something else: it includes raw garlic, onions, salami, mozzarella,
parmesan cheese, radicchio, balsamic vinegar and fried croutons.
</P>
<P>
   A facade of accessibility: On his show, Lagasse often deep fries
the likes of onion rings and breaded eggplant. But even if you did
want to duplicate his efforts at home, you'd have a hard time. He's
using a professional deep fryer.
</P>
<P>
   Sloppy presentation: Preparing an appetizer tray of toasts with
a variety of simple toppings isn't exactly a finesse operation, but
it doesn't have to be a a mess either.
</P>
<P>
   On one show, Lagasse haphazardly topped some toasts with cheese,
some with steak, some with peppers and some with cheese and meat.
Then, instead of slicing onions so that they would lay on each one
_ as anyone else on earth would _ he tossed chunks of raw onion
over the entire plate, missing many of the toasts.
</P>
<P>
   For a finishing touch, he managed to identify a couple of the
individual toasts in the rubble and dropped a bit of creole mustard
on each: the unappetizers of the evening.

THE MINIMALIST: PARSLEY MOVES TO PLATE'S CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parsley is, without a doubt, the most underrated herb in the
United States. We fuss over basil, fall in and out of love with
cilantro, experiment with lavender and nearly ignore parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the situation has improved somewhat over the years; when
I was growing up, it wasn't even clear that parsley was edible _
the few sprigs on the side of the plate merely served notice that
the dish was somehow ``fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when you get past using parsley as a garnish, and sprinkle a
handful on top of a dish just before serving, you begin to
appreciate the bright, clean flavor of this common herb. And when
you realize that it remains in season far longer than basil,
rosemary or other popular herbs (many regional gardeners harvest
parsley in the snow), you get a further sense of its value.
</P>
<P>
   My love for parsley increased even more when I learned how to
feature it in sauces. You can, of course, make a parsley-based
pesto simply by substituting parsley for the basil in any pesto
recipe, and the results are quite good.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of combining parsley with olive oil, I've learned to
blend it with vinegar to make a sharp, spiky sauce that complements
simply prepared, full-flavored foods beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   I first had this sauce (or something very much like it) with
bollito misto, the Italian dish of assorted boiled meats and
sauces. In the last few weeks I've found it a wonderful
accompaniment to the simplest grilled, broiled or roasted meat _
great on well-browned steaks, pork or chicken.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of simple technical aspects to this 10-minute
preparation that are worth considering. First of all, although many
sources insist that flat-leaf parsley is better than the curly-leaf
variety, blind tastings have not borne out that myth; what matters
more is freshness, because limp parsley has no flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, parsley is sandy, so wash it well. In the quantity
given here, it's worth using a salad spinner afterward to make sure
it is thoroughly dry.
</P>
<P>
   The vinegar you use should be mild and not too intensely
flavored. A good rice or sherry vinegar, with an acidity level of
about 6 percent, works best. Stronger vinegar should be diluted
even more than indicated in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   PARSLEY AND VINEGAR SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup packed parsley leaves (about 1 ounce), washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small clove garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sherry vinegar or other good, fairly mild vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the parsley in a food processor, along with the oil,
garlic, a healthy pinch of salt and about \ teaspoon of pepper.
With the machine on, drizzle the vinegar through the feed tube
until the parsley is pureed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add a tablespoon of water and pulse the machine on and off a
couple of times; taste. The mixture should taste sharp, but not
overpoweringly so. If it seems too sharp, add a little more water;
the texture will be quite loose, something like thick orange juice.
Taste, and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Pass the sauce at
the table. Spoon it over grilled, broiled or roasted steaks, pork
or chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 1 cup.

MUSHROOMS: THE BLAND, THE BITTER AND THE FURRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FRESH-MUSHROOMS, DRIED-MUSHROOMS.) 
(lb) 
 By MOLLY O'NEILL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 50 varieties of edible mushrooms are available
commercially in the United States, though not at all seasons. I
tried eight of the most commonly available cultivated mushrooms
alongside their wild cousins _ tasting them and cooking with them.
Note: Health experts suggest cooking exotic mushrooms thoroughly to
neutralize the enzymes that can cause stomach pains.
</P>
<P>
   OYSTER MUSHROOMS: These soft, white bland things prove that the
easiest mushrooms to grow are the least tasty. They can add body to
a roasted, braised or gently stewed dish, but tend to become bitter
if seared or fried. The same can be said for the colorful oyster
variations. The nearly violet-blue oyster is tastier than most and
can have a sexy, satiny feel in the mouth. However beautiful the
pink and yellow oysters are, they are not flavorful; in very small
quantities, they make gorgeous raw garnishes. Cultivated oyster
mushrooms were firmer than the wild ones.
</P>
<P>
   BEECH: This medium-size Asian capped mushroom can be tawny or
white. It is fleshy and has a nice resistant texture. It is best
roasted or sauteed and develops a spicy, deeply nutty flavor.
Undercooked, it can be very bitter. The cultivated ones were far
superior to the sodden little samples from nature.
</P>
<P>
   BLEWIT: Light blue to violet, dense and meaty. The wild ones
tasted herbaceous and nutty, the cultivated ones like toasted
grain. Both are best braised or roasted.
</P>
<P>
   MORELS: The domed and hollow black honeycombed cap tastes woodsy
and sweet. The wild versions had a much fuller flavor, but were not
as firm as the meaty, springy cultivated ones.
</P>
<P>
   POMPOMS: They look like oversize powder puffs. They feel furry
but are extremely dense. They are bland, but absorb seasonings very
well. They can be marinated in flavored oil and roasted in a very
hot oven or sliced and breaded as cutlets and enlivened with herbs,
garlic or a chili-based chutney or salsa.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD EAR: Also called cloud ears and tree ears, these whorled
black and brown mushrooms are shaped like ... well, ears. Added at
the last minute, they lend snap and crunch to stir-fries or soups.
They do not lose their firm texture in long cooking and are
wonderful in fish stews. Only cultivated samples were available.
</P>
<P>
   HEN-OF-THE-WOODS: This variety can range from golf-ball to
soccer-ball size, and looks like clumps of white or tan feathers
with a core as dense as cauliflower. The wild ones taste garlicky
and oniony and can be quite tough but are good braised in wine or
herbed broth, or simmered in soup. The cultivated ones are milder
and more tender; their taste can best be described as the flavor of
air drawn into the mouth on a walk in the fall woods. They are
delicious sauteed. Cut into small fibers, or paddles, flash fried
and drained, they rival potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   LOBSTER: It is shaped like a thick, rippled funnel. The name
refers not to the taste but to the red-orange color. The mushrooms
are gathered wild and in huge quantity in the Pacific Northwest,
but have been farmed so far with minimal success. They have a
delicate fruity flavor and are best sauteed or stir-fried. There
was no difference in flavor or texture between the wild and the
cultivated samples.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ten years ago, Gregory Barbero's career at Polygram
Classics and Jazz, the recording branch of the international
Polygram corporation, was taking off as rapidly as the company's
sales of classical compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   Barbero's entry into the business had been humbling: in early
1984, fresh out of college as a philosophy major, he took a sales
job in the record department of a Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore in
downtown Boston. Four months later, the compact disk was introduced
and quickly became an obsession for classical music collectors. In
three years as manager of the record department, Barbero saw CD
sales increase tenfold, from $200,000 to $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The classical recording field was expanding exponentially. In
1988, Barbero got an entry-level job at Polygram. By 1995, he was
the vice president of London Records, the American branch of the
London-based Decca company, one of three major classical labels
owned by Polygram. The others were Deutsche Grammophon, based in
Hamburg, and Philips, based in Amsterdam. Barbero tended to
London's distinguished catalogue and its stellar roster of artists
like Luciano Pavarotti and Sir Georg Solti. He also recruited
artists, planned recordings and, most important, devised marketing
campaigns for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real Wild West atmosphere,'' Barbero said.
``Everything you tried worked. And nothing was too crazy to try.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbero, who helped turn the debut disk of the Three Tenors
into the biggest-selling classical album and used the proceeds to
sign up fine artists like the soprano Renee Fleming, is now out of
a job at age 36. His history with Polygram, which dominates the
worldwide music market, tells much about the heady times and
current confusions in the classical recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   The success of projects like the Three Tenors _ crossovers that
sell beyond the usual classical market _ stunned recording
executives more used to selling recordings by the thousands than
the millions. Other crossover releases were tried, some with
astonishing results, like the sensation Andrea Bocelli, the darkly
handsome, blind Italian tenor, who sings arias, lighter classical
works and pop songs, and has sold some 14 million records worldwide
on the Philips label.
</P>
<P>
   While the good times were rolling for CD sales, executives like
Barbero were given latitude to pursue serious projects. But when
the windfall ended in the mid-1990s, and the oversaturated market
lagged, panicky executives downsized classical departments and
hooked onto crossover projects like a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Barbero's success in demonstrating that the right
classical album can be as marketable as a pop record may have
fueled unrealistic expectations and contributed to his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Though Polygram's classical labels retain their identities with
consumers, they have been, in effect, folded into two new
genre-based departments, core classical and a crossover division
for New Age music, soundtracks and superstar artists.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing of the core classical department raises questions
about Polygram's commitment to important classical recordings that
are not big sellers, like the conductor Valery Gergiev's Russian
opera series with the Kirov Opera company on Philips, or the
conductor Pierre Boulez's recordings of 20th-century works on
Deutsche Grammophon.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is the sale of Polygram Holdings to the
Seagram Co., now in its final stages. The purchase would give
Seagram, the Canadian liquor giant, new reach into the
entertainment industry. Significantly, Polygram's parent company,
Philips Electronics, has lowered the price of Polygram from $10.6
billion to $10.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Roberts, the president of Polygram Classics and
Jazz, is sympathetic to the fears of classical record collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, consumers may worry that the trickle-down effect of
these changes will be that they get less opportunity to follow
their passion,'' Roberts said recently. ``But that is absolutely
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The prior structure at Polygram, where competition was actively
encouraged among the three labels, ``made sense in the '80s, when
so much product was coming along,'' he explained. ``But no
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the company's classical CD sales created new
marketing problems, he added, like over-saturation, duplication of
repertory and a crowding of release dates. He spoke of the
``naivete and greed'' of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was selling, everyone was buying,'' he said. ``But
the real organic demand was not being addressed. The people who
were already in the classical market were the ones converting to
CDs. Not enough new people were coming on.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as reality was settling in and the business was
starting to adjust, along came the Three Tenors, which was good and
bad for the classical recording field in general, and for Barbero
in particular.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Having started as a lowly account service representative,
driving from record store to record store photographing displays
and putting up posters, Barbero took a leap up the ladder to
classical regional manager in 1989, and, the next year, to director
of marketing for Polygram Classics and Jazz, which included Verve,
an essential jazz label.
</P>
<P>
   The first Three Tenors concert, in September 1990, was intended
as a one-time event, a joint celebration of Jose Carreras' recovery
from leukemia and the World Cup soccer match in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   To almost everyone's surprise a recording of the concert sold
more than 100,000 copies. ``I made a pitch to go to our biggest
accounts, like Camelot, a chain of some 300 mall-based record
stores mostly in the Midwest, and to put together a presentation to
promote the Three Tenors like a pop record,'' Barbero said.
</P>
<P>
   Camelot Music signed on. Then came the tidal wave: 700,000 units
sold in four months. Ultimately, sales topped 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   This proved to the corporate parents of Polygram, and to
competing companies, that certain classical music, if promoted
strategically, could appeal to a broad audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Three Tenors opened up a new area: the classical superstar
album,'' said Barbero. ``Without the Three Tenors, is Bocelli
possible? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Polygram used its big profits in important ways, including
empowering several creative younger executives like Barbero, who
was promoted in March 1995 to his post at London Records.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, he used the good times to support artists like the
mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, who, it is often forgotten, was no
overnight sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cecilia was on her fifth record, in 1993, when things started
to look up,'' Barbero said. With her album ``If You Love Me,'' a
program of 18th-century Italian songs, the company realized that it
``was dealing with a once-in-a-lifetime, and highly marketable
performer,'' he added. ``And her manager, the best in the business,
set her up brilliantly. Suddenly, it was a juggernaut.''
</P>
<P>
   The classical division of Polygram was reorganized to insure
that such quality projects continued to prosper, said Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   The core classical department is now headed by Barbero's former
counterpart at Deutsche Grammophon, Albert Imperato, a latecomer to
classical music who heard Leonard Bernstein conduct Beethoven in
Vienna during a his junior year abroad and had an epiphany. Now 36,
he still sounds like an ecstatic convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are turning off their televisions and getting bored
with the latest hype,'' he said. ``Classical music delivers the
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   In his former post at Deutsche Grammophon, Imperato unabashedly
championed mass-market classical projects like the ``100 Reasons to
Listen to Classical Music'' series. But he points with pride to the
German violinist Anne Sophie Mutter's recordings of contemporary
works by Lutoslawski and Penderecki, and singles out a new two-disk
recording of ``Undine,'' a ballet by the German composer Hans
Werner Henze.
</P>
<P>
   His boss, Roberts, who doesn't expect sales for the Henze ballet
to be noticeably good, said: ``This is a trade-off.'' Polygram can
protect Deutsche Grammophon's status as ``the beacon of classical
recordings'' by ``allowing the crossover department to pursue its
special projects,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the new arrangement, Philips, the label that once supported
the conductor Sir Colin Davis in his project to record the complete
works of Berlioz, is to be primarily a crossover label for
performers like the new waltz king, Andre Rieu, the ``Lord of the
Dance'' composer Ronan Hardiman, and, of course, Bocelli.
</P>
<P>
   The senior vice president for the crossover department, Lisa
Altman, points to her musical pedigree (a degree in piano from the
Oberlin Conservatory) as evidence of the judgment she will bring to
emerging artists. As an example, she cites the California-born
violin prodigy Leila Josefowicz. Philips released Ms. Josefowicz's
first recording, the violin concertos of Tchaikovsky and Sibelius,
when she was 16. But last year she was featured in an album called
``Violin for Anne Rice,'' a musical homage to the popular author of
Gothic vampire stories, accompanied by a jazz combo.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, Ms. Altman said, some kind of crossover sellout.
``Today's musicians don't see themselves as existing in any one
world, any one genre,'' she explained. ``What this is about is
keeping the artists heard and creating a healthier landscape for
all music.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious classical collectors might adopt a wait-and-see attitude
about the changes. Are more projects like the Henze ballet coming?
Can Ms. Bartoli continue to fulfill the expectations of Polygram's
executives, or will she be deemed to have peaked if she branches
out into more obscure repertory and sales drop off?
</P>
<P>
   Now that the elegant French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet has had
a crossover success with his album of solos by the jazz giant Bill
Evans, as transcribed by Thibaudet (more than 35,000 sold), will
his impressive two-disk set of the complete piano works of Ravel
from 1992 remain in the catalogue?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope so,'' Roberts replied. ``But if you never
deleted anything, the catalogue would go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of staff members in the core classical area has
shrunk, he conceded, ``but it was a realignment, not a real
reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   The reduction was real enough to Barbero. But he is still
working for Polygram as a freelance project consultant and has
taken jobs for other companies also on a freelance basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, the new structure at Polygram makes sense,'' he
said. ``Everyone supports it. Even I, frankly, support it. Would it
be better if there were three healthy working classical labels? Of
course. But for these times, given this market place, that won't
work.''

<P>
   KENNETT SQUARE, Pa. _ Security checkpoints ward off uninvited
visitors as they approach some of the mushroom farms that have long
been part of this rolling Andrew Wyeth country south of
Philadelphia. Corporate secrets are taking root in the nation's
mushroom capital, and competition is accelerating the bucolic pace
in an area where horse-drawn wagons still slow traffic along
winding roads.
</P>
<P>
   The portobello did it.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning commercial success of that mushroom _ the hottest
fungus to hit America in nearly a century _ propelled the formerly
easygoing growers into a race to develop and market an
ever-widening array of mushrooms, each more exotic than the last
and each requiring talent and technique that no one here seems
eager to share.
</P>
<P>
   Farms where only white mushrooms had been cultivated are now
sprouting brown domestic varieties, as well as shiitake, enoki and
oyster mushrooms. And hundreds of dark, cavernous mushroom houses
are being converted to brightly lighted laboratories where formerly
wild mushrooms can be grown in trim plastic containers under
antiseptic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the intense competition here, in many food
stores across the nation, the mushroom section is starting to look
like a magical playground for gnomes. Today's cooks can choose from
dozens of weird, formerly wild mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, those portobellos dropped like fully
opened parachutes into a national menu ravaged by dietary concerns
and epicurean aspirations. Almost immediately, the big
meaty-tasting mushrooms became a fetish among food lovers and, as a
meat substitute, a mass-market sensation.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, only a handful of people had heard of
portobello mushrooms. In 1997, 32.7 million pounds of the big brown
mushrooms valued at more than $47 million were sold. (But however
exotic portobellos may have seemed, they are actually just
overgrown cremini mushrooms, the common brown variety that America
considered normal until the mushrooms called whites, or buttons,
began their reign in the mid-1920s.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to generating unprecedented sales, portobellos,
along with dietary health concerns and shifting food preferences,
seemed to renew interest in all mushrooms. About three dozen
varieties are being cultivated and are available year round.
Seasons for wild mushrooms vary, but most are available for only a
few weeks in the spring and fall. It's difficult to tell the
difference in the market, though cultivated mushrooms tend to be
cleaner and more uniform in size.
</P>
<P>
   Mushroom consumption increased by nearly 200 percent between
1970 and 1994, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.
Restaurants have led the way, with mycological one-upmanship
becoming more and more intense among chefs. Eighty percent of chefs
surveyed by the National Restaurant Association in 1997 ranked
mushrooms first in the top 20 chic foods. And the dishes the chefs
create from ruffled wood ear mushrooms, pompons and cinnamon cap
mushrooms are steadily broadening the audience for _ and the price
of _ all such weird mushrooms. Most cultivated exotic mushrooms
cost $10 to $40 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost doesn't matter if our customers are getting something
that is one of a kind,'' said Sottha Khunn, the executive chef of
Le Cirque 2000 in Manhattan, who makes a lobster salad with lobster
mushrooms and pot-au-feu with hen-of-the-woods.
</P>
<P>
   But to satisfy the demand, mushroom producers had to leave
convention behind. Not so long ago, nearly all cultivated mushrooms
grew in dark, moist sheds. They were all from the same family,
basidiomycetes, and were the umbrella-shaped variety familiar to
most Americans, including button, brown, shiitake, enoki and
portobello mushrooms. All have a cap and gills. About 818 million
pounds of these mushrooms were sold in the United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The newly cultivated exotics are mostly from the ascomycetes
family. They are more primitive _ they never developed the cap or
gills that help create and protect spores _ and come in a
mind-boggling variety of shapes, resembling everything from heads
of coral to feathery funnels. These are trendy mushrooms like
morels, hen-of-the-woods and wood ears. They have convoluted
complexions and spores on their surfaces. Although only 9 million
pounds were sold in 1997, they are the frontier of the mushroom
industry today.
</P>
<P>
   Ascomycetes are much trickier to grow: the primordial-looking
mushrooms require rooms as sterile and bright as an intensive care
unit. The mushroom wards at Phillips and Terry Farms are a long way
from the forest floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of cultivated exotic mushrooms have increased by more than
200 percent since the mid-1990s, said Jim Angelucci, the chief
grower at Phillips Farms in Kennett Square. The trend was solid
enough for his company to get out of the white mushroom business
completely in 1993. Phillips Farms is now the largest producer of
exotic mushrooms in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's mushroom menu is changing. And so are things around
Kennett Square. Until recently, there weren't many secrets among
the local mushroom farmers. Some grew for the canning industry,
others for the fresh market; there was enough demand to keep
everybody busy. Everybody grew white mushrooms, and everybody grew
them about the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Now everybody's looking for the next portobello. In the face of
rising prices and an ever-growing appetite, mere mortals can find
it tough not to play God.
</P>
<P>
   ``In nature, most exotic mushrooms have a short growing season,
limited availability, and the price goes through the roof,'' said
Rod Sorenson, the chief researcher and cultivator at Terry Farms, a
three-year-old morel farm in Auburn, Ala. ``Growers look at that
and make the assumption that if they could grow those mushrooms in
quantity year round, they could make a zillion dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are unexpected hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of research and of reproducing the forces of nature
that prompt a mushroom to be fruitful and multiply is steep. And if
a grower is successful, the supply inevitably increases _ and the
price plummets. The price of morels, for instance, has dropped
steadily since morels from Terry Farms came on the market, said
Hans Johansson, the owner of Mushrooms and More, a specialty
produce dealer in Westchester County, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mushrooms will only fruit if they are sure they are going to
die,'' said Jack Reitnauer, a biologist and the director of
research at Vlasic Farms in Blandon, Pa. To confuse a mushroom into
giving birth, a grower has to create conditions that will scare it
to death. Marked shifts in temperature, a sudden soaking or blaze
of light will scare the gills off it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For basidiomycetes, both creating a luxurious life and insuring
consistent reproduction is relatively easy: they rely on
agricultural byproducts like straw, hulls from wheat bran or
cottonseed meal and chicken, turkey or horse manure. Tidy mountain
ranges of this composting mixture steam in the autumn morning as
Reitnauer tours the 73 sheds where he grows about 16 million of the
100 million pounds of mushrooms Vlasco sells each year.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, a machine that resembles a backhoe acts as an
outdoor kitchen mixer, turning the elements as they decompose. The
heat generated makes the enterprise look like the Great Smoky
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The compost is then transferred into an 8,000-square-foot room
that is stacked six high with bunk beds that measure 6 by 64 feet;
14 inches of compost is layered on each bunk, and the temperature
in the room is raised to 135 degrees Fahrenheit to pasteurize this
growing medium.
</P>
<P>
   The beds are then cooled and ``seeded'' with tissue culture,
which is created in Petri dishes in a laboratory and then used to
coat sterilized seeds of grain, primarily rye. The grains are
spread in the bed and begin to grow like a white veil throughout
the compost, or substrate, which by this time has compacted to
about 8 inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, the tissue culture colonizes the compost and an
inch-and-a- half of peat moss is added. The mushrooms continue to
grow up through the peat moss. With watering, they thrive, and
after six days, fresh air is introduced. This shocks them into
``fruiting,'' or sending up the stems and caps most people call
mushrooms. Harvesting begins 13 days later and continues for
slightly less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ascomycetes are much pickier about their homes and their menus _
they will settle for nothing less than a perfect simulation of
their natural habitat. In addition, different varieties are highly
idiosyncratic in what they require to procreate.
</P>
<P>
   Reitnauer, for instance, tried to grow chanterelles when he was
a college student. ``We noticed that they grew like crazy after an
electrical storm, and so we tried to simulate lightning in the
lab,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, no one has determined how to grow chanterelles
commercially. But scientists have learned one thing: the lower on
the evolutionary ladder a fungus is, the smaller the niche in which
it can grow.
</P>
<P>
   Enoki mushrooms, for instance, thrive on cedar near the snow
line in the mountains of Japan. To cultivate them requires huge
stores of cedar and an environment that simulates the temperature,
oxygen and sunlight levels in the Japanese highlands.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, where cedar chips are an agricultural byproduct,
cultivating enoki isn't difficult and the mushrooms are common and
cheap. In the United States, on the other hand, the cost was
prohibitive until a cedar substitute made of pulverized corncob
pellets was developed.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments found that the forest floors of southern France and
Spain could be simulated with uncomposted wheat to grow oyster
mushrooms in half a dozen varieties, including vivid pink and blue
ones, and the yellow ones that resemble tiny Cala lilies.
</P>
<P>
   Hen-of-the-woods mushrooms like oak sawdust. Wood ears like a
mixture of semi-composted wood and straw. Shiitake like oak logs.
</P>
<P>
   But truffles seem to require a symbiotic relationship with the
entire oak tree, the same arrangement chanterelles require with
pine trees. So far, neither has been cultivated with much success.
</P>
<P>
   Morels like the forest floor of Minnesota, northern Ohio and
Michigan, and Sorenson, the Terry Farms researcher, had to
determine how to make the dust and leaves that he gets from
Birmingham, Ala., seem as if they were from the Midwest. He said he
also had to create an environment where he could simulate ``spring
in the mountains, complete with fog, low-level lighting, and the
ground temperature and moisture that simulates a good snow melt.''

<P>
   SAUTEED WILD MUSHROOMS WITH HERB SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   For the mushrooms:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   { pound hen of the woods mushrooms, cleaned and broken into very
small strings
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pound mixed wild mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   For the herb salad:
</P>
<P>
   10 chives, cut into 2-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   \ cup parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   \ cup small chervil sprigs
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of kosher salt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare the mushrooms: heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large
skillet set over medium-high heat. When very hot, add the hen of
the woods, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring frequently,
until mushrooms are very brown and crisp, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer
to paper towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   2. Clean mixed wild mushrooms and remove stems if they are woody
or fibrous. Slice any mushrooms that are very large, but try to
maintain the variety's distinctive shape.
</P>
<P>
   3. Return skillet to medium heat and add remaining tablespoon
oil and the butter. When butter is melted, add mushrooms and
shallots, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring
frequently, until mushrooms have released all their liquid and are
lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes depending on varieties. Add
vinegar and cook 1 more minute.
</P>
<P>
   4. Prepare the herb salad: in a small bowl, combine chives,
parsley and chervil. Add olive oil and salt and toss.
</P>
<P>
   5. Divide hot mushrooms among 4 small plates. Sprinkle them with
the crisp hen of the woods, and top each with a small mound of the
herb salad.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 first-course servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAN-ROASTED HEN-OF-THE-WOOD MUSHROOMS WITH CABBAGE, BACON AND
BLUE CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 50 minutes
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces Savoy cabbage (about a half medium head), sliced
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces crumbled blue cheese.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a large kettle 2/3 full of salted water to a boil and
add the cabbage. Cook 3 minutes, drain and immediately plunge
cabbage into a large bowl of cold water to stop the cooking. When
cooled, drain cabbage well and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place a large skillet over medium heat and add bacon. Cook,
stirring occasionally, until bacon is cooked through and lightly
browned, about 5 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and set
aside on paper towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour off and reserve all but a thin coating of bacon fat from
the skillet; place skillet over high heat. When it is very hot,
season mushrooms lightly with salt and pepper and place them
feathery side down in skillet. Lower heat to medium, cover pan and
cook until crisp and deeply browned, about 5 minutes. Turn
mushrooms over and cook the other side. Transfer to a platter and
keep warm.

`A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY': TRIP TO THE SOUTH POLE ON A ONE-WAY
TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, in a fascinating book called ``The Nobility of
Failure,'' the historian Ivan I. Morris described the intense
admiration felt by the Japanese for those who, after a monumental
struggle, succumb to disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Preston's absorbing and moving story of the attempt by the
British explorer Robert Falcon Scott to be the first to reach the
South Pole shows that that reverence for the noble failure is not
unique to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Preston's portrayal, Scott became a British national
hero, ``the very epitome of the English officer and gentleman doing
his duty without fuss,'' precisely because he died valiantly and
stoically while being beaten to the pole by the more skillful, less
mistake-prone Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Ms. Preston also demonstrates in ``A First Rate
Tragedy,'' which is both a biography of Scott and a succinct
history of South Pole exploration, Scott was aided in his rise to
pantheonic heights by public ignorance of the reasons for his
failure. Scott was seen at the time to have been a victim of plain
bad luck and of a certain underhandedness by Amundsen, who did not
signal clearly his intent to make a race to the pole.
</P>
<P>
   One of the virtues of Ms. Preston's account is her
clear-sightedness about the fatal amateurishness of the British
effort. Scott, Ms. Preston contends, was fatally harmed both by
errors of judgment and by traits of character that reduced his
effectiveness as an explorer. Scott, in other words, did have bad
luck, but Ms. Preston puts that issue into perspective by citing
Amundsen's own instructive comment on the role of luck in
exploration:
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory awaits him who has everything in order _ luck people
call it. Defeat is certain for him who has neglected to take the
necessary precautions in time _ this is called bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott was one of the last in the special breed of English
adventurer-explorers, like Burton, Speke, Livingston and others,
whose names are synonymous with arduous Victorian-era travel.
</P>
<P>
   A British naval officer from a modest background, Scott was, in
Ms. Preston's view, an especially conflicted member of the explorer
fraternity. He suffered from sea-sickness, fainted at the sight of
blood and struggled to mask a congenital shyness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The navy was not a place which tolerated weakness,'' Ms.
Preston writes. ``Cool assurance and decisiveness were the recipe
for a successful career, and Scott had to conceal the introspective
side of his character.''
</P>
<P>
   He did a good job of that, eventually impressing Sir Clements
Markham, a fellow of the Royal Geographic Society who pressed the
British establishment to sponsor South Pole exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was appointed commander of an early British expedition to
Antarctica in 1902-3, leading a 93-day trek by dog sled some 250
miles farther south than humans had gone before. But afflicted with
scurvy, snow blindness, the exhaustion and death of the dogs, and
shortages of supplies, the three-man team (supported by an
additional 40 team members at their base camp) stopped 150 miles
from the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the team's failure is stated as a British
cultural aversion by Ms. Preston: ``It never occurred to these
sentimental Englishmen to eat the dogs, as Amundsen was to do. Had
they done so they would have alleviated their scurvy. As it was,
the death of the dogs affected Scott deeply in his weakened and
emotional state.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott returned to England in 1904 to find himself a hero, even
as he returned to normal naval duties. He married Kathleen Bruce
and then, in 1909, as the international competition with the
Norwegians to be first to the South Pole intensified, was named
head of a new expedition, the ``first rate failure'' of Ms.
Preston's title.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's second effort to reach the pole is a gripping episode
full of an almost inhuman pluck and endurance.
</P>
<P>
   One example of the remarkable spirit of exploratory adventure:
During the six-month winter, while the team was holed up in
specially built cabins waiting for the reappearance of the sun, the
team's doughty naturalist Edward Adrian Wilson spent a hair-raising
40 days in the pitch dark at minus 50 degrees making a 90-mile
round-trip over the ice to a place called Camp Crozier. The
purpose: to observe the nesting habits of the emperor penguin and
to collect a few of its eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Preston, an English historian and journalist, tells the
story of Scott's final and fatal expedition with bracing economy.
Here and there throughout this book one wishes that the text had
been edited for American readers, who may not know offhand what
happened to Bonnie Prince Charlie at Culloden Moor or what was the
psammead in the sandpit in E. Nesbit's stories.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Preston makes several references to the grisly fate of Sir
John Franklin in an expedition in the Arctic that preceded Scott's
in Antarctica, but she never explains what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the end, when Ms. Preston recounts the final days and
hours of Scott and his rugged companions, her spare, unadorned
account becomes deeply moving. The five men who went to the pole
(which they reached in January 1912, one month after Amundsen)
struggled through terrible adversity in their unsuccessful effort
to walk back the 600 miles to base camp and their ship.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the very limit of comprehensible human endurance, when
all five knew that they were going to die, that Scott and the
others wrote letters to their wives and to the families of their
companions, and it is these letters above all else that express the
nobility of his failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't a very good husband but I hope I shall be a good
memory,'' Scott wrote to Kathleen. ``I shall simply fall and go to
sleep in the snow,'' the naturalist Wilson wrote to his wife.
``Don't be unhappy _ all is for the best.''

`A PLACE CALLED CHIAPAS': EXAMINING MEXICO'S ZAPATISTA UPRISING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sorting through the political and social mess portrayed in
Nettie Wild's clear-eyed documentary film ``A Place Called
Chiapas'' is not easy. Nor do there seem to be any simple solutions
to the simmering conflict examined by the film between
disenfranchised Mayan Indians in the southern Mexican state of
Chiapas and the ruling government against which they have been
waging a fitful guerrilla rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens Wednesday at Film Forum, was completed in
eight months between June 1996 and February 1997. It takes us
inside the Zapatista movement by indigenous Indians who are at the
bottom of the Mexican social order. The demands of these
desperately impoverished people include health care, education and
control over their land.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a charismatic, pipe-smoking intellectual known as
Subcommander Marcos, the movement has always had a surreal quality.
Marcos, who appears briefly in the film, talks in poetic metaphors
and issues cryptic statements on the Internet. A well-educated
mestizo (a person of mixed Spanish and Indian blood) he has
dedicated himself to the Zapatista cause for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos and his freedom fighters have a flair for the dramatic.
They take their name from Emiliano Zapata, the Mexican
revolutionary who rode victoriously into Mexico City in 1914 with a
peasant army but was tricked and assassinated by the government
five years later. Like their forerunners, the Zapatistas conceal
their faces, swathing them in bandanas or black ski masks that
cover everything but their eyes. Marcos is a shrewd manipulator of
the media. When he calls for a convocation of journalists and
observers, an international throng shows up for a gathering the
filmmaker calls a ``post-glasnost revolutionary Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   The history covered by the film begins on Jan. 1, 1994, the day
the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect. The
peasant rebels, protesting an imminent influx of cheap corn from
the United States that would undermine their meager livelihood as
corn farmers, took over four towns and 500 ranches in southern
Mexico. The government sent in troops, and at least 145 people died
in the ensuing battle.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, an uneasy cease-fire has prevailed as the two sides
have attempted to negotiate an elusive peace agreement. At the
center of the negotiations is Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, whom the
Mayans call ``grandfather'' but whom the landowners who were
dispossessed by the Zapatista rebellion view with deep suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the ranches still in the hands of the Zapatistas,
the area has been surrounded by the Mexican army. At the same time,
paramilitary troops who call themselves the Peace and Justice Party
have aligned themselves with the government (which denies their
existence) and terrorized the Indians, driving 2,000 of them from
their villages. Ms. Wild and her film crew accompany a group of
peasants back to their village, where they face angry troops who
accuse them of violence and (off camera) threaten to kill the
Mexican members of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done? The filmmakers clearly sympathize with the
Zapatistas, but they have no answers.

`BELLY': FOR YOUNG BLACKS, DECENCY VS. CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mountain of style buries a molehill of wishful thinking in the
Hype Williams film ``Belly.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a new millennium, it ponders the fate of young
black men drawn to drugs, violence, easy money and sexual license,
and weakly invokes the spirits of everyone from Marcus Garvey to
Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X to preach the virtues of godliness,
lawfulness, fidelity and plain old decency.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while its visual style glamorizes the fruits of
casual killings and outlaw life: gleaming cars, complaisant women
and piles of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belly'' is a film that begs for a pat on the head for its
virtue while catering to cinematic tastes more interested in crotch
shots, topless dancers, wall-sized television screens, ganja galore
and, wherever possible, crime without punishment, all to the
accompaniment of a high-octane soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Belly,'' Williams, a graduate of music videos making his
feature-film debut as writer and director, uses rapid cuts,
multiple images, superimpositions, slow motion and highly dramatic
lighting among other devices as he assembles an assortment of rap
artists in a tale set in 1999 among mostly undereducated urban
black teen-agers. The focus is on the friendship of two of them,
who appear older than their years.
</P>
<P>
   Pals since childhood, Tommy Brown (Earl Simmons, also known as
DMX) and Sincere (Nasir Jones, also known as Nas) have achieved a
measure of success in their chosen criminal life, and with a gang
of confederates at the outset of the film pull off a murderous,
bloody and very remunerative heist at a popular nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy goes home to his lavish modernistic mansion in Jamaica
Estates, in New York City, and to Kisha (Taral Hicks), the
girlfriend he cheats on with Kionna (Lavita Raynor), a girl below
the age of consent. Sin, by contrast, returns to his more modest
and more traditionally decorated house, where his wife, Tionne
(Tionne Watkins) and their baby await him.
</P>
<P>
   While Tommy's ambition turns his thoughts to entering the drug
trade and importing an additive that increases the potency of
street drugs, Sin the family man is thinking of going straight.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's ambition involves him in drug traffic, feuds and murder
on the island of Jamaica and a venture into drug sales in Omaha,
Neb., that offends a local gang, prompts them to tip off the police
and results in a bloody shootout.
</P>
<P>
   As Sin attempts to distance himself from Tommy and his way of
life, Tommy is on the run, never certain whom he can trust.
Cornered by federal agents, he is given a choice: go to jail
forever or infiltrate the organization of the well-meaning Rev.
Saviour (Benjamin F. Muhammed), plant drugs and assassinate him at
a huge gathering as midnight draws near on New Year's Eve 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Though not out of danger, Sin, meanwhile, is planning to begin a
new life in Africa with Tionne and their baby.
</P>
<P>
   The film draws to a close with an eloquent plea for change in
the new millennium, but fighting the emphases of Williams' style,
the message amounts to too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belly'' is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It contains considerable violence, simulated sex,
nudity and an abundance of crude language built around sex and
race.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m. CDT Tuesday, the remnant circulation of winds that
once were Hurricane Mitch regenerated into a minimal tropical storm
about 50 miles west-southwest of the city of Campeche on the
Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the marginal tropical system will move eastward
across the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida. With moisture gathering
ahead of the system, clusters of showers and thunderstorms, some
heavy, will develop over the peninsula and will likely intensify
Wednesday night and into Thursday as the tropical system
approaches. Heavy rain and flooding are possible over the southern
half of the Florida peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fog and patchy drizzle will dampen much of the Front
Range of the Rockies on Wednesday as moist winds from the east
continue to be forced up the sloping terrain. Light, patchy snow
will dust higher elevations across parts of Colorado and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Light to moderate rains will affect the Pacific Northwest Coast
on Wednesday as a Pacific disturbance moves inland. The focus of
moderate rains will likely occur on west-facing slopes of the
Coastal Range, Cascade and Olympic mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy light snow will continue over the mountains of northern
New England as a low pressure system which has been stalled over
the Canadian Maritimes for several days continues to circulate
cold, moist air southward from Quebec. Sprinkles of rain will fall
in the valleys. However, moist air moving eastward will dry on
descent from the Appalachians, setting the stage for a partly to
mostly sunny day along much of the Northeast Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ILKS OF FOG
</P>
<P>
   Fog blanketed the Front Range of the Colorado Rockies early
Tuesday as moist winds from the east gently glided up the sloping
terrain. This ilk of fog is called upslope fog. More traditionally,
ground fog, sometimes called valley fog, forms on a clear night
with light winds as the ground rapidly loses its heat to space. In
turn, the ground chills a layer of overlying air, coaxing invisible
water vapor to condense into tiny water droplets. Another type of
fog called advection fog forms when moist air passes over cool
ocean waters. The wind then carries or advects the fog inland.

HBO'S LARRY SANDERS: OFF THE AIR AND OFF KILTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (hlw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ His talk show is off the air, and his life is in
free fall after entering that show business dark zone known as
``between jobs,'' but Larry Sanders is still every inch the
slightly off-kilter celebrity his fans came to know so intimately
in ``The Larry Sanders Show'' on HBO. But he remains a man who
hides nothing embarrassing, as we discover in his
soon-to-be-released book, ``The Autobiography of Larry Sanders:
Confessions of a Late Night Talk Show Host'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster),
which tells all and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch with Sanders is a journey into a sort of entertainment
nether world. Things got off to an awkward start with his
suggestion that we meet at Le Dome, the hottest show business
restaurant about 15 years ago but the only place he said he was
guaranteed a good table. He arrived 20 minutes late and instantly
excused himself to make the obligatory visit to a neighboring table
for some much-needed recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say hello to my old friend Peter Asher, you know,
the famous record producer, used to be with Peter and Gordon,''
Sanders said. ``He's a great guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Garry,'' said Asher.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders hastily took him aside for some whispered exchanges,
then he returned to our table wearing the look of chagrin he made
so famous on ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' which ended its run last
spring after winning the first Emmy for its writers, the highly
regarded Peter Tolan and another person named Garry Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   Shandling, as it happens, is also listed as the ``as told to''
author of the autobiography, but Sanders dismissed him as a sort of
secretary who took some time to assemble the book only because he
had no other useful work. As Sanders put it, ``I said, `Look, maybe
you can help me transcribe it and organizationally help me, plus I
think it would be a joy for you just to hear about my life.' And he
said, `OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that Sanders was off the air; he ordered a big meal
and ate heartily. In fact, he said, he is happy that he does not
have to watch his weight so closely any longer. ``Television really
does add about 10 pounds to your physical appearance, and actually
television adds about 20 pounds to your ego, by the way,'' he said.
To try to keep his ego from being deflated, he added, he has
started a new diet. ``I have a nutritionist who is Bruce Willis'
nutritionist, and she has increased my carb level to maintain my
ego at a very steady place, rate, mountain, actually,'' he said,
adding that the nutritionist did not actually work for Bruce Willis
but just used the name in the title of her business because that
appealed to insecure celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually go to Kevin Costner's doctor; I don't know his
first name or last name, I just know him as Kevin Costner's
doctor,'' he said. ``I have Kate Capshaw's decorator doing my wood
floors and Candice Bergen's hair stylist doing my hair tomorrow, in
fact. I made the mistake the other day of going to Jackie Chan's
acupuncturist, and I am so energetic that I can't handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders insists in his book that he will not traffic in idle
gossip, but he goes on to reveal affairs with a number of actresses
and said those flings were all behind him. He confessed, however,
that one of those flames still burned bright, for the actress
Winona Ryder. As viewers of the talk show will recall, Ms. Ryder
spurned Sanders' advances in favor of the comic who replaced
Sanders, Jon Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure now that Winona knows she made the wrong choice,''
Sanders said. ``We've all done that in our lives, and that makes me
love her all the more because she's vulnerable and makes mistakes.
In fact, I got a note from her the other day that says, `Please
stop calling me.' But the fact that she sends a note means that
there's something more subliminal there. We also have what I think
is a very romantic thing, which is that every time I drive by her
house she closes the curtains. It's like a little signal we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about great moments from his talk show, Sanders was candid
about the difficulties of finding the right chemistry with a guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, most of the great moments in a talk show happen
spontaneously where, no matter how much preparation you have,
there's some unexpected moment that creates a spark between the
guest,'' he said. ``There was never one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders went on to say that, though preparation was important,
intuition played a more important role in the success of a talk
show host.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm most proud of is I always felt as an
interviewer I reflected what America was thinking,'' he said.
``That was such a gigantic accomplishment because I don't read
anything, any newspaper, any book, any map. I don't listen to the
news because I find newscasters to have even bigger egos than talk
show hosts. So I really knew very little and had to sort of wing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders insisted that the future, though empty for him at the
moment, would be bright.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a day that goes by, by the way, when I don't go up
to someone and say, `Aren't you curious about what I'm going to do
next?''' he said. ``I think people feel awkward pushing me on it,
and so they're nice enough not to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't see myself pursuing an acting career, but
I'm sorting that out. If the right thing came along perhaps, you
know, if there was a `Private Ryan' type of movie, I might be
interested in playing one of the soldiers. Or for that matter, one
of the frightened French shop owners who has to run into the
cellar. Although that might make a good special for me on
television. But that's in the future.''

`GODS AND MONSTERS' DEFTLY PROFILES LATE DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 4 STARS 
BY BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ James Whale was the greatest film director
nobody's heard of. Not only did he make the most influential horror
movie of all time, Universal's 1931 ``Frankenstein,'' he was
responsible for its even better sequel ``Bride of Frankenstein.''
His work includes two other, much-copied thrillers (``The Old Dark
House'' and ``The Invisible Man'') and the first and still vibrant
screen version of the musical ``Showboat.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1940s, however, Whale's career was essentially over, due
mainly to studio interference that resulted in a few flops. Some
say it was also because the unapologetically gay Englishman refused
to stay in the closet, decades before coming out was even
considered an option. Regardless, Whale retired to a life of
painting and leisure in Pacific Palisades _ where he was found,
fully dressed and drowned in his swimming pool, in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' (the title is a line from ``Bride''), is a
fictionalized account of Whale's last days, and it is so unique and
compelling a movie that it could bring him the kind of immortality
that Boris Karloff's creature enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the film ingeniously weaves the fundamental
``Frankenstein'' themes of memory, decay and regeneration into a
witty and touching tale of unlikely friendship and the enduring
power of the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Christopher Bram's novel ``Father of Frankenstein'' and
adapted and directed by Bill Condon, the film is a complex piece of
pure cinema, shot through with subjective time shifts, dream
displays, convincing re-creations (the ``Bride'' lab is an
authentic kick) and metaphorically loaded tableaux. Despite its
psychologically charged surrealism, however, ``Gods'' is never hard
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   This is due in large part to the fact that Condon keeps
character the main focus and has gotten career-best performances
out of Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser _ and a darn amusing one
from Lynn Redgrave _ to put the story's complex ideas and difficult
emotions across.
</P>
<P>
   While recovering from a mild but debilitating stroke, Whale
(McKellen) takes a fancy to his hunky new gardener, Clayton Boone
(Fraser). Something of a dolt, definitely a loser, the sullen Boone
agrees to model for the artist. During these sessions, the erudite
Whale tells his story _ loveless lower-class upbringing, horror and
loss in the trenches of World War I, succeeding beyond his wildest
fantasies in Hollywood _ to the befuddled but fascinated ex-Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Whale's cultivated attention has an effect. Boone likes the new
ideas and sensitivities his friend inspires in him. But he is
perceptive enough to understand what Whale is really after, and
Boone is revolted by the man's homosexual overtures. Yet the
difficult friendship grows and deepens.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on the proverbial dark and stormy night, the director
requests something far more intimate and alarming than sex.
</P>
<P>
   Good as McKellen is as the crafty old Nazi in ``Apt Pupil,'' he
more than tops that performance here. Rueful yet still lusting for
life, proudly fey yet too much the individual to fall into queer
stereotype, McKellen's Whale is, most of all, a man enraged by his
own incremental decline and determined, like Dr. Frankenstein, to
defy nature's inevitability. McKellen expresses this with all the
subtlety and slyness at his formidable command, while keeping in
mind that Whale was a marvelously entertaining old joker, too. It's
the finest, richest acting you'll see this year.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, surprise of surprises, George of the Jungle keeps up
with him. Fraser juggles so much _ dawning intelligence,
repulsion/attraction, escalating unease, Boone's own unexamined
secrets _ you'd expect it would daunt a master Shakespearean like
his co-star, let alone a Hollywood pretty boy. Yet he invests the
character with a ready emotional availability that is not only
impressive, it's uplifting. If Boone is the monster to Whale's mad
scientist, Fraser makes you belief that the experiment could have
some merit after all.
</P>
<P>
   And what's a good horror show without a nutty European servant?
Redgrave seems to have thought it would be incomplete. As Whale's
judgmental, protective German housekeeper Hanna, she plays it
suspended between a kind of comic-relief Frau Blucher and Prussian
domestic goddess. The approach steps dangerously past the line of
caricature, but Redgrave knows when to draw back and illuminate the
humanity of yet another bewildered and appalled, yet fiercely
loving, creature.
</P>
<P>
   On every level, ``Gods and Monsters'' is a marvelous
achievement. And it's that rare movie that seems to evolve, rather
than just unfold, before our eyes, from something provocative into
something closer to transcendent and eternally true about the human
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Shelley couldn't have imagined the movies when she wrote
``Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus'' in 1818. Had she known a
film like ``Gods and Monsters'' could be made, she might not have
been so pessimistic about man's presumptuous determination to
create something that could live forever.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``This Is Our Youth'' is back, and not a moment too
soon. In a season in which some of the wise men of the theater have
been trying to force-feed insipid fare like ``Stupid Kids'' and
``Footloose'' to young audiences, it's sheer relief to celebrate
the return of a rambunctious and witty play about wayward
teen-agers and post-adolescents that doesn't turn youthful travails
into plastic rap.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Lonergan's three-character comedy made an indelible
impression during an all-too-limited run two autumns ago under the
auspices of the New Group. It has been revived by another nonprofit
theater, Second Stage, with many of the original hands aboard: the
director, Mark Brokaw; the set designer, Allen Moyer, and two of
the actors, Mark Ruffalo and Missy Yager. (Mark Rosenthal is the
cast's newcomer, replacing Josh Hamilton.) All are in fine form,
incisively animating Lonergan's devastating portrait of Upper West
Side rich kids and their amoral, self-abusive, patternless lives.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright has unfailing antennae for the crude folkways of
this dissolute urban tribe, whose customs revolve around drug
dealing, scamming their uninterested parents and recreating their
broken homes in their dysfunctional friendships. These are the
disposable offspring of the elite, as wired and drifting in their
way as the lowlife juvenile delinquents caught in the klieg lights
of ``Cops.'' The major difference is these articulate sociopaths in
training can talk their way out of trouble, and, if all else fails,
their folks will surely find it in their hearts to get them good
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is Our Youth,'' which opened Tuesday night, insinuates
itself into this closed society with a spymaster's stealth; one of
its great strengths is its careful, voyeuristic eye on confused,
embittered young manhood. The play conjures this world in all of
its revelatory rituals, from a dirty kitchen sink, carelessly
filled with Chinese takeout cartons and a basketball, to the
epithet-laced stream of put-downs and private phraseology that
passes for conversation. ``Hello, Jessica, you're looking very
automated tonight,'' the babyish Warren (played by the captivating
Ruffalo) says at one point, and is utterly baffled when Jessica (in
Ms. Yager's well-nigh perfect portrayal) doesn't get that he's paid
her a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   The Lost Boys of ``Peter Pan'' are not half as disfranchised as
the characters in Lonergan's work, a caper play of sorts; though
his characters are aimless, his narrative is not. The year is 1982,
and the place is the studio apartment of Dennis Ziegler, a reckless
man of 21 or thereabouts who has been cast out by his father, a
``serious painter'' who sets Dennis up in a bachelor pad that the
son immediately converts into a 14-year-old's bedroom. Moyer's
tumbledown set is precisely observed, down to the numbers scribbled
on the wall over the phone: it's a shrine to emotional immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   Like the apartment, Dennis is a total mess. He spends his days
sleeping late, watching television and selling cocaine, and, as
intelligently played by Rosenthal, he's also a manic hypocrite,
prone to screaming fits in vile phone fights with his unseen
girlfriend and to endless boasts about the success he could have
made of himself, if he had cared to. Occasionally, Rosenthal
overdoes the shrillness; the first 20 minutes of the play are
pitched so high, it's difficult to penetrate the story. But this,
we gather, is the way the production acknowledges that Dennis' life
is a disaster, and the worst may be yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Into Dennis' apartment strolls misguided Warren, an acolyte of
Dennis' and the unlikeliest romantic hero of the year. Ruffalo,
sporting a thick untamed mane and decked out in the sloppy-guy
layered look _ T-shirt under sport shirt under sweatshirt _
delivers the kind of masterly comic performance that rekindles your
awe at the persuasive power of fine acting; in his physicalizing of
Warren's hangdog pout, the twitchy slump to his shoulders, you get
the outward manner of a young man trapped between his sensitive and
destructive impulses, an uncertain grown-up only half willing to
abandon childhood.
</P>
<P>
   How Warren will turn out, whether he'll follow Dennis into
dissipation, or discover a way out, is the play's preoccupation. He
has arrived with a suitcase filled with his vintage toys, and with
$15,000 stowed in his knapsack, cash he has swiped from his father
in an impulsive act of rebellion. It's a foolish, transparent crime
that can come to no good, but the young men don't see it that way.
Dennis views it as an opportunity to finance a major drug deal,
Warren as the pathway to true manhood.
</P>
<P>
   When Jessica, a mixed-up Manhattan prep school girl, shows up
for a date, Warren pulls out a wad of bills and takes her off,
awkwardly, for a night of New York seduction. His choice is
hilarious, given the slovenly cast of the rest of his life: like
characters out of a Woody Allen movie, they make love on the
terrace of a suite at the Plaza Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The liaison establishes the play's tender side, and in terms of
great comebacks also sets up its funniest line, which is recited by
Rosenthal and won't be divulged here. Ruffalo and Ms. Yager handle
their scenes together with clumsy grace. They're particularly
evocative in a pivotal confrontation in Act II, when Jessica
demands of Warren a gesture of generosity that forces him to choose
between the source of his new infatuation and an old, treasured
object of love, a baseball cap bequeathed to him by his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw, who first came to notice with the original New Group
production of this play, and went on to direct the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``How I Learned to Drive,'' leads the characters
through ``This Is Our Youth'' as if he lived in the building with
them.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, in its ``Real World'' series, has tried to touch a nerve
with young people by documenting their comings and goings in
temporary, artificial households, but the television show doesn't
come close to the searing truths Brokaw and Lonergan discover in
their fictional triangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Is Our Youth'' _ by turns caustic, cruel and
compassionate _ is the  &UR; real &LR;  real world.

   With images of Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, Georgia
O'Keeffe, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and other major
personalities in the arts and on the world stage, an exhibition of
the photographs of Philippe Halsman will open on Friday at the
Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery in Washington.
From the 1940s through the '70s, portraits by Halsman (1906-1979)
appeared on the covers and in the pages of major magazines like
Life, Look and The Saturday Evening Post. Comprising 73 vintage
prints, the exhibition, ``Philippe Halsman: A Retrospective,''
continuing through Feb. 7, is billed as the first major review of
his work. The show includes ``Dali Atomicus'' (1948), which
captures Salvador Dali flying through the air, along with a
painting, furniture, streams of water and several cats.

   Outside a foundry in a village about 40 miles west of Paris,
finishing touches are being applied to a bronze statue of Winston
Churchill, to be unveiled in the French capital in ceremonies
attended by Queen Elizabeth II next Wednesday, the 80th anniversary
of the armistice that ended World War I. Created by the French
sculptor Jean Cardot and financed by private and public
contributions, the 10{-foot, 5,000-pound statue depicts Churchill,
Britain's World War II leader, in his air marshal's uniform, a
walking stick in his left hand, as he appeared on Nov. 11, 1944,
when he strode with Charles de Gaulle down the Champs-Elysees three
months after the liberation of Paris. Its pedestal inscribed with
the words ``We shall never surrender,'' the statue will stand
outside the Petit Palais, at Avenue Winston Churchill.

   The Discovery astronauts successfully retrieved the Spartan
satellite-based solar observatory on Tuesday, completing one of
their nine-day mission's highest priorities.

<P>
   Astronaut Steve Robinson grabbed the boxy, 3,000-pound

that it could record hundreds of pre-programmed observations of the
sun's outer atmosphere and the solar wind with a pair of
telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   Spartan lagged up to 40 miles behind Discovery during the free
flight. Early Tuesday, Discovery commander Curt Brown and pilot
Steve Lindsey initiated a series of maneuvers that placed the
shuttle several miles behind then below the $9 million satellite.
</P>
<P>
   A gradual ascent by the shuttle brought Spartan within reach of
Discovery's 50-foot robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston, we've got a good grapple of Spartan,'' Robinson
radioed mission control.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's rendezvous activities also permitted Brown's crew to
test an experimental laser range-finding device mounted in the
shuttle and aimed at targets on the free-flying Spartan. The ranger
is being developed by NASA for use on a future unmanned cargo
capsule that could make automated dockings with the U.S.-led
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   So that ground-based engineers could evaluate the accuracy of
the laser, Brown and Lindsey eased Discovery to within 200 feet of
Spartan, backed out to 500 feet and then slowly zeroed in for the
capture.
</P>
<P>
   Spartan's flight was the last in a series of four such missions
since 1993, each designed to gather observations at different
points in the sun's 11-year cycle of magnetic activity. An attempt
to carry out the mission last November was unsuccessful because
that shuttle crew failed to properly activate the spacecraft prior
to its deployment and then accidently bumped it with the robot arm
during an hasty attempt to recapture it, sending the Spartan into a
slow tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Spacewalking astronauts on that flight hand caught the wobbly
satellite several days later, allowing scientists to reschedule the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers are hopeful the observations will shed new light on
the sun's changing magnetic field, the genesis of the solar wind
and periodic mass eruptions of electrically charged atomic
particles.
</P>
<P>
   These events influence the Earth's climate and occasionally
disrupt satellite communications and ground-based electrical power
distributions grids.
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn, the 77-year-old Mercury astronaut who is one of the
shuttle's seven crew members, served as an observer throughout the
rendezvous and retrieval operations.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Glenn was engaged in a range of medical and
biotechnology experiments, furnishing blood and urine specimens for
a muscle loss investigation. Using a laptop computer, Glenn
participated in evaluations of his reflexes and mental
concentration for a sleep study as well.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn also donned a halter with a heart monitoring device that
is part of a study of his cardiovascular health.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's crew is scheduled to land Saturday at the Kennedy
Space Center in Florida. &QL;

Israel after all.'' I told my mom that the Wye signing made my
husband, Nati, and myself feel scared and depressed. She was
surprised. After all, wasn't Wye a direct continuation of Oslo?
That is what Netanyahu would like us to believe. It's also what a

   HITECH-CLASSROOMS _ Aside from the overhead projector and the

pulls together several media and brings them to bear on the

   STOCK-GURU _ GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Ten years ago, Bob Prechter was
world-famous, the top stock market forecaster on the globe.
Operating from his home on Lake Lanier, his every utterance made
Wall Street roil. But after correctly predicting the October 1987
crash, his vision blurred. He forecast a catastrophic drop in
stocks and the worst depression in 200 years. Didn't happen.
Instead, the Dow Jones average bounced around for a while, then
began the historic climb that peaked at 9,337 in August. All the
while, Prechter stuck to his guns, insisting the end was still
nigh, living in virtual obscurity, a Chicken Little in a big
chicken town. ``It was predictable, my fall in fame,'' he muses,
staring at the image of a spiral-shaped nautilus shell in his
office. ``In fact, I did predict it. Popularity waxes and wanes, as
does everything else in nature. All collective social behavior is
predictable.'' That is the essence, the central notion, of the
mathematical theory known as the Elliott Wave Principle, which
Prechter uses to make all his forecasts. (Hendrick, Atlanta

BART SIMPSON WOULD FEEL RIGHT AT HOME AT NANCY CARTWRIGHT'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You can almost hear Bart Simpson saying, ``Don't
have a cow, man.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Cartwright, the woman who actually says the words, has
ignored the advice.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime voice of Bart has a life-size statue of a
black-and-white cow on the lawn of her Northridge house &UR;  &LR; in the San
Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As you walk through the multicolored gates of her one-acre
homestead, it doesn't take long to realize that Cartwright has at
least one thing in common with the eternally 10-year-old Bart _ a
sense of playfulness.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you get the feeling that if Bart were a decorator, this
1947 wood-framed farmhouse where the Andrews sisters once lived
would be one of his creations.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the star of the family's annual ``Happy Moo Year'' card,
there are also a number of other animals _ both living and replicas
_ prowling around the property. Among the living are four cats _
Pip Pip, Cheerio, Emma and Chewie (short for Chewbacca) _ two dogs
_ Lydia and Buddy (Lydia's friend) _ a white bird named Eddie
Murphy and a lizard. There used to be two lizards, but Chewie
chewed one.
</P>
<P>
   There are also figurines of the Seven Dwarfs, owls, icicle
lights and a tree swing.
</P>
<P>
   As you enter the house, one of the first things you see is a
``Simpsons'' pinball machine. Then, as your eyes bounce around the
brightly colored rooms, you notice plastic lobsters, a nutcracker
collection, giant stuffed animals and more tchotchkes than you'd
find at the Aaahs warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Attention to detail is consistent throughout the house.
Cartwright's office, which is a converted garage, had an unsightly
beam cutting it in half. A little bit of burlap, some fake leaves
and fruit, and the next thing you know, the beam becomes a banana
tree. An ornate chandelier lights her desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every girl should have a banana tree and a chandelier,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids prefer Nancy's house to their own,'' said ``Simpsons''
executive producer Mike Scully. ``It's like going to Disneyland
without having to make the ride all the way out to Anaheim.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Cartwright, who lives in the four-bedroom, five-bath
petting zoo with her husband, Warren Murphy, and children, Lucy, 8,
and Jack, 7, she explains her choices this way: ``It's whimsical.''
</P>
<P>
   Her surroundings are far more conspicuous than the star herself.
Cartwright is able to play one of the most recognizable characters
on television and has the luxury of hardly being recognized while
moving about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anonymity thing comes into play, and I can go where I want
to and do what I want to do without my privacy being invaded,'' she
said. ``I can go anywhere, and nobody knows that I'm this icon or a
voice of an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   Scully says that when ``The Simpsons'' was cast, ``We were
looking for real actors, not just people with funny voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright, has appeared on stage and in such films as
``Godzilla'' and ``Twilight Zone: The Movie,'' recently landed a
movie role after telling the casting director she thought the
character had ``big teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy has a great sense of fun,'' says Scully. ``She really
understands the way a kid thinks. That's why she's such a great mom
_ and perfect for the role of Bart.''
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright likes to put her celebrity and whimsy to good use.
</P>
<P>
   Off to one end of her production studio is a workbench on which
she does crafts projects to sell at charity auctions. She was
delighted to hear that a plate she painted recently raised $500 for
the Surf Rider Foundation, which was raising money to help clean up
the beach in Malibu, previously ravaged by El Nino. The plate
depicted Bart on a surfboard, holding a fishing line with a
three-eyed fish dangling from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always great to any kids who come to see a show
recorded,'' says Scully. ``She always signs autographs and does the
voice for them. I think she really knows what it's like for a kid
to meet Bart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cartwright has a serious side, too.
</P>
<P>
   On the walls of her office and production studio are charts that
mark personal and professional progress. Cartwright, a
Scientologist for the past decade, has adopted L. Ron Hubbard's
administrative techniques, and points are assessed for any forward
motion. For instance, booking an on-camera acting job is worth
1,000 points.
</P>
<P>
   Cartwright is an outspoken advocate of the religion that has 8
million members worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is misunderstood, like all new religions,'' Cartwright said
of Scientology. ``(Critics) just need to read a book to find out
what it is. I wanted something very practical to give me stability.
... Certainly being an artist in Hollywood is an unstable
profession,'' she said. ``Scientology gives me a basis from which
to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Cartwright is moving beyond Bart. With her husband and
Peter Kjenaas, she has formed Happy House Productions Inc. Its
first motion picture, ``Gathering the Joneses,'' about a family
patriarch who comes home after an 11-year visit to a convenience
store, is scheduled to begin filming in January.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds, well ... whimsical, and as serious as Cartwright is
about Hollywood, whimsy is never far away.
</P>
<P>
   Once she was on an airplane that was grounded for about an hour
without air conditioning. So she offered to put her skills to good
use by entertaining the disgruntled travelers with a little Bart
Simpson performance, but the flight attendant wouldn't let her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have brought up the morale,'' Cartwright
said. ``He should have let me do it.''

   FBN-FALCONS-LINE _ Falcons offensive line has caught a lot of

nobody is questioning its ability to block for the run. (Bunn,

   RAC-ARCA _ They have Winston Cup ambitions with small-track

some could be getting their first taste of superspeedway racing.
With the inexperience come problems. ARCA racing has its share of
up-and-comers, but it also is known for its wrecks. The last time
the circuit raced here, there was a death. (Minter, Atlanta

   RAC-MARCIS _ ATLANTA _ Dave Marcis has his hands full. His No.
71 Chevrolet has been loaded into his hauler, which is trying to
back out from the remote area where NASCAR's have-nots must park _
back behind the Union 76 fuel pumps, where one vendor is selling
ear plugs for $1 from his truck. Marcis' 71 car was too slow to
make the 42-car Delco field, but he's still working, bouncing from
one team truck to another, looking for parts, information, anything
that will keep him from going through this early-exit routine
again. Team Realtree is Team RealUnlucky. The only traffic it can
beat these days is that leaving the race track. (Levine, Atlanta

   ARCHDEACON-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Rod Foster pulled up the
green pant leg of his Wright State warm-up suit and eased down the
top of his white cotton sock until you saw the faint, two-inch scar
just above his left ankle. ``That's all you can see of it
anymore,'' he said with a shrug. ``From this, you can't really tell
how big of a deal it was in my life.'' As it turns out, this thin
line of flesh is really more like the great divide. On one side
there was the National Basketball Association, where Foster was a
Phoenix Suns shooting guard. On the other side of the scar, you
find basketball stops far beyond those marquee seasons with UCLA
and the NBA. (Archdeacon, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

RELIGIOUS RIGHT IS WRONG ABOUT BILL CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the eve of my birthday last week, my sister and niece showed
up on my doorstep bearing gifts.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the boxes and offering my thanks, we launched into
a review of the day's events: the kids, school, the kids, voting,
and the kids. It was much like all the other scatterbrained
conversations we have, and although we didn't talk much about the
gifts, it occurred to me later, after Jo and Jasmine had gone home,
that they were perfect. I happen upon these _ perfect gifts, I mean
_ every so often when I've done a good job of dropping hints.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I'm shameless. But this time I'd not told Jo that I was
hoping for a good bottle of perfume. It is a simple thing, really,
but it reminded me that all good and perfect gifts are from God.
</P>
<P>
   While I was thinking about gifts like these, I couldn't help but
remember a New York Times article I read recently about President
Clinton's letter to members of his home church in Little Rock, Ark.
In a two-page handwritten missive, the story said, Clinton
expressed his repentance and asked members of Immanuel Baptist to
forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed like an honorable thing to do, but when I read
further along in the news story, I found that in the weeks since
Clinton admitted to having lied about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, top officials of the Southern Baptist Convention have
called on Immanuel Baptist to revoke the president's membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can President Clinton claim to be Southern Baptist and
persist in this display of serial sin?'' R. Albert Mohler Jr.,
president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, was quoted
as saying. ``Only because the congregation which holds his
membership failed to exercise any semblance of church discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   My heart sank, but the story got even better. Or maybe I should
say worse.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Pat Robertson, the television evangelist and
chairman of the Christian Coalition, said he wanted the president
to resign and for Congress to begin ``repairing America's moral
fabric.'' He also wanted ``Christian Americans'' to send money to
his politically charged organization to help it get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those columns I wish I didn't have to write. I'd
like to figure that if I ignore this thing long enough, it'll just
pass by. But the religious right just won't shut up.
</P>
<P>
   I listen to these people and I think that those who call
themselves ``born again'' today have simply become members of an
elite, private club. I have to wonder if even Jesus could enter.
</P>
<P>
   If he could, he would remind them, no doubt, ``if a man be
overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such a one in
the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be
tempted.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Mohler's and Robertson's holier-than-thou attitude has
stayed with me because I think it is so contrary to everything
Christianity is. For one thing, the truly ``born again'' know that
only God has the power to change who we are. It is no wonder that
he says, and I'm paraphrasing here, that if you who are called by
my name would humble yourselves and seek my face and turn from your
wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and heal your land.
</P>
<P>
   As a child of the ``born again,'' one of the earliest lessons I
learned was how I ought to pray and ask God to ``forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.''
</P>
<P>
   At 41, I am a long way from being that child, but I have not
forgotten the lessons _ no, the gifts _ my parents gave me. I pray
I never will.

 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Christmas season is here, ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the calendar says we're barely past Halloween
and Thanksgiving is still three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Many retail store managers are worried that customers won't shop
till they drop for packages to put under the tree this year. So
they have already festooned their halls with Christmas trimmings,
installed holiday lighting and begun playing traditional carols to
get folks in the mood to buy.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Christmas actually arrives, we'll be sick of Santa.
</P>
<P>
   And it would serve the stores right.
</P>
<P>
   Our overeager merchants are ruining the exciting sense of
anticipation that used to characterize the holiday's secular
festivities. If we are surrounded by Christmas commercialism
practically all fall, boredom will set in long before Dec. 25
actually arrives. How many times can you hear ``Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer'' without going nuts?
</P>
<P>
   Back in the dark ages, stores used to wait until the
Thanksgiving turkey was reduced to boney rubble before hauling out
the stuffed Santas. Macy's famous Thanksgiving Day parade marked
the start of the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   We had one holiday at a time, in orderly succession.
</P>
<P>
   That gave everyone four post-Thanksgiving weeks to enjoy jingle
bells, wrap presents and hang up the mistletoe. Plenty of time for
the seasonal jollies.
</P>
<P>
   But this year many merchants didn't even wait until the little
ghouls and goblins had their fill of Halloween candy before pushing
artificial greenery and red ribbons at us. Organizations that keep
track of such things report that the typical mall across the
country has hastened the Christmas season by several weeks this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving, alas, will get lost in the shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Retail stores have never cared much for Thanksgiving anyway.
There's not much of a market for merchandise to celebrate that
particular family tradition. How many ceramic turkeys can you own?
</P>
<P>
   Only the grocery stores and turkey farms make out. It's
basically an excuse to eat, not to purchase presents, house
decorations or new party clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Prolonging the Christmas shopping season is tempting for
retailers because that is their single most profitable period. Some
chains generate more than half their annual sales then.
</P>
<P>
   Any year now Christmas items will be in the stores by Labor Day,
and all of autumn will be identified with tinsel and toys rather
than pumpkins and falling leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The trend knows no bounds. Early this August, Macy's ignored its
own history and put on sale a $50 mechanical Santa Claus that
dances and sings. Next we can expect Christmas to overtake the
Fourth of July, perhaps featuring plastic Santas waving American
flags.
</P>
<P>
   And can it be long before we are stuck with Christmas decor all
year? It's too much. Help!
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonal and overexposed holiday greediness is not the right
antidote to combat what some economists predict is a growing
nervousness among average Americans about their personal finances.
The Conference Board, a New York-based business research group,
reported last week that consumer confidence fell for the fourth
straight month _ to its lowest level in almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   Many families are spooked by the tumbles in the stock market,
the Asian financial crisis and fears of a pending recession. That
reality is not going to be reversed by prematurely dangling
Christmas ornaments before them.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful December poinsettias that traditionally announce
the holiday season have a limited blooming period of about one
month. So do the gift-buying instincts of most Christmas shoppers
and the good-behavior efforts of most youngsters anticipating those
gifts. The traditional time frame has always worked well. Let's
keep it that way.

   Fox used some giant dinosaurs to take a bite out of NBC last
week, but considering how much Fox paid for the meal, it might be
questioning how much bite it got for its buck.
</P>
<P>
   Fox did announce a noteworthy achievement on Tuesday: For the
first time, it beat NBC among the 18-to-49-year-old viewers that
both networks covet, in a week in which Fox did not rely on some
special sports events like the World Series or the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The first network broadcast of Steven Spielberg's dinosaur epic
``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' played a significant part in that
victory, because the movie on Sunday night significantly improved
Fox's overall performance.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Lost World,'' was not a runaway success. It did not even
beat the competing NBC movie on Sunday night, Part I of a biography
of the soul group the Temptations. That film cost NBC $8 million,
precisely one-tenth of the record-setting $80 million that Fox paid
for the rights to ``Lost World,'' and NBC got four hours out of
``The Temptations'' to three for ``Lost World.''
</P>
<P>
   For an even more eye-opening comparison, match the performance
of ``Lost World'' against that for the original ``Jurassic Park,''
which NBC owns and broadcast for the first time in May 1995. ``Lost
World'' had a 12.4 national rating (each rating point represents
994,000 homes), and a 9.7 rating among those 18-to-49-year-olds.
``Jurassic Park'' virtually doubled those numbers: a 23.3 national
rating and an 18.3 among young adults.
</P>
<P>
   NBC paid a lot less to get twice the audience, a reported $50
million for ``Jurassic Park'' and another Steven Spielberg film,
``Schindler's List.'' To complete what looks like either a great
bargain for NBC or a gouging for Fox, the ratings for ``Schindler's
List'' also make ``Lost World'' look unimposing. In February 1997,
``Schindler's List'' scored a 20.9 national rating, with a 13.4
rating among 18-to-49-year-old viewers.
</P>
<P>
   When NBC ran ``Jurassic Park'' for a third time in 1996, it
still did far better than ``Lost World,'' with a 14.2 rating, and a
10.8 among young adults. Fox bought 10 runs of ``Lost World'' for
its $80 million and now has a considerably lower base rating on
which to sell the next nine showings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fox had an upbeat ratings week, its best of the season so
far. Fox had improvements on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But as for beating NBC without relying on a big sports event,
that claim may also merit an asterisk. Fox was helped enormously on
Sunday night by 23 minutes of runover from the football game
between the Packers and the 49ers, a match-up of playofflike
impact. The game scored a 17 national rating and an 11.6 with young
adults, both much higher than ``Lost World.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Fox had not had that football runover in prime time on
Sunday night, would it still have beaten NBC for the week for the
first time? Not quite. It would have been a tie.

   Widening a Career
</P>
<P>
   Anderson Cooper, an ABC News correspondent, may have grown a bit
restless after three years reporting more often for the
lower-profile weekend news broadcasts than for ABC ``World News
Tonight.'' His contract expired recently, and he had an intriguing
offer from a cable network.
</P>
<P>
   But what journalist in his right mind would leave ABC News to
work for the USA Network?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Cooper has found a way for him to have his cake and
eat it, too. Although the deal is not yet final, Cooper met Tuesday
morning with Shelby Coffey, executive vice president of ABC News,
and Stephen Chao, the USA Networks president for programming, and
they agreed in principle that Cooper would anchor his own news
prime-time magazine show on USA, while still serving as a
correspondent for ABC News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anderson is interested in pursuing this project with USA
Network and so are we, and we're talking to USA Network about it,''
said an ABC News spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks issued a press release on Monday describing the
project as a ``one-hour single-topic news documentary series'' and
describing Cooper as a ``former ABC News correspondent.'' Later,
USA issued a correction to remove the word ``former'' from the
reference to Cooper but still announcing the project as a done
deal.
</P>
<P>
   For ABC, it would be another vehicle to expand ABC News'
presence into other media outlets beyond broadcast television.
Seeking such extensions was one of the responsibilities given
Coffey when he joined ABC News, after a career in print journalism,
last June. Another example: ABC News Productions produces a news
program for the Discovery Channel, anchored by an ABC reporter,
Steve Aveson.
</P>
<P>
   Until these projects, ABC journalists had done outside work only
for public television or for networks partly owned by ABC, like A&AMP;E
or the History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, 31, was a globe-trotting correspondent for Channel One,
the network that broadcasts a 12-minute daily news program into
American high schools, when ABC News hired him in 1995. He tried to
take his youthful, first-person-based reporting style to ABC News,
but as time passed, he began doing more mainstream, straight-news
reports, and had not settled into a beat that got him on the main
evening newscast regularly.

   Games Children Watch
</P>
<P>
   Add to the toy cupboard of children's television a new network
devoted entirely to games children play. Nickelodeon announced
Tuesday that it would offer a new digital channel next year called
Nickelodeon GAS, short for Games and Sport for Kids (minus the
`K').
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon GAS, which at first will consist mostly of reruns of
such popular Nickelodeon game shows as ``Global Guts'' and ``Double
Dare,'' has been in development for months as Nickelodeon
programmers decided how to expand when digital technology makes
additional channels available to every network.
</P>
<P>
   It will be offered next February, a few weeks after the premiere
of Noggin, a digital cable channel strictly for preschoolers, which
Nickelodeon has been developing jointly with the Children's
Television Workshop.
</P>
<P>
   The one new show will be an original, live-action series called
``Renford Rejects,'' produced in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philosophically it's a very Nickelodeon-style show,'' Cyma
Zarghami, the network's executive vice president and general
manager, said Tuesday. ``It's a bunch of kids navigating
adolescence, while playing on a soccer team, a coed team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon is known for doing extensive research with children
both online and face-to-face, in focus groups. ``What we heard from
kids was that they don't need us to give them sports the way they
already get it from other networks,'' Ms. Zarghami said. ``They
wanted sports they don't get elsewhere, and things like inside the
locker room, or sports as a kids' pastime, or sports heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon GAS will develop shows about video and electronic
games. It has also bought episodes of ``S.I. for Kids'' from Sports
Illustrated, a series originally produced for CBS. And it will use
repeats of ``Sports Theater with Shaquille O'Neal,'' a popular
series of one-hour specials that originally appeared on
Nickelodeon.

AT PLAY WITH SPACE AND ITS IDEAL PROPORTIONS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)
</HEADLINE>

 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, the New York architects,
once took issue with the conventional wisdom that mass tourism,
with its comfort, ease and homogenization, has replaced the hardy
travel of yore.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they suggested, tourism inflicts an enormous amount of
stress, risk, and discomfort. Delayed flights, mixed connections,
metal detectors, lost luggage, toddler-size airplane seats, crying
infants, pestilentially recycled air and inquisitorial customs
officials: this is a new kind of travel, but not a less taxing one.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this recently when I went to Finland to see
Kiasma, Helsinki's new museum of contemporary art. The building,
which opened in May, was designed by Steven Holl, one of New York's
most gifted architects.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be necessary for a New Yorker to endure jet lag to
check out one of his buildings. And what if the thing turns out to
be a turkey?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Helsinki's new museum is worth the trip, in part
because it is informed by an awareness of the twists and surprises
of contemporary life, the unexpected departures from plans, the
vast tracts of unknown experience that reside even in a built-up,
shrinking world.
</P>
<P>
   Artists can explore that experience, and Steven Holl is one of
them who does. Hooray for John Glenn's second voyage into outer
space; three cheers for Steven Holl for creating a new space on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Kiasma stands in the center of modern Helsinki. Compared with
Senate Square, the city's 19th-century neoclassical core, this
nameless zone lacks cohesion and grace. A case study in modern
disjunction, it is a mixture of the civic, the commercial and the
industrial.
</P>
<P>
   Monumental buildings, like the Finnish Parliament and the city's
main train station, swim around in the same tepid urban soup with a
50s hotel and shopping complex and a movie theater from the 1930s.
All are basically background buildings trying to be foreground
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Holl's design reverses the equation. Firmly planted at the
center of this disarray, it is a foreground building that behaves
as if it were a background building. Its formal variety, its
collagelike use of materials, its reflective surfaces of glass and
water, pick up fragments from the city around it and mold them into
an astonishing sculptural presence.
</P>
<P>
   The views from within _ carefully framed and scaled vistas of
the city _ also knit Kiasma into the urban fabric, and transform
the way you see it.
</P>
<P>
   The architect got to name his own building. There's not a
donor's plaque in sight. Kiasma, a neurological term, refers to a
crossing of optical nerves at the base of the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Though I doubt that Holl intended a literal depiction, the
building's ground floor plan does suggest a cross-over structure:
two reflecting pools are joined by a water cascade that runs
beneath the museum at the point where it flares out into the
horn-shape that terminates the building's northern end. (Holl
envisions a water park that will eventually connect the pools to
the broad expanse of Helsinki's Toolo Bay.)
</P>
<P>
   But I assume that the optical twists Holl is aiming for are
those between art and the city: between the contemplative and the
bustling, the metaphoric and the urban domain of material reality;
between retinal experience and what the mind's eye makes of it.
This he accomplishes with a strikingly assured interplay between
windows (including skylights _ the path of the sun was a major
force shaping the design) and walls, curves and grids, voids and
planes. The result emerges as a symphonic variation on the city
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Helsinki never had a museum of modern art. The Finns were
probably too busy creating great design. Crowds have flocked to
Kiasma since the day it opened. They animate the square as well as
the building.
</P>
<P>
   A bookstore and cafe are on the ground floor, both open to the
public without charge; in one corner of the cafe there are some
stools and a shelf with laptops that can also be used free of
charge. They are being heavily surfed.
</P>
<P>
   In plan, the museum looks something like a boxcar colliding with
a comet. It has two wings, joined by a skylit circulation spine.
The roof and inner wall of the largest wing, five stories at its
highest point, are both dramatically curved, with the roof curling
down to form part of the outer wall.
</P>
<P>
   The flat-roofed ``boxcar'' slams it at an oblique angle. The
exterior is clad in polished industrial materials: zinc, aluminum,
brass and glass.
</P>
<P>
   Holl's method of design makes it nearly impossible to read his
work from plans spatially scenographic. He begins with perspective
renderings and then works on constructing the spaces he has
envisioned. The building does not express its structure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the result differs from the scenographic architecture of,
say, Charles Moore or Michael Graves. Holl's drawings, while
two-dimensional, represent deep and highly plastic space.
</P>
<P>
   On entering, the long ramp of the circulation spine pulls the
eye upward and forward; the body follows. As Vesa Honkonen, Holl's
associate architect, writes in a book about the museum, this is
about movement in space, and the entrance establishes that. No
works of art are presented on the the ramp because it is one.
</P>
<P>
   The wings partly overlap and are fused with a seamlessness that
makes the building's organization difficult to hold in mind but
pleasant to explore. There are four floors of galleries, two of
them devoted to the museum's permanent collection, the others to
changing exhibitions, special projects and a 230-seat cinema.
</P>
<P>
   None of the galleries resemble the perfect white cube envisioned
by modern architects. Entrances to the galleries are not aligned on
axis. The walls dividing some of them are not parallel but radiate
outward from the shallow curve of the central circulation spine.
Side walls echo the curve of the spine or the buildings exterior
skin.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries are art-friendly. In each, three walls are
properly perpendicular and square. But Kiasma is not an egg crate.
Its interiors are continually and subtly varied.
</P>
<P>
   Complaint Department:
</P>
<P>
   1. Too much detail. These are mostly finely worked, but not
entirely. The small, metal-lined cascade running beneath the
building fills up unattractively with grit and now looks like a
gutter. But Holl is still relatively young for an architect, and I
would much rather see him design with a young man's excessive
exuberance than affect an old man's simplicity. And many of the
details are wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   At night, a small triangular skylight in one of the galleries
perfectly frames a blue neon advertising sign floating high up on
the skyline in the dark sky. It was delightful to see this in a
museum featuring a Bruce Nauman retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   2. Holl's esthetic fundamentalism. Holl is much attached to the
Golden Section, not only as a system for determining proportions
but also as a means of establishing his lineage from Le Corbusier,
whose Modulor system was also based on the Greek ideal. This may be
a problem for a contemporary art museum built at a time when many
artists are questioning the enduring validity of classical ideals.
</P>
<P>
   I myself like a nice, classically ordered space. But when the
Section motif turns up repeatedly and emphatically in, say, the
design of window mullions, it begins to seem like a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, John Summerson gave a lecture at the Architectural
Association attacking the orthodoxies of the Modern movement. He
believed it would take 10 more years for architects to rebel
against them.
</P>
<P>
   His hope was that by then architects would ``learn to study not
merely minimum requirements, but maximum possibilities; to learn
not only how to economize space but how to be extravagant with it;
to study the overtones of architecture and the geometrical
discipline of space as space: to learn not only to use space but to
play with space.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, a rebellion did occur, but it did not proceed in the
direction Summerson had hoped. In America, at least, architects did
begin to play, but not with space. They were playing with images,
with decorative motifs, visual quotations drawn from pop culture or
the historical styles.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late 1980s, the post-Modernism dispensation, too, had
reached a state of crisis. Today, many architects are beginning to
realize something much closer to Summerson's vision.
</P>
<P>
   Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, Henry
Smith Miller and Laurie Hawkinson, among others, are producing work
that aims toward realizing the maximum possibilities of space.
</P>
<P>
   Holl's building is a first-rate example of this development. Too
bad it takes practically a space mission to get there.

 INDONESIAN DEBTORS ARE URGED TO SETTLE DEBTS OUT OF COURT 
</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ When the director of a small property
company here went in search of financing for a hotel he planned to
build in Central Java nearly four years ago, he found banks at home
and overseas lining up to give him money.
</P>
<P>
   The loan's grace period is now expiring and the owner, who asked
not to be named, says he is in no position to start making payments
on a multimillion-dollar loan that has ballooned beyond reach after
a 70 percent drop in the value of the Indonesian currency, the
rupiah, the last year and a sharp decline in the number of
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   While the situation may vary for the 2,000 Indonesian companies
that have racked up an estimated $67 billion in foreign corporate
debt, one factor holds true for them all: they cannot pay their
bills and the patience of their creditors is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   More than $32 billion of that amount is due in the next six
months, and domestic consumer markets for many products have dried
up. The International Monetary Fund, which arranged a $49 billion
bailout for Indonesia over the summer, has forecast a 15 percent
decline in gross domestic product this year, and some private
analysts are more pessimistic. Inflation is running at just under
80 percent, and unemployment is approaching 20 million people, a
fourth of the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not forget the human face of the crisis,'' Gerald Meyerman,
the head of the World Bank's Corporate Restructuring and Governance
Group, told 1,200 participants gathered for talks on restructuring
the massive private debt..
</P>
<P>
   The precipitous decline of Indonesia's economic fortunes has
driven most of the country's companies into technical bankruptcy
and created confusion and mistrust between debtors and their
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the debt is in the hands of the country's largest
conglomerates, but 600 smaller companies employing millions of
Indonesians are believed to have problematic overseas debt
obligations in the neighborhood of $15 million each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first reaction is usually denial, then acceptance and
later negotiation,'' said Victor Khosla of Cerebrus Capital
Management, among the 280 foreign creditors at the two-day Jakarta
Initiative conference that ended Tuesday. ``I think we may now be
entering the second stage,'' he said, citing lengthy experience
with similar situations in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank and the Indonesian government organized the
conference to encourage creditors and debtors to restructure their
debt obligations out of court and refrain, where possible, from
entering into costly bankruptcy proceedings, which are rare in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once debtors and creditors begin to explore the financial
middle ground between massive haircuts and bankruptcy, the process
of restructuring and recovery is able to proceed,'' said Kostas
Kalimtgis of the financial restructuring group Houlihan, Lokey,
Howard &AMP; Zukin.
</P>
<P>
   Debt write-downs, or haircuts, have been proposed by leading
Indonesian businessmen like Aburizal Bakrie of Bakrie &AMP; Bros., a
company carrying over $1.2 billion in debt, but have been
discouraged by the World Bank as a one-sided approach to debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the rupiah strengthening to levels not seen since
February, inflation slowing and signs that the worst of the crisis
may be over, skeptics warned that failing to tie the voluntary
initiative to some form of ``stick,'' like bankruptcy, would lead
to little more than talk as many companies try to buy time gambling
on further improvements in the exchange rate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Others are even less optimistic about the prospects for the
initiative, with one participant likening the conference to ``a
bunch of cheerleaders and players that have gotten onto the bus but
forgot to bring the ball.'' Finance Minister Bambang Subianto
called on companies to open their books to creditors, explaining
that ``without understanding the size of losses in companies there
will be no successful restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's largest automotive concern, PT Astra
International, did just that last month when it presented its
creditor banks with a restructuring plan but also announced that it
was halting payments on $1.4 billion of its estimated $2 billion
foreign debt until its plan is approved.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the debt is held by Japanese banks,
which include Sakura Bank, Sumitomo, Fuji Bank, Dai-ichi Kangyo
Bank and Marubeni. The creditors, which also include Chase
Manhattan and Societe Generale, are scheduled to meet with
officials of Astra on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other large conglomerates have begun debt restructuring talks
with international bondholders and Japanese, European and U.S.
banks, though only one little-known company has taken advantage of
the exchange rate insurance mechanism offered by the Indonesian
Debt Restructuring Agency, which was established in July at the
urging of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic and international creditors have also been wary of the
country's commercial court, where only 12 cases have been filed
since it was set up in August, and only two companies have been
declared bankrupt. Established by the administration of B.J.
Habibie, who ascended to the presidency after Suharto resigned on
May 21, amid widespread civil unrest, these institutions have yet
to take hold. &QL;

COURT QUESTIONS IOWA LAW ALLOWING POLICE TO SEARCH VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several Supreme Court justices on Tuesday
questioned an Iowa law that gives police the right to search the
vehicle of a person stopped for a traffic violation such as
speeding or not wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   The justices were examining the case of a plastics factory
worker named Patrick Knowles, who was stopped on March 9, 1996, for
going 43 mph in a 25-mph zone in Newton, Iowa. An officer gave him
a speeding ticket and then searched Knowles and the front-seat area
of his car.
</P>
<P>
   The search turned up marijuana and a pipe used for smoking the
drug. Knowles, 37, of Monroe, Iowa, was convicted of several
drug-related charges and sentenced to 90 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say a Supreme Court decision upholding the Iowa
statute would represent a substantial boost in police powers to
make searches of individuals and their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem an enormous amount of authority to put into the
hands of the police,'' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said during oral
arguments in the case Tuesday. ``We do have constitutional checks
because we're not always sure that the police will exercise good
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether the law permitted police
to use traffic violations as a way to stop and search the vehicle
of a person that police suspected of other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Assistant Attorney General Bridget A. Chambers, who spent
most of her time before the court fielding hostile questions,
answered that it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an abuse of authority,'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
responded. ``Stopping somebody on one pretext, say speeding, for
another real reason, to search the car, is an abuse of authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said there was no evidence that police were abusing
their power in that way.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Justice Antonin Scalia asked Chambers whether an officer
could stop people, arrest and search them, then drop the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   When she said yes, Scalia responded, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia also asked if police could search people for other minor
offenses, such as jaywalking or failing to curb their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tough out there in Iowa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the barrage of probing questions, Chambers insisted that
the law is needed to protect police in dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Determining whether it is reasonable to believe that a
particular suspect is likely to use a weapon or destroy evidence is
a difficult question of law, and it must be made quickly and in a
wide variety of circumstances,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted that other
laws already give police the authority to conduct a search to
protect their own safety.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding a need to preserve evidence, the chief justice added,
``When you have a traffic stop, you're not going to find any more
evidence of speeding when you search a person's car.''
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, Knowles argued that the search violated the
Constitution's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable
searches and seizures. But Iowa courts allowed the marijuana to be
used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to the Iowa Supreme Court earlier this year. That
court affirmed the conviction, saying the state statute allows
police to make an arrest or issue a citation for any traffic
violation. Either way, they can make an ``otherwise lawful
search,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Knowles' lawyer, Paul Rosenberg, told the U.S.
Supreme Court that the Iowa law was unfair because police had used
the statute selectively. He pointed out that about 400,000 people
are given traffic tickets each year in Iowa but that police search
relatively few cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody issued a traffic ticket was searched, the
legislature would change the law tomorrow because the people
wouldn't stand for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to rule on the case by July.

Stories from Rwanda 
By Philip Gourevitch. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 355 pp. $25. 
 
 
WAR CRIMES 
Brutality, Genocide, Terror, and the Struggle for Justice 
By Aryeh Neier. Times Books. 
286 pp. Illustrated. $25. 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a scene in John Hersey's classic, ``Hiroshima,'' where
dazed and traumatized people are wandering away from the ruined
city. They cannot comprehend or articulate what has happened to
them, and when an aid worker asks one man where he is from, he
points to the ruined city and says vaguely, ``There.'' Asked where
he is going, he points the other way and says, ``There.''
</P>
<P>
   Something of that vacant feeling, that sense of overwhelmed
emptiness, may affect readers of Philip Gourevitch's extraordinary
book about the Rwanda genocide of spring 1994. It is absolutely
revealing in its detailed accounting of the nationwide massacre --
the social and political background, who did what to whom, the
aftermath -- yet as with all such events, the horror is outside the
pale of comprehension or articulation, in the darkness beyond the
communal campfires.
</P>
<P>
   Gourevitch, a staff writer for the New Yorker, was not in Rwanda
in the hundred days of April-July 1994, when at least 800,000
people were shot, bludgeoned, or hacked to death. He first went
there a year later. But his research, visits to killing sites, and
interviews with survivors and perpetrators yield something close to
an eyewitness account.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, as in Yugoslavia, we imagine the genocide to be a
tribal affair: Hutus killing Tutsis out of ancient animosity. But
those are not distinct tribes, only artificial social and racial
groupings encouraged by the Belgian colonizers. Originally the
Tutsis were herdsmen, while the Hutus were farmers, with lower
status. In recent times the two groups freely intermarried and in
many cases are impossible to tell apart. Yet the status
distinctions remained, and the Belgian colonial government kept the
Tutsi elite in charge. A Hutu-led coup in 1960 overthrew the
established order, after which those Tutsis who did not go into
exile became an uneasy minority treated with suspicion -- and
occasional pogroms. ``Killing Tutsis was a political tradition in
postcolonial Rwanda,'' Gourevitch writes; ``it brought people
together.''
</P>
<P>
   With a Hutu-dominated government firmly in charge, the Belgians
left in 1962. General Juvenal Habyarimana, a pogrom leader under
his predecessor, took power in 1973, vowing peace and harmony. His
wife, a Lady Macbeth named Agathe Kanzinga, came to be seen as a
power behind the throne. Around her a Hutu clique arose that fanned
an ideology called Hutu Power. Hutu Power regarded Hutus and Tutsis
roughly as National Socialism regarded Aryans and Jews: The latter
must be eliminated if the former is to survive. By spring 1994 the
hatemongers of Hutu Power had drummed into the people the idea
that, as one put it in a speech two years earlier, ``We the people
are obliged to take responsibility ourselves and wipe out this
scum.'' When Habyarimana was killed in a plane crash on April 6,
1994 (possibly by his own party), the orders were given, and the
slaughter began.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the massacre are horrifying and by now familiar:
Most of it was carried out by machete, at crossroads, in homes, and
in churches or hospitals where Tutsis had fled for safety. Fields
and streams and wells were filled with bodies. It was like the
scenes of Jonestown magnified more than a thousandfold. As shocking
as the deeds are the range and numbers of people who participated:
People killed their in-laws, doctors killed their patients, church
leaders killed parishioners. The killers included mayors,
schoolteachers, policemen. It seems a psychosis overcame the
people.
</P>
<P>
   There was a carefully prepared universal draft. Gourevitch
writes, ``Rwanda's Hutu Power leaders understood this perfectly. .
. . The people were the weapon, and that meant everybody: the
entire Hutu population had to kill the entire Tutsi population. . .
. If everybody is implicated, then implication becomes
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   How could this have happened? Rwanda was by no means the poorest
of African countries; it had many educated and accomplished people.
Gourevitch hints at an answer that may make us feel better about
our fragmented, atomized society: a pervasive conformity at the
roots of Rwandan culture, which is necessary for survival, and
often admirable, but chilling when turned to diabolical ends. If a
neighbor is threatened and cries for help, one Rwandan explains to
Gourevitch, ``There is responsibility. I cry, you cry. You cry, I
cry. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We all come running, and the one who stays quiet, that one that
stays home, must explain. Is he in league with the criminals? . . .
This is community.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing was more or less ended only when the Tutsi-led
Rwanda Patriotic Front army rolled across the country and drove the
Hutu Power into camps in neighboring Zaire and Tanzania. When in
1996 those camps were forcibly closed, 600,000 Hutus returned home
with the promise that there would be no full-scale retribution.
Some Hutu Power leaders were tried and punished, and others
remained in exile, but many smaller-scale killers returned to their
home communities to face the stares of their victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   How is such a return possible? How can any sort of social
cohesion develop after such events? The new government passed a law
that provided for lesser sentences, even forgiveness, for
lower-level perpetrators who confessed -- much like South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The new government took the
position that reeducation of the followers was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't necessarily just go for everyone you might think you
should go for,'' said Paul Kagame, one of the new leaders. ``Maybe
you create an atmosphere where things are stabilized first, then
you go for those you must go for. Others you can even ignore for
the sake of gradually leading a kind of peaceful coexistence. . . .
And I think some people can even benefit from being forgiven, being
given another chance.'' This idea is appealing and also unsettling;
we are seeing it, or have seen it, in many places in the world. Not
only in South Africa, where thugs and killers under the apartheid
regime have received amnesty if they came forward and confessed
before the commission, but also in Israel, Northern Ireland, and
Argentina. In all these places, people have taken the bitter
medicine of sitting down and trying to find a way to live with, or
at least tolerate the existence of, those whom they knew had
committed or given support to outrages.
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Neiser's wide-ranging and cogent book, ``War Crimes,''
reviews all these historical cases, as well as the denazification
program in occupied Germany, and finds that in every case there
were compromises, that perfect justice, as we might envision it in
ordinary criminal cases, is almost never possible. In Germany, many
low-level bureaucrats and officials under the Nazi regime,
including many judges, were eventually given a clean slate and took
up their places in building the ``German Miracle,'' which was
needed to resist Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Neier, formerly executive director of Human Rights Watch, is
restless over too-easy forgiveness, and argues strongly for
creation of an international court of justice. He believes the plan
for such a body, under the United Nations, will be realized by the
end of the century if the great powers support it. But he is under
no illusions that in the case of crimes on a vast scale, such as
those in Bosnia, Argentina, or Rwanda, many of those who helped
implement the evils would be prosecuted. He writes, ``the
overwhelming majority of those who conspired to commit crimes
against humanity (by definition, crimes on a great scale) or
knowingly aided in their commission cannot be prosecuted. . . . the
fact that others who abetted the commission of great crimes will go
free makes them innocent only in the formal sense that they have
not been preven guilty in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   For the latter, the obloquy of their neighbors may be enough
retribution for both sides, as long as the survivors are given the
truth, consolation, and concrete help. ``Let's say we have a
hundred thousand young people who have lost their families and have
no hope, no future,'' says one Rwandan leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a country like this if you tell them, `Go and kill your
neighbor because he killed your father and seven brothers and
sister,' they'll take the machete and do it. . . . It will require
a lot to make sure that these people can come back to society and
look at the future and say, `Yes, let's try.' `` But no government
policy, no measure of either punishment or forgiveness, could
readily heal the spirit of those who witnessed the butchery of
their families. When he experienced the truth of the Rwandan
genocide, saw the stacks of bodies left in the Nyarabuye church as
a reminder, like Auschwitz, of the genocide, Philip Gourevitch was
reminded of Conrad's character Marlow at the end of ``Heart of
Darkness,'' back home in Europe being nursed by his aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not my strength that needed nursing,'' Marlow says,
``It was my imagination that wanted soothing.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THEY are eight games into a schedule that has been about as
difficult a test as trying to the read the top line on an eye
chart.
</P>
<P>
   And what we know about the Cowboys is they can at least squint
and make out the big ``E'' when it's staring them in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through his first season as head coach, Chan Gailey is
still feeling his way along. He has introduced new offensive sets _
i.e., five wide receivers _ and is trying to find a way to get
Chris Warren into the regular mix at running back.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have an offensive line that, while not back to
dominating, is at least doing the job. A rejuvenated Emmitt Smith
has run for 709 yards and showed with that fourth-quarter burst
into the end zone Monday night that he still can make those slick
moves.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin finally came off the missing-in-action list by
catching his first TD pass of the season. Troy Aikman came off the
shelf and, though skittish in the pocket, showed few ill throwing
effects from that broken collarbone.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Leon Lett appears in the best shape of the past
couple of years, pursuing the football all over the field. And
Deion Sanders, when he's not taking punts all the way to the end
zone as a Most Valuable Player candidate, blankets his portion of
the secondary even as Kevin Smith and Omar Stoutmire are
victimized.
</P>
<P>
   All of which adds up to one thing: Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably depends on who you ask, to be honest,'' Aikman
said. ``Personally, I think it would be a little out of place for
me or anybody else in our locker room to be talking about the Super
Bowl when last year we went 6-10 and didn't make the playoffs. I
think that might be a little presumptuous on all of our parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumptuous. Strange. Shocking, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But why not Dallas? Somebody has to represent the dog-ugly NFC
in Miami, and the Cowboys get a leg up on the competition with a
chance to fatten up like hungry vultures on the carrion that is the
NFC East. They have been through each of their divisional foes once
over the first half of the season and have devoured them for four
wins to pad their 5-3 record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the second half of this cupcake schedule brings the Giants,
Redskins and Eagles to Texas Stadium with only a trip to the
Arizona desert presenting the slightest challenge to an 8-0 run of
the division table. After all these years of playing in the NFL's
most rugged neighborhood, the Cowboys _ even at less than optimum _
finally are benefiting from living on the kind of pushover block
that has kept the 49ers near the top of the heap for most of the
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, examine the rest of the schedule, where the Thanksgiving
Day meeting with the Vikings (7-1) is the Cowboys' only game
against a team with a record above .500. Kansas City, Seattle and
New Orleans are 4-4, and each has its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that as things stand _ having survived their
five-game stretch when Jason Garrett filled in for the injured
Aikman _ the Cowboys have virtually wrapped up the NFC East title
and are just one game behind the 49ers (6-2) in the race for
securing a first-round playoff bye and a second-round home game.
</P>
<P>
   But if all they accomplish between now and January is to take
the NFC East, it would send Dallas _ as the third-best division
winner _ into the wild-card round of the playoffs with the
home-field advantage, where they certainly could win that game.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of argument, say it sends the Cowboys into a
second-round date at Minnesota. Is that really an impossible
situation? Will the reborn Randall Cunningham still be hotter than
a blowtorch by January? Will there be a real quarterback
controversy with Brad Johnson by then? Will Dennis Green, as usual,
eventually find a way to screw up this team?
</P>
<P>
   Could the Cowboys _ with a healthy Aikman, Irvin and Smith, with
Deion cutting a rug on special teams, with Gailey calling the shots
instead of Barry Switzer _ win one meaningful road game? Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Under that same scenario, Green Bay would enter the playoffs as
a wild-card team, weaker than in the recent past but dangerous with
Brett Favre in control. Could the Packers go into San Francisco and
beat the 49ers? Why not? They always do.
</P>
<P>
   Which would bring the Cheeseheads and the NFC Championship Game
to Texas Stadium, and we know how that story turns out every time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys in the Super Bowl. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Just don't ask me how they'll beat the Broncos. We're talking
long shots here, not miracles.

   ROME _ The former wife of Maurizio Gucci, heir to the leather
goods fortune, was convicted on Tuesday of ordering his murder and
sentenced to 29 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The co-conspirators with Gucci's former wife, Patrizia Reggiani,
were also convicted by a jury in Milan. The hit man who shot Gucci
in 1995 was given a life sentence. Mrs. Reggiani's personal
psychic, Guiseppina Auriemma, who first contacted the killers, was
given 25 years. Two other accomplices also got heavy sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidently, they didn't believe me,'' a stricken Mrs. Reggiani,
50, said moments after her verdict was read out. As guards began
escorting her back to her cell, she muttered, ``Truth is the
daughter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was eagerly awaited in a country that followed the
Gucci trial, as it became known when it opened last May, as the
ultimate real-life soap opera. The case brought together some of
the country's favorite obsessions: sex, money, designer footwear
and astrology. Mrs. Reggiani's personal psychic admitted that she
hired the killers, but insisted that she did so at her client's
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mrs. Reggiani said that while she had loudly
broadcast her desire to see her ex-husband dead, she did not
actually carry out her threats. Mrs. Auriemma, they argued, acted
on her own, then blackmailed Mrs. Reggiani. Mrs. Reggiani said in a
cross-examination that she was forced to pay $365,000, then added,
somewhat confusingly: ``It was worth every penny.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her chief lawyers, Giovanni Maria Dedola, said on
Tuesday: ``I guess the jurors were not susceptible to our
arguments.'' Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, the most
severe punishment in Italy, which does not have a death penalty.
Mrs. Reggiani is scheduled to remain in prison, but her lawyers say
they will ask that she be placed under house arrest pending an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reggiani's friends were stunned by the 29-year-sentence.
``I think that is an extremely heavy sentence considering that
child murderers get even less,'' said Jennifer Gucci, the former
wife of Paolo Gucci, a cousin of the murder victim. ``I would have
thought they would take her brain injury into consideration.'' Mrs.
Reggiani had surgery for a brain tumor in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, hours before the verdict was reached, Mrs. Reggiani
made her final plea of innocence, saying she was a naive victim of
her astrologer's greed. ``Never let even a friendly fox into the
chicken coop,'' she told the jurors, referring to Mrs. Auriemma.
``Sooner or later it could get hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Before her divorce from Gucci, Mrs. Reggiani was one of the more
extravagant members of the Italian jet set. She was famous for
having once said, ``I would rather weep in a Rolls-Royce than be
happy on a bicycle.'' Mrs. Reggiani continued to be outspoken even
after her husband was shot outside his Milan office in 1995,
telling friends and even reporters that she had wanted him dead.
After she was arrested in 1997, the Italian newspapers quickly
dubbed her the Black Widow.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reggiani's lawyers argued that Mrs. Reggiani's threats were
the ramblings of a mentally disturbed woman, maintaining that her
physical illness took away her critical faculties. But their hopes
that a judge would rule her unfit for trial were dashed a few weeks
ago when a psychiatric panel concluded that Mrs. Reggiani was
mentally competent at the time of the murder and well enough to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for the first time, her two daughters, Alessandra, 21
and Allegra, 17, sat near her in court, weeping and kissing their
mother. Mrs. Reggiani's mother, Silvana Barbieri, who is being
investigated on charges of having known about the murder plot, also
sat in court.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci family members did not put in an appearance. Maurizio
Gucci, who inherited half of the family business after his father
died in 1983 and fought and exchanged lawsuits with his relatives,
was not deeply mourned. He spent his own and his company's income
so freely that after repeated losses he was forced to sell his
shares to a Bahrain-based investment group, Investcorp, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   When Gucci was killed, he was living with his mistress, Paola
Franchi, an interior designer, and trying to re-establish himself
as a businessman by, among other things, investing in a casino in
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the police thought that his murder was linked either
to Gucci family feuds or his new-found casino ties. Finally, an
anonymous tip led police to a hotel porter, Ivano Savioni, who had
been contacted by Mrs. Auriemma and who helped her hire the gunman,
Benedetto Ceraulo, as well the driver of the getaway car, Orazio
Cicala. Savioni was given a 26-year sentence on Tuesday. Cicala was
given a 29-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence prosecutors presented in court was Mrs.
Reggiani's diary. In it she wrote: ``There is no crime that money
cannot buy.'' On the day Gucci was shot, there was a single word
entry: ``Paradeisos,'' the Greek word for ``paradise.''

FAIR TRICKSTER TURNS LOOKERS INTO GOLD

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - At the far end of the dusty tent, past the shrunken
heads, past the goatsucker monstrosity, past Julius Squeezer, the
albino python, sat the most interesting thing the International
Circus Sideshow Museum and Gallery has to offer: Bobby Reynolds,
the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I tell you, kid?'' Reynolds, who brought his
traveling museum to the Arizona State Fair, began in an old-time
New York accent, before I'd even pulled the cap off my pen. ``It
all started a long time ago, when my mother left me at a sideshow.
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Nah. That's not really how it all started. Turns out Reynolds'
stories are like his sideshow _ not everything is genuine, but as
long you're entertained, who cares about the details?
</P>
<P>
   Although his real story is as good as anything he could make up.
Reynolds, 68, started out as a shoeshine boy, but his heart was in
magic (he once shined Harry Blackstone's shoes). So at the age of
13, he found himself billed as the World's Youngest Magician in a
New York sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked as a talker, the guy out front who entices the
crowd inside with a steady stream of melodious malarkey. Without
prodding, Reynolds launched into a word-for-word rendition of his
spiel for Professor Heckler's Traveling Flea Circus _ the same
spiel he was spouting at 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't remember something I did yesterday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds learned all the sideshow tricks _ sword swallowing,
fire eating, lying on a bed of nails, hammering a nail up his nose,
the usual. He also kept talking out front, bringing people into the
shows. Eventually he owned his own. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ultimate talk &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk suits him. An accomplished magician, his best trick is his
non-stop patter. Tapes of his work (which has been cataloged by the
Smithsonian Institution) play all day and night at the fair. He's
worked with a man who had three legs, 16 toes and four feet, and a
woman with a second person growing out of her stomach. Yet he
doesn't hesitate when asked if there is one ultimate attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ultimate draw is the guy who gets out there and talks
on it,'' he said. ``I could sell anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt it. As he showed me a genuine shrunken human head
(not to be confused with the fake one next to it in the display), a
hesitant kid approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch it,'' Reynolds said, holding out the fist-size head.
``It's good luck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' the kid replied. And then: ``Are you serious?''
</P>
<P>
   Aha, a flash of curiosity. Reynolds had him hooked. Seconds
later, the kid ever-so-gently brushed a finger against the head.
This guy (begin ital) could (end ital) sell anything.
</P>
<P>
   I've always been of two minds about sideshows. When I see the
canvas out front painted with depictions of the fat lady and the
dog-faced man, I'm intensely curious. But I'm also a little
hesitant, a little afraid. (begin ital) What if this stuff really
is real? (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Then, if I find out the Siamese calf is actually stuffed, I'm
disappointed, but also relieved. That's the attraction of the
sideshow, why I pay $1 to peer behind the curtain. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Wink and nod' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole carnival's a wink and a nod,'' Reynolds said.
``Throw 45 darts and win a big teddy bear _ that's (expletive)
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The general rule is, don't ask too many questions. Don't worry
about what's real and what isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public loves this type of show,'' he said. Sure enough,
the small crowd was gasping, laughing and pointing at the
jack-o-lope and the pictures of Henry, Reynolds' late, lamented
tattooed dog. ``Even if it isn't (real), you want to see if it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has a ranch in Fillmore, Calif., but he doesn't see
himself retiring. Who would he talk to? He never stops. We ended
the interview because he had to meet someone who found his dog,
which had run away from the sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a headline for you,'' Reynolds shouted as I walked
away. ``Dog runs away from circus and joins a home!''
</P>
<P>
   Ha. Not bad, Bobby. Not bad at all. &QL;

   Holding elections early in November is good practice for what

things that are sort of impolitic.'' Bad idea. Look how much
trouble he's in for saying an impolitic ``yes'' to Monica Lewinsky.

   John Glenn, it's reported, voted absentee before heading into
space. Usually it's not voters but some of the winners who, after
the vote, lose touch with gravity.

   Glenn reports he's had no dreams or nightmares while asleep in
space. And probably darn few trick-or-treaters, too.

   This is odd. Investors are happy because the stock market is

EXPLORING THE FINAL FRONTIER

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - My 77-year-old father went off exploring the same day
77-year-old John Glenn was launched into outer space. He's done
crazy things like this before. My father, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, he's been on one adventure after
another, always to some unknown territory, some place filled with
so much danger and uncertainty that younger, stronger, supposedly
braver men avoid it at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   He goes off on these trips as he went off to war _ as John Glenn
went off to war _ not out of wanderlust, but because circumstance
leaves him no choice.
</P>
<P>
   It was like that last week.
</P>
<P>
   While Glenn took the elevator to the cockpit of the space
shuttle Discovery, my father headed to the basement of his home
outside of Pittsburgh. He'd played golf the day before, as he does
every Wednesday, and was feeling a little tired. Still, the day had
its duties, from which he's never wavered.
</P>
<P>
   At the foot of the stairs, he felt a sharp pain in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   The newest adventure began.
</P>
<P>
   The author Malcolm Cowley described my father's situation in a
book called ``The View From 80.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To enter the country of age is a new experience,'' Cowley
said. ``different from what you supposed it to be. Nobody, man or
woman, knows the country until he has lived in it and has taken out
his citizenship papers.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A darker border &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I would have preferred that my father take a little more time
between exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time he and my mother crossed a dark border
into cancer territory. This was completely new terrain for Dora,
who'd never been sick as a young woman. She'd followed others into
the land of disease, but only to support them as they struggled
through.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she was forced to lead the way, my father trailing
along behind. It was a long and difficult trip over rugged terrain.
She didn't make it out.
</P>
<P>
   The journey was rough on my dad, too. For the first time in more
than 50 years, he was left without a traveling companion.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's off again.
</P>
<P>
   For several days he had as many wires and tubes connected to him
as Glenn did in outer space.
</P>
<P>
   To a son in Phoenix, he seemed to be as far away.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy, John Glenn was one of my heroes. We were told
as much in grade school by nuns who cut out photographs of the
astronauts from ``Life'' magazine and taped them to the blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't know at the time that Glenn was in World War II, like
my dad, or that he and his wife had two kids, like my parents.
</P>
<P>
   And I didn't know that age, like war, has a way of producing
whole generations of heroes.
</P>
<P>
   But it does. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel's limits &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Glenn has it better off going into space than the average
man does checking into the hospital. The senator was better off
long before his shuttle mission, too. There's no more comprehensive
health care plan than the one members of Congress gave to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A former steelworker's coverage isn't bad, but has many limits.
That's how it is for most older people.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Cowley said, ``Although we are all in the same boat,
with tickets for the same destination, we do not enjoy the same
comforts during the voyage. The boat turns out to be an
old-fashioned liner with first-, second-, and third-class
accommodations, not to mention a crowded steerage.''
</P>
<P>
   My father's parents traveled in steerage to get to America. They
never complained. He doesn't complain, either. He goes where the
adventure takes him. So do most people his age, displaying a type
of courage that isn't showy, a kind of heroism so widespread it's
taken for granted. Though it shouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to visit space on a multibillion-dollar shuttle
with a computerized flight plan. It's another thing to be out there
on your own, not knowing exactly where you're headed or when you'll
get back. Or if you'll burn up on re-entry. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, Nov. 8,
1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   FEATURE Stories
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-RADIO-ISAY (Undated) _ A look at David Isay and his
public radio documentaries, which appers frequently on `'All Things
Considered,'' including ``Stonewall Remembered'' and ``Ghetto Life
101.'' By Samuel G. Freedman.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   DOYLE-FILMS (Hollywood) _ An interview with Christopher Doyle,
46, the Australian-born cinematographer whose collaboration with
directors like Wong Kar-Wai has won him a legion of fans in Asia
and who is working on his first American film, Gus Van Sant's
remake of ``Psycho.'' By David Hay.
</P>
<P>
   VELVET-GOLDMINE-FILM (Undated) _ Anyone who watches ``Velvet
Goldmine,'' Todd Haynes' extravagant, silver-spangled, $7 million
valentine to glam rock, is bound to wonder if the filmmaker was
himself once a glitter-crazed teen-age rebel who hennaed his hair,
experimented with cross-dressing, and pranced around in six-inch
platform shoes. The answer is no. ``Velvet Goldmine,'' which is set
mostly in London in the early 1970s, follows the rise, fall and
mysterious disappearance of Brian Slade, a David Bowie-like
superstar whose stage alter-ego, Maxwell Demon, bears striking
similarities to Bowie's most notorious invention, that
flame-haired, extraterrestrial androgyne Ziggy Stardust. By Stephen
Holden.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   CITY-CENTER-DANCE (New York) _ City Center used to be a place
where, as one critic complained, a cloud of dust rose when Tosca
stamped her foot. The neo-Moorish fantasy on West 55th Street had
begun its second life in 1943 as a ``people's theater,'' where the
performing arts could be enjoyed for a mere $5.95 an orchestra
seat, a price raised only in 1968. The former Shriners' temple soon
became known as a lovably dowdy home for the arts, where
generations of audiences grew up watching all-American companies
like the New York City Opera, New York City Ballet and the Joffrey
Ballet grow with them. By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   PUBLIC-THEATER-DANCE (Undated) _ George C. Wolfe, the music
director of the Public Theater, has hired a new choreographer.
Keith Young, 45, a choreographer from Los Angeles and a total
stranger to the Great White Way. What drew Young was the chance to
work on Broadway with Wolfe, whom he considers to be the top man in
American theater. He also liked the show in current production ``On
the Town'' from 1944. By Valerie Gladstone.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews Kennth
Lonergan's ``This Is Our Youth''; Hilary Bell's ``Wolf Lullaby''
and John Henry Redwood's ``The Old Settler.''
</P>
<P>
   TOP-BRITISH-ACTRESS (London) _ Who is the greatest living
British actress? Maybe the question is silly, since it makes an
infinitely demanding art sound like a steeplechase for mature
fillies, and maybe it is meaningless. After all, it is not exactly
easy to measure Maggie Smith, with her droll wit and sly timing,
against Diana Rigg, who is currently giving a fierce, febrile
performance as Racine's Phedre in the West End. Or Dame Maggie
against Vanessa Redgrave, who, sadly, seldom brings that wonderful
emotional clarity of hers to the stage these days, or Dame Diana
against Helen Mirren, of whom more in a moment. But if I were to
nominate a woman for top spot at the theater's top table today, it
would be Judi Dench. By Benedict Nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   ANNA-KARENINA-THEATER (London) _ The stripped-down version of
Leo Tolstoy's ``Anna Karenina,'' arriving on Wednesday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, is a production by
Shared Experience _ another London theater company that makes
imaginative use of relatively few props. But this is no simple
exercise in minimalist theater. For more than two decades, the
touring troupe has put the actor at the center of the event,
enhanced by only as much set design as is needed to release the
affective heart of the story. By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MUTATIONS-ALBUM (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Beck sees dead ends
everywhere on his new album, ``Mutations.'' Creativity and culture
are played out, love has faded away. There aren't even any new
jokes to be told. ``Who wants to be there to sweep the debris, to
harness dead horses?'' he sings. Well, for the length of the album,
it seems that Beck does. He contemplates entropy and decay with his
most lucid and unguarded songs, as he renounces his old studio
tomfoolery. Some of the songs could be about long-lost love, but
nearly all of them also read as impressions of a time when the only
certainty is a free-floating sense of loss. By Jon Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   WHITNEY-MUSEUM-MAXWELL (New York) _ Maxwell Anderson, the new
director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. At 42, he is poised
and polished, with slicked-back hair and a rich, gravelly voice.
His arrival at the Whitney has prompted speculation that New York's
most trendy museum has decided to atone and go conservative,
entrusting its future to a seeming traditionalist, a man who's the
grandson of the celebrated playwright Maxwell Anderson and who
received his academic training in, of all things, Greek and Roman
art. By Deborah Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   KIASMA-MUSEUM-ARCH (Undated) _ I recently went to Finland to see
Kiasma, Helsinki's new museum of contemporary art. The building,
which opened in May, was designed by Steven Holl, one of New York's
most gifted architects. It shouldn't be necessary for a New Yorker
to endure jet lag to check out one of his buildings. Fortunately,
Helsinki's new museum is worth the trip, in part because it is
informed by an awareness of the twists and surprises of
contemporary life, the unexpected departures from plans, the vast
tracts of unknown experience that reside even in a built-up,
shrinking world. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   BECKER-TV (Undated) _ ``You know who I want to meet?'' the good
doctor asks. ``The sick, twisted little bean counter who came up
with the health maintenance organization.'' As a prickly but
secretly noble physician who spouts outrageous truths, Ted Danson's
John Becker is no more believable than the saintly Marcus Welby
was. But here, in a promotional spot for the new CBS sitcom
``Becker,'' he sounds oddly realistic, echoing opinions heard more
and more often, on and off television. By Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   MAORI-WARRIOR-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The near-life-size wood
carving of a Maori warrior exudes raw power. The eyes, made of
shells, gleam white with seeming rage against the tatooed face, and
the large, claw-like hands and the short, thick, muscular legs
project brute strength. The figure depicts an ancestor of a Maori
chief and symbolizes the pride of a tribe. The figure originally
served as the base of the central post of a mid-19th century
meeting house on the eastern coast of New Zealand. It will be sold
at Sotheby's on Nov. 22, and the auction house expects it will
bring between $1 million and $1.5 million, 10 times what its owner
paid in 1978. By Rita Reif.

<P>
   When it comes to pasta shapes, there is always room for
innovation. ``Producers keep coming up with new cuts,'' said Ronald
Cardoos, a broker for Gourmet America, a company in Hingham, Mass.,
that is importing one of the most alluring ones.
</P>
<P>
   Called foglie d'oliva, the spinach pasta is in the shape of
olive leaves. The mold for them was made by pressing real olive
leaves in bronze, Cardoos said. Castellana, a small, family-owned
company in Bari, on Italy's heel, produces the leaf pasta and also
makes it in a mixture of seven colors (made with tomato, turmeric
and other natural ingredients), calling it foglie d'autunno, autumn
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The pastas are $4.99 for a 17.6-ounce bag at Garden of Eden, 162
W. 23rd St., and 314 Third Ave. (23rd Street); $3.59 a bag at
Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Ave. (71st Street); $5.99 at the
Tuscany Fine Food Market, 729 W. Jericho Turnpike, Huntington,
N.Y.; $6.95 at the Red Horse Market, Montauk Highway, East Hampton,
N.Y.; and $4.99 at Kings Super Markets in New Jersey.

   Aquavit to Go
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aquavit, the Scandinavian restaurant at 13 W. 54th
St., has introduced a sleekly packaged line of prepared
Scandinavian foods. Sweetness and smoke infuse the fine smoked
salmon, and there is a silken-textured gravlax ($25 for one pound
of either). Tart lingonberry preserves can complement game meats or
pates ($8 for eight ounces); crisp ginger-citrus cookies are almost
candylike ($18 for one pound); and the marinated herring is
excellent ($8 for 12 ounces). But the herring in dill cream ($8 for
12 ounces) is exceedingly salty.
</P>
<P>
   The products are sold at the restaurant, individually or in
gift-basket assortments, and can be ordered for shipping (plus
delivery charges) by calling (888) 650-9500. The gift baskets are
also sold at Chelsea Market Baskets, in the Chelsea Market, 75
Ninth Ave. (15th Street).

<P>
   D'Artagnan, the company that specializes in foie gras and game,

the land of the Three Musketeers, to complement its products.
</P>
<P>
   A late harvest white wine, Gros Manseng, offers good acidity to
balance its sweetness, making it a fine aperitif with rich
foie-gras mousses or pates. It is $6.99 for a half-bottle. There is
also a light, pleasant White Gascony and a rustic Red Gascony,
$6.99 each a bottle. The wines are sold at Morrell &AMP; Co., 535
Madison Ave. (54th Street); Washington Square Wines, 545 La Guardia
Place (West 3rd Street); Paley Wines and Spirits, 88 Seventh Ave.,
Park Slope, Brooklyn; and Bliwise Liquors, 1267 Route 22,

COMMENTARY: A TALE OF TWO CHURCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you walk into the Gothic shade of Grace
Cathedral, at the top of Nob Hill here, you will find the last work
created by Keith Haring as he was dying of AIDS, at age 31 in 1990.
It's one of his typical gyrating graffiti cartoons _ and yet far
more muted. Cast in bronze and drained of color, it is a triptych
telling the story of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The piece serves as the altar for a permanent chapel
memorializing those who died of the same disease that killed the
artist. Though Grace Cathedral is an establishment Episcopalian
church far removed from the gay Castro district in altitude and
sensibility, it was hardly immune to the epidemic's ravages in this
city. At least 200 members of its congregation and three of its
priests were killed by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   My host at Grace was the Rev. Anthony Turney, who, as the former
head of the Names Project, supervised the mammoth unfurling of the
AIDS Memorial Quilt on the Washington Mall in 1996. One of its
panels memorializes his own partner, who died in 1991. But he sees
hope in the treatments that have finally slowed the nonstop grief
that he and other gay men began experiencing almost two decades
ago. The national AIDS death rate fell 46 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that Turney is at peace. He laments the
widespread misconceptions _ even among some young or complacent gay
men _ that AIDS has been ``cured'' or that a vaccine is imminent or
that a morning-after magic bullet can undo the infection.
</P>
<P>
   And he worries as well about those who are now at the epicenter
of the disease: the poor who can't afford or access treatment, the
African-American population that accounts for more than half of new
HIV cases, and the vast areas of Asia and especially Africa where
AIDS is reaching pandemic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward, he asks rhetorically: ``Will the predominantly
white gay community in places like San Francisco confront the
obligation to see to the welfare of a population that is not as
fortunate as it is?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a big, tough question that reaches far beyond San
Francisco. And by simply walking straight down Nob Hill to the
Tenderloin, you can literally see the cultural gap that must be
bridged.
</P>
<P>
   Amidst flophouses and drug dens stands the Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church, a fabled center for social services for San
Francisco's dispossessed and a new ground zero for the city's AIDS
crisis. Its infected constituents _ often homeless, drug-addicted
and mentally ill _ are about as far removed from the gay white male
middle class as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   But here you can find the beginning, at least, of an answer to
Turney's question: a collaboration between Glide and Project
Inform, the leading national organization devoted to disseminating
up-to-the-minute AIDS medical information.
</P>
<P>
   Though started by gay white men in 1985, Project Inform has
steadily expanded its demographics in race, class and gender; under
a new pilot program, it now helps train AIDS counselors at the
grass-roots level here and elsewhere in the San Francisco area.
Some of the Glide counselors are recruited from the homeless
population itself and are especially effective at steering other
street people to HIV tests, treatment and related welfare services.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we get to those for whom poverty is the central issue,
not AIDS?'' is how Martin Delaney, Project Inform's co-founder,
defines his latest task. He has held town meetings about testing
and treatment everywhere from fishing villages in Alaska to
churches in Harlem, always in collaboration with local leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some gay survivors of Delaney's boomer age are understandably
too burned out to join him. ``This is harder work than we did 10
years ago, coming at a time when the government and everyone else
thinks the work is over,'' he says. ``But we should not walk away
now that AIDS is passing into another community. It's part of our
heritage as gay men.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Project Inform works hand-in-hand with neighborhood
professionals like Glide's HIV/AIDS program director, Sharyn
Grayson. A tall, seemingly tireless black woman, she doesn't wear
the red ribbon of mourning that marked the generation of AIDS
warriors that came before but instead sports a big button reading
``We Can Do Anything.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ When Christopher Doyle shows up to shoot a film, the
director had better not expect ``coverage,'' the standard Hollywood
practice of capturing the action from every possible angle. ``
`Coverage' is a horrible word,'' said Doyle late one recent
Saturday night. ``It means you're not sure what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Uncertainty is not this man's style. Nor are visual cliches.
Doyle, 46, an Australian-born cinematographer whose collaboration
with directors like Wong Kar-Wai has won him a legion of fans in
Asia, had just arrived from the set of his first American film, Gus
Van Sant's remake of ``Psycho,'' for an interview at the house of a
friend, the director Phillip Noyce. ``For a non-American to come to
America,'' he said, ``that's the biggest shock: the cliches are
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle was smartly dressed in a gray shirt and trousers designed
by Yoshji Yamamoto. Threads of material, however, fell from the
bottoms of the trousers. ``They were too long, so I took a pair of
scissors to them,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Bursting with manic energy _ ``Sleep? What's that?'' _ Doyle was
due back on the ``Pyscho'' set at 6 a.m. for the final day of
re-shoots. Later that day, Doyle would catch the red-eye to
Baltimore, where he is photographing ``Liberty Heights'' for Barry
Levinson.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle has only one regret when it comes to his schedule: ``I
don't have enough time to go to parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle has filmed more than 20 movies since his debut in 1983
with ``That Day on the Beach,'' a Taiwanese production directed by
Edward Yang. But until he met with Van Sant late one night in a
Hong Kong bar, Doyle had refused all offers to come to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine myself doing a `Jurassic Park' or a Tony
Scott film, no matter how visual they wanted them to be, because I
didn't know the system here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle felt comfortable with Van Sant. ``In Gus' films you can
see his personality,'' said Doyle. ``I thought, `This seems like a
good person to be with.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his cinematography, which has made him much in demand,
Doyle has created still photographs, collages, art installations
and videos. This month, much of the work that made him famous in
Asia will be on display in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Two local art galleries are together presenting ``Christopher
Doyle: Image Wrangler,'' a major survey of his work beyond film.
And on Saturday, the University of California at Los Angeles Film
and Television Archive begins an eight-feature film retrospective
titled ``Days of Being Doyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Doyle has worked throughout Asia _ in 1995 he
photographed ``Temptress Moon'' for the Chinese director Chen Kaige
_ it is his collaboration with Hong Kong-based Wong Kar-Wai, that
established his reputation. He began working with this director in
1990 on ``Days of Being Wild.'' The film was a romantic evocation
of Hong Kong in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Doyle has photographed ``Ashes of Time,'' ``Fallen
Angels,'' ``Happy Together'' and ``Chungking Express'' for Kar-Wai,
all the while developing a distinctive style. Doyle uses highly
contrasting and deeply saturated color. He prefers to keep the
camera moving, preferably by using a hand-held camera or a
Steadicam strapped to his body. (He once told a reporter that he
used a tripod ``one in every 30 shots.'')
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Los Angeles to start work on ``Psycho,'' Van
Sant challenged the free-wheeling Doyle to comply with some strict
guidelines. The director insisted that his remake of Alfred
Hitchcock's classic follow the shot selection drawn up by Hitchcock
nearly 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have deviated from the original,'' Van Sant said,
``but as time went on, we became more and more interested in the
original setups.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle recalled: ``It was an exercise in style. We were going to
remake it shot for shot, but how do we make it our own?''
</P>
<P>
   Their first departure from Hitchcock was to use color rather
than black and white. ``His black became our green,'' said Doyle.
To capture the television quality of Hitchcock's film _ the 1960
``Psycho'' was filmed by a television crew _ Doyle suggested
de-saturating the film during processing to give it a nostalgic
look. ``This would make our film look good but still be deferential
to the original,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In the film _ which is to open on Dec. 4 _ Doyle opted for
different lenses and hand-held shots, which gave the actors,
especially Anne Heche, who reprises the role played by Janet Leigh,
greater freedom.
</P>
<P>
   This would not surprise fans of Doyle's earlier work, in Asia.
He is famous for nonconventional compositions that do not always
highlight the actors. In the 1997 South Korean film ``Motel
Cactus,'' he photographed a love scene in which the protagonists
tumble furiously in and out the frame, a visual gambit that
exaggerates their passion and lack of inhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reality as being more relevant than any other
reality,'' Doyle said. ``Why can't we film the back of someone's
head? Why can't we have the characters speaking off-screen?''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle likes to mix artificial and natural light. His is a visual
philosophy honed in Hong Kong, where neon signs, daylight and a
glow from a television screen add as much light to a room as a
household lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nestor Almendros, bless his heart, says light has to have a
defined and specific source,'' Doyle said. ``Well, I say: `Sorry.
Lighting sources are all mixed now. That is how people live.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His approach was evident during the first week on ``Liberty
Heights,'' the fourth in Barry Levinson's Baltimore series, when
Doyle was shooting in a supermarket. The lighting technicians had
replaced the store's fluorescent tubes, a standard practice because
they give off a greenish hue on film. Doyle protested. ``Why change
them?'' he said. ``They're there. We'll go with how they look
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson happily went along: the greenish hue stayed. It was an
example of how Doyle ``manages to paint with lighting,'' said Chen
Sim Lim, a programmer at the UCLA Film and Television Archives.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, describing himself as ``the anti-Storaro'' _ a reference
to the Italian formalist cinematographer _ believes his willingness
to eschew visual conventions derives from his lack of formal
training. ``I'm an autodidact,'' he said, adding that ``the only
thing film schools are good for are your sex life.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle was born in Sydney, and at 17 joined the Norwegian
Merchant Marine to earn a passage from his homeland. After
traveling widely _ there was a long sojourn in Amsterdam and a
stint at the University of Maryland studying Chinese art _ Doyle
landed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   It was there his language teacher gave him the name Du Ke Fang
(``gentleman of the sea''). It is the moniker by which he is known
in Asia. Doyle then moved to Taiwan, where he gravitated to its
dance, theater and arts scene and wound up working as the cameraman
on a documentary on the Chinese boat people.
</P>
<P>
   When he is not behind the movie camera, Doyle is often taking
stills. His photographic records of the films he has worked on have
all been published. Both Van Sant and Levinson gave him permission
to take pictures of life on their sets.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle prefers to have his photographs hung in bars and
bookstores. ``I don't want to have this pedestal of art imposing on
the kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning back for an instant _ at all hours, Doyle is like a
wind-up toy _he admitted to an equally modest ambition for his
cinematography: ``I always say, `If we light the set well enough,
maybe you'll change your lamps at home.'''

ALIEN SIGNAL REPORT SOUNDS LIKE HOAX, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; No, ET hasn't called yet. But scientists around the world who
work on serious efforts to monitor the skies for possible signals
from alien civilizations have spent the last week scrambling to
respond to an apparent hoax by someone who is claiming to have
picked up such a signal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all the earmarks of a hoax'' rather than an honest
mistake, said Darren Leigh, a radioastronomer who operates one of
the largest such search efforts in the world today, the BETA
project (for Billion-channel Extra-Terrestrial Assay) in Harvard,
Mass. Nevertheless, Leigh said, the 84-foot dish of the Oak Ridge
Observatory's BETA telescope was trained on the region of the sky
where the signal had been claimed, just to be sure. And no, there's
nothing there.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 other radio dishes, including a large array in
Australia and many owned by amateur astronomers who are members of
a group called the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)
League, also checked out the claims, and none found any evidence of
a real signal, according to the League's director, H. Paul Shuch.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrator made most of his claims anonymously but then was
tentatively identified by SETI researchers as an engineer named
Paul Dore; an anonymous resume he had posted was identified as
Dore's through an on-line search. But Shuch said in an interview
Tuesday that he had just heard from the real Paul Dore, and is now
convinced that he was not the perpetrator. Apparently whoever was
playing the hoax had simply used and altered Dore's resume. ``He's
a decent guy, and he had nothing to do with this,'' Shuch said.
</P>
<P>
   The hoaxer had planned to hold a press conference in England
Wednesday, but sent out an e-mail message Tuesday _ signed Paul
Dore _ calling off the press conference, and claiming that the
signal was in fact coming from a secret spy satellite.
</P>
<P>
   In the message, posted on an Internet site, the hoaxer claims he
was visited at home Tuesday by British and US intelligence
officials, who made him sign a ``security oath'' forbidding him
from revealing details they shared with him.
</P>
<P>
   That story is absurd on its face, Shuch said. Signals from
secret spy satellites are routinely picked up by SETI searches, he
said, and widely reported as such. Since all such transmissions are
presumably highly encrypted, nobody could get any real information
this way anyway, and there would be no reason for intelligence
officials to be concerned _ and they never have been.
</P>
<P>
   The hoaxer may have taken his inspiration from some reports in
September, written by SETI Foundation astronomer Seth Shostak, that
described an observing session at one of the world's most powerful
SETI efforts, Project Phoenix. During that Sept. 15 session in
Puerto Rico, the astronomers briefly were excited by a possible
signal from a star called EQ Pegasi, but after a few minutes of
checking it became clear that the signal was just satellite
interference.
</P>
<P>
   But the same source, EQ Pegasi, was named as the source of the
signals picked up by the hoaxer. That in itself is suspicious, said
Leigh, because the dish the hoaxer said he was using is not capable
of pinpointing locations in the sky to within a circle about six
times the diameter of the full moon, and thus could not have
specified one star.
</P>
<P>
   The radio frequency where the hoaxer said he picked up the
signal is one well known to SETI searchers as being riddled with
interference from satellites and other terrestrial sources. ``It's
one of the hot spots'' that keeps providing false alarms, Leigh
said. These can be easily ruled out because the same signal shows
up in different directions, picked up by other antennas at the same
time, not just at the point in the sky where the telescope is
pointing. SETI researchers routinely use such comparisons with
antennas pointing in different directions as a way to rule out
spurious signals.
</P>
<P>
   But could this have been an honest mistake, rather than a
deliberate hoax? Most of the astronomers don't think so. Hiding
behind anonymity and false identity, as well as clear signs in the
claimed data itself _ such as identical data, including identical
random ``noise,'' being reported as having been picked up on two
different nights _ clearly indicate a deliberate hoax, the
astronomers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always willing to give people the benefit of the doubt,''
said Shostak, ``but from the beginning, the indications were that
this was deliberate.''

SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS BOUNDS OF POLICE POWER WITH TRAFFIC
OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The state of Iowa asked the Supreme Court on
Tuesday to uphold a state law that gives the police essentially
blanket authority to search a car after issuing the driver a
citation for speeding or another routine traffic violation.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa Supreme Court upheld the law, the only one of its kind,
by a 5-4 vote last year. But the justices responded to the state's
arguments with considerable wariness. Justices across the
ideological spectrum worried aloud that an expansion of the current
rule, under which the police may conduct a search as an aspect of
taking a person into custody in a formal arrest, would give the
police too much power.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an appeal by a man who was stopped for driving 43
miles an hour in a 25 mph zone. The police officer gave him a
speeding ticket after determining that his license was valid and
that there were no outstanding warrants for his arrest. Then the
officer searched the car, finding a small quantity of marijuana and
a pipe, and arrested him.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, the Supreme Court validated a practice
known as ``search incident to arrest,'' which is an exception to
the ordinary Fourth Amendment requirement that a search be
supported by probable cause, or at least some level of suspicion of
a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Once there was probable cause to make an arrest, the Court said
then in United States vs. Robinson, a search of the person
arrested, as well as the area under his control, would be deemed
reasonable, without further need to establish probable cause to
search. It made sense, the court said in the 1973 case, to
authorize such a search to preserve evidence and to protect the
arresting officer's safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the argument on Tuesday, several justices, including the
court's more conservative members, suggested that the rationale of
the ``search incident to arrest'' doctrine did not apply in the
context of a simple speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   With a speeding violation, ``the offense is complete when the
car is brought to a stop,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
said, adding, ``There is no more evidence to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Bridget A. Chambers, an assistant attorney general
from Iowa, the chief justice said: ``If you'd come here on a
second-degree burglary, it might have been different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa law, which dates to 1983, authorizes the issuance of a
citation ``in lieu of arrest or in lieu of continued custody'' for
a variety of offenses. The law then provides that police officers
who issue such citations have the same authority to search that
they would have if they made a formal arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rosenberg, the lawyer for the arrested motorist, Patrick
Knowles, told the justices that while searches in connection with
actual arrests have a long legal tradition behind them, that was
not the case when no arrest had taken place. Rosenberg urged the
justices to maintain a clear distinction between the two
situations, a proposition that several members of the court
appeared to find attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Chambers, the lawyer representing Iowa, Justice David
H. Souter said: ``Would it make sense, in order to keep not only
our constitutional categories but our constitutional protections in
place, to require a custodial arrest?'' He answered his own
question: ``Then we would all know where we stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said to Chambers: ``It does seem an
enormous amount of authority to put in the hands of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Several justices raised the prospect that the police, given such
authority, would be tempted to manipulate the system by issuing a
ticket, searching the car, and then making a formal arrest if the
search turned up evidence of a crime. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
observed that rather than a search incident to an arrest, the state
was seeking authority for ``arrest incident to search,'' inviting
``an abuse of authority'' by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers replied that while there ``could conceivably'' be such
abuses, the public would respond so negatively that the state
legislature would intervene and put an end to the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens commented that the police ``might save
it for out-of-state motorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, Knowles vs. Iowa, No. 97-7597, has attracted
considerable attention, with organizations of police officers
urging the Court to uphold the law. In a series of cases in recent
years, the court has steadily increased the authority of the police
in traffic stop situations, giving police the power to order
drivers and passengers out of a car and to seek consent for
searches in routine traffic stops without advising the driver that
consent may be withheld. So one question underlying the proceedings
in the courtroom on Tuesday was whether this case presented the
Justices with a line they would not care to cross.
</P>
<P>
   In other action, the court issued its first opinion of the new
term on Tuesday, ruling unanimously that a labor union does not
violate its duty to fairly represent its members when it negotiates
a collective-bargaining agreement that appears to require all
employees to join the union and pay full union dues as a condition
of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Under Supreme Court precedents interpreting federal labor law,
employees in fact cannot be required to join a union; they can be
required to pay dues to support the union's collective-bargaining
activities, but not to support union political activities to which
they object. But most collective-bargaining agreements include
blanket ``union security'' clauses that do not spell out those
distinctions and that the plaintiff in this case, an actress who
lost a job because she did not pay dues to the Screen Actors Guild,
argued were inherently misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court on Tuesday in Marquez vs. Screen Actors
Guild, No. 97-1056, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the provisions
of the standard contract had become ``terms of art'' that
incorporated the relevant Supreme Court precedents and need not be
spelled out further.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``intricacies of every term used in a contract'' needed
to be spelled out, Justice O'Connor said, ``contracts would become
massive and unwieldy treatises, yet there would be no discernible
benefit from the increased mass.'' The decision upheld a 1997
ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, in San
Francisco.

   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ All kinds of things had taken them to
the United States _ sales jobs, shopping sprees, conferences, and a
honeymoon. But for two hours Tuesday aboard a jetliner bound for
Honduras, they shared a mix of unspoken fears and hopes.
</P>
<P>
   They were flying back from Miami to see what remained after
Hurricane Mitch plowed through Honduras and much of Central
America, killing as many as 8,300 people throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you hear?'' Perla Alvarado, carrying two suitcases
stuffed with milk, cereal, and crackers for her daughters, asked a
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cousin, the engineer,'' responded Maria Antonia Martinez.
``He died.''
</P>
<P>
   Others nodded in sympathy. Around the two women, passengers
exchanged rumors and third-hand accounts of neighborhoods flooded,
buildings swept away, and families stranded by the last fury of the
hurricane, which spat out four feet of rain in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, the airline had canceled its daily flight to the
drenched Honduran capital, so dozens of Hondurans stranded in the
United States frantically called friends and neighbors to ask about
their children, their houses, their churches, their pets.
</P>
<P>
   In the first-class section were three members of a World Bank
team traveling to assess the damage. In the first row, one of the
team members, Debbie Larson, pored over a paperback of the
bestseller, ``The Perfect Storm,'' appropriate reading for someone
viewing the ravages of what the US State Department calls the worst
storm in Central America this century.
</P>
<P>
   In economy class, the passengers carried dried milk, gallon jugs
of water, vitamins, and what seemed like sample cases from
pharmaceutical companies. In row 12, newlyweds Rolando and
Alejandro Montero were returning from their honeymoon in Disney
World, where they paused each day to call and check on the
well-being of their families. In row 25, Jorge Balidiano, a
salesman, clutched a package of toy cars to cheer his son, who had
lived through a week of downpours, including a day when corpses
floated past their house.
</P>
<P>
   A few rows back, Jorge Handal, a fund-raiser for nonprofit
groups, had cereal, canned tuna, and other staples that he had
bought at 4 a.m. in a New York supermarket for his 8-year-old son
and 6-year-old daughter. Thanks to buddies with ham radios, Handal
knew that his children were fine, and he couldn't sleep because he
was excited about seeing them again.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the crowd, in row 18, Phil Gelman and his
fiancee, Florencia Colindres, had a wedding dress and a gallon of
pickled herring for their wedding next month.
</P>
<P>
   Half jokingly, Gelman said it will be the first Jewish wedding
in Tegucigalpa. The two had had spent a week in New York stocking
up on yarmulkes, ceremonial cups, and, yes, herring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a sappy story,'' said Gelman, who helps run food
programs for CARE in Honduras. Flight 953 Tuesday was filled with
sappy stories, sad stories, and, most of all, unresolved stories.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to e-mail, Florencia Colindres knew that her three
children from a first marriage were dry and healthy in Tegucigalpa,
even if they were hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras is a place where the 19th and 20th centuries live side
by side, and Colindres had been unable to get hold of her parents,
farmers who raise crops and cattle in the lowlands west of the
capital. Their town, in an area called Dulce Nombre de Culmi,
barely has phone service, much less e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Colindres' sister had tried repeatedly to get information on
their parents through a radio station, but with no luck.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Dec. 20 wedding was in doubt. Just a year and a half
ago, Tegucigalpa's minuscule Jewish community opened its first
synagogue with books and decorations donated by immigrants who
arrived from Germany in the 1930s. It wasn't much of a synagogue,
really, just a dowdy house on a river bank. Over the weekend, the
river crested, the house collapsed, and the donated items were
whisked away or buried in mud.
</P>
<P>
   A few rows away, Maria Antonio Martinez spoke about her cousin,
Arturo Calona, an engineer who had wanted to make Tegucigalpa a
first-world capital. He was killed Sunday in the helicopter crash
that also claimed Tegucigalpa's popular mayor, Cesar Castellanos.
They had been surveying the damage caused by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 757 made a heavy, ungainly landing on Tegucigalpa's
runway, because it was filled with extra fuel to make the trip
back. Fuel, like drinking water and fresh food, is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   As the passengers stepped into the airport, to the hugs of
waiting relatives, Jorge Handal drove off to see his children, 15
miles away. He didn't get very far. All the bridges were out, the
phone lines were severed, and the rivers were swollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than I thought,'' Handal said. ``It's like this
country has stepped back in time about a hundred years.''

STRESSED OCEANS HIT BY NEW DISEASES, ECOLOGIST SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Bleached and devastated coral reefs, the
widening reach of shellfish diseases, and the lightning-swift
decimation of marine organisms in recent years suggest that the
oceans are under environmental stress as never before, an ecologist
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It's even possible that marine plants and animals are becoming
more vulnerable and that new diseases are emerging from the brew of
global warming and pollution caused by human activities, said the
scientist, C. Drew Harvell of Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not business as usual,'' Harvell said, referring to
the bleaching of coral reefs worldwide that reached its greatest
known geographic extent in 1997-98. ``This is as if you went
outside and all the trees were white.''
</P>
<P>
   Bleaching occurs when coral is diseased or under stress and
expels the symbiotic microalgae that it normally harbors. The
calcium carbonate skeleton then shows through, giving a pale or
stark white appearance to the coral.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Harvell said in a presentation to the Council for
the Advancement of Science Writing, is that scientists can't yet
say whether bleaching is simply an extreme phase in a cycle of
warming and cooling from which the ecosystem will recover or a sign
of an unremitting global warming that is enabling new disease
threats to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Hampering scientists' efforts to assess the significance of the
recent marine epidemics is a dearth of information about previous
levels of disease. They also don't know whether, like forest fires,
ocean diseases ebb and flow in a natural rhythm that helps maintain
a balance.
</P>
<P>
   The worrisome picture includes such elements as these:
</P>
<P>
   _Growth of a fungal disease, aspergillosis, that has battered
and destroyed many sea fans, a delicate, fringed type of flexible
coral in the Florida Keys. The keys are already under intense
pressure from human habitation and pollution.
</P>
<P>
   _The appearance in waters off Maine of a lethal disease of
oysters, Perkinsus marinus, that has moved up the coast from
Chesapeake Bay due to warmer-than-usual winter temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   _The detection of 10 to 14 new coral diseases since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the disease-causing organisms are unidentified, making
it difficult even to know what agents are at work, Havell said.
Marine biologists don't have anything comparable to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention to which they can send samples, as
doctors do for human illnesses, ``but it's beginning to look like
we need something like this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are also grappling with another ecological threat
that affects bays, estuaries, and harbors: the inadvertent
importation of exotic species in the ballast water of ships, said
James Carlton, a marine sciences professor at Williams College.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious of the ballast stowaways is the zebra mussel,
which arrived in US waters from Asia in 1988 and now foul buoys,
clogs intake pipes, and attacks other shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, crabs from Japan and China have invaded San
Francisco Bay by the tens of thousands. In New England, aliens such
as the European oyster and the European green crab threaten local
shellfish, while the Japanese crab has worked its way to just below
Plymouth, said Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that during any week, about 15,000 species of
plants and animals are moving across the globe in the ballast tanks
of 35,000 ships.
</P>
<P>
   New shipping regulations call for vessels to empty their ballast
tanks in the deep ocean and take in new ballast, said Carlton. Any
hitchhikers contained in that water would be ill-suited to the
shallower coastal waters where the ship would eventually dock and
expel its ballast, scientists believe.

WHERE PARENTS CAN GO FOR EXPERT ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: List of clearinghouses and topics covered at end of

<P>
   URBANA, Ill. _ Are there rules of thumb to guide parents
checking a baby sitter's references? How does one get a preschooler
to clean her room? Are there ways to make a new teen-age driver
safer?
</P>
<P>
   Parents by the thousands, as well as teachers, school
administrators and community workers, are finding expert advice on
these and almost any other question on the National Parent
Information Network, available on the Internet, and through a
toll-free telephone call. The project, at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is being financed by the federal
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the parents ask the kind of questions that they might
have posed to a trusted neighbor or family member a generation or
two ago. Parents of babies and toddlers ask most frequently about
getting their children to sleep. After that, the biggest issue is
what to do about hitting and biting. Toilet training and
bed-wetting come close behind.
</P>
<P>
   Other questions asked frequently: When should my child walk?
When should my child talk? How many words should he speak at age 2
or 3? When should my child read?
</P>
<P>
   In September, the network had 250,000 visits to its Web site
(www.npin.org), and staff members expect the total this year to
reach 2 million. Telephone calls, answered by staff members from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern standard time at (800) 583-4135, are running
at 1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Information Network operates primarily as an
information service, a latter-day cooperative extension for family
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a hot line,'' said Dr. Anne S. Robertson, director
of the network. ``But if people call in a crisis situation, we can
refer them.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff members, who include researchers with backgrounds in
early childhood, health care, day care, and special education, link
callers with expert advice, either online or available through a
library or community organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had questions from parents who know they are about to be
homeless,'' said Dr. Amy Aidman, a staff member. In Illinois, Dr.
Aidman said, such parents are referred to a toll-free number at the
state Board of Education where that issue is handled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robertson remembered a tearful call from a woman in a
Southern state who had just been told that her daughter, who had an
attention deficit disorder, was being retained in kindergarten.
School officials had told the mother _ incorrectly, as it turned
out _ that she could not request federally financed special
education assistance until her child reached the fourth grade. Dr.
Robertson got the name of someone in the woman's home state who
helped her.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, callers are hesitant about stating their problem.
Once, a woman called with what she said was a question about
diapering her baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on the phone when the staff realized the woman wasn't
accepting our answers,'' Dr. Robertson said. ``She had just moved
to California and was living in a trailer park. She had a new
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robertson found out that the woman had just been told she
might have seizures, and that she had no health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her we could find a health care visitor willing to home
visit,'' she said. ``We did some research and we gave her the name
and number.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The National Parents Information Network also has a free online
service in which subscribing parents can exchange advice and
opinions. Staff members monitor the electronic discussions to make
sure the remarks do not get too intemperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breast-feeding is a big topic,'' Dr. Robertson said of the
discussions. ``Some people think if you don't beast-feed, you deny
nutrition to your child. But others say they can't breast-feed. The
discussion got heated, and it was not part of our `netiquette.' So
we asked people if they wanted to contribute to an article on the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting article, edited by a the network's researcher,
appears on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The staff draws on the largest education database in the world,
established by the Educational Resources Information Service, a
federally financed and managed network. The service draws
information from more than 850,000 records of journal articles,
research reports, curriculum and teaching guides, conference papers
and books. The material is made available by 16 clearinghouses on
separate education topics that collect, abstract and index
information about education, answer requests for information and
produce special publications.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone answering component of the network was developed
in 1992 as a pilot project at the service's Clearinghouse on
Information and Technology, at Syracuse University. The University
of Illinois runs the Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early
Childhood Education.
</P>
<P>
   The advice is usually down to earth. A preschooler will
straighten up her room if the expectations are realistic, said Dawn
Ramsburg, a network research assistant. Her advice included: Make
the bed up with a comforter; do not ask her to flatten sheets.
Store toys on shelves instead of a box. On the question of teen-age
driving, the network cites Tom Deats, a Texas police officer who
set up a national teen-age safe driving program, 4MYTEEN.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of checking references for a baby sitter, Dr.
Jeanne Beckman, a licensed clinical psychologist who practices in
Winnetka, Ill., wrote: ``I am suspicious of any sitter who can only
give names of people for whom they sat only one time, or for whom
they have sat only recently.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackling what to do if an unsatisfactory baby sitter uses you as
a reference, she wrote: ``I feel you have a responsibility to
somehow convey the difficulty, even if all you say is, `Yes, she
sat for me, but I cannot give you any more information.' That kind
of statement actually conveys lots of information.''

 SPANISH PREMIER OKs TALKS WITH BASQUE REBELS  
(nk) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spain's prime minister said Tuesday that he had
authorized his government to talk with people close to the leading
Basque guerrilla group to test the trustworthiness of the rebels,
who announced what they called an indefinite cease-fire six weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who survived a bomb attack by
the rebels in 1995 when he was the opposition leader, has said
there can be no peace talks directly with the rebel group, known as
the ETA, until it permanently renounces violence to end its 30-year
armed fight for an independent Basque homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's chief spokesman, Josep Pique, said the
initial talks aimed ``only to verify if there is a real willingness
to abandon arms and stop the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Aznar answered with a simple ``yes'' when reporters asked if he
had authorized the initial contacts. Soon after, some of his aides
said privately that the Basque rebels, who are blamed for 800
deaths, were showing signs of wanting a permanent peace since their
announcement on Sept. 16 of the unilateral cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the guns remain silent,'' one aide noted. Further, he
added, the leftist independence coalition Euskal Heritarrok, which
is linked to the rebels, has expressed respect for the results of
the Basque parliamentary elections last month, which was won by
moderates who prefer to keep the prosperous Basque region within
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials insisted they would not reveal the timing,
location or the participants in the initial talks. But one of
Aznar's aides said he had heard the venue might be in France,
Belgium or even Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The talks would be the government's first acknowledged contacts
since 1989 with the ETA, whose initials in the Basque language
stand for Basque Homeland and Liberty, and the first ever by a
conservative government.
</P>
<P>
   The previous talks under the Socialist administration lasted
just a few months before breaking off. Each side blamed the other
for the impasse, and the ETA renewed its wave of bombings and
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said that the ETA's current cease-fire, its first
without conditions or an end date, is a better start for the peace
process, which they expect to involve long and difficult
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid politicians point out that the cease-fire comes after
police arrests have thinned the ranks of the rebels and large
street demonstrations in Spain since last year, including in the
northern Basque region, have united people of diverse political
parties to call for a permanent peace.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Socialist Party expressed surprise Tuesday that
it had not been consulted about the start of initial talks, but the
moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which has governed in minority
in the Basque region for 18 years, called the government's
announcement ``a new important element in the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   The most cautious reaction came from the Association of Victims
of Terrorism, based in Madrid, which urged that the talks should
not lead to a ``secret amnesty'' for some 530 ETA convicts or
suspects who are jailed in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The victims association, representing 1,400 Spanish families who
comprise half of those affected by terrorist attacks, has argued
vigorously that the victims not be forgotten on the path to peace.

HOUSTON OUSTS 6 POLICE OFFICERS IN FATAL RAID
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a case that has angered Hispanic residents of
Houston, police officials here have dismissed six officers involved
in a botched drug raid in which a Mexican landscaper was killed by
police gunfire in his bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen, in my opinion, a case as egregious as this
case,'' said Chief Clarence Bradford, who announced the action on
Monday night after the department committees on civilian review and
administrative discipline recommended the dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came less than two weeks after a grand jury here
declined to indict five of the officers in the death of the
landscaper, Pedro Oregon, and filed a single charge of criminal
trespass, a misdemeanor, against the sixth officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said the officers burst into Oregon's apartment on July
12 after Ryan F. Baxter, whom they had stopped for public
intoxication and who was on probation on drug charges, gave the
police the name of someone he said was his drug supplier in
exchange for his own release. With an address supplied by Baxter,
the six officers raided Oregon's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   As the officers entered the apartment, one accidentally fired,
striking another officer who was wearing a bulletproof vest.
Believing that Oregon had fired the shot, the other officers began
shooting, firing 33 times and hitting Oregon 12 times, Bradford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's gun was found near his body but was not fired in the
raid. An autopsy found no drugs or alcohol in his system, nor were
any drugs found in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, a 22-year-old Mexican immigrant, was the father of two
who coached soccer and worked as a landscaper. He had no known
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation found that the officers had illegally
entered the apartment without a search warrant and violated police
policy by using an unregistered and intoxicated informer in an
unauthorized narcotics investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris County grand jury began an investigation of the six
officers: Sgt. D.H. Strouse and Officers D.R. Barrera, P.A.
Herrada, D.R. Perkins, L.E. Tillery, and James R. Willis. On Oct.
20, the grand jury returned one count of criminal trespass against
Willis.
</P>
<P>
   That action angered many Hispanic residents here and prompted
city officials and the Mexican Consulate in Houston to request a
federal civil rights investigation. A Justice Department spokesman
said Tuesday that the case was under investigation.

<P>
   ``It has all the earmarks of a hoax'' rather than an honest
mistake, said Darren Leigh, a radioastronomer who operates one of
the largest such search efforts in the world today, the BETA
project (for Billion-channel Extra-Terrestrial Assay) in Harvard,
Mass. Nevertheless, Leigh said, the 84-foot dish of the Oak Ridge
Observatory's BETA telescope was trained on the region of the sky
where the signal had been claimed, just to be sure. And no, there's
nothing there.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 other radio dishes, including a large array in
Australia and many owned by amateur astronomers who are members of
a group called the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence)
League, also checked out the claims, and none found any evidence of
a real signal, according to the League's director, H. Paul Shuch.
</P>
<P>
   The perpetrator made most of his claims anonymously but then was
tentatively identified by SETI researchers as an engineer named
Paul Dore; an anonymous resume he had posted was identified as
Dore's through an on-line search. But Shuch said in an interview
Tuesday that he had just heard from the real Paul Dore, and is now
convinced that he was not the perpetrator. Apparently whoever was
playing the hoax had simply used and altered Dore's resume. ``He's
a decent guy, and he had nothing to do with this,'' Shuch said.
</P>
<P>
   The hoaxer had planned to hold a press conference in England
Wednesday, but sent out an e-mail message Tuesday _ signed Paul
Dore _ calling off the press conference, and claiming that the
signal was in fact coming from a secret spy satellite.
</P>
<P>
   In the message, posted on an Internet site, the hoaxer claims he
was visited at home Tuesday by British and US intelligence
officials, who made him sign a ``security oath'' forbidding him
from revealing details they shared with him.
</P>
<P>
   That story is absurd on its face, Shuch said. Signals from
secret spy satellites are routinely picked up by SETI searches, he
said, and widely reported as such. Since all such transmissions are
presumably highly encrypted, nobody could get any real information
this way anyway, and there would be no reason for intelligence
officials to be concerned _ and they never have been.
</P>
<P>
   The hoaxer may have taken his inspiration from some reports in
September, written by SETI Foundation astronomer Seth Shostak, that
described an observing session at one of the world's most powerful
SETI efforts, Project Phoenix. During that Sept. 15 session in
Puerto Rico, the astronomers briefly were excited by a possible
signal from a star called EQ Pegasi, but after a few minutes of
checking it became clear that the signal was just satellite
interference.
</P>
<P>
   But the same source, EQ Pegasi, was named as the source of the
signals picked up by the hoaxer. That in itself is suspicious, said
Leigh, because the dish the hoaxer said he was using is not capable
of pinpointing locations in the sky to within a circle about six
times the diameter of the full moon, and thus could not have
specified one star.
</P>
<P>
   The radio frequency where the hoaxer said he picked up the
signal is one well known to SETI searchers as being riddled with
interference from satellites and other terrestrial sources. ``It's
one of the hot spots'' that keeps providing false alarms, Leigh
said. These can be easily ruled out because the same signal shows
up in different directions, picked up by other antennas at the same
time, not just at the point in the sky where the telescope is
pointing. SETI researchers routinely use such comparisons with
antennas pointing in different directions as a way to rule out
spurious signals.
</P>
<P>
   But could this have been an honest mistake, rather than a
deliberate hoax? Most of the astronomers don't think so. Hiding
behind anonymity and false identity, as well as clear signs in the
claimed data itself _ such as identical data, including identical
random ``noise,'' being reported as having been picked up on two
different nights _ clearly indicate a deliberate hoax, the
astronomers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always willing to give people the benefit of the doubt,''
said Shostak, ``but from the beginning, the indications were that
this was deliberate.''

 By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One afternoon in 1988, when David Isay was 22 years
old and just stumbling into a passion for radio, he paid an
unannounced visit to the Manhattan office of his father, a
psychoanalyst.
</P>
<P>
   There he encountered a man who seemed to be living in an
anteroom of the professional suite. At first, Isay's father
explained away the stranger as a patient. Then he told the truth:
he was gay and the man was his lover.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the disclosure, Isay (pronounced like the two words
``I say'') set about understanding the surreptitious life his
father had led through years of marriage and parenting. There was
nothing autobiographical, much less confessional, about his
approach.
</P>
<P>
   With microphone and tape recorder and the license both objects
conferred to ask questions, Isay began interviewing veterans of the
Stonewall uprising, the 1969 brawl between homosexuals and police
outside a Greenwich Village bar that catalyzed the gay-rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, the 25 minutes of ``Stonewall Remembered''
were broadcast on National Public Radio, becoming the first of
say's documentaries to play on the network. Listeners heard from
those exhilarated by the insurrection: a Vietnam veteran, a former
convent girl, a drag queen, a lesbian now residing in a center for
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   They even heard from the public-morals investigator assigned to
police the Stonewall Inn. Only at the very end, though, did they
hear the producer responsible for the program intone simply, ``I'm
David Isay.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since that documentary, Isay has produced an
acclaimed body of radio journalism that still hews to the
paradoxical style of ``Stonewall Remembered.'' Whether assembling
pieces about ghetto teen-agers or Appalachian snake handlers,
Bowery denizens or gospel quartets, Isay has made himself both
determinedly absent and fiercely present, imprinting his
sensibility while silencing his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Isay has won or shared in numerous awards, foremost among them
two Peabodys for broadcast journalism. Working more as an oral
historian than a newsman, he has influenced other radio
documentarians even as he has occasionally tangled with the editors
of National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest nod to Isay's stature, WNYC-FM (93.9) will present
a two-hour retrospective of his work at 7 p.m. on Nov. 27,
simulcast on WNYC-AM (820).
</P>
<P>
   His success serves as proof that even a half-century after
television should in theory have rendered radio obsolete, this
relatively primitive medium provides certain satisfactions not even
the highest technology can match.
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio's flagship broadcast, ``All Things
Considered,'' draws a nightly audience of 7.7 million, not much
less than the viewership for any one of the television network
newscasts, and has created stars like Cokie Roberts, Susan
Stamberg, John Hockenberrry and Robert Krulwich.
</P>
<P>
   That Isay remains far more obscure than they to a general
audience says less about public radio than about his own taste for
invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find other people's stories so much more interesting than my
story,'' he says. ``I know my story. And I know I'm not much of a
talker. I'm a much better listener. So I try to be the vehicle
through which people's stories can be heard. What I'm looking for
is poetry on the margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Mueller, the radio curator of the Museum of Television and
Radio, puts it this way: ``Just like Frederick Wiseman is cinema
verite, David Isay is audio verite.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before entering radio, Isay had learned much about the
meticulous editing that characterizes his work. He grew up, first
in New Haven and then in Manhattan, with the example of his mother,
Jane Isay, a book editor who has worked with authors like Harold
Bloom and Melissa Fay Greene. ``She taught me the ability to cut
down to what's most interesting,'' he says, ``to be brutal with
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   From his father, Robert, Isay says, he took ``a real sense of
the courage of people who are out of the mainstream and of the
cruelty of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Isay's social conscience and incipient technique
waited in latency as he graduated from New York University in 1987
and headed into medical school. During a break from class, he
wandered past an East Village store specializing in books and
supplies for 12-step programs.
</P>
<P>
   When Isay chatted with the owners, both recovered drug addicts,
he found they were planning to open a ``museum of addiction.'' They
already had blueprints and a scale model made of tongue depressors.
</P>
<P>
   Isay raced back to his apartment, threw open the Yellow Pages
and began calling television and radio stations, trying to interest
anyone in the story. Finally, he reached Amy Goodman, the news
director at WBAI-FM, the Pacifica station known for its iconoclasm.
``Sounds great,'' she told him. ``I don't have anyone to do it. Why
don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   With a borrowed tape recorder and editing help from Ms. Goodman,
Isay patched together a six-minute piece. On the day it was
broadcast in 1988, a National Public Radio producer named Gary
Covino happened to be visiting New York and listening to WBAI.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Covino had earned his own reputation on NPR for assembling audio
portraits, most notably one of a street demonstration against the
Filipino dictator Ferdinand Marcos, from vast volumes of
first-person testimony. Now he heard a kindred spirit. ``It was
rough,'' he recalls of the Isay piece, ``but listening through the
roughness I could hear this sensibility that intrigued me.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Ms. Goodman, he located Isay, a gangly, bespectacled
fellow with, appropriately enough, very big ears. Covino re-edited
the WBAI piece so it could run nationally on NPR's ``Weekend All
Things Considered.'' Then he paid the neophyte $50. ``I was
apologizing that it was so little,'' he says, ``and Dave was
flipping out because he didn't think he'd be paid at all.''
</P>
<P>
   So began the education of an acolyte. As Isay developed
``Stonewall Remembered,'' he spent months immersed in tapes that
Covino had sent him and in the broadcasts of ``Weekend All Things
Considered,'' which Covino produced.
</P>
<P>
   From those models, Isay learned to eschew the NPR formula of
``acts and trax'' _ slang for alternating sections of the ambient
sound called actualities and vocal tracks _ in favor of using
editing and overdubbing to create a dense aural tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   When Isay began producing more pieces, Covino took sole
responsibility for editing them. Justifiably or not, he depicted
NPR's editors as ``narrow minds who wouldn't hear the potential for
terrific stories in his ideas.'' To this day, he proudly asserts,
``We violated all the rules of NPR editorial apparatus.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet NPR broadcast virtually everything that Isay developed,
bringing both the network and the young producer renown. Between
1990 and 1993, Isay traveled the country for the American Folklife
Project, profiling characters from death row inmates to a Pullman
porter to a minister with a 34-million-word diary.
</P>
<P>
   The series captured a Peabody honor, and the death-row segment
won the Livingston Award for excellence by a young journalist.
Subsequently, Shanachie Records released highlights from the series
and W.W. Norton published a companion book.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were stories of sacrifice, of quiet heroism,'' Isay
wrote in the book, ``Holding On.'' ``There seemed to be eternal
qualities shared by all of these subjects, but we couldn't pin them
down. Was it the sense of loneliness? The bravery? Individuality?
Resilience? Was it that oddly wistful feeling we were left with
each time we visited one of these people?''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of Isay's next major documentary, ``Ghetto Life
101,'' was anything but ineffable. In 1993, Covino hired Isay to
contribute to a yearlong series of broadcasts on race relations for
WBEZ, the NPR affiliate in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by ``There Are No Children Here,'' Alex Kotlowitz's
book about two boys in a Chicago housing project, Isay created an
aural equivalent _ except that he actually turned over the
reporting to two 13-year-olds, LeAlan Jones and Lloyd Newman. The
pair kept taped diaries and interviewed friends and family members,
and Isay pared down more than 100 hours of material to an
excruciating 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Lloyd Newman caught neighborhood children taunting
his alcoholic father by daring him to spell ``fool.'' Later in the
broadcast, LeAlan Jones asked his older sister how many of her
friends had been murdered. ``Maybe a little less than 30,'' she
replied.
</P>
<P>
   In still another scene, the two boys wandered into a downtown
hotel as the lounge pianist played the theme song from the Peanuts
cartoon series, surely not the soundtrack to their youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghetto Life 101'' won a Livingston Award and a Society of
Professional Journalists prize, among others, and was translated
for broadcast in several foreign countries. But Isay's proteges
were not, as it turned out, finished yet. In 1996, a 5-year-old boy
from the same housing project as LeAlan and Lloyd was pushed out a
high-rise window to his death by assailants ages 10 and 11. With
Isay again editing and producing, LeAlan and Lloyd reported a
25-minute documentary entitled ``Remorse.'' Perhaps its most
harrowing moment came in this exchange about the murdered boy:
</P>
<P>
   LeAlan: Dude, you think they got a playground in heaven for
shorties?
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd: Nope. Ain't no playground in heaven for nobody.
</P>
<P>
   LeAlan: I don't know, man. How you figure there ain't no
playground in heaven for little kids?
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd: God didn't make it special for nobody.
</P>
<P>
   LeAlan: But, man, what Shorty gonna do up there? He wasn't old
enough to do nothing bad enough to go to no hell. What he doin,
just kickin' it? Or is he reincarnated? Maybe he be a little bird
or something.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With ``Remorse,'' Isay won his second Peabody and the only Grand
Prize ever given to a radio program in the Robert F. Kennedy Awards
for coverage of the disadvantaged. Scribner published a book
compiling the transcripts and many outtakes from both ``Remorse''
and ``Ghetto Life 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Isay established his own nonprofit organization, Soundport, for
which he currently raises $200,000 annually, enough to support
himself and several employees and to cover production costs.
</P>
<P>
   As important, Isay had found in the use of surrogate narrators a
form that suited his temperament, one that began to be imitated in
public-radio circles. He employed the trope most recently in ``The
Sunshine Hotel,'' a 25-minute portrait of a Bowery flophouse that
was broadcast on ``All Things Considered'' in September.
</P>
<P>
   Isay chose Nathan Smith, the hotel manager, to introduce
listeners to some of the 125 men who pay $4.50 a night for a 4-by-6
cubicle topped with chicken wire: the Russian immigrant with a
weekend heroin habit, the former band boy with Tito Puente, the
loan shark, the drug dealer, the senile 80-year-old abandoned by
his son and living on Oreos.
</P>
<P>
   Such a cast, far from disturbing Isay, elicited his friendship.
``He comes with a particular innocence,'' Smith says. ``It disarms
people. You don't think he's going to cut your throat or rob you.
It was a heartfelt, honest thing he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Compassion and engagement, however, yielded more than 70 hours
of raw tape. Which it fell to Isay and his digital editing machine
to reduce in a manner that his mother might well have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a compulsive editor,'' says Stacy Abramson, Isay's
associate producer. ``It's enough to make you insane. He'll sit
there and fine-tune and fine-tune and fine-tune. He'll make sure
the timing of the phone call fits seamlessly over Nate's narration.
It's so seamless you don't notice it. But it's been gone over and
over and over. When you spent a year on a piece and boil it down to
25 minutes, every second has to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Isay's perfection, or perhaps because of it, he has at
times feuded with NPR. ``All Things Considered'' turned down his
1995 audio diary of a prostitute dying of AIDS, though the segment
later was broadcast on ``Weekend All Things Considered'' and took a
Kennedy Award.
</P>
<P>
   The network withheld broadcast of Isay's 1991 documentary on a
hospital for the criminally insane. The facility's director
claimed, based on an advance script that Isay had provided her,
that the report overemphasized the patients' violence. John Dinges,
then NPR's managing editor, ordered it revised to address ``serious
questions about both accuracy and balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Isay instead withdrew the documentary. It later was broadcast on
another NPR show, ``Soundprint,'' and, paradoxically enough,
received an award from the American Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a prickly relationship with highly talented
independent producers and the network,'' says Bill Buzenberg, who
was NPR's vice president for news and information from 1990 through
1997. ``It stems from the fact they (italics)are(end italics)
independent, don't want to work for the network, want to do radio
art to the nth degree. So a mutual distrust gets in there
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Isay himself acknowledges the periodic tensions. ``I've been
viewed with suspicion,'' he says. ``There's a feeling that when you
do a non-narrated piece, when you don't write, when you do
something like oral history, that you haven't done the research,
that you don't know your facts. There's a feeling that you're
cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   Those feelings have not lasted long, even among Isay's few
critics. Buzenberg hails him as ``one of the best radio artisans in
the business.'' After ``Ghetto Life 101'' was broadcast, Dinges
wrote in a memo to the NPR staff that ``pieces like this will
revolutionize documentary radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Isay, typically, lets his subjects speak for him. There comes a
moment in the American Folklife Project series when a Colorado man,
who has built a castle atop an isolated mountaintop, delivers what
could be Isay's own manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go on and on about Buttafuoco,'' the man says. ``Did he
ever build anything with his hands? Conan O'Brian? Where do they
come from? I've heard of Imelda Marcos. I've heard of Saddam
Hussein. I've heard of all these other people. Have they heard of
this?''

MALAYSIAN LEADERS ON TRIAL INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Two trials are under way in this
suddenly fractious Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   One is in a drab Kuala Lumpur courtroom, where Malaysia's former
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, is fighting charges of
corruption and sex-related crimes. The other is on the streets
outside, where students, taxi drivers and politicians are treating
the case as a referendum on Anwar's former boss, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a crisis of confidence here,'' said Lim Kit Siang,
the most prominent opposition leader. ``If public confidence in the
system of justice is shaken, Mahathir's position will definitely be
eroded.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors began presenting their case Tuesday, saying Anwar,
who was dismissed by Mahathir in September and later arrested, had
engaged in ``sexual misbehavior'' and then obstructed a police
investigation of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Their first witness was a former director of the Special Branch
of the Malaysian police. Prosecutors say Anwar asked the official
to obtain a retraction from a man who had said Anwar had had a
homosexual relationship with him. In Malaysia homosexual acts are a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar has pleaded not guilty to 10 charges of corruption and
sodomy. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The lurid nature of the charges and Anwar's prominence _ he was
long regarded as Mahathir's successor _ has turned this case into a
national obsession. With the news media carrying heavily sanitized
reports of the trial, the public's hunger for information is
ravenous.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse a crowd of 30 people surrounded a
reporter, pleading for a detailed account of the Tuesday's events.
Several said they were doubtful that Anwar would receive a fair
trial, given that he had been ousted after a fierce power struggle
with Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the odds are 60-40 against him,'' said a young man
who would not give his name because, he said, plainclothes police
officers were watching the gathering. ``We want to show the world
that we support him.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman standing next to the man furtively lifted a traditional
Malay shawl to show off a white T-shirt emblazoned with Anwar's
picture. ``We don't like Mahathir,'' she said, ``but we are scared
to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As on Monday, supporters of Anwar were corralled behind police
barricades under the gaze of troops wielding automatic weapons,
truncheons and tear-gas canisters. A water-cannon truck was parked
in front of the High Court Tuesday morning to discourage
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Protests against Mahathir, which reached a peak two weeks ago
when dozens of demonstrators clashed with the police on the streets
of Kuala Lumpur, have been notably absent during the first days of
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   People said they believed that would-be demonstrators had been
scared off by police warnings. But they added that if the public
came to believe the trial was unfair, crowds would again take to
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying issues that brought people on the street are
the same,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of political science
at the University of Malaya. ``The Anwar case, of course, but also
the whole issue of the government and the man who sits at the apex
of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Malaysians are getting a heavily edited version
of events. After court adjourned on Monday, Anwar sharply
criticized Mahathir and another top official in remarks to
reporters. Most local papers, with the notable exception of The New
Straits Times, did not report his comments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cramped courtroom has raised further doubts about the
handling of the trial. Several diplomats, including a
representative of the U.S. embassy, were turned away on Monday,
prompting the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, to say, ``We
have serious concerns about what's going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Augustine Paul, also refused to grant observer
status, which would guarantee seats, to human rights groups. A U.S.
diplomat and a representative of Amnesty International did attend
Tuesday's session.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although Anwar's lawyers were rebuffed again Tuesday in
their efforts to have the case dismissed or delayed on a legal
technicality, they said they had no complaints about the conduct of
Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir has said nothing publicly about the trial,
concentrating in a speech here on Monday on the global economy. As
he has before, Mahathir pinned the blame for the Asian crisis on
foreign currency traders, who he said ``are well on their way to
bringing about a worldwide recession.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS NOT EXPECTED; GOOD DEALS FOR
FREQUENT FLIERS; MORE SMOKE-FREE PLANES; A DIFFERENT SORT OF
TURBULENCE

<P>
   There is nothing new about complaints of crowded airplanes,
cramped airline seats and high-priced hotel rooms that do not allow
guests to check in before midafternoon _ and which, when they do
finally check in, they frequently find dirty. But the complaints
have grown louder in each of the last five or six years since the
airline and hotel industries struggled back from the financial
brink.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is still surprising to hear strangers and
casual acquaintances say only half in jest that an economic
downturn could bring about a return to better service, lower
prices, more legroom and more amenities. But while any of that is
possible, industry executives say, it is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recession, customer service would either stay the same or
possibly get worse, due to financial pressure on the airlines,''
said Travis Tanner, chief executive of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, who
is a former airline official. ``What will attract customers in a
downturn are changes in pricing and scheduling, as opposed to more
legroom, headroom or extra danish.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, airlines are better prepared for a recession or
economic slowdown this time around. Marginal or unprofitable routes
have been trimmed, and smaller, more efficient planes have replaced
the jumbo jets that once served even secondary markets. The same is
true even in ailing international markets; UAL's United Airlines
dropped its service between San Francisco and Manila last February,
for example, and Northwest Airlines recently reduced its capacity
in the Pacific by 15 percent when it took four 747s out of service
last month.

   This month is shaping up as a good one for frequent fliers.
United Airlines, Northwest, Trans World Airlines, Delta Air Lines
and US Airways are offering double frequent-flier miles in November
on all or most flights, while AMR's American Airlines is offering
them for passengers who pay full fare and travel within and between
the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. As usual, restrictions
apply. Why so many double-mile offerings? Because all the other
airlines matched Northwest, which offered them as a way to bring
back customers after its recent 18-day strike, followed by seven
more days before Northwest resumed full operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the double miles awarded to all qualifying
passengers this month, Delta has agreed to give double miles and
discounted tickets to a relative handful of passengers who were
Delta frequent-flier members prior to July 1, 1988, and had at
least 40,000 miles in their accounts. The decision is part of a
tentative settlement in a lawsuit filed 10 years ago in Cook
County, Illinois, charging Delta with changing its frequent-flier
program to limit the number of free tickets that members could
acquire.
</P>
<P>
   More Smoking Bans
</P>
<P>
   The number of airlines banning smoking on flights continues to
grow. Less than two weeks ago, the three Brazilian airlines that
fly to the United States _Varig, VASP and Transbrasil _ banned
smoking, in accordance with a new Brazilian law that prohibits
smoking on international and domestic flights. Japan Airlines,
whose domestic flights have been smoke-free for two months, will
ban smoking on its international flights beginning April 1, 1999.
All Swissair flights have been nonsmoking since last June; to help
smokers, the airline offers nicotine chewing gum on long flights.
</P>
<P>
   Unruly Passengers
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials say there are too many unruly passengers on
flights, but they are divided about whether in-flight assaults and
incidents are increasing. TWA, for one, thinks they are becoming
more frequent _ which is why last spring three TWA flight
attendants and a pilot testified against an abusive passenger who
flew from New York to Orlando, Fla., with her child and 10 other
family members. For intimidating the flight crew and interfering
with crew members' duties, she was jailed for almost three months.
In Britain two months ago, a judge sentenced a London woman to 15
months in jail for head-butting a British Airways flight attendant
and spitting at another.

   There is nothing new about complaints of crowded airplanes,
cramped airline seats and high-priced hotel rooms that do not allow
guests to check in before midafternoon _ and which, when they do
finally check in, they frequently find dirty. But the complaints
have grown louder in each of the last five or six years since the
airline and hotel industries struggled back from the financial
brink.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is still surprising to hear strangers and
casual acquaintances say only half in jest that an economic
downturn could bring about a return to better service, lower
prices, more legroom and more amenities. But while any of that is
possible, industry executives say, it is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a recession, customer service would either stay the same or
possibly get worse, due to financial pressure on the airlines,''
said Travis Tanner, chief executive of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, who
is a former airline official. ``What will attract customers in a
downturn are changes in pricing and scheduling, as opposed to more
legroom, headroom or extra danish.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, airlines are better prepared for a recession or
economic slowdown this time around. Marginal or unprofitable routes
have been trimmed, and smaller, more efficient planes have replaced
the jumbo jets that once served even secondary markets. The same is
true even in ailing international markets; UAL's United Airlines
dropped its service between San Francisco and Manila last February,
for example, and Northwest Airlines recently reduced its capacity
in the Pacific by 15 percent when it took four 747s out of service
last month.

EVEN BEFORE THE EURO, A EURO MINDSET 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Currency traders attacked the lira in August, and were
repelled when the central bank intervened to make it clear that it
would maintain Italy's link to the euro, the single continental
currency that comes into official use on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Fazio, the Italian central bank president, disclosed
details of this summer's unheralded currency battle in testimony
before a Parliament committee last Thursday. With the Russian
financial system in meltdown and global investors shunning risk, he
said, traders had bet heavily that the lira would sink in value,
buying futures contracts that would insure big gains if it did.
</P>
<P>
   They backed off when the central bank signaled through its own
purchases of the lira on the open market that come what may, Italy
would support its own currency in preparation for the introduction
of the euro, the currency that will replace it.
</P>
<P>
   For Italians, the strength afforded by the lira's lock to the
euro was reassuring. Indeed, while the advent of the new currency
is still weeks away, the euro is already a financial force, both in
currency trading and in European capital markets, where it has
begun to alter the ways in which governments do business.
</P>
<P>
   As the euro approaches, European capital markets are melding
together. After Jan. 1, all securities will be denominated in
euros, and the currency will be used for electronic commerce. Not
until January 2002 will euro notes and coins enter circulation.
</P>
<P>
   But a vigorous market for euro-style bonds _ so-called
euro-fungibles, government or corporate securities issued with the
pledge of payment in euros _ already exists. After a fitful start
in 1997, fresh issues of these securities averaged $16.6 billion a
month in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Paola Lamedica, a bond strategist with Paribas in London, called
the volume ``above any realistic expectation,'' despite a slump
since August, when global markets plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with new bonds denominated in euros, and thus no
currency-exchange risk, investors in Milan, like those in Paris,
can shop Europe for the lowest prices and highest yields, and they
are doing so, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, countries that are comparative spendthrifts, such
as Belgium or Italy, are likely to find it harder to finance their
operations if they continue paying their way by accumulating debt.
So high was the level of public debt in the two countries _ more
than 120 percent of their gross domestic products, double that of
Germany and France _ that European officials bent the rules to
admit Italy and Belgium to the euro club, in which total debt was
not supposed to exceed 60 percent of national output. Both
countries have pledged to bring the level down.
</P>
<P>
   So is the party over? Not necessarily, experts say, though the
price of an entry ticket may have gone up dramatically. In the
past, accumulating debt had been relatively easy, given the captive
audience European nations enjoyed for their government securities.
With high savings rates and a lackluster stock market, for example,
Italians scooped up their government's notes as the investment of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there will be a wide range of options. Indeed,
Vincent Truglia, managing director for sovereign risk at Moody's
Investor Service in New York, compares Europeans to New Yorkers in
the 1970s, when the city's fiscal crisis left few local financial
institutions feeling obliged to purchase municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no large captive audience anymore,'' he said of Europe
as the new currency approaches. Lacking a central European
government and the equivalent of U.S. Treasury bonds, European
nations, much like American states and Canadian provinces, he said,
will be competing with each other, ``at lower prices and higher
interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some analysts use that comparison with North American
markets for state and provincial bonds to estimate future European
bond spreads.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Vanadia, bond strategist with Lehman Brothers in
London, believes that future spreads between, say, Italian and
German bonds will rarely exceed 50 basis points, or one-half of a
percentage point, except perhaps in times of severe economic
stress. ``It could be raised in case of recession,'' he said, but
in normal market conditions, he expects 20- to 30-basis-point
spreads.
</P>
<P>
   This past February, Italy offered the largest euro-denominated
bond issue thus far, bonds worth the equivalent of $7.2 billion.
Sweden and Finland have followed suit with lesser amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The appetite for these bonds has been ferocious. Much of the
buying, traders say, is by Japanese banks and other financial
institutions eager to broaden their bond portfolios, which had been
overweighted toward the dollar because of the fragmentation of
European currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the dollar's recent weakness is attributable,
they say, to Japanese institutions' liquidating dollar holdings in
exchange for the euro.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the limits for European governments? Analysts say
that, in part at least, the Maastricht treaty, the 1991 agreement
establishing the single currency, which sought to give the euro a
firm foundation by requiring low inflation and public debt levels,
will rein in European spending. Under the treaty terms, governments
whose deficit levels exceed 3 percent of output or debt levels
surpass 60 percent of output are threatened, theoretically, with
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be fine as long as European economies grow, a
severe test will come whenever European economies slip into the
next recession, and governments are tempted to spend their way out
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Still no one is quite sure whether the proposed penalties will
stick. And with left-leaning governments now in power in Germany,
France and Italy _ the major nations among the 11 first-stage euro
participants _ there is political demand for neo-Keynesian pump
priming to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment. Given that
political pressure, and the hard realities of high joblessness,
their interpretation of Maastricht's guidelines may prove to be
extremely liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Maastricht's strictures, said Truglia of Moody's, ``the
bottom line is governments are free to do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, bond markets, searching for criteria to judge risk, are
adding Europe's political risks to the calculation of economic
fundamentals _ and notably, the risk of nations' backing out of the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a theoretical point of view,'' Ms. Lamedica of Paribas
said, ``it's definitely possible,'' given that neither the
Maastricht treaty nor subsequent agreements forbid it.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, among the criteria Vanadia of Lehman Brothers uses
to judge national risk is a ``cessation risk,'' _ the chance that a
country might reintroduce a national currency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, speculators who attacked the lira in August were betting
on just that.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 28, Fazio said, as the dollar took a beating against
European currencies, Italy's central bank noticed heavy trading in
lire and German marks, as traders bet that the lira, with the
dollar, would be pulled down. In forward contracts pegged to Jan.
2, 1999, one day after the euro's introduction, speculators bet
that as many as 999 lire would be needed to purchase a German mark,
against 988 then. In the end, the central bank _ by merely showing
its face, and then by spending about $300 million supporting the
lira's value _ fended off the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, many experts believe that of the three largest
nations in the euro club _ Germany, France and Italy _ France runs
the greatest risk of leaving, because of low public acceptance of
the single currency. In a referendum, only 51 percent of the French
voted in favor of adopting the euro; in recent public opinion
surveys, support has dropped to about 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In July, though, Paribas canvassed thousands of its clients and
found that only 13 percent believed there was a chance of the euro
agreement breaking down, compared with 39 percent in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main threat,'' Ms. Lamedica said, ``would be political
disquiet over fiscal policy, if you entered a period of stress.''

A COLLEGE WHERE FEEDING CHICKENS IS AS IMPORTANT AS READING
CHAUCER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CRAFTSBURY COMMON, Vt. _ On the brink of dawn, when almost any
other college undergraduate would expect the right to sleep
undisturbed, Emily Seifert slipped stoically out of her warm bed,
pulled on boots and a snug jacket, and trudged into the bracing
chill of a New England autumn to lend a hand with the farm chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of fun being out at 6:30 and watching the sun come
up, because I wouldn't be out otherwise,'' said Ms. Seifert, a
19-year-old sophomore at Sterling College.
</P>
<P>
   Rising with the chickens _ and feeding them _ is part of an
education at Sterling, an iconoclastic Vermont institution that
integrates labor with learning at a time when some traditional
colleges are phasing out work programs and increasing financial aid
to allow students more study time.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling College considers how its students learn as no less
important than what they learn. So they build a stone wall before
sitting down in class to discuss what Robert Frost meant when he
began his poem: ``Something there is that doesn't love a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   They are taught, in a course called Forgotten Arts, to make
their own snowshoes and canoe paddles, which they then use to
venture out and study the woods and rivers of northern Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The college library and its computer room stay open all night.
But down the road, draft horses and other livestock await feeding
and watering at the campus barn. The college's agricultural courses
grow 15 to 20 percent of its food.
</P>
<P>
   And Sterling students learn to use an ax as well as a computer.
``A computer is a tool, too,'' said the college's president, John
E. Williamson. ``You have to keep your skills sharp in both of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling College, once a boys' preparatory school, became a
two-year junior college in 1987. This year, it expanded into the
smallest accredited four-year college in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The college has only 75 students on campus, a 140-acre expanse
of rolling meadows and woods. Fifteen second-year students are
deployed in field internships around the country. With its focus on
the environment, Sterling offers majors in sustainable agriculture,
wildlands ecology and management and the growing field of outdoor
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students in general hunger for meaningful work, and
stewardship of land speaks to them a lot,'' Edward Houston, the
dean of the college, said. ``In America we still consider that
owning and taking care of land is one of our deepest freedoms. But
taking care of land is hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston admitted that owning an ax was not obligatory at
Harvard, where he was an undergraduate. But at Sterling, he said,
``We think of ourselves as a liberal arts college. It's not just
about forest management. It's about a metaphor for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling students have gone on to become foresters,
veterinarians, farm managers, environmental lawyers and officials
in the Forest Service and National Park Service. At least one
became a doctor, another an architect, yet another an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things at Sterling that you can be good at,''
said Vanessa Gabriele, 21, a sophomore from Freeport, Maine. ``I
knew I'd learn enough about how to live my life, and it wouldn't be
a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sterling College doesn't fit the conventional mold, neither
do its students, many of whom chafed at learning by the book and at
the social frivolity of their adolescent peers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seifert was home-schooled in Fletcher, Vt., until she was
16, when her parents sent her to the local high school. She felt
uncomfortable with the other students. ``A lot of them were very
busy being obnoxious adolescents with raging hormones,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ms. Seifert said, ``I wasn't interested in going to
a college that was a lot like public high school.'' At Sterling,
she said, ``It's hands-on, not sitting and listening for hours and
hours, but doing things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Any college that launches its first semester by dispatching
students on an overnight orienteering course and ends it with a
four-day winter expedition that forces them to trek through 30
miles of snow and ice hardly meets anyone's definition of a party
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Sterling instills a real sense of the work
ethic,'' said Diane Morgan, the college's director of career
resources.
</P>
<P>
   When its graduates apply for paid jobs, she said, ``They're
willing to work long hard hours, and they don't mind being asked to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Shope, a 25-year-old junior from Seattle, worked for
several years as a firefighter and heavy equipment operator to save
enough money for Sterling's tuition, which is $18,900 a year,
including room and board. More than 70 percent of the students do
receive some financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say Sterling walks the walk,'' said Shope,
who plans to become a wildlife ecologist. ``The place is right for
me. It's the only place I ever considered seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's curriculum cuts across traditional disciplines. The
natural science course assigns each student a ``bio'' or plot of
wetland or woodland to study for its botanical and geological
secrets. In another course on forestry techniques, students use a
two-man crosscut saw and extract the timber with horses. They are
taught rock climbing to develop self-confidence as well as to
depend upon each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The learning that the students are doing outside the walls has
an absolutely direct connection with the syllabus that's given in
their classwork,'' said Williamson, a former Outward Bound
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the winter expedition offers the context
for a literature course, Triumphs of the Human Spirit, that
discusses such books as ``West with the Night'' by Beryl Markham
and ``South'' by the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton.
</P>
<P>
   The college's eight faculty members and seven adjuncts work
alongside their charges. ``The notion of doing meaningful labor
across generations has disappeared to a large degree,'' said
Houston, who teaches a survey course titled Humans and the
Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Serbanica, 18, from Madison, N.J., found his teachers
unusually accessible. ``They're always willing to talk to you and
find out what's going on,'' Serbanica said. ``At any other
university, they'd just be on their way to the next class.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jessica Vernay, from Cortland, N.Y., said they also pile on
the homework. ``There's more reading than I could ever do,'' Ms.
Vernay said. ``There's a lot of reading and a lot of assignments
and a lot of times where you have to sit down and write.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Vernay, who is 21, was allowed last year to go off
to Alabama to build an experimental house from bales of straw and
plaster.
</P>
<P>
   Houston said he wants students to cultivate a self-reliance that
goes beyond marketable skills. ``I like them to get away from the
idea that you have to buy everything,'' he said. ``I want to help
them see that consumerism is a fairly inadequate measure of
success.''

management, 80 percent of Sterling's graduates have pursued a B.A.
at other colleges as diverse as Middlebury, Oberlin, Sarah Lawrence
and the University of Vermont. But now that Sterling has been
accredited as a four-year institution by the New England
Association of Schools and Colleges, more students plan to stay on.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gaffney said her father, a philosophy professor, and her
mother, an antiquarian book seller, didn't want her to attend
Sterling for just two years. ``My parents were more interested when
they found out it would be four years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As the college expands, Williamson plans to add more dormitories
and a new science laboratory and recruit more faculty, and he has
put the library online. But he said he was determined not to have
Sterling's expansion eclipse the outdoor experiences that kept the
small college unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to make sure we don't turn all of that off
and put computer terminals in every room and keep the kids inside
all year,'' Williamson said.

WOODWARD RESPONDS TO EAPPENS' CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After months of silence, Louise Woodward, the British
au pair convicted of killing a baby in her care, has made a
last-minute move to challenge a wrongful-death suit brought by the
baby's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, hours after attorneys for Sunil and Deborah Eappen
filed a motion in federal court seeking &UR;  &LR; several million dollars in
damages from Woodward _ who was convicted of manslaughter in the
death of their son, Matthew _ her Boston lawyer filed a motion to
reopen the case.
</P>
<P>
   In the court filing, Woodward is also asking federal Judge
William G. &UR;  &LR; Young to vacate an injunction that prohibits her from
spending any money she might get from selling her story and
requires her to notify the court and the Eappens of any
contracts &UR;  &LR; for such activity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The injunction amounts to a ``seizure of her intellectual
property rights,'' according to the two-page motion filed by her
newly-hired Boston lawyer, John P. Ryan of the firm Sloane and
Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the injunction suggests Woodward may be getting
ready to tell her story for profit, something she has insisted she
would never do.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's legal maneuver, which follows months of claims that
she could not afford to hire a lawyer to fight the Eappens' suit,
comes at a time of personal and financial turmoil for her family.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities here and in Britain are
investigating claims that money from her $500,000 legal defense
fund may have been misused.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woodward's parents are separated, according to two
British newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The filing Tuesday &UR;  &LR; was the first time Woodward has responded
to the suit filed against her by the Eappens in June. Because of
her silence, Young issued a default judgment, meaning that the
Eappens had won the case. The only issue for Young to decide was
how much to award the couple, which he was expected to do by the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Ryan refused to say when or how he was hired by Woodward and
said that it would be ``really inappropriate for me to comment any
further at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, who is studying law at a London university, is also
challenging the claim in the suit that she engaged in ``willful,
wrongful or reckless conduct,'' relying instead on the findings of
Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel, who found that Woodward's
actions reflected ``confusion, fright and bad judgment, rather than
rage or malice.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-hour move will be opposed by attorneys for the Eappens,
who are expected to file a response Wednesday in US District Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodward now seeks another chance to challenge what she calls
`the seizure of her intellectual property rights,' apparently
because she desires to profit more from her killing of the Eappens'
baby,'' attorney Fredric L. Ellis, who represents the Eappens, said
in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knowingly and deliberately ignored this lawsuit for over
four months and she should not be able, at this late stage, to
change her course of action,'' Ellis said. ``This is just another
example of Woodward's disrespect for the American legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday how Woodward came up with the money to
hire a lawyer. In June after she defaulted in the case, Woodward's
English solicitor, Paul Barrow of Liverpool, said she could not
afford to fight the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got no money,'' Barrow said. ``It's as simple as that.
There's no hidden agenda. There's no other reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and her parents have long insisted that her story is
not for sale. She said she has turned down six-figure offers and
has proclaimed, ``I have no intention of profiting from this
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in June the Daily Mail newspaper, a British tabloid,
admitted it had paid Woodward's parents $60,000 for an interview
last November.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to England, Woodward's most highly publicized
interview was with the BBC, for which she was not paid.

   CRAFTSBURY COMMON, Vt. _ On the brink of dawn, when almost any
other college undergraduate would expect the right to sleep
undisturbed, Emily Seifert slipped stoically out of her warm bed,
pulled on boots and a snug jacket, and trudged into the bracing
chill of a New England autumn to lend a hand with the farm chores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of fun being out at 6:30 and watching the sun come
up, because I wouldn't be out otherwise,'' said Ms. Seifert, a
19-year-old sophomore at Sterling College.
</P>
<P>
   Rising with the chickens _ and feeding them _ is part of an
education at Sterling, an iconoclastic Vermont institution that
integrates labor with learning at a time when some traditional
colleges are phasing out work programs and increasing financial aid
to allow students more study time.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling College considers how its students learn as no less
important than what they learn. So they build a stone wall before
sitting down in class to discuss what Robert Frost meant when he
began his poem: ``Something there is that doesn't love a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   They are taught, in a course called Forgotten Arts, to make
their own snowshoes and canoe paddles, which they then use to
venture out and study the woods and rivers of northern Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The college library and its computer room stay open all night.
But down the road, draft horses and other livestock await feeding
and watering at the campus barn. The college's agricultural courses
grow 15 to 20 percent of its food.
</P>
<P>
   And Sterling students learn to use an ax as well as a computer.
``A computer is a tool, too,'' said the college's president, John
E. Williamson. ``You have to keep your skills sharp in both of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling College, once a boys' preparatory school, became a
two-year junior college in 1987. This year, it expanded into the
smallest accredited four-year college in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The college has only 75 students on campus, a 140-acre expanse
of rolling meadows and woods. Fifteen second-year students are
deployed in field internships around the country. With its focus on
the environment, Sterling offers majors in sustainable agriculture,
wildlands ecology and management and the growing field of outdoor
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students in general hunger for meaningful work, and
stewardship of land speaks to them a lot,'' Edward Houston, the
dean of the college, said. ``In America we still consider that
owning and taking care of land is one of our deepest freedoms. But
taking care of land is hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston admitted that owning an ax was not obligatory at
Harvard, where he was an undergraduate. But at Sterling, he said,
``We think of ourselves as a liberal arts college. It's not just
about forest management. It's about a metaphor for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling students have gone on to become foresters,
veterinarians, farm managers, environmental lawyers and officials
in the Forest Service and National Park Service. At least one
became a doctor, another an architect, yet another an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things at Sterling that you can be good at,''
said Vanessa Gabriele, 21, a sophomore from Freeport, Maine. ``I
knew I'd learn enough about how to live my life, and it wouldn't be
a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sterling College doesn't fit the conventional mold, neither
do its students, many of whom chafed at learning by the book and at
the social frivolity of their adolescent peers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Seifert was home-schooled in Fletcher, Vt., until she was
16, when her parents sent her to the local high school. She felt
uncomfortable with the other students. ``A lot of them were very
busy being obnoxious adolescents with raging hormones,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ms. Seifert said, ``I wasn't interested in going to
a college that was a lot like public high school.'' At Sterling,
she said, ``It's hands-on, not sitting and listening for hours and
hours, but doing things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Any college that launches its first semester by dispatching
students on an overnight orienteering course and ends it with a
four-day winter expedition that forces them to trek through 30
miles of snow and ice hardly meets anyone's definition of a party
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Sterling instills a real sense of the work
ethic,'' said Diane Morgan, the college's director of career
resources.
</P>
<P>
   When its graduates apply for paid jobs, she said, ``They're
willing to work long hard hours, and they don't mind being asked to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Shope, a 25-year-old junior from Seattle, worked for
several years as a firefighter and heavy equipment operator to save
enough money for Sterling's tuition, which is $18,900 a year,
including room and board. More than 70 percent of the students do
receive some financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say Sterling walks the walk,'' said Shope,
who plans to become a wildlife ecologist. ``The place is right for
me. It's the only place I ever considered seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's curriculum cuts across traditional disciplines. The
natural science course assigns each student a ``bio'' or plot of
wetland or woodland to study for its botanical and geological
secrets. In another course on forestry techniques, students use a
two-man crosscut saw and extract the timber with horses. They are
taught rock climbing to develop self-confidence as well as to
depend upon each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The learning that the students are doing outside the walls has
an absolutely direct connection with the syllabus that's given in
their classwork,'' said Williamson, a former Outward Bound
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the winter expedition offers the context
for a literature course, Triumphs of the Human Spirit, that
discusses such books as ``West with the Night'' by Beryl Markham
and ``South'' by the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton.
</P>
<P>
   The college's eight faculty members and seven adjuncts work
alongside their charges. ``The notion of doing meaningful labor
across generations has disappeared to a large degree,'' said
Houston, who teaches a survey course titled Humans and the
Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Serbanica, 18, from Madison, N.J., found his teachers
unusually accessible. ``They're always willing to talk to you and
find out what's going on,'' Serbanica said. ``At any other
university, they'd just be on their way to the next class.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jessica Vernay, from Cortland, N.Y., said they also pile on
the homework. ``There's more reading than I could ever do,'' Ms.
Vernay said. ``There's a lot of reading and a lot of assignments
and a lot of times where you have to sit down and write.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Vernay, who is 21, was allowed last year to go off
to Alabama to build an experimental house from bales of straw and
plaster.
</P>
<P>
   Houston said he wants students to cultivate a self-reliance that
goes beyond marketable skills. ``I like them to get away from the
idea that you have to buy everything,'' he said. ``I want to help
them see that consumerism is a fairly inadequate measure of
success.''

EX-PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES PLAN TO RUN AGAIN IN NIGERIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTA, Nigeria _ Surrounding himself with supporters in his home
village who call him ``father,'' Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo announced
Tuesday that he would seek the presidency of Nigeria, Africa's most
populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo, 61, who was president from 1976 to 1979 and remains
the only military ruler in this country to have given up power to a
civilian government, was immediately seen by many Nigerians as the
front-runner in the elections set for February.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria's military government has pledged to hand over power to
a civilian president on May 29. Obasanjo emerged from three years
in prison in June shortly after the death of the dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo comes from the Yoruba of the south and has strong ties
to the northern Hausa and Fulani, who dominate the military. He
presented himself as the man capable of holding together a country
whose regional, ethnic and religious fissures have widened in
recent months with the death of Abacha; the death of Moshood K.O.
Abiola, Nigeria's most famous opposition figure; and unrest in the
oil-producing Niger Delta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Nigerian has a stake in the survival and prosperity of
the country,'' Obasanjo said at a news conference that was attended
by politicians from all over the country and began with Christian
and Muslim prayers. ``This stake should be recognized. No section
or group should be made to feel disenfranchised or alienated.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo gained respect inside and outside Nigeria for handing
over power in 1979 to a civilian government. That administration
was ousted in a military coup a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Obasanjo was sentenced to 15 years in prison for an
abortive coup against Abacha, whose ruinous and ruthless rule over
Nigeria turned it into an international pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo was freed after Abacha's death by Nigeria's current
president, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. Abubakar, who has begun a
series of political and economic reforms, has said he does not
intend to run.
</P>
<P>
   After attending a book party in Lagos Tuesday morning, Obasanjo
traveled north to his farm here, a 25-mile trip made longer by the
frequent mile-long lines at gas stations. The general arrived an
hour late.
</P>
<P>
   He was driven into his estate on a dirt road, past banana
plants, and was led out of his car and carried onto a stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our father, Obasanjo, should be the president of this
country,'' said Kola Olanrewaju, 20, as he stood in the crowd. ``He
has been very good to us, and we all know what he can do. We are
all anxious about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Oluwole Abdullahi, 32, said: ``Obasanjo, we have known him to be
a very good father. He has served in government before. So I think
he is the only one in this country with the experience and
credibility to take us to the promised land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that he will get the respect of Great Britain and the
United States,'' Abdullahi added. ``We know that he will be
credible to the other people in the country _ to all the groups. Of
course, some people may have grudges against him, but people will
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The resentment is from some of the general's fellow Yoruba who
believe that he is too close to the Muslim Hausa and Fulani of the
north, and that in the close 1979 elections, he helped deliver
victory to a northerner over a southerner. What is more, many
Yoruba fault him for not having strongly supported Abiola, a Yoruba
who had converted to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's accepted by the international community for having given
up power and he's a military man, so he satisfies the North,'' said
Olisa Agbakoba, a prominent human-rights lawyer in Lagos and a
member of Nigeria's third-largest ethnic group, the Ibo, in the
south. ``The fundamental problem is that he does not satisfy his
own people in the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's announcement Tuesday had been expected since he
joined the People's Democratic Party last week. The party is one of
nine that recently qualified to present candidates in local
election scheduled for next month, as well as statewide and
presidential elections set for January and February, respectively.

MANY VOTERS PROFESS EXASPERATION WITH IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., N.Y., Texas)  (For related stories and graphics, see

<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice of the people had a decided edge of exasperation to it
on Election Day when voters were asked whether the threatened
impeachment of President Clinton was a factor in their ballot
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just voted and I didn't even think about it,'' said George
Gordon, a 96-year-old retired food broker, emerging from a public
school polling station on West 77th Street in New York City. ``It's
a lot of baloney. Who gives a damn about the man's sex life?'' he
added, frowning at the question in the sunshine. ``I've been voting
since the Depression and the only president I'd trust not to fool
around with women would be good old Harry Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside a Chicago voting place, Scott Vanderweele made a similar
quick survey of rectitude in the Oval Office. ``I don't know any
president _ maybe Jimmy Carter _ who hasn't done a little sleeping
around, and I don't know any 50-year-old man who hasn't lied about
it,'' said Vanderweele, a 49-year-old systems analyst, describing
the Republican Congress' impeachment inquiry as ``insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans professing to be tired of the whole sex-and-mendacity
scandal in Washington still betrayed that they were up to the
minute on its historicity. ``You know, Jefferson fooled around with
his slaves,'' said Joyce Schlichting, an 85-year-old New Yorker who
was sparkled-eyed as she emerged fresh from voting. ``Kennedy was
worse than Clinton, but Clinton got caught. Let him serve out his
term.''
</P>
<P>
   With Election Day results being awaited by politicians as a
referendum of sorts on the president's predicament in Washington,
voters randomly interviewed across the country tended toward
tolerance of the president and impatience with his Republican
inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just made me vote Democratic because Republicans keep
harping on it,'' said Anthony Duran, a 32-year-old television
cameraman, sipping coffee as an early voter in the Fairfax district
of Los Angeles. ``It actually made me come out and vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the raw numbers of surveys of voters leaving the
polls _ where Clinton's popularity amid the scandal was confirmed
once more _ were hardly a match for the angry edge to the views of
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted against the Republicans for being such pinheads, for
not getting down to issues,'' said Judy Malone-Stein, an artist and
teacher, after voting at the Lanier Middle School in Houston.
``It's a dangerous time in this country when people start prying
into peoples' private lives and not taking care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's critics were no less fervid. ``Clinton should be
booted out,'' said Joe Strack, a municipal employee in Oceanside,
New York. ``Whether by impeachment, resignation _ just leave. A
president has to have family values,'' he said. ``How can he speak
for this country now?''
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, surveys of voters leaving the polls found the
president's political capital holding strong, with 6 in 10 wanting
the impeachment inquiry to be quickly ended, without the House even
holding hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pushed too far,'' Andrew Paton said of the Republicans,
after voting in Houston, echoing the view of Christopher Larkosh in
Chicago that the impeachment issue ``really backfired'' on the
party. ``People are sick of hearing about it and mixing President
Clinton's personal life with the goings-on of government,'' Larkosh
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, N.Y., Carlos Gorbea, a playwright, voted and then
prodded neighbors on Montague Street: ``Did you vote yet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president violated his obligations by lying to
everybody,'' Gorbea said. ``But I wouldn't waste the time, energy
and money to impeach him,'' he added, denouncing the Republicans
even more strongly for driving the scandal forward at the expense
of what he said were far more vital issues and needs.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Jay Brady, an artist, said the impeachment
drive gave her a special impulse to vote. ``I would like to see the
hypocrites and the scolds have the rug of opportunity pulled out
from under them,'' she said, referring to Ken Starr, the
independent counsel, and Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys at the polls showed the voters making a distinction
between approving of Clinton as a president (about 60 percent) but
disapproving of him as a person (60 percent).
</P>
<P>
   One voter, Harvel Lewis, an engineer from Mount Vernon, N.Y.,
speculated that the president's resilience with the public may have
more to do with compassion amid their own private failings than
with his political popularity. ``I've been through that road before
myself,'' he said gently, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters found the scandal issue rooted in differences of
generation more than party. ``The majority of my peers can get over
it: the bar has been lowered since we were born,'' said Jennifer
Logothetis, a 28-year-old government worker in New York. ``We can
forgive infidelity. I have a problem with the lies. But
impeachment? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the president's scandal showed ordinary voters
inured to the luridness of it after 10 months of revelations as
candid as Chaucer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he lied, yes, he can't keep his zipper zipped,'' said
Shannon Havard, a restaurant manager and registered Republican in
Houston. ``But I don't think it affected how he ran the country.
Republicans are acting like it was the crime of the century.''

NEW ORLEANS TAKES ON GUN MANUFACTURERS IN LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Orleans last week became the first city to sue firearms
manufacturers for millions of dollars for the cost of violence
involving guns, and several other cities are expected to follow in
the next few months, city officials and gun control advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans suit is based on a claim of product liability,
that the gun makers have failed to incorporate enough safety
devices in their weapons, making them ``unreasonably dangerous.''
Other cities that are close to filing suits of their own are
Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, with San Francisco and Dade
County, Fla., also exploring the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But under a new plan being put forward by Mayor Edward G.
Rendell of Philadelphia, 30 to 60 cities might file suit in their
state courts, all on the same day, at some point next year, he said
in a telephone interview. The plan is under discussion by the
United States Conference of Mayors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of so many cities filing suit all at once would be
monumental for gun manufacturers,'' Rendell said. ``They don't have
the deep pockets of the tobacco industry, and it could bring them
to the negotiating table a lot sooner'' so cities would not have to
wait years for the outcome of trials, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans suit, filed on Friday in state district court
against 15 gun manufacturers, seeks to recover ``millions of
dollars'' that the city has spent to combat gun violence, including
hiring more police, raising police pay, improving emergency trauma
care and starting new youth programs, said Mayor Marc Morial.
</P>
<P>
   The legal action will be paid for by a group of prominent
anti-tobacco lawyers led by Wendell Gauthier of New Orleans, in
exchange for an agreement that they would receive 20 percent of any
settlement, or 30 percent of any damages award. The Center to
Prevent Handgun Violence in Washington, D.C., the group founded by
Sarah Brady, the wife of James Brady, the former White House press
secretary who was wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on
President Ronald Reagan, will serve as co-lead counsel and has
helped devise the legal strategy for the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Morial said he decided to act after ``witnessing the awesome
powers of intimidation of the gun lobby in the state legislature''
and then the recent gunshot killing of a gospel singer who was his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone needed to step up and break the ice,'' Morial said in
a telephone interview. The gun industry may control legislatures
around the country, Morial said, ``but the beauty of the American
legal system is that it levels the playing field,'' giving cities a
chance in court to develop a new way to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done everything we can as a city'' to reduce handgun
violence, Morial said. The homicide rate in New Orleans has dropped
by more than 40 percent since 1994. But Morial said it was now time
to try to force gun makers to produce safer products that could not
be used so easily by juveniles or criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell's position, however, represents a change. Earlier this
year his legal staff prepared a lawsuit, but he put it on hold
while he negotiated with gun manufacturers represented by the
American Shooting Sports Council, a lobbying group. Rendell said he
had hoped the talks would lead to quicker progress than litigation,
but that he was now ``pessimistic'' because the firearms makers had
failed to support state and federal legislation limiting buyers to
one gun a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the seminal test, and they failed it,'' Rendell said,
saying they offered instead what he described as ``the usual
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Feldman, the executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, in Atlanta, said that the New Orleans' suit ``was
just inevitable, too tempting, when you have a bunch of plaintiffs'
lawyers sitting on fat settlements from the tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said that the New Orleans suit ``won't solve one murder,
or won't stop one bad guy from taking a gun and using it against a
citizen of New Orleans.'' The real problem with murders using guns,
Feldman said, is that ``Society does not keep the people in prison
it's supposed to keep in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the New Orleans suit was based on a faulty
premise, ``alleging we have not used safety devices which have not
been invented yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These mayors had better think carefully about the political
liability they open themselves up to in their own backyard,''
Feldman said. The gun industry has the support of 80 percent of the
American people, he claimed. ``Two can play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The suits in Philadelphia and Chicago are likely to be based on
different legal theories than the product liability claim in New
Orleans. Rendell said a major part of Philadelphia's suit would be
to pursue the gun makers for creating a public nuisance, trying to
recover the $58 million a year he estimates gun violence costs the
city in excess police, court and jail expenses.

MUSICIANS OFFER THEIR TAKES ON '90S FORMAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We've often heard from industry types about where
they think music radio is heading, so we decided to check in with a
range of artists.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Chick Emily Erwin, for example, hopes the country format
spawns a range of micro-formats, such as modern country,
traditional country, bluegrass and country gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The format has grown a lot in terms of being multifaceted,''
she said. ``There's not just one type of country music _ it's like
rock 'n' roll where you have all this variety. Being from Dallas,
we have three major country stations that are all totally
different. I hope that happens across the country as well.''
</P>
<P>
   As for jazz, a format that draws nearly the same numbers as
classical music, pianist-composer Chick Corea says he's come across
just a handful of stations that present the music properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes real dedication to keep jazz radio on the air,''
Corea said. ``There are some good jazz stations throughout the
world. When you find a station where the DJ is playing what he
likes, that's the way it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Underground acts like turntable mixer DJ Spooky insist artists
can build a large fan base without radio support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget rap groups like Public Enemy and NWA blew up
without radio,'' he said. ``I don't mind not being on the radio.
Electronic music is this totally 21st-century folk music, and
people who are supposed to find it will find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roots-rocker Mary Cutrufello, though, still believes in the
power of rock 'n' roll radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, it gave me something to believe in as far as the
world and how I fit in,'' she said. ``I think radio still has that
potential, although I know it's a lot different today. But the
potential is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about hip-hop and rap, the genres responsible for some
of the decade's biggest sales?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even consider rap and hip-hop in the same category,''
says RZA, the brains behind rap outfit Wu-Tang Clan. ``These radio
stations say they're the place where hip-hop lives, but they're
really the place rap died.''
</P>
<P>
   A Web of opinions
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 radio types responded to a survey at the Web
site run by radio vet Don Barrett last week.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out talk is the fave format, followed by news and
alt-rock. In mornings, most people tune into Howard Stern on
KLSX-FM (97.1). Ken Minyard and Peter Tilden at KABC-AM (790) were
next, followed by the KNX-AM (1070) morning news.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents said they listened to radio an average of 21 hours
and seven minutes during the week and almost eight hours on
weekends.
</P>

TV DRAMAS ATTACK MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)  
(mk) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know who I want to meet?'' the good doctor asks. ``The sick,
twisted little bean counter who came up with the health maintenance
organization.'' As a prickly but secretly noble physician who
spouts outrageous truths, Ted Danson's John Becker is no more
believable than the saintly Marcus Welby was. But here, in a
promotional spot for the new CBS sitcom ``Becker,'' he sounds oddly
realistic, echoing opinions heard more and more often, on and off
television. Under the heading ``Becker on HMOs,'' the harangue
continues: ``You go in with a headache; they do a credit scan
before a CAT scan. Need surgery? They biopsy your wallet. HMOs, you
know what HMOs stand for? Have Money or Die.''
</P>
<P>
   More astute than the labored series itself, the promo sounds a
theme that medical dramas have also leaped on this season.
``Chicago Hope,'' ``E.R.'' and the new ``L.A. Doctors'' have all
included more than one major story pointedly attacking HMOs. The
shows reflect the widespread image of HMOs as faceless, heartless
monoliths that would rather save a penny than save a life. On
``Chicago Hope,'' Dr. Aaron Shutt (Adam Arkin) runs into an HMO
representative who has been reviewing the doctor's prescription for
an expensive drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that what you HMO guys do all day?'' Shutt asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're not torturing animals,'' says the rep,
acknowledging the image of his profession and offering viewers a
crowd-pleasing joke.
</P>
<P>
   Television is scrambling to catch up with a critical mass of
public opinion, as increasing numbers of people have joined
managed-care groups (one recent estimate puts HMO membership at 75
million, which is 30 million more than five years ago). The most
volatile stories are not about generic health insurance (though
those references abound, too), but specifically, angrily about
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The dramas give voice to the audience's common complaints about
HMOs: not enough individual attention or choice of doctors, a
maddening lack of logic in the rules of coverage, the Kafkaesque
nightmare of dealing with a slow-moving bureaucracy about an issue
as personal and urgent as health.
</P>
<P>
   And though in reality, patients may blame greedy doctors (or
cheapskate employers) for being saddled with frustrating HMO care,
television doctors are life-saving heroes, and this season their
noblest acts include standing up to HMOs. Every one of these plots
involves a heroic doctor who personally confronts a villainous
number cruncher or physician from an HMO. Fulfilling a viewer's
fantasy, the series doctors get in the faces of the supposedly
faceless bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy goes only so far, though. Even these fictional HMOs
never back down, sending one of the scariest social messages to
come along in a while: Health maintenance groups are even more
powerful than doctors.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Chicago Hope,'' Shutt prescribes the expensive new
medication only because a manic-depressive patient named Artie
reacts badly to two standard, HMO-covered drugs. The HMO
representative explains that the new drug is covered only for
hospitalized patients, not out-patients like Artie.
</P>
<P>
   ``So let me get this straight,'' Shutt says. ``Artie can have
the pills he needs only after he suffers the psychotic episode the
pills would prevent? That's your policy?''
</P>
<P>
   On ``L.A. Doctors,'' Dr. Tim Lonner (Matt Craven) has a similar
response. Astonished that an HMO called Steadicare won't cover
medication for a migraine patient, he tells his office
administrator: ``I don't get the logic here. We're talking about a
hundred bucks worth of pills a year. Without them, they're going to
have to cover three or four visits to the E.R. each month at $300 a
pop. Hasn't anybody explained that to them?''
</P>
<P>
   Both plots lead to volatile confrontations. Without his
medication, Shutt's patient attempts suicide, and Shutt later drags
the HMO representative into Artie's hospital room. ``It's your
fault!'' Artie yells. ``I'm not a name on your list. I'm a human
being, for God's sake.'' The HMO rep says he's sorry and walks
away. Shutt loses the insurance fight but gains the last word and
the moral victory. ``This is wrong, and you know it,'' he says,
though the rep is disappearing down the hall and can't hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Doctors'' is less realistic and more blunt than ``Chicago
Hope'' or ``E.R.,'' and Lonner's confrontation more comic as he
decides to shake some sense into the HMO account representative,
known to him only as 8294-7. Unable to get through the 17
voice-mail options on the HMO phone line, Lonner turns up at their
office, a Dilbert-like warren of anonymity. There he finds 8294-7,
a wimpy guy with a pocket protector and white hair, played by
Michael Pollard. Lonner grabs him by the neck and throttles him,
obviously reading the minds of viewers who have envisioned just
such a request for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But 8294-7 has his own complaints. ``Can you imagine having a
job where the whole world hates you?'' he whines. Even worse: ``I'm
covered by Steadicare. I just pray to God I never get sick.'' Yet,
heartless to the end, he rejects the claim one last time.
</P>
<P>
   Lonner seems to be a one-man crusade against HMOs. In another
episode, he arrives at the hospital to see one of his patients, a
high school athlete with pneumonia. A physician who introduces
herself as Meyer from the HMO won't let him see the patient or his
records. Like all the HMO characters, whether doctors or bean
counters, male or female, Meyer is dowdy and rumpled, in contrast
to the series' sleekly good-looking heroes. And though Lonner and
his three partners have an upscale private practice, they also have
mile-wide altruistic streaks and the bizarre habit of turning up at
their patients' houses. So Lonner sneaks in to see his patient and
decides that he requires a $1,500 test to rule out a blood clot.
It's no surprise that the HMO doctor refuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I sit, it looks like you're crunching numbers
deciding what people are acceptable to sacrifice so your profit
margin keeps going up,'' Lonner tells Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   And she offers the HMO side of the argument. ``The fact is,
doctor, most of the people that are in this hospital right now
could not afford to be here if it weren't for managed care. And
just for the record, my patients get the same quality care they
would if I were in private practice.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucky them,'' Lonner says sarcastically. There are more
complicated arguments to be made on both sides, but they are far
beyond the bounds of such dramas. And why should drama do anything
more? There are other places to note that some large HMOs have not
been doing well lately or that a saber-rattling doc like Lonner is
pure fantasy. Television dramas satisfy a different urge and serve
an important social function; the outraged doctors deliver a
message to HMOs, the fictional ones and all the real ones listening
in, with an impact beyond what any individual viewer could hope to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``E.R.'' plumbs the complexities of the issue with greater
dramatic results. In a recent episode, Dr. John Carter (Noah Wyle)
admits a boy with leukemia to the hospital to treat dehydration. In
fact, the child is not dehydrated, but the false diagnosis will
allow him to be treated for expensive in-patient treatment that his
insurance would not otherwise cover. Yet when the boy's mother
learns about the ploy she panics and takes him away, afraid of
losing their coverage completely if Carter's well-meaning scam is
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen?'' asks Lucy (Kellie Martin), the
medical student Carter is supervising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to die,'' Carter says of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier episode this season, an unconscious older woman is
brought into the emergency room and resuscitated by Carter. Soon a
cold-blooded woman in a drab blue suit arrives and announces, ``I
authorize admissions for Blue Beacon, her HMO. This lady's a DNR,''
meaning a patient who left do-not-resuscitate orders. ``I can't
justify an expenditure of $5,000 a day on a patient who should not
be alive, who does not want to be alive,'' she tells Carter. ``Her
choice was not to be resuscitated. That's what's in the HMO file;
that's the guideline I have to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The patient has no family. Carter turns off the machine, takes
out the tube helping the woman to breathe and sits quietly watching
her die.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not suffering. It's what she wanted,'' he says,
ostensibly to Lucy but just as much to convince himself.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, HMOs have been fighting back with frequent television
commercials meant to enhance the image of the industry as a whole.
One ad compares the cost of an expensive operation under most
health insurance plans with a $150 co-payment for an HMO member.
The commercials make television even more of a battleground in a
public relations war that HMOs are surely losing. A commercial is
no match for the image of the pained and thoughtful Carter watching
an old woman die.

A DIFFICULT JOURNEY FROM DAIRY FARMER TO LAWYER

 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONKTON, Vt. _ The classified advertisement was tucked away on
page 22 of the Addison County Independent, the twice-weekly paper
serving 7,000 readers in the shadow of the Green Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heartfelt thanks,'' it began, ``to all the friends and
neighbors who supported our family during the three long years Sam
was in Boston at school. You chauffeured the kids, helped Eugenie
fix things, chase heifers and keep a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad went on to make special mention of the teachers at the
Monkton Central School, ``who showed us enthusiasm for lifelong
learning.'' Even, it added, ``in a middle-aged farmer's quixotic
journey to law school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We survived,'' the ad concluded. ``Sam's home.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugenie Doyle, a 46-year-old substitute teacher at the
elementary school, spent $19.60 to place that ad on Oct. 5. It was
intended to reach the 1,687 residents of this farming and bedroom
community about 55 miles south of the Canadian border, who had
picked up the slack for her absent husband, however deeply it had
pained her to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say thank you,'' she said in an interview, ``you
realize how much you've been given, and how rich you are.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, battered by an economy that set the price of milk well
below what it cost to produce it, Ms. Doyle's husband, Sam Burr
made a change. After two decades as a dairy farmer _ the only job
he had ever really known or wanted, but a job in which he had run
up losses of $30,000 in some years _ Burr decided to go to law
school at age 44.
</P>
<P>
   He picked the law, he said, because he ``wanted to make a
difference.'' There were 3,688 dairy farmers in Vermont when he
bought his first farm in 1975; this year, there were 1,770. And
those who were left, Burr reasoned, could probably use an advocate
who understood the pressures bearing on them.
</P>
<P>
   Burr picked Northeastern University in Boston, 260 miles south,
because it was close enough for him to travel home on the weekends.
And after the first year, there was a co-op program, which meant
that he could alternate three-month terms on campus with
internships in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   But Burr, a wiry man with thick gray sideburns, also wanted to
escape for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, he had been forced to auction the last of the
59 heifers in his herd. And for a man who prefers the company of
cows to people _ his cows' names, including Rocket and Lulu, are
memorialized in a folder on his desk titled ``Gone but Not
Forgotten'' _ there was only so much empty barn he could take.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more frustrating than being on a farm,
watching things go downhill and not being able to figure out how
not to make it happen,'' he said, walking past rows of organic
strawberries grown by his wife to provide ``grocery money'' in his
absence.
</P>
<P>
   Holding out hope that they could find him something else to do,
his wife had begged him not to go to law school. ``It seemed like,
first the cows go, then the equipment, then the farmer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But scraping together tuition money from the sale of eight
residential lots carved from the farm's 270 acres, as well as with
loans from relatives, Burr departed for Boston in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be his first time in school there: Burr had
graduated from Harvard in 1974 with a degree in anthropology. He
had hoped at the time, he said, to attend a more rural school but
had been talked out of the idea by Harvard's president, Dr. Nathan
M. Pusey, a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   At Northeastern, Burr discovered that he loved learning about
the law and became an active participant in class discussions,
where fellow students referred to him as ``Pops.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his wife was feeling his loss. On the first day of
school after he had left, Ms. Doyle got a flat tire with her
daughter, Nora, then 11, and her twin sons, Silas and Caleb, then
8, in the car. She realized she would have to call a neighbor for
help, but that was hardly something that came naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers can be really isolated,'' she said. ``You kind of
stick to yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   She did call, and John Padua, who owns a nearby nursery,
responded. Ms. Doyle wanted to fix the tire herself. He took the
kids to school.
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, a neighbor who lives on the edge of the
family's farm, Robin Hopps, telephoned Ms. Doyle at the school to
say that the heifers being boarded on Ms. Doyle's property _ their
home farm had grown too small _ were loose. Rounding up her kids
from their classes, she returned to find the problem: her husband
had given permission, unbeknown to her, for a bull to be
temporarily lodged there as well. He had trampled the fence.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the bull got out again and was somehow held at bay
in Ms. Hopps' compost heap by her housemate, Wendi Sue Harper. Ms.
Doyle, twisting the animal's tail, got him home.
</P>
<P>
   There were other kindnesses by neighbors that Ms. Doyle logged:
one fixed the furnace in the middle of the night, another moved the
refrigerator, and any number picked up one child at soccer practice
while she picked up the other. For the children, the hardest part
was when their father ``had to leave on Sunday,'' said Caleb, now
12.
</P>
<P>
   Now Burr is home, and his family is getting used to the idea of
seeing him in a suit. Prior to this year, he had only owned two: a
black one from high school, which still fit, and one he inherited
from his grandfather two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is working, for the time being, at the Vermont Legislative
Council, a government agency that helps legislators draft bills.
Though he still hopes to advocate on behalf of his fellow farmers,
he has not quite figured out how.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Burr works in a cramped office adjacent to the
statehouse, where atop his computer sits a faded blue corderoy hat,
with the name of the Blue Seal grain company emblazoned on the
front.
</P>
<P>
   He had worn it, he said, every day of his life as a farmer.

YOU CAN WORRY ABOUT Y2K, BUT I'VE GOT BETTER THINGS TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have resisted all efforts to engage my interest in what will
happen when the first instant of the year 2000 arrives, and
suddenly the computers of the world and the folks who operate them
no longer know what century they're living in.
</P>
<P>
   There was a story in our paper the other day about how some
cyber-wonk business executives already are planning to stockpile
food and other essentials, buy generators and lay in extra firewood
as insurance against a possible widespread collapse of the social
order.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I am very relaxed about the doomsday date.
</P>
<P>
   What I intend to do on the first morning of the last year of the
present millennium _ a Saturday, that will be _ is pretty much the
usual.
</P>
<P>
   The previous day, on Friday, if the weather was at all fit for
it, I expect I will have been out playing hooky with friends and
dogs in the quail meadows. So there will be some urgency to get a
column written for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   I'll heat coffee water on the gas stove, stir up a cup of
instant and carry it in with me to the computer.
</P>
<P>
   If the local electric company has not been shut down by the year
2000 bug and there is power, I will write the column and send it to
the newspaper _ if there still is one.
</P>
<P>
   My computer will not care _ nor will I _ what year it is. For
us, one year is much like any other. In each one of them, there are
columns to be written. And now the first of those will be done and
out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose, on the other hand, that the power everywhere is
out. All the world's computers, mine included, will sit silent and
dead as stones.
</P>
<P>
   I have a manual typewriter. In fact, I have 20-some of them. But
they'll be no help, either. Because without computers, type cannot
be set, or the presses made to turn.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll just shut the room where I work, and dress again in
yesterday's rough clothes. Taking the essentials _ wood saw, a bag
of salt, shotgun and a pocket full of shells _ I'll head south to
the familiar woods, to the cabin that heats with wood and can be
lit by lantern or candle.
</P>
<P>
   And there my wife and I, with all our creatures around us, will
settle in to wait the crisis through.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, I suppose, they will get the radio up and
running. And we will listen to the news through crackling static,
as I used to do the winter I lived there.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the world's most isolated backwaters _ parts of Africa,
Australia's Outback and remote island outposts in the southern
oceans _ will life proceed in its accustomed way. Everywhere else,
chaos will rule.
</P>
<P>
   From Paris will come word that mobs have taken over the city,
and that the chief executives of the bourse, the telephone and
telegraph monopoly and leading high-tech companies have been led
into the Place de la Concorde and deprived of their heads.
</P>
<P>
   From Geneva to New York, depositors demanding access to their
frozen assets will be ripping down bank doors and helping
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage accounts will have become valueless. And with
telephone systems everywhere fallen silent, it will be impossible
even to complain. The tide of public rage will gather force with
each passing day.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the man who is often characterized as the father of
the modern computer revolution, and thus a principal author of the
crisis?
</P>
<P>
   There will be occasional reports, sketchy and often conflicting,
that Tom Gates _ or Frank Gates, or George Gates, or whatever the
devil his name is _ has been spotted in one or another seedy West
Coast motel, scuttling between hideaways like a frightened rat.
</P>
<P>
   What good is it to be the second- or third-richest man on the
planet, when your software won't work and all those marvelous
machines have stopped running and some punk newspaperman in Kansas
City can't even remember your name?

BUILDING THE BRIDGES OF FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILLIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 40 years ago, several women spoke on racism at a
synagogue sisterhood program.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the stores at which they couldn't shop, the
restaurants at which they couldn't eat, the neighborhoods in which
they couldn't live because of their race or religion.
</P>
<P>
   The program was so well received that the women were asked to
give more presentations. One thing lead to another and the group
soon became the Panel of American Women.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's goals were lofty, but its approach was
simple. The women talked to audiences of all ages about their lives
and the daily bigotry they experienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it as simple and as personal as we could,'' explained
Mamie Hughes, a longtime community activist. ``The goal of the
panel was to reach out to ordinary people. It stimulated people to
think about how we should all treat everyone with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the discussions were painful. Students would jeer,
racists would picket. But one conversation at a time, the women
opened minds and built bridges that turned into lifelong
friendships.
</P>
<P>
   The two area YWCAs hope to resurrect the panel's work. They
recently announced that they would establish the Panel of Empowered
Women, which will send women to youth groups, schools, churches and
other organizations to talk about their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create constructive public dialogue on issues
we think are important and in so doing, we're also accomplishing
our mission of eliminating racism and empowering women,'' said
Elaine S. Mann, a member of the board of directors of the YWCA of
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes the program will not only educate listeners about the
challenges we all face, but also empower the speakers, some of whom
will have gone from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think civic and civil dialogue is what's really missing in
our society right now,'' Mann said. ``There's a whole generation of
young people who don't know the history of women in this city and
this country. I really think it's important to relate to them how
far we've come and how far we have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said she is looking forward to participating on the new
panel because speaking one-on-one to young people makes a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is needed as much today as back then,'' she said. ``As long
as there are stereotypes, it is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel seems like such a simple solution to such complex
issues, but when people listen to one person's story, it is
impossible not to empathize, and empathy leads to understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has another chance to replace the walls of bigotry
with bridges of friendship.

ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS SEEK U.S. HELP IN HOLDING ACCORD
TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The fragile peace agreement between the Israelis and
the Palestinians was severely tested Tuesday as both sides appealed
to the United States to salvage the land-for-security accord,
underscoring the central role of the Americans as arbiters and
guarantors of the memorandum signed at the White House a week and a
half ago.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a pattern of postponements, Benjamin
Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, again delayed presenting
the agreement to his cabinet for ratification Tuesday. This time,
under persistent pressure from the right, he demanded that the
Americans wrest from the Palestinians a written timetable for the
arrests of 30 fugitives suspected in terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians accused Netanyahu of political brinkmanship and
implored the Americans to compel him to move beyond the impasse.
The Palestinians also said the Israelis were taking advantage of
the delay to establish footholds for new Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, which would be illegal once the agreement takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Netanyahu was trying to shore up
support on his right by acting tough, whether he was suffering
renewed pangs of mistrust toward the Palestinians, or even, as some
speculated here Tuesday, whether he was delaying the Cabinet vote
until Ariel Sharon, the foreign minister, recovered from the flu
and could help him face down the right-wing opposition among his
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said in Washington
on Tuesday that the Palestinians had submitted an acceptable
security plan, meeting their obligations for the accord to take
effect. He added that the Americans believed there was no reason to
delay implementation, which was supposed to start Monday under a
tight, 12-week schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our standpoint the agreement entered into force
yesterday, but we recognize there is a political-legal process that
Israel must go through,'' Rubin said. ``We still believe the
problems which that political/legal process could cause should not
or need not interfere with the implementation of the
responsibilities by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had spoken
with Netanyahu twice Tuesday, and is ``working hard to resolve
these problems that require clarification.''
</P>
<P>
   Two senior Israeli ministers said the Palestinians were supposed
to but did not include in the security blueprint a timetable for
the fugitives' arrest. One said the omission would endanger
approval of the agreement by the Israeli Parliament, which has been
rambunctiously challenging Netanyahu's leadership since his return
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, the trade minister, said the Israelis wanted in
writing an oral commitment that the Palestinians had given at the
Wye Plantation in Maryland: that the fugitives would be arrested 10
at a time on the second, sixth and tenth week of the 12-week
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a detail, it's one of the more central parts,
and when we finally got the plan from the Americans, it was
absent,'' Sharansky said. ``This needs to be fixed, and it can only
be fixed through the Americans, and we expect to see very clear
language from the United States. We need dates and figures,
something that can be checked and controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senior Palestinian officials, on the other hand, said
the Israelis were treading on dangerous ground in trying to force
sensitive security issues out into the open. Saeb Erekat, who was a
top negotiator for the Palestinians in Maryland, said the Israelis
were humiliating the Palestinian officials before their own people.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going out of their way to make it seem like we are
agents of the Israelis, ready to do their bidding,'' Erekat said.
``We have prepared a security plan. The Americans have accepted it.
The Americans should intervene immediately to make Netanyahu honor
his commitments, or this will go on forever and he will never be
satisfied.''

</P>
<P>
   In Israel, political analysts struggled to sort out Netanyahu's
motives for canceling his Cabinet meeting and raising anxiety about
the peace accord. Some speculated that he was trying to stand tall
and win one last concession from the Palestinians in order to win
not just a majority, but a decisive majority, in the ratification
vote. That would help him overcome threats to topple his
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants to pull out all the stops and make the vote
an impressive victory with complete razzle dazzle,'' said David
Makovsky, the diplomatic correspondent for Haaretz, a daily
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, who is in Spain, kept
quiet Tuesday; he has chosen so far to play a patient, undemanding
role. His colleagues did not restrain themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot understand that he wants us to arrest 30 Palestinians
when the Israelis close their eyes on settlement activities,''
Nabil Shaath, the Palestinian minister of transportation, said,
referring to a crop of settlers' trailer homes that have arisen on
hilltops in the West Bank in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer that the prime minister come out and say
honestly, `I can't go ahead with this memorandum instead of
creating new political deception,''' said Hassan Asfour, one of the
Palestinian negotiators at Wye.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the far right for agreeing to turn over
another 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, Netanyahu
first delayed presenting the Wye memorandum to his Cabinet on Oct.
27, saying he needed to see the Palestinian security plan first.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he announced he was postponing the implementation
until he received approval from his Cabinet and from his
Parliament. He set a Cabinet meeting for Tuesday, and sought and
received an acceptance from Arafat for a delay.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said the delay would push back the first Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank by only a few days.
</P>
<P>
   During the peace negotiations in Maryland, the Israelis had
dropped their demand that the fugitives be extradited, agreeing
that the Palestinians could arrest and try them under the
supervision of the Central Intelligence Agency. But it was a
difficult concession.
</P>
<P>
   So the prime minister's representatives made a phone call at 3
a.m. Tuesday, Washington time, to Dennis Ross, the American envoy.
They were seeking a written timetable for the fugitives' arrests
from the Palestinians before the Cabinet meeting scheduled for this
afternoon. They did not receive it, and the meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Netanyahu was still regaining his balance Tuesday
morning from a raucous Parliament session on Monday, in which his
gambit to attach a motion of confidence in his government to a
budget vote almost backfired. At the last minute, his budget
passed, and his government was endorsed, but only by a one-vote
margin.
</P>
<P>
   He had been saved by the Israeli Arab members of Parliament, who
abstained from voting so his government would not be toppled in a
budget vote, derailing the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, though, Netanyahu turned on his saviors, saying he
would not put himself in the position of relying on ``non-Zionist
votes'' to carry a peace agreement through the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him not because I love him but because I love the
peace process,'' said Abdul Wahab Darawshe, the leader of the Arab
faction in Parliament. ``Today he has turned and slapped us in the
face. It's a real crime. It's a very racist declaration.''

CONGRESS MENDING HOLES IN THE FARM SUBSIDY SAFETY NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just two years after passing the
market-oriented Freedom to Farm Act, Congress is re-knitting
agriculture's safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to election-season pleas from the Farm Belt, Congress
recently added $6 billion in farm aid to the federal budget, nearly
doubling farm subsidies this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those extra subsidies strike some as a departure from 1996
legislation aimed at phasing out subsidies over seven years while
giving farmers the right to plant what they wanted, when they
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Letting the market determine who will survive was part of what
the Freedom to Farm Act was supposed to do, said Russell Lamb,
senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. Now,
he said, Congress has done an about face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $6 billion in new farm aid is misguided,'' Lamb said.
``One of the things we were supposed to get in (the) '96 Freedom to
Farm Act was to allow the market to work and guide agriculture
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody engaged in normal business knows that sometimes you
make money and sometimes you lose. The latest farm bill suggests we
are not going to let that happen to U.S. agriculture. We are going
to let them make money like they did in 1996 and 1997, then when
things get tough, we are going to bail them out.''
</P>
<P>
   From his 1,100-acre grain farm in Platte County, the state of
agriculture still looks pretty grim to Brad Foster.
</P>
<P>
   His fields are soggy. Bin-busting harvests have spilled a global
grain glut at the same time that exports to Asia have dwindled
away. Commodity prices across the board have been on a deep slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' Foster recently groused as he waited for
parts to get his combine running again. ``Nothing has been good
this year. Prices are low. It's too wet. Exports are ruined. I just
think it is a very poor farm economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Farm income was estimated to fall to $54.3 billion from $60.8
billion last year _ a 12.1 percent drop _ before the extra subsidy
money was ponied up. Indeed, some observers believe today's
elections may have been a big motivator for subsidies that altered
the original Freedom to Farm plan.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Flinchbaugh, professor of agricultural economics at Kansas
State University, said he is not surprised that farmers got extra
money during an election year; just about everybody else did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we have done it from a pure economics standpoint? No.
Should we have done it from a political standpoint? Yes,''
Flinchbaugh said. ``It was interesting to me that it was never a
question of whether they would provide some relief. Even the
conservative righters, even Dick Armey kept quiet. It was a
question of which party would give the most.''
</P>
<P>
   But agriculture supporters, including two Kansans, U.S.
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts,
say the extra money does not mean an end to the Freedom to Farm Act
but provides a safety net for harder times than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the aid bill ``does represent a slight turn of
direction from Freedom to Farm...This is a recognition by the
administration and the majority in Congress that Freedom to Farm
did not provide an adequate safety net. I wouldn't call it a
repudiation of Freedom to Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, one of the architects of the Freedom to Farm Act, did
not object to giving farmers more money.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts thinks immediate problems could have been dealt with for
the $4.2 billion in additional aid Republicans originally proposed.
But he makes no apologies for supporting extra money for farmers.
Roberts said it was a victory that Congress beat back efforts to
return to the old system of supports, where subsidies had strings
attached that hampered farmers' efforts to compete globally.
</P>
<P>
   When Freedom to Farm was passed, Congress promised to expand
export markets available to farmers, Roberts said. Instead of
expanding export markets, he said, the United States has imposed
sanctions against countries that previously bought a lot of U.S.
grains and meat, cutting into export options.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what we are facing globally, if you provide
emergency assistance but kept Freedom to Farm intact, that is a
victory,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman and Roberts agreed that although prices are low,
harvests in Kansas and Missouri have been good the last couple of
years and farmers in this area are probably getting by. It has been
the Dakotas and the Southwest that have been hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is we do not have a farm crisis nationwide,''
Roberts said. ``The weather in the South and the problems in the
northern Plains created the urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the agriculture sector, including some farmers, admit
that at least some of the problems plaguing American agriculture
are its own making. Some farmers are just learning the lessons that
a free market has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Storage problems, for example, are in part a result of so many
farmers deciding not to sell grain last year because grain prices
were roughly a dollar a bushel below high 1996 prices. Now, with a
glut of grain and less demand from Asia, prices have fallen, and
farmers can't find storage space because it is filled by last
year's crops. As a result, those without their own storage are
having to sell their crops at the deflated prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an old guy call last night who has `96, `97 and `98
wheat stocks in storage, unpriced,'' said Flinchbaugh from Kansas
State. ``I told him he is not getting any sympathy here. On the
other hand, I don't remember a time in history when things have
turned so fast. Eighteen months ago we had $6 bushel wheat. Now
it's $2.50. Changes like that make it very political.''
</P>
<P>
   As bad as things are, they are not critical, said Jay Armstrong,
who farms about 2,000 acres in Atchison County, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is comparative in life,'' said Armstrong.
``Compared to the last three years where prices were high, it is
not good. Incomes will be lower. But compared to what we went
through in the early 1980s, we are not in a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Pine, whose family farms about 4,000 acres near Lawrence,
said: ``From my perspective, if farmers had pretty good yields in
last few years then they are not completely down and out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But agriculture will be in trouble if prices don't improve and
world markets don't come back, said Pine, who became president of
the National Corn Growers Association Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Using the jargon of international bankers, Pine, Armstrong and
Foster said that more important than the extra subsidies was
approval of $18 billion for the International Monetary Fund, which
Congress hopes will help restore depressed Asian economies and
those nations will resume buying U.S. grain. In their view,
Congress now needs to pass fast-track authority for the
administration to expedite international deal making and it needs
to remove food sanctions from countries so grain exports are not
lost to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always talk about living in a global economy but I don't
think it had soaked in to many farmers before,'' Armstrong said.
``Today, I think the rank-and-file farmers know what it means. I
don't hear farmers blaming the government for their lot in life.
More of them realize Asia was buying goods and now it has stopped.
They look at the IMF and things like that and suddenly it clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year may pose a bigger problem than this year. If commodity
prices don't improve and the economy weakens, farmers will face
another year of losses. Moreover, chances of getting post-election
congressional help are a lot slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we going to do next year?'' Roberts asked. ``We may
not have a budget surplus next year if we have to pay out a lot of
unemployment, for example. The surplus can vanish fast. Next year
is not an election year. It will be much tougher next year to pass
a bailout package.''

INDONESIAN ARMY IS BLAMED FOR ROLE IN SPRING VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Members of the Indonesian military helped
to instigate the violence and looting in the Indonesian capital in
May that killed nearly 1,200 people and led to the resignation of
President Suharto, a fact-finding team has concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-member investigating team, including representatives of
the government, private groups, the armed forces and the Commission
on Human Rights, also concluded that the military had been
ineffective in controlling the chaos that engulfed the capital and
four other cities from May 13-15.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by members of the clergy, the military and the Rights
Commission, Marzuki Darusman, the head of the team, announced the
results on Tuesday after a three-month investigation. Government
officials failed to show up for a meeting to receive the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the involvement of many sides from local thugs and
political and mass organizations to the involvement of certain
members and elements within'' the military, Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that much of the violence had been
organized and provoked. Suharto's role in the rioting was not
addressed, with the report attributing the chaos to ``a conflict
between the political elite, related to the continuity of national
leadership, and a deterioration of the monetary situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The report confirmed that 66 women, most of Chinese descent, had
been raped during the three days of rioting and that 10 others had
been victims of sexual assault and harassment. Ethnic Chinese
residents, who are predominant in the country's mechant class, were
a target of many of the rioters.
</P>
<P>
   The number of rape cases verified in the report is far lower
than earlier reports by rights groups that 168 women had been
raped, but higher than estimates by the military, which said it had
investigated and found no evidence that any rapes had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the investigating team, Asmara Nababan, attributed
the discrepancy to difficulties in verifying the rapes in the
climate of fear that followed the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were fears that the team's findings would be
watered down to protect the interests of the military and
government officials, the report turned out to be frank.
</P>
<P>
   Two military officers were singled out as bearing the most
responsibility for the unrest. The team called on the government to
investigate the role of former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, a
son-in-law of Suharto who was the commander of an elite army unit.
</P>
<P>
   The officer who was in charge of security in the capital during
the riots, Maj. Gen. Syafrie Samsuddin, was found not to have
carried out his duties properly, and the report said he ``should be
held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsuddin remains an active officer in the Indonesian military,
while Subianto was ousted from the military in August on charges
that he was involved in the abduction and torture of political
activists earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nababan said that the report could not be used as a legal
document for prosecution purposes but that he hoped that its eight
recommendations, including a court-martial for Subianto, would be
taken seriously.

YES, THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE AIR DURING THIS `SECOND SPRING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH BAUM BIGUS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Lilac bushes filled with purple flowers.
Crabtrees bursting forth in shades of pink. Rhododendron and
azaleas awash in colorful blooms.
</P>
<P>
   It's not spring, and it's not your imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners may have begun their wintertime hibernation, but some
vegetation has launched into bloom in the last several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a fairly common sight, and it's been going on
for about a month,'' said Dennis Patton, horticulturist for Johnson
County Kansas State Research and Extension.
</P>
<P>
   Patton blamed the premature blooms on a hot, dry summer and
sporadic rainfall, which results in less-developed root systems and
plants that don't cope well when conditions get dry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plants don't think they've gone through winter,'' he said,
``but because of the stress they've suffered, they say `Hey, I'm
not doing that great so I'd better bloom and reproduce.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Stiens, nursery manager of Suburban Lawn &AMP; Garden at 10501
Roe Blvd., said many ornamental trees there have been blooming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from those warmer temperatures we've been having,
reaching the 70s for several days at a time,'' Stiens said.
</P>
<P>
   The temperatures seemed warm during October, but they were not
out of the ordinary, said Jeff Manion, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   He said the temperatures were running about 2 degrees above
normal for October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The early part of the month was cool and then in the latter
half we were warm,'' he said. ``Normally our highs are in the 60s,
not the 70s.''
</P>
<P>
   A killing frost _ when temperatures fall below 32 degrees
Fahrenheit for several hours _ would change things dramatically.
The average first killing frost in this area usually occurs around
Oct. 26, and Manion said it is possible that could happen this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Patton said the premature blooming may have an effect next
spring, when plants may not be as showy or have as many blooms as
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chalk it up to Mother Nature and enjoy the show,'' Patton
said. ``The plants know what they are doing, so leave them alone.
Don't prune them, because you may take off the spring bloom which
already is growing.''

 &HT;    Ellen Tracy show draws a crowd
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much of the fashion pack here to see designers'
spring/summer '99 collections arrived at the Ellen Tracy runway
show in Bryant Park's main tent Tuesday morning bleary-eyed yawning
and yearning for a decent breakfast. With their hair still damp
from the shower and their legs unsteady as they shuffled to their
seats, many in the 500-seat venue looked more in the mood for
cereal than another episode in this serial known as Fashion Week.
</P>
<P>
   What kept the show's attendants alert was the snap, crackle and
pop elements taking place on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the label's upcoming 50th anniversary, Ellen Tracy
design chief Linda Allard dispatched 66 outfits that seemed to
shift from modern to retrospective and back to modern again at the
snap of a finger.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of an otherwise flawless presentation, an
unnervingly loud and incessant crackle began emanating from the
ceiling-mounted loudspeakers that had been pumping a string of
danceable, funk-rock tunes.
</P>
<P>
   And in a worst case scenario of what can go wrong when a model
wears a tube top, the striking and buxom African-American model
Oluchi wound up flashing the crowd two out of her three trips down
the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's now a favored label among career women, Ellen Tracy
started out as a sportswear company and Allard's designs signaled a
return to active lifestyle looks. Allard designed for the next
warm-weather season with three considerations in mind: ease,
simplicity and comfort. Placing far less emphasis on suits than she
has in recent seasons, she proposed a wardrobe built of
mix-or-match pieces in pale or neutral colors (off-white, coral,
blue, grey, bronze and black), luxuriant fabrics (diaphonous linen,
leather, ribbed rayon and textured cotton) and easy-going
silhouettes that looked easy to move in.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom of movement _ and of spirit _ were also extolled at the
early morning (so early in fact, that nearly half of the invited
guest didn't attend) Pleats Please show by Issey Miyake.
</P>
<P>
   In its premiere showing on American soil, Pleats Please paid
homage to such icons as comic books, NASA and the wild, wild west.
</P>
<P>
   Mini-pleated sportswear separates were printed with characters
and scenes from Frank Kozick's vintage ``pulp'' cartoons.
Earth-tone vest outfits were fringed and worn with floppy mesh
cowboy hats. Photos of the first moon landing were screened onto
pleated dresses. And for the finale, Chinese artist Cai Guo Qiang's
gunpowder abstracts were printed onto sheer, pleated evening gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Coming Thursday: Ralph Lauren, Dana Buchman and Michael Kors

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Designer Draws Competition: It's a rarity when a designer's
runway show is attended by a competitor in the industry. That's why
eyebrows arched when Carolina Herrera was spotted in the audience
for Tuesday afternoon's Oscar de la Renta show.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables there to see de la Renta's designs for the mature
woman with money included Barbara Walters and Ivana Trump.
</P>
<P>
   One Atlanta-based tele-journalist with things in common with
Herrera and de la Renta said it shouldn't have seemed odd to see
one at the other's show.
</P>
<P>
   Noelle Garcia hosts a program called ``De Modas'' on CNN's
Spanish-language network; acting as the Latina equivalent to CNN
``Style'' host Elsa Klensch. She says there's a special unity among
designers of Latin descent _ the Dominican de la Renta and the
Venezuelan Herrera included.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, it's natural for Latin people from different
countries to be competitors because of nationalist pride,'' Garcia
said. ``On the other hand, we all can be proud of each other
because we think of ourselves as underdogs.''
</P>
<P>
   ROLE CALL: Thanks to a number of film and television actresses
who have shown up at shows this week, Fashion Week has started to
regain some of the celebrity cache it seemed to have lost in recent
seasons past. Screen queens spotted so far include: Lauren Holly,
Ashley Judd (with mom Wynonna in tow), Shannen Doherty, Lela
Rochon, Leslie Mann and Gretchen Moll. Rising R&AMP;B star Mya has also
made several appearances.
</P>
<P>
   GOING CO-ED: New York designers will begin showing their men's
and women's collections back-to-back beginning with the
fall/winter' 99 shows to be staged Feb. 11-19. According to Fashion
Week's governing body, 7th on Sixth: menswear will be shown the
first three days, designers who make clothes for both sexes will be
encouraged to show on Valentine's Day and womenswear collections
will show on the final five days.

 &HT;    Georgia Public Television among first to air HDTV show
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_G eorgia Public Television (GPTV) will become the first
public television system in the country to air a performance taped
in the new format of High Definition Television, which offers
sharper images and CD-quality sound.
</P>
<P>
   The performance, by opera singer Jessye Norman, will air at 9
p.m.EST on Dec. 21. It will be offered to each of GPTV's nine
stations in the state.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV, while just starting to make its appearance, is important
to public television and GPTV. The programming there, including
concert performances and nature shows are particularly well-suited
to what HDTV offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television is heading this way and we want to be in the
vanguard,'' said Kent Steele, GPTV's director. ``This first show
lets us stick our toe in the water. It will be good experience for
our engineering staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many, though, will be able to view GPTV's HDTV offering. For
one, few HDTV-ready sets, which start at $7,000, are available and
have been sold. And two, most cable systems are not technically
able to deliver the HDTV signal at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Steele believes HDTV will someday become the standard.
``In the long run, HDTV will be reasonably priced and widely
available,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's different, HDTV requires new cameras and editing
equipment. None of this is inexpensive, so GPTV has a strong
partnership deal with NHK Japan Broadcasting. That is the Japanese
counterpart of public television.
</P>
<P>
   ``NHK has a truck with HDTV filming and editing equipment
roaming the country,'' said Steele. ``We were going to film Norman
anyway and were lucky to sell the performance to NHK.''
</P>
<P>
   NHK is sending its HDTV truck from New York to Augusta this
week, where it will film two performances of Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Norman has been named to the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV differs from television today in that it is a digital
signal. HDTV, for example, delivers 2 million pixels _ dots that
make up the picture on the screen _ in contrast to the current
system's 250,000. The higher the number of pixels, the sharper the
picture. And an HDTV picture has 1,080 lines per screen, nearly
double the current number. The result is a very lifelike picture.

 &HT;    New approach to teaching combines various media
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Aside from the overhead projector and the video tape,
there probably have been no bell-ringing changes in the tools of
classroom teaching in many a decade. But Gregory Abowd and his
partners at Georgia Tech may have changed that, at least for
college students.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed Classroom 2000, the new approach pulls together several
media and brings them to bear on the teaching process. At the same
time, the system frees students to concentrate and participate
fully in class without the furious, head-down note taking
characteristic of most college classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It is a system that can reward the most aggressive students with
extra information, and provide a safety net and special assistance
for others.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system, in the works since 1995, specially outfitted
classrooms are augmented with gear that includes one or more
electronic white boards, as well as audio and video equipment.
Slides and other images projected on white boards are recorded
along with the voice of the lecturer, and even extra notes written
in the margins of slides as the class progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a software program called ZenPad, the system captures
the package of information on the Internet and organizes it into
Web pages and it posts it on the Internet. Registered students in
the class, at their convenience, can access the lessons on the
Internet later and save them to study.
</P>
<P>
   All of the teaching materials, and even additional material
fetched from the Internet via a Web browser, can also be included
in the presentation and preserved as part of the electronic class
record. Only students with login authority can access the class
material.
</P>
<P>
   I watched a 90-minute lecture to a computing class by Abowd, who
directed the development of the Classroom 2000 software, and sensed
a unique atmosphere. There was a remnant of students, obviously
wedded to old ways, who followed the lesson in a text book and took
a fair amount of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Standing room only
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, came to class empty handed and kept their eyes
fixed on the presentation, following the points closely and
frequently asking questions to elicit additional information. A
couple of students slept in the back of the class.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for weary students is the program functions also
as a kind of safety net that will preserve the continuity of the
classes for those who miss sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The class had standing-room attendance, which Abowd said is
normal, indicating the technology does not encourage students to
miss and catch the evening show instead.
</P>
<P>
   The class I witnessed, mostly for doctoral students, was a
history of interaction between humans and computers. It dealt with
the enormous amount of effort since the late 1940s in places like
Xerox Park in California and elsewhere to make the computer not
only more powerful, but more handy and productive as well.
</P>
<P>
   Passages from books were projected and worked into the
electronic record, along with Abowd's comments, explanations, as
well as input from the class.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interesting points were the origins of ``windows'' or
multiple displays of the work the computer performs, the invention
of the mouse, which sped up commands, and the introduction of the
desktop, simulating the way humans organize activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``An historic moment in computing,'' Abowd said, ``was the
introduction of the desktop on a Macintosh computer during (a
commercial on) the 1984 Super Bowl, making the desktop a useful
'metaphor' that helped to de-mystify computers for many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Said one student: ``Well it didn't de-mystify it for everybody,
given the fact that many people still avoid computers.'' All
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Students seem to appreciate the new classroom approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that you can add your own notes and comments,
recording your reactions at the time they are presented,'' said Sam
Collins, a second year doctoral candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the flexibility it gives students, including a chance
to go back and get material you may have missed,'' said Tanisha
Hall, a first year doctoral student.
</P>
<P>
   Multitalented teacher
</P>
<P>
   Several other schools, including Kennesaw State University(Ga.),
Georgia State University, and Darton College(Ga.), are using
Classroom 2000 to teach certain courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it for teaching math,'' said Meghan A. Burke of
Kennesaw. ``But I use it differently from others, preferring to
write equations on the white board while adding my voice to the
presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Burke continued: ``Mine is a more traditional way of
teaching, but it presents more options to the students.''
</P>
<P>
   The Classroom 2000 technology has broad possibilities for
college classes beyond science and math, depending on the
resourcefulness and ingenuity of teachers, she said. For instance,
the Shakespeare scholar, striding across the room reciting Lear
would have more powerful influence on students watching with heads
up, relaxed and paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   In another setting, the technology could prove useful also to
business and industry for teaching complex subject matter and and
providing in-service training for employees unaccustomed to taking
voluminous notes at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   A study of the effectiveness of Classroom 2000 is now in
progress and results are expected later this fall, Georgia Tech
officials said.

 &HT;    PBS takes good look into great cop series
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television covers practically everything. Except itself. With
the exception of little puffball pieces on ``Entertainment
Tonight'' and its wannabes, and John Leonard's beard-tugging
critiques on ``CBS Sunday Morning,'' television is usually too busy
being too full of itself to step back and look at itself.
</P>
<P>
   So PBS' ``Anatomy of a Homicide: Life on the Street'' (PBSD
check local listings) is noteworthy, first, purely as a curiosity:
a full-length, serious documentary on the making of a TV drama. But
it's much more than that: ``Anatomy'' is a sharp, thoughtful take
on that sharpest and most thoughtful of TV cop shows, ``Homicide.''
(A detailed exegesis of ``Suddenly Susan'' would probably lack the
same heft.)
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Ted Bogosian spends an hour exploring what makes
``Homicide'' tick and a how a single episode was put together:
``The Subway,'' the harrowing 1997 show in which a man was pushed
onto a subway platform and trapped between cars with less than an
hour to live. Following the one-hour documentary, PBS then runs the
original episode, commercial-free, a highly unusual network-to-PBS
crossover.
</P>
<P>
   Bogosian outlines the situation of ``Homicide'' well: its
ongoing ratings problems (it usually is third behind ``20/20'' and
``Nash Bridges'' at 10 p.m. EST Fridays), its critical acclaim, its
refusal to work in cop-show conventions and easy endings where
every crime is solved.
</P>
<P>
   He interviews everyone from producers Tom Fontana and James
Yoshimura (who wrote ``Subway'') to outgoing NBC entertainment
president Warren Littlefield and now-departed series star Andre
Braugher, portraying the never-ending skirmish between art and
commerce that defines every decent TV series. Television is
possibly an even more collaborative medium than movies, and
watching Yoshimura get a constant stream of suggestions from NBC
and others, then re-tool his script to accommodate his many
masters, brings to life that old adage about being ``nibbled to
death by ducks.''
</P>
<P>
   The topper, finally, is getting to see ``The Subway'' after
watching the story of how it was conceived, cast and filmed.
Although ``Homicide'' has been a little wobbly this season, it
still stands as the single finest police show of the '90s, and
``The Subway'' as one of its finest episodes.
</P>

   Tutu with `60 Minutes'
</P>
<P>
   A ``60 Minutes'' crew was in Atlanta on Tuesday to interview the
Rev. Desmond Tutu for a story involving Amy Biehl, the American
student killed in 1994 near Cape Town, South Africa, at the hands
of an angry mob. Tutu, who is teaching at Emory University this
fall, chaired the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that granted
Biehl's killers amnesty earlier this year. Biehl, a Fulbright
scholar, was in South Africa to aid voter registration for the
nation's first all-race election in 1994 that ended years of
apartheid. Biehl's parents, Peter and Linda Biehl of Newport Beach,
Calif., had attended the amnesty hearing and publicly forgave their
daughter's killers after the men apologized for the slaying. Leslie
Stahl is the ``60 Minutes'' correspondent for the Biehl story,
which could air on CBS in as little as six weeks.

RELIEF EFFORT IN HONDURAS NEEDS HELP, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Honduran authorities struggled on
Tuesday with meager resources to deal with catastrophic damage from
torrential rains and floods spawned by a hurricane, as the official
death toll here climbed to 362. Experts expect that figure to go
far higher.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said thousands were still trapped by flooding in
remote regions. Most major roads and bridges were destroyed by
flood waters or blocked by mudslides after a week of relentless
rain dumped several feet of water on this impoverished country in
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials estimated that at least 5,000 people have
died and that 600,000, 10 percent of the population, have lost
their housing.
</P>
<P>
   Entire neighborhoods in Tegucigalpa, the capital, were washed
away on Friday, when the Choluteca River broke over its banks and
inundated many parts of the city, burying houses, cars and people
in mud.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening the waters had receded, and the sun came out.
Thousands of tired and stunned people returned to the wreckage of
their houses. Many had lost everything they owned. Others had lost
family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost everything,'' Ana Mercedes Ramirez, 38, a homemaker,
said as she peered into the remains of her house in the La Oya
neighborhood. What was once her living room was filled with several
feet of mud. ``I've never seen anything like this, not even with
Hurricane Fifi did anything like this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifi, in 1974, left 10,000 Hondurans dead.
</P>
<P>
   The latest storm, called Mitch, struck last week, leaving much
of the downtown along the river a disaster scene. Factories,
hospitals, prisons and bridges have been washed away. Some
neighborhoods, where hundreds of houses stood, have become muddy
wastelands of debris, rotting animals and human corpses,
</P>
<P>
   President Carlos Flores Facusse pleaded on Monday night for
international aid. Top military officials conceded that they lacked
equipment to rescue people in remote regions. Many families have
been waiting for days without food or water on top of their houses
or perching in trees, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand is so great and the equipment we have is so little
that we feel impotent,'' the Army chief-of-staff, Gen. Mario Hung
Pacheco, said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people were waiting for rescue in southeastern
Choluteca, and at least 2,000 were trapped by flood waters in San
Pedro Sula, the authorities said. There were reports from the
northern town of El Progreso of desperate parents' tying small
children to the limbs of tall trees to protect them from drowning.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane was one of the most powerful storms to hit the
Caribbean in modern times. The tightly wound eye of the storm never
hit the mainland. Instead, it hovered over the Caribbean and the
Gulf of Honduras for days, dumping up to two feet of rain a day.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials characterized the storm as the worst natural
disaster in recent history. Floods and landslides have destroyed
more than two-thirds of the crops, experts said, raising a
possibility of severe food shortages, knocking out scores of
bridges and blocking nearly every major road.
</P>
<P>
   The floods have wiped out many food warehouses and have halted
most commercial traffic, making it nearly impossible to transport
food, and many communities have no potable water, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also said there is a great danger of cholera and other
diseases. With limited equipment, the military and rescue workers
are having trouble recovering corpses, and the floods have wreaked
havoc on sewer systems and have washed out latrines. The situation
is a recipe for disease.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of the capital doubted the government had the
resources to rebuild the destroyed areas and were pinning their
hopes on international aid operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only with help from abroad can we make it out of this
situation,'' said 23-ear old Ana Sepeda, an office worker whose
house was severely damaged by the flood waters on Saturday. ``We
are trying to continue forward, but it is difficult, especially for
the people who lost all their things.''

DOW ENDS SLUGGISH TRADING DAY UNCHANGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were narrowly mixed in fairly sluggish trading
Tuesday as investors resisted pushing prices, which are now at
levels not seen in nearly three months, any higher.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day advance that sent its shares to their highest
levels since Aug. 18, the Dow Jones industrial average closed
unchanged at 8,706.15. The Dow, which slipped during the morning,
came back in the early afternoon and fell back again at the close,
has not finished unchanged at the end of a trading day since Dec.
2, 1996, the New York Stock Exchange said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index barely budged,
closing down 0.76 point, or less than one-tenth of a percent, to
1,110.85. The Nasdaq composite index lost ground, falling 12.48
points, or seven-tenths of a percent, to 1,788.43. But the Russell
2000 index of small-company stocks posted another gain, rising 0.74
point, to 387.56.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the Big Board was fairly subdued at 695.47 million
shares, down from 751.96 million on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After the torrid advance recorded over the last few weeks,
traders and analysts said a period of consolidation was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put quite a bit of distance between where the market
is now and its lows'' during the summer, said Bob Gasser, head of
block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before any of the major indexes makes a major move from here,
there has to be some tangible evidence about 1999 earnings,'' he
said. ``So it is good news that at this point the market is sort of
trading sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in
Baltimore, said, ``in talking with portfolio managers, my sense is
that the market is a little tired here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is at an important juncture,'' he continued. ``We
are either going to trade on valuations, which means we are at the
top of the trading range, or we will be trading on momentum and
will move higher. My sense is that most managers are not inclined
to go back to the momentum trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, market indexes in Japan and Hong Kong posted strong
gains, and stocks also did better in Mexico and Brazil. But stocks
were mixed on European exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, Citigroup fell for the second straight
session, losing 2, to 44 1/8. The world's biggest financial
services company has lost more than 6 percent of its value since
James Dimon, the company's president, was forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola rallied for a second straight day, rising 1 15/16, to
72 15/16. And General Electric was up 1 1/8, to 88 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, shares of Boston Scientific Corp. fell 5 7/8, or 11
percent, to 46 3/8, after the medical equipment manufacturer said
it had discovered accounting irregularities at its Japanese
subsidiary. Trading was halted on the news, dragging down share
prices of other medical equipment manufacturers. Medtronic dropped
1 5/8, to 64 15/16, and Biomet declined 1 5/16, to 33 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's most active stock was Ciena Corp., which fell 3 9/16,
to 18 1/4, giving back part of a 78 percent gain recorded during
the last three trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In part, investors sold Ciena out of disappointment that a $23
million contract announced Tuesday with Enron Corp. to supply
networking equipment was not larger.
</P>
<P>
   Ciena's stock had risen sharply before Tuesday on speculation
about new contracts and a possible renewed takeover offer from
Tellabs Inc. or another potential suitor, most likely Cisco
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was good breadth to the market today,'' as gainers
outnumbered stocks that fell in price, said Phil Roth, chief
technical market analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``And the
reason the market is not going to go straight down again is because
the breadth is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Roth said he expected that early next year the S&AMP;P 500
would test the lows it hit late this summer. And he suggested a
more significant test could come before that. ``A lot of people are
betting that the Federal Reserve Board will cut interest rates
again this month,'' he said. ``If they don't, that could be a
disappointment.''

 &HT;    Video Networks offers easier ad transmission
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSWELL, Ga._Video Networks has found a potentially good and
profitable niche in the cable TV advertising business.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that advertise on cable television often have to mail
their ads to each cable system.
</P>
<P>
   They have to pay to duplicate each tape and send the tapes to
local cable offices, called head-ends, to be aired. FedEx, one of
the largest package shippers, charges about $25 to pick up and ship
one videotape overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Video Networks, however, can transmit an ad electronically for
$14, or as little as five cents, depending on the volume, said CEO
Tom Engdahl.
</P>
<P>
   Video Networks also has automated the process of buying
television air time. Cable companies sell the National Cable
Consortium a certain amount of air time they, in turn, sell to
advertisers. The NCC acts as the broker between the cable company
and the company wanting to advertise on a cable television channel.
(The consortium estimates cable television advertisers spend more
than $200 million each year shipping ads to cable companies to be
aired.)
</P>
<P>
   Video Networks' $500,000 in revenue this year is split between
the video distribution side and the electronic commerce side of the
business. Don Vassel, vice president of marketing, said video
distribution should account for 75 percent of the company's revenue
by late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Customer reaction: Wes Hart is vice president of advertising for
Marcus Cable, which, after its merger with Charter Communications,
has 2.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus, based in Texas, is one of Video Networks' test sites.
The company replaced its old system with an Internet/satellite
combination in 62 of its local cable offices, about one-fifth of
the company's head-ends. Hart said he expects that number to grow,
in part because the Video Networks method of sending ads is saving
him more than $7,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said the most vital savings is efficiency. If he needs to
send an ad to air on ESPN on 50 of his head-end systems, he no
longer has to rely on 50 overnight shipments or courier deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, and the elimination of the human error factor,'' Hart
said. ``You don't have to rely on couriers and someone inserting a
tape.''
</P>
<P>
   The system requires hardware at the cable operator end. Engdahl
said the equipment costs between $1,000 and $10,000, but most cable
companies lease it.
</P>
<P>
   Next: The company recently took $10.75 million in venture
capital, for a total of $15.5 million in venture capital. Engdahl
is hoping to take the company public in 2001. He recently hired Don
Vassel to head the company's marketing efforts. The chief financial
officer is Mark Adams, who took Melita International public in
1997.

 &HT;    Vow to be better pays for Falcons
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there was a moment that galvanized a critical part of the
Atlanta Falcons, it happened a week ago Monday when the offensive
line took stock of the previous day's carnage in New York against
the Jets. ``The debacle,'' tackle Bob Whitfield called it.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that the line took a vow to be better. A lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good meeting,'' Robbie Tobeck said. ``We said,
'Enough is enough.' We decided we were going to take attitudes out
there. We were going to hold each other accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a performance against the St. Louis Rams on
Sunday that was impressive in run-blocking and pass-protecting.
Running back Jamal Anderson gained 172 yards, and quarterback Chris
Chandler was sacked just once.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as that was, the unit hardly felt like the effort
was something special. It deserved to be lauded but not canonized.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our job,'' Tobeck said. ``We have to be aggressive,
attacking. And when you look at the guys' stats _ see Jamal gets
172 yards, see Chris had a good day _ you know we got the job done.
It's where we get our pride, our juice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been much-maligned, and deservedly so. They didn't
play well (in New York),'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``But any time
you get that kind of yardage (rushing), you need help. The line
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   To each other, more than to the criticism. ``This line is up
there with all the lines I've played with,'' Whitfield said. ``It's
young and aggressive, and it likes to play. And the best thing
about it is that we know everybody will bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. ``If it wasn't for them, nothing happens,'' Chandler
said. ``They gave me a chance to get the ball to the playmakers.
They gave Jamal a chance to make some yards. They just did a great
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the trick is to have a similar performance in Foxboro on
Sunday, when the Falcons play the New England Patriots. The
Patriots are expected to blitz the Falcons as much as the Jets did
last week and the Rams did Sunday. Against New York, with Steve
DeBerg at quarterback, Atlanta's line suffered several breakdowns
and was manhandled. Atlanta rushed for 55 yards, and Falcons
quarterbacks were sacked five times.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nice rebound Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one game when almost everything went right,''
Whitfield said. ``Last week was our debacle. It's funny, but a
couple of good plays open up, and it all opens up. But we have to
do the job every week. We have to put it behind us. We have to
start strong and fast every game and make it happen.''

 &HT;    Golf's living museum
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga._For five years, it's been an added bonus of the
Chateau Elan event. The arrival of the Subaru Sarazen World Open
each November since 1994 has meant an annual, weeklong appearance
by Gene Sarazen, who at 96 still can remember what President Warren
G. Harding wore when they played golf together in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Every time you speak with Sarazen, you expect to look out the
window and see a time machine in the driveway. Every conversation
lets you touch a piece of history. He spends one morning every
April at Augusta. He spends the week at the tournament founded by
Don Panoz to honor him, basking in its global accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen sat down with Roy Firestone as part of his Tuesday
routine, taping an interview that will be shown at tonight's
tournament pro-am party. Delightfully enthusiastic, Sarazen said
after 10 minutes in make-up, ``When I walked in here I was 96. Now
I'm 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for bringing his guests to tears, Firestone was the one
touched this time. Sarazen spoke about times with Bobby Jones and
Babe Ruth. With Howard Hughes and Harry Vardon. That Sarazen has
lived nearly a century is one of golf's greatest feats of good
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe Ruth was a long hitter,'' Sarazen said, smiling, ``but he
played `Catholic golf' _ across here and across there.''
</P>
<P>
   About Jones, whose name was so prominently mentioned this past
week at East Lake, where Sarazen once played with him in the 1920s:
``He had more than the greatest golf game. He had the greatest
personality. He was kind and good to everybody. I cherish my
memories of Bob Jones, because was a lifelong friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarazen told of playing with hickory shafts, or ``broomsticks,''
as he called them. He recalled his fear of flying with Howard
Hughes because ``he always had a file in his hand, and he filed the
(propeller) blades to make it go faster.'' He spoke about Hughes
asking him as they motored out of a hangar one day ``to pull up on
the stick.'' Sarazen said it inspired him to change the flange on
his niblick to create the first sand iron 70 years ago, changing
the flight of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   When he attended the British Open with the new club, he told his
caddie to stick it in the bag with the head down, so nobody from
the Royal &AMP; Ancient would see it and ban it. But eventually, the
Brits in the gallery were saying, ``I say, have you seen Sarazen's
weapon?''
</P>
<P>
   It's an amazing contrast to see Gene Sarazen still with us, as
golf prepares for the next millenium and $5 million tournaments
with $1 million first prizes. Sarazen won seven majors from 1923-32
and earned less than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone wanted to know about the celebrities with whom Sarazen
played golf in the 1920s. Sarazen mentioned Ty Cobb, whom he played
with at Augusta. He spoke of competing against Ben Hogan, the
perennial loner. ``You walked on the left side of the fairway,''
Sarazen said. ``He walked on the right side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Charlie Chaplin?'' Firestone asked. ``Did you play
golf with him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I knew him,'' Sarazen said, ``when he was a kid.''

 &HT;    Inman's victory climaxes dream year
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Inman is floating around the grounds of the Dunes Golf &AMP;
Beach Club in Myrtle Beach, S.C., this week after an emotional
victory Sunday in the Pacific Bell Senior Classic pushed him into
the top 31 on the money list and another year of full exemption. A
Senior Tour rookie, Inman earned $165,000 with his first win and
moved to 27th on the money list with $566,402. Inman won just once
on the PGA Tour, the 1976 Kemper Open. A year ago he was an unknown
long shot preparing for qualifying school while working as
on-course commentator with PGA Tour Radio. Now, after a one-stroke
win over Lee Trevino, he's about to enjoy the 1999 season as a
tournament winner. ``I'm proud of myself,'' Inman said approaching
this week's $2 million Energizer Senior Tour Championship. ``I
realize now that I had a better game when I was younger, but I
never gave myself credit for it. We all have doubts. The key is to
fight back that voice inside that gives you those doubts.'' After
Trevino bogeyed the 17th hole Sunday, all Inman had to do was par
the 18th. He drove safely and hit a 6-iron to the green but knocked
his approach putt 4-feet past the hole. ``When I saw that putt go
by, I said, `Oh, God, look at this,' '' Inman said. ``Then I said
to myself to just hit the putt. The putter had been my best club
all week.''

   Jim Furyk has withdrawn from the Sarazen, citing fatigue from a
heavy schedule of late. Furyk was one of three PGA Tour players
topping $2 million, joining Vijay Singh and David Duval. ... The
late Lloyd Mangrum has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame
and will be inducted in March in St. Augustine, Fla., along with
Seve Ballesteros. ... There is talk of playing East Lake to a
normal par 72 when the Tour Championship returns in 2000. That
would mean leaving the fifth and 10th holes as par 5s. ... Sarazen
defending champion Mark Calcavecchia held on to the 10th spot on
the President's Cup team despite his 29th-place finish at the Tour
Championship. Captain Jack Nicklaus was expected to add the 11th
and 12th finishers, Fred Couples and John Huston, Tuesday night.
Lee Janzen stood 11th before East Lake, but he was passed by Huston
and winner Hal Sutton, finishing 13th. Janzen might look back on
two unfortunate incidents as crucial to his money total, which
ended up $37,000 short. He was disqualified at the NEC World Series
for signing an incorrect scorecard after a TV viewer pointed out a
violation. Janzen lost serious ground Sunday at East Lake, taking a
double-bogey on the par-5 15th hole when a baby cried during his
backswing. Colin MontgomerieDave Pelz

 &HT;    ARCA race in Atlanta known for wrecks, not drivers
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_The big names in stock-car racing, the stars of NASCAR's
Winston Cup Series, will race Sunday afternoon before more than
100,000 fans in the NAPA 500.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow's stars, and some of the Winston Cup drivers, will race
Saturday afternoon in NASCAR's Grand National Series in front of a
much smaller crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The dreamers and the journeymen of the Automobile Racing Club of
America (ARCA) get their shot at glory Friday afternoon in a race
that draws little attention, unless there's a violent wreck.
</P>
<P>
   And often, that's exactly what happens.
</P>
<P>
   In ARCA's last race at Atlanta Motor Speedway (AMS), on Aug. 28,
the cars had just gotten up to speed when rookie Chad Coleman lost
his life in a crash on the backstretch.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, whose previous racing experience consisted of Late
Model cars on 3/8-mile short tracks in his native South Carolina
and north Georgia, was driving a former Winston Cup car that had
been raced by Geoff Bodine.
</P>
<P>
   The ARCA series is a mixtureof superspeedway and short-track
races. The superspeedway cars are, for all practical purposes,
identical to Winston Cup cars, but for many drivers the experience
level is no match, according to racers and racing officials.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Thomas, from Phenix City, Ala., is a veteran of both ARCA
and short-track racing. But he has cut back on his superspeedway
outings, in part because of the perils of racing against rookies at
nearly 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely dangerous,'' Thomas said. ``They let people out
there with no experience at all. Some of them don't even have good
short-track experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't belong in a car going 190 miles per hour,'' Thomas
said. ``They need to have raced and be familiar with racing. What
happens is they get comfortable and don't realize the speed, and
then they get in trouble. People get hurt severely or killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas says that even the experienced drivers can get into
trouble when the inexperienced are nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come up behind a car, and they're out of control or
not paying attention, it's pretty scary,'' he said. ``Lots of them
have more car than they can handle, and before you know it they're
into the wall or a bunch of them have crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thompson from Cartersville, Ga. was one of ARCA's most
successful superspeedway drivers before a crash involving a slower
car at AMS in March.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a broken ankle, he lost six months of work at his
company, Phoenix Air, because of a closed head injury that he
describes as a ``Ricky Craven kind of thing,'' in reference to a
brain injury that sidelined Craven for much of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has raced only once since the crash and is not entered
in Friday's race, even though he has run well at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing against Atlanta,'' he said. ``I just don't need
to have another sudden stop in a race car anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, however, is not critical of ARCA or its format, which
pits veterans against raw rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though that's what took me out, I don't blame anything on
ARCA,'' Thompson said. ``I'd rather race in ARCA (because of
safety) than Winston Cup. The lack of experience is not that big of
a deal. It's just one of the different things you have to deal with
during the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says, and other racers agree, that at least two-thirds
_ some say three-fourths _ of ARCA's drivers are competent to drive
on superspeedways. The problem lies with the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   ARCA officials and Atlanta Motor Speedway president Ed Clark
said ARCA has given extra effort to try to eliminate drivers who
can't handle cars at speed and to ensure that all cars are as safe
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``ARCA was a crash-fest 10 or 12 years ago, when they only ran
four or five superspeedway races, but now they run 11, so there's
more knowledge and experience,'' Clark said. ``And ARCA is watching
the drivers in practice and pulling them off the track if they're a
problem. You have to remember that Darrell Waltrip ran his first
superspeedway race somewhere, and Richard Petty ran his first
somewhere. ARCA is one of the few circuits where you can get
superspeedway experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark and others point out that ARCA hasn't been any more
dangerous than Winston Cup in recent years. Coleman's death was the
first in ARCA since Chris Gehrke was killed at Talladega in 1991.
Since 1985, five ARCA drivers have died from injuries sustained on
the track. In the same period, at least six Winston Cup drivers
died, including Bruce Jacobi, who died in 1987 from injuries at
Daytona in 1983. All but one of the 11 deaths _ J.D. McDuffie at
Watkins Glen in 1991 _ came on superspeedways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, ARCA guys don't crash as much as the
(Winston) Cup guys do,'' said ARCA veteran Clay Young from Smyrna,
who also fields cars for his son Phillip.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who has cut back on superspeedway racing, but still runs
regularly _ and wins _ in the four ARCA races on dirt tracks, says
speeds on the big tracks need to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow them down 15 or 20 miles per hour so you could have a
chance to keep from knocking the wall down if you blow a tire or
something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the occasional wicked wreck, Clark says, ARCA drivers
are always welcome at his track.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have egos, they just want to race,'' he said.
``They're good people, they try hard, and they put on a good show.
I'll never knock them. I want to help them.

A NEW GENERATION REVELS IN BEL CANTO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is an exaggeration to claim, as some do, that the bel canto
operatic repertory languished completely during the post-World War
I decades until Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland arrived on the
scene in the 1950s and 60s to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   Operas by Rossini, Donizetti and Bellini, the masters of the
tradition, turned up now and then during those years, especially in
Italian houses, and not just perennial favorites, like Rossini's
``Barbiere di Siviglia.'' Even Donizetti's ``Poliuto,'' obscure at
the time, was presented at La Scala in 1940, as a vehicle for the
tenor Beniamino Gigli.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the operatic world at large this repertory was mostly
forgotten or unthinkingly disparaged. When Ms. Sutherland, at 33,
won international acclaim in Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' at
Covent Garden in 1959, the opera had not been performed there in 34
years.
</P>
<P>
   When she sang her first Covent Garden Elvira in Bellini's
``Puritani,'' in 1964, the opera had not been heard in the house
since 1887.
</P>
<P>
   But these great artists made the public realize that bel canto
operas were not just dramatically preposterous showpieces for
brainless, chirpy sopranos. When Callas sang Bellini's ``Norma,''
the opera emerged as a refined and emotionally shattering piece; to
hear Ms. Sutherland and Marilyn Horne in Rossini's heroic
``Semiramide,'' and Callas in that composer's madcap ``Italiana in
Algeri,'' was to marvel at the range of Rossini's compositional
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   And I defy anyone to listen to the astonishing sextet from
Donizetti's ``Lucia'' on the 1972 Decca/London recording, with Ms.
Sutherland, Luciano Pavarotti and Sherrill Milnes leading the way,
without succumbing to this perfect blend of musical and vocal
ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Successors to these bel canto champions, like Beverly Sills,
Montserrat Caballe and Shirley Verrett in her coloratura mezzo
days, kept the revival going. Then it faltered again, as power for
power's sake, telegenic good looks and marketable personality
started to replace elegant _ and in Callas' case, elegantly
powerful _ vocalism as the top priorities of young singers and
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But a new generation of bel cantists has arrived, and some
notables among them are represented in a wave of new recordings:
from RCA, Bellini's ``Capuleti e i Montecchi,'' featuring the
exciting Bulgarian mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova and the Italian
soprano Eva Mei; from Decca/London, Rossini's ``Turco in Italia,''
with the acclaimed mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, and from Sony,
``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' with the Hungarian soprano Andrea Rost,
and Charles Mackerras conducting the period-instrument Hanover
Band. The overall affinity for the style manifested by the singers
and conductors in these releases is most striking.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for it? Perhaps the training in conservatories and
opera companies is becoming more sophisticated, and young singers,
tired of pushing their voices in heavier roles, are reclaiming bel
canto values: elegant legato, lyrical continuity, evenness of
production, agility.
</P>
<P>
   Even the English soprano Jane Eaglen _ vocally, the most highly
endowed Wagnerian since Birgit Nilsson _ sings bel canto roles. She
may not be anyone's ideal Norma, but by singing both Norma and
Brunnhilde, as Wagner's revered Lilli Lehmann did, Ms. Eaglen
reminds us that Wagner valued the bel canto approach to singing,
even for (italics)his(end italics) music, which requires voices
with enormous heft and stamina. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   ``I Capuleti e i Montecchi'' (RCA Victor 09026-68899-2; three
CDs) is Bellini's operatic telling of the Romeo and Juliet story.
The criticism that it defiles Shakespeare's tragedy has followed
the work since its 1830 premiere.
</P>
<P>
   But as Philip Gossett, the Boswell of bel canto, points out in
his liner notes, neither Bellini nor Felice Romani, his protean
librettist, knew Shakespeare's plays, few of which had crossed the
Alps at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera was based on an Italian version of this Italian story,
different in significant ways. (Juliet, for example, is betrothed
to the hotheaded Tybalt when she falls in love with Romeo.) The
libretto was largely recycled from a libretto Romani had prepared
for the composer Nicola Vaccai in 1825; and Bellini, working with
untypical haste (in the 10 years of his adult career, he seldom
produced more than one opera a year), also recycled earlier
material. Here is fodder for another criticism: that Bellini and
his librettist were hacks.
</P>
<P>
   True, cut-and-paste recycling and even farming out the job of
writing recitatives to other composers (a sometime practice of the
hyper-productive Rossini) were standard procedure. But ``I Capuleti
e i Montecchi'' is a sublime work, a reflective and profoundly
serious musical drama. As the opera reaches its denouement, the
supporting characters drift away, leaving only the ill-fated lovers
to sing what Gossett calls the ``most deeply moving death scene in
all of Italian opera,'' and in the presence of this inspired music,
when beautifully sung, one is hard put to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kasarova, with her earthy, poignantly colored voice, is a
natural for the role of Romeo. She has temperament and vocal
charisma, and can lovingly spin a high-lying pianissimo phrase. Yet
RCA seems not to have captured her sound ideally here. Either that,
or an edgy quality is starting to affect her middle register.

 &HT;    Ex-Philadelphia gas company chief decides against taking AGL
position
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_James Hawes III, named last month as executive vice
president of Atlanta-based AGL Resources Inc., has withdrawn from
the position amid a politically charged controversy in Philadelphia
over his spending practices as chief executive of the city-owned
gas utility. AGL Resources Inc. is the parent company of Atlanta
Gas Light.
</P>
<P>
   The Elberton, Ga. native and Morehouse College(Ga.) graduate had
been president and chief executive officer of Philadelphia Gas
Works since 1996. His last day in that position was Friday. He said
he was opting out of the AGL position to take more time to consider
his next move with his family.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from Philadelphia, Hawes said Tuesday he had
done ``absolutely nothing wrong'' and noted that he denied all the
allegations against him Friday in an appearance before the
Philadelphia City Council.
</P>
<P>
   A series of articles in The Philadelphia Daily News during the
past six months raised questions about expenditures made by Hawes
as the $285,000-a-year chief executive of the largest municipally
owned gas utility in the United States. The focus includes
relocation expenses claimed by Hawes in connection with his 1996
move to Philadelphia from Omaha, where he had held a senior post
with U.S. West Communications Inc., and perks and expenses claimed
by other PGW executives.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham said Oct. 9 that
she and the city controller were conducting an investigation of
spending practices at Philadelphia Gas Works.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Davol, spokesman for the district attorney, declined
Tuesday to say whether Hawes is under investigation, but said:
``The whole situation is under investigation and will be. There's a
lot of money involved.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for PGW has said internal and independent audits
found no improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   any conduct that was Hawes was named as executive vice
president-chief administrative officer at AGL on Oct. 2. He was to
take his new position in Atlanta Nov. 16 and be a part of the new
leadership team of Walter Higgins, who took over as chief executive
and president of the company in March. But he said Tuesday he
decided after spending the weekend with his family not to take the
Atlanta job and called Higgins on Sunday to inform him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy that made a personal decision and I respect
it,'' said Higgins. He said Hawes ``made me fully aware of all the
things that were being pursued in the newspapers'' before accepting
the job. ``I looked into them and was confident he dealt with them
just fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawes said the controversy was not the reason for his decision
to forgo the AGL position, but noted the last few months ``have
been exhausting'' for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people take shots at you, you know it's exhausting,'' he
said. ``But that's part of it. You've got your normal work
environment, also.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Philadelphia newspaper reports, Hawes billed
PGW for $34,000 in meals and hotel costs while staying in a
$2,000-a-month hotel suite for nearly a year while waiting for his
new Philadelphia home to be built. Hawes also reportedly violated
company policy by accepting an all-expenses trip to a golf
tournament in Augusta from a company vendor and donated $5,000 in
company funds to Morehouse College. PGW officials confirmed the
expenditures. Hawes agreed to pay back the money given to
Morehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Hawes in Philadelphia credit him with improving
PGW, including cutting accounts receivable, customer complaints and
gas costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hawes said it was ``not fair'' to ask AGL to hold open the job
for him while he decides his next move, but moving to Atlanta at
some point in the future ``will be an option for us.''

   Ms. Mei, the Juliet, sings with lyric beauty, focused sound and
impressive agility. Her voice, so different in color from Ms.
Kasarova's, blends with it intriguingly in their duets. The tenor
Ramon Vargas, as Tebaldo, has a tendency to scoop up to high notes,
but his voice has a nice ping, and he sings with vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Umberto Chiummo and Simone Alberghini complete the rewarding
cast. Roberto Abbado conducts the Munich Radio Orchestra in a
spaciously paced, sensitive performance.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, Maria Malibran, Bellini's original Romeo, was not
convinced by the final death scene, for within two years of the
premiere, she began performing the role with a final scene
interpolated from Vaccai's opera, which gave her and the Juliet
more opportunity for display. That version, sung by Ms. Kasarova
and Ms. Mei, is included in the RCA set as bonus CD of nearly 40
minutes. Vaccai was a composer of some skill, but this extended
scene lacks the refinement and depth of Bellini's music. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rossini's ``Turco in Italia'' (London 289 458 924-2; two CDs) is
sometimes thought of as a sequel in reverse to ``L'Italiana in
Algeri.'' In the latter, a nice Italian girl deflates the puffery
of an Algerian monarch: just what he needs. In ``Turco'' a Turkish
pasha, Selim, goes to Naples and falls in love with the feisty
Donna Fiorilla, the wife of the henpecked Don Geronio.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more here than Rossinian farce. Gossett, again
providing liner notes, says the opera should be considered
Rossini's ``Cosi Fan Tutte.'' This opera of spouse-swapping,
duplicity and confusion, with a plot stirred up by a poet who
speaks to the audience like some narrator in a Pirandello play, is
eerily ambiguous and not entirely funny.
</P>
<P>
   Rossini's music, with its sudden shifts of key, deceptively
breezy lyricism and complex ensembles, catches every nuance of the
libretto.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Fiorilla has been sung mostly by sopranos, notably
Callas, whose 1954 recording (recently reissued by EMI) is
cherishable. Ms. Bartoli, who is now moving into the soprano
repertory, is in her element. Her performance is musically
exquisite and perky. As always, her delivery of Italian is
incomparable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the tessitura of the role seems high for her; this is a
matter not of range (she nails the high notes) but of vocal color
(hers is that of a light mezzo). Again, it may be a case of
Decca/London's not having best captured her voice in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, overall, is close to ideal, with the stylish bass
Michele Pertusi as Selim, Vargas as Narciso, the lyric baritone
Alessandro Corbelli as Geronio, the baritone Roberto de Candia as
the poet and the mezzo-soprano Laura Polverelli as Zaida, Selim's
former slave and jilted fiancee. Riccardo Chailly elicits a supple,
humorous yet dramatically resonant performance from the orchestra
and chorus of La Scala. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The selling point of the new ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' (Sony
Classical S2K 63174; two CDs) is that it is the first recorded
performance on period instruments, and the first using an
authoritative edition of the score that restores Donizetti's
original key scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the composer sanctioned many of the transpositions
that have become common, so it's hard to say what an authoritative
version of the score is. The Hanover Band plays in historically
informed style for Mackerras, and certain instrumental features
(like the warm-toned wooden flute in the mad scene) are lovely.
</P>
<P>
   But this opera is already well served on records, including two
great performances by Ms. Sutherland (from 1961 and 1972) and two
classics by Callas (a studio recording from 1953, conducted by
Tullio Serafin, and a live performance in 1955 from La Scala,
conducted by Herbert von Karajan). That is daunting competition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rost gives an intelligent, often impressive performance. Her
light, lyric voice is probably closer to the type of soprano
Donizetti wrote for. Callas or Sutherland she is not, however, and
the rest of the cast, though solid, is also not up to the existing
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Rost is, like Ms. Bartoli and Ms. Karasova, a good
example of a young singer, steeped in the bel canto tradition, with
much to offer. There are others like her now, including the
golden-voiced Ruth Ann Swenson, who will sing Lucia in a new Met
production in December.
</P>
<P>
   They are all in debt, for sure, to Callas, Ms. Sutherland and
other bel canto pioneers, but they bring something of their own to
this repertory. Today's audiences are the beneficiaries.

   IZAPA, Nicaragua _ In one way or another, every part of
Nicaragua has been devastated by the relentless floods and
landslides that followed Hurricane Mitch and killed at least 6,000
people throughout Central America. But the real disaster zone
begins here.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, highways are functioning again, and cattle still
graze in waterlogged fields. But the Izapa River overflowed its
banks here and washed away the Pan-American Highway, the main land
link between northwest Nicaragua and the rest of the country. And
to travel north of here is to enter a realm dominated by
destruction and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Arnoldo Aleman ventured into the region
for the first time since the Casita volcano unleashed a sea of mud
over the weekend that entombed more than 1,500 people outside
Posoltega, about 25 miles north of here. Very quickly, he learned
the importance of that severed connection and the way it is
crippling Nicaragua's recovery and rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   All along the road, entire families trudged in both directions
throughout the day, balancing large packages on their shoulders or
lugging sacks of rice and beans. With bridges and roads out, some
have walked all the way from the capital, Managua, some 40 miles to
the south, fording stream after stream in a desperate attempt to
get food, clothing and medicine to family and friends in the
disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making the slow, tiring trek northward on Tuesday
morning was Vicente Hernandez, accompanied by his wife and a
younger brother. Hernandez, 29, works on a ranch near Posoltega,
artificially inseminating cows. But he was away visiting relatives
when the mudslide engulfed his home and his village, and he was now
trying to return home and search for another group of relatives who
are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been left with nothing but this,'' he said, gesturing
toward a small plastic bag containing a few items of donated
clothing that was attached to the handlebars of a bicycle he was
riding. ``Our family has been dispersed, and a great misfortune has
fallen upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Maria Elena Caballero Gomez, began to sob. ``I don't
know what has become of them,'' she said of the missing family
members. ``And if they are alive, they don't know where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Jairo Javier Perez Penalver, a Red Cross volunteer who has been
working in the Posoltega area, said that as late as Monday
afternoon, more than 48 hours after the flank of the volcano
collapsed, he and other rescue workers could hear the voices of
people buried in the mud who were begging to be rescued. Most of
them, he said sadly, are surely dead now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been asking for help, but it has not been arriving,''
he said. ``The only way to get in there and take people out safely
is by helicopter, and there are not enough helicopters to satisfy
what is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road, one traveler after another said they were
responding to the pleas of relatives who in some cases have not
eaten in three days. There are also shortages of gasoline, which
has led to fuel rationing and made it even more difficult for
people to move around and to incinerate the decaying corpses that
health officials say could cause epidemics if not disposed of soon.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the disaster zone, there are signs that hard-pressed
and hungry inhabitants are growing increasingly impatient with
their situation. At a brief stop along the on Tuesday and later in
Leon, the largest city in the region, Aleman was greeted with
jeers, catcalls, boos and shouts of ``We don't need an inspection,
we need food'' and, ``Where is the aid?''
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto Wong, the president's press secretary, put the blame
for the outbursts on the opposition Sandinista National Liberation
Front, which he accused of trying to take partisan advantage of a
national tragedy. The government, he said, was doing everything in
its power to aid flood and storm victims as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are remote and isolated regions that it just has not
been possible to reach because for so many days we had inclement
weather and the helicopters could not even fly,'' he said. ``People
everywhere are now asking us for help, but there is a lack of
transport, and so we are asking the international community to help
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nicaraguan air force has only seven helicopters, he said,
most of them Soviet models left over from the Sandinista era. The
United States, Mexico and Panama have donated two helicopters each,
he said, but tens of thousands of people are still stranded and in
need of food, water and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Juarez, a farmer here who raises cattle and grows beans,
corn and sorghum, would like to help out. But the floods swept away
his cattle _ some of which reappeared later, bobbing in the swollen
river _ destroyed his crops and leveled his home and those of his
neighbors. Now he has to start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I had is gone, and all we have been left with is
rocks and stone,'' he said as he sat on his bedraggled horse and
surveyed the destruction here. ``I'm ready to plant, but somebody
has to give me seeds. But so far, nobody has come here to help us,
nobody.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE LOCKOUT REMINDS US: GET A LIFE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tuesday night should have been the opening game in
Madison Square Garden, the Knicks against the Celtics, but the
entire National Basketball Association has been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   I am considering it a gift from that avuncular chap with the
beard. Commissioner David Stern and the owners and the players have
given us at least a couple of months, time to take a walk in the
falling leaves instead of watching the ball go through the hoop,
incessantly.
</P>
<P>
   As the wisest man in pro sports, Stern knew there was going to
be an epic season in baseball that would leave people around the
country satiated. He sensed it was the right time to undo all the
mischief the owners have done to themselves over the years by
paying for what they claim they cannot afford. He also knew we
could tolerate a year off, which puts huge pressure on the players.
</P>
<P>
   There was a century's worth of communal betrayal when baseball
went down in 1994. There was a feeling of deprivation from the
fervent hockey minority in 1995. I don't feel any of that here.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen the glazed look on fans in the Garden in recent
years, real people who paid too much of their own money to watch a
stagnant team in a stagnant sport in a stagnant league, and I have
seen the faces of people who would not mind getting a few months'
worth of money back rather than watch Patrick Ewing fire up jumpers
while falling away from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   This lockout is a chance for all of us to get our lives
together. I promise to write more about hockey and college hoops
and women's sports, find people who still pursue sport for joy.
Maybe I will even put up with Parcells' oafish sarcasm if the Jets
are for real.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night I probably should have gone to the Rangers-Devils
hockey game in New Jersey but I stayed home with a good book. Since
you asked, it is a new translation of Dante's Inferno. And speaking
of the lower depths, I've been avoiding sports crowds since the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   We need to talk about the cruel mood in Yankee Stadium, as well
as the upper rings at the Garden where I have seen children wearing
the colors of opposing hockey teams be frightened by the mob. This
obviously includes the outer reaches of Shea Stadium, where my
agent and her nephew were mugged _ I mean, mugged _ for wearing Red
Sox apparel during the World Series of 1986. And I'm sure the Jets'
renaissance will touch off some crude actions toward opposing fans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a New York thing. There's nothing quite like it anywhere
else in the States. This is not my imagination, from inside some
glass-enclosed press box. For post-season games, columnists are
relegated to an auxiliary press box in deep left field, so I walked
the narrow ramps and sat behind The People, the vast majority of
whom were high-spirited and polite and even watched the game.
</P>
<P>
   I have no real problem with the personal chants directed at
David Justice of Cleveland during the championship series, taunting
him about his very public divorce, nor do I have a problem with the
ubiquitous chants at opposing fielders. As Ken Caminiti of the
Padres admitted, he did stink.
</P>
<P>
   But once the Series shifted to San Diego, survivors of Yankee
Stadium began telling their tales _ how the Padres' rally towels
were burned by the posse in the bleachers, how the Padres' caps
were confiscated by vigilantes, how the Padres' fans were taunted
by bullies. I read that the wife of Kevin Brown of the Padres was
afraid to let their son go into the men's room by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The post-season mood in Yankee Stadium the past four years is
getting perilously close to English soccer _ packs of antisocial
men looking to hurt strangers under the guise of sport. There has
been far too much praise for the so-called Bleacher Creatures in
right field. They are not cute, and their brutal presence is
setting the wrong tone.
</P>
<P>
   What to do about it? I would not advocate tapping some beered-up
thug on the shoulder and saying, ``Hey, Mac, we don't do that kind
of thing around here.'' But I do think we can influence our
friends, our relatives, not to join in.
</P>
<P>
   I'd also like to hear from Mayor Giuliani, who has tried to ban
jaywalking and squeegee men and sidewalk vendors in the name of
civility. Rather than low-ball the costs of a new midtown pleasure
palace for George Steinbrenner, the mayor should address the louts
who wear the same ball cap he does. We have time to speak of many
things this fall. Thank you for that, Commissioner Stern.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)  
 (Valerie Gladstone is a contributing editor to Dance magazine.)

 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The listing above is fictional, but its contents are
not. In 1944 ``On the Town'' introduced the talents of Leonard
Bernstein, Jerome Robbins and the writers Betty Comden and Adolph
Green to the Broadway stage.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Hollywood made it into a popular film starring
Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. While the Public Theater's production
in Central Park in the summer of 1997 won mostly favorable reviews,
the dances of Eliot Feld were generally considered awkward and
conventional.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, George C. Wolfe, the producer of the Public
Theater and the musical's director in its current Broadway
incarnation, went shopping for a new choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe tried out Christopher d'Amboise for two months in the fall
of 1997, and when d'Amboise failed to please him, he asked Robbins
for suggestions. He gave him a list of 20 choreographers, from
Broadway, ballet and modern dance.
</P>
<P>
   In February, applicants submitted resumes and videotapes with
representative clips of previous work, with the final selection to
be made by Robbins, Ms. Comden, Green, the Bernstein estate and
Wolfe. After several months, the committee narrowed the list to
three _ the New Yorkers Lar Lubovitch and Joey McKneely, who had
worked on Broadway, and Keith Young, a 45-year-old choreographer
from Los Angeles and a total stranger to the Great White Way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The job was definitely tantalizing _ with almost as many
drawbacks as attractions. In just 10 weeks, whoever was chosen
would have to create dances to one of the most complex scores ever
written for a musical. Not only would he be stepping into Robbins'
oversize shoes, he would have to deal with Bernstein's formidable
score.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the judges picked Young. ``We chose Keith,'' Wolfe
said, ``because we wanted to bring in fresh, new energy. It's
liberating to work with someone who hasn't been conditioned by the
conventions of Broadway.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What drew Young was the chance to work on Broadway with Wolfe,
whom he considers to be the top man in American theater. He also
liked the show. ``The story is so moving,'' he said recently over
dinner. ``Here are three sailors, about to go off to war, in the
city for only 24 hours, searching for love and excitement. It's so
joyful, such a big old valentine to New York.'' A smile brightened
his handsome but usually serious face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young is a quick study. Until he was 21, he knew nothing about
dance. ``It only took seeing one dance class to feel like I'd found
gold,'' he said with passion. ``Dance encompasses everything I love
_ art, literature, music, sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Totally enraptured, in 1975, he dropped plans to get a graduate
degree in art therapy at the University of Miami, in his native
Ohio, and headed for New York. He trained first with the modern
dancer Viola Farber and later with Merce Cunningham. From 1979
through 1985, he danced with Twyla Tharp's company. ``Merce taught
me how to build an architecturally sound house,'' he said. ``Twyla
taught me how to put things in it.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, he ran his own 12-member troupe until
accepting a teaching post at the California Institute of the Arts
near Los Angeles. ``It got pretty discouraging running the
company,'' he explained. ``We performed all the time, got well
reviewed, but never made any money.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 years, Mr. Young has been choreographing in Los
Angeles for pop stars, television, theater and film. His credits
could hardly be more diverse: concert tours of Babyface, Madonna,
and En Vogue, ``Seinfeld,'' HBO's ``Heidi Chronicles,'' the film
``The Parent Trap'' and several Grammy Awards ceremonies. He even
made chimps dance in a Bonita Banana television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to relinquish your ego,'' he said, ``by working in
so many disciplines, often with nondancers.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Young won an Emmy Award for his choreography for ``The
Drew Carey Show.'' Last month, he received the annual American
Choreography Award (given by the Society of Stage Directors and
Choreographers and the Los Angeles Dance Foundation) for a ballet
he created for the Christopher Reeve television special, ``A
Celebration of Hope.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But however interesting his resume, it did not make him an
obvious successor to Jerome Robbins. ``At first, the judges thought
I'd be too L.A.,'' he said, ``too MTV.'' To prove otherwise, Young
studied the movie version of the show, hired a group of dancers and
choreographed a few scenes. He filmed the results and sent off the
videotape. ``No one requested it,'' he said. ``But I felt I had to
show how I conceived of the choreography.'' It was a costly bid for
consideration. Weeks passed without a response.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late March, Wolfe asked him to come to New York
immediately. Exhausted after an overnight flight from Los Angeles,
he made his way to the Public Theater. ``It was raining and cold,
and everything seemed extremely drab,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, Ms. Comden, Green, Robbins and members of the Bernstein
family received him pleasantly but noncommittally. More time
passed. He turned down other jobs, in the hope of getting this one.
Finally, in May, the call came. Work would start in September. &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Getting ``On the Town'' now looks as if it was the easy part.
``Ever since I began,'' Young said, ``I've totally immersed myself
in everything about the show. I'm reading Bernstein's biography.
When I'm home, I do nothing but listen to the score. It's
symphonic, jazzy, balletic and very emotional. There are so many
layers. Its complexity makes it imperative that every bit of dance
perpetuates the story.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With permission from the estates of deceased composers and
songwriters, choreographers of most Broadway revivals can alter the
scores to accommodate their particular visions or to make their
jobs a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers and Hammerstein
Organization and administrator of entertainment copyrights for 70
musicals, said it was quite common to permit modifications,
specifying, ``It usually depends on the pedigree of the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lichtefeld, the choreographer of ``The Sound of Music,''
got permission to add an Austrian courtship dance to that show.
Kenneth MacMillan also got permission for changes in his Tony
Award-winning ``Carousel'' in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the Leonard Bernstein estate is far stricter. `` `On the
Town' has been recorded more than 20 times,'' said Harry Kraut, the
general manager of the estate. ``We feel if audiences are going to
a Bernstein show, they should hear Bernstein.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when Christopher Chadwick was choreographing the
musical at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut, he thought it
could use some jitterbug and big band numbers. The Bernstein estate
did not agree, and he resigned from the show. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Young's only challenge had been the Bernstein score, he would
have had his work cut out for him. But he also followed Robbins,
who died in July at 79. ``It makes me feel good that before Jerry
died, he approved me for the job,'' he said. ``I loved how he
caught the youthful innocence of the sailors and the urban feel of
the city. Though I wouldn't do his steps now; 54 years have passed
since then. The body moves in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the first run-through of the show, Ms. Comden and
Green reassured Young. They said that Robbins had not been able to
figure out how to convey frustration and poignancy in the dream
ballet where a sailor fruitlessly searches for his lover. ``They
told me,'' Young said proudly, ``that I did.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks later, at a rehearsal at the George Gershwin
Theater, where the musical will play, Young went through a section
with Tai Jiminez, who plays Miss Turnstiles, the subway beauty
queen. Young still moves like a Twyla Tharp dancer, loose, bemused
and articulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith brings in elements from ballet, modern and jazz,'' Ms.
Jiminez said, ``and makes movement that can be sexy or jazzy or
lyrical. He never does the obvious. Every gesture has to convey
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the story, her character has just realized the
fleeting nature of fame. She stepped forward tentatively, a bouquet
of flowers in her hands _ all that remains of her brief celebrity.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Young wanted her to express something other than resignation.
``Show how the feeling sweeps over you,'' he said. ``Now, turn in
arabesque, very slowly. You aren't sad, simply more knowing. Your
gestures should be large. Remember, you, as Miss Turnstiles, now
know more about life and are better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He stood back and watched her as she opened her arms and did a
series of fluid jumps across the stage. Her dance did not look
anything like a standard Broadway musical number, nor in the least
like MTV. As Wolfe had hoped, it was new and fresh. When she
finished, a few cast members, scattered throughout the dark, empty
theater, started to applaud.

HONORING THOSE WHO ONCE WERE WARRIORS

   (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The near-life-size wood carving of a Maori warrior
exudes raw power. The eyes, made of shells, gleam white with
seeming rage against the tattooed face, and the large, clawlike
hands and the short, thick, muscular legs project brute strength.
The figure depicts an ancestor of a Maori chief and symbolizes the
pride of a tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce and unhuggable as the figure may seem to Western eyes, it
was anything but to the Maori. They eagerly caressed and embraced
it, pressing their noses against its nose, in the belief that doing
so put them in touch with their ancestor. Such showing of deep
respect and affection for their forebears is still practiced by the
Maori today.
</P>
<P>
   The figure originally served as the base of the central post of
a mid-19th-century meeting house on the eastern coast of New
Zealand. It will be sold at Sotheby's on Nov. 22, and the auction
house expects it will bring between $1 million and $1.5 million, 10
times what its owner paid in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Not all collectors and curators admire the look of this Maori
treasure. Its outsize head, the realistic sculpturing of its limbs
and its high-gloss finish have been criticized by those who prefer
abstract detailing and a weathered matte surface in tribal works.
(The sheen is actually a protective coating of varnish favored by
the Maori.)
</P>
<P>
   But almost everyone agrees that the work is impressive on at
least two counts: It is rare, the only privately owned sculptured
house post from this period; and it has an enviable pedigree of
ownership. The figure has descended in the family of Bishop William
Williams, an Oxford-educated Anglican missionary, who left England
in 1825 to work among the Maori.
</P>
<P>
   Williams translated the New Testament into Maori, and his Maori
dictionary was published in 1844. Always the educator, he was
tireless in prodding the Maori into attending school, where they
learned to read and write. He became a bishop in 1858, and when he
retired in the 1870s he went to live in the Hawkes Bay district of
New Zealand, where the figure had originated.
</P>
<P>
   A Maori chief probably gave the piece to Williams, a most
unusual gesture for a Maori, since they seldom made gifts of large
art works. And when they did, it was only to a person held in the
highest esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Williams died in 1878, and the figure was taken to England in
the 1880s by a grandson, A.H.W. Williams. In 1978 a great grandson,
J.L.H. Williams, sent it to Christie's in London, where it was
auctioned for $110,000, a record for Maori art. The buyer was
Philippe-Guy Woog, a Swiss inventor and producer of dental
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Maori objects then began to increase in value, as did tribal
works of Polynesian, Oceanic and African origin. In 1979, Phillips
in London auctioned a smaller Maori figure, carved in about 1820,
for a record $145,860.
</P>
<P>
   Such masterpieces seldom appear on the market, in part because
the Maori have historically held on to their possessions. Museums
in New Zealand also aggressively collect them. A sampling of these
collections was seen in ``Te Maori: Maori Art from New Zealand
Collections,'' an exhibition that opened an American tour in 1984
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to such exhibitions, the audience for such a figure is
much larger today. And there is a greater curiosity on the part of
Westerners about the kind of mystical beliefs held by the Maori.
The Maori believe that those who entered the meeting house were
enveloped by tribal ancestors. The rafters represented the spirits'
ribs; the facades, the arms, and the mask at the apex, the face of
an ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   But the price Sotheby's expects for the figure seems high to
some potential bidders. In 1992, Woog, saying he needed the money
for his business, had Sotheby's offer the piece to the Museum of
New Zealand in Wellington for several million dollars. The offer
was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly like to have the figure back in New
Zealand,'' said Roger Neich, the curator of Maori art at the
Auckland Museum, who helped organize ``Maori Art and Culture,'' a
recent exhibition in London of the British Museum's collection, the
largest outside New Zealand. ``But I don't think New Zealand has
that sort of money to spend. There is some unease here with the
increased commercialization of Maori art.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since he bought the figure, Woog has tried to prove that it was
produced in about 1800 or earlier, which would increase its value.
Sotheby's used this date when it announced the sale in August. The
date was changed to 1840 last month after Jean Fritts, who heads
Sotheby's tribal art department, consulted several experts,
including Neich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study of Maori art is not an exact science,'' Neich said.
``But certain things are known from recent research. That face was
definitely carved with metal tools, available from the time Captain
Cook landed here in 1770. And the figure doesn't have the
suppleness and intensity in the face that you find in the
pre-contact period.''

CENTRAL AMERICANS IN NEW YORK OFFER AID TO VICTIMS OF HURRICANE
</HEADLINE>
  (See related NICARAGUA-MUDSLIDES)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Central Americans in New York stepped up their
efforts on Tuesday to help the victims of Hurricane Mitch, the
killer storm that has swept up entire villages and cities in
Central America and caused the deaths of more than 7,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador and many of
the community advocates who serve them in New York opened up
drop-off points for canned goods and medicines throughout the
region, held meetings to devise strategies for the delivery of the
donations and offered Masses for the dead, as well as prayers for
the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praying _ that's what I've been doing,'' said Antonia Guzman,
a 43-year-old health care attendant from the Bronx who did not know
the fate of her parents and sisters in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of churches, community centers and travel agencies are
serving as focal points for the collection of goods _ from canned
food to used clothing to medicines and first aid kits. And New
Yorkers, even those with no ties to Central America, are
responding. Some of the churches already have rooms full of
donations.
</P>
<P>
   But while praying for miracles, scurrying for food and medicines
and pleading to merchants for money, leaders of several Central
American immigrant community groups worried about how to get goods
to countries where roads were blocked by the floods, and many
cities were still under water.
</P>
<P>
   And, they said, even if they succeed in transporting the goods
to Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, more challenges lie ahead _
mainly, to make sure the donations reach their intended
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fear is that the donations won't reach the people who
truly need it,'' said Antonieta Maximo, president of the Federation
of Honduran Organizations, an umbrella organization for Honduran
groups in New York. ``We have sent things in the past that have
never reached the people. It happened after a hurricane in 1974,
and we have not forgotten that.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday evening, several organizations were still
scrambling to find reliable channels to deliver the donations.
Several were hoping that the Red Cross or other international
organizations with offices in Central America would help them.
Others, including a coalition of Salvadoran organizations that met
in a church on Long Island on Tuesday, have opted to send only
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transportation is expensive,'' said Miguel Ramirez, of El
Centro Hispano Cuzcatlan, a community-based group of Salvadorans in
Queens. ``With the money, they can get what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   A group from the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which before the
storm had adopted Tipitapa, a Nicaraguan city, as a sister city, is
doing the same. Donna Katzin, an advocate in the group, said it had
decided to seek only money donations because in the past it had had
trouble with shipments of medicines, school supplies and used
clothing. Its last shipment, sent in May, is still in storage at
the airport in Managua, Nicaragua, subject to a high tax that the
organization cannot pay, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that that will not be the fate of the donations now,
but I just don't know, and we cannot take that risk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Paredes, executive director of the Northeast Hispanic
Catholic Center, said the goods collected through the Roman
Catholic churches in the region would safely reach their
destination because they would be delivered through Caritas, the
international official agency of the Catholic Church for
humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the safest way we know to do this and the most effective
one,'' said Paredes, who returned yesterday from a weekend trip to
Central America where he was able to assess the damage from the
hurricane. ``It's total, pure devastation.''

   CHRYSLER POSTS 20 PERCENT RISE FOR SALES IN OCTOBER
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler reported that its car and truck sales rose 20 percent
in October compared with figures from the month a year earlier,
indicating another strong month for industry vehicle sales despite
waning consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Other automakers also reported excellent sales. Toyota Motor
Sales reported its best October sales ever for its Toyota and Lexus
divisions. And American Honda reported its Honda and Acura sales
increased 10 percent for its best October.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS MIXED IN SLUGGISH TRADING
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were narrowly mixed in fairly sluggish trading as
investors resisted pushing prices _ which are now at levels not
seen in nearly three months _ any higher. The Dow Jones industrial
average finished unchanged at 8,706.15, while the S&AMP;P 500 and
Nasdaq declined slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices rose for the first time in three sessions as the
yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.21 percent from 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN SEEN WARMING TO EURO
</P>
<P>
   With subtle shifts of tone and emphasis, Gordon Brown, the
British chancellor of the Exchequer, and other members of the
British government are signaling new warmth toward the
soon-to-be-introduced single European currency, promising to
divulge a ``national changeover plan'' for the euro earlier than
many people had expected.
</P>
<P>
   SINGLE CURRENCY ALREADY A FORCE
</P>
<P>
   While the advent of the euro, Europe's single currency, is still
weeks away, it is already a financial force, both in currency
trading and in European capital markets, where it has begun to
alter the ways in which governments do business.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING INDICATORS STAY UNCHANGED
</P>
<P>
   The index of leading economic indicators was unchanged in
September for a second consecutive month, suggesting that the
economy may be slowing at a time when Federal Reserve Board
policy-makers are considering whether to cut interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA STRUGGLING WITH DEBT
</P>
<P>
   For 2,000 Indonesian companies that have racked up $67 billion
in foreign corporate debt, one factor holds true for them all: They
cannot pay their bills, and the patience of their creditors is
wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   EQUITABLE PROFIT DECLINES 23 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Equitable, the financial services and insurance concern, posted
a 23 percent decline in third-quarter earnings largely because its
investment business was hurt by the summer upheavals in global
stock and bond markets. Shares of Equitable, which is controlled by
AXA of France, fell $1.125, to $47.75.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney said its fiscal fourth-quarter net income fell 24
percent because of weak films and lower demand for its products in
some places.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan International said its third-quarter profits rose
more than eightfold, but the results missed Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum said its operating profit fell 36 percent in
the third quarter, which was less than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ABC LOCKS OUT STRIKING WORKERS
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand ABC employees who went on a 24-hour strike on

lockout of workers.
</P>

   The Los Angeles Times said it would cut its 6,400-person work
force by 250 people, or nearly 4 percent.

WITH WIFE AND CLOSE FRIENDS, CLINTON WATCHES RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton watched the election returns roll
in Tuesday night much the same way that he campaigned: from the
White House, in the company of loyal friends and quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has bitterly complained in the last two days about
the political culture of Washington, the president remained
sequestered with Hillary Rodham Clinton here rather than venture
into a country that was molding his political fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us know what is going to happen,'' Clinton said
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if this election, with impeachment hearings looming,
was a referendum on whether he should stay in office, the president
replied that it was ``a referendum on all the hopes of the American
people for the future and their assessment of the present
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   To watch the returns, Clinton gathered in the White House
solarium on Tuesday night with members of his senior staff, like
Doug Sosnik, a White House counselor, and some close friends,
including Terence McAuliffe, a leading Democratic fund-raiser
</P>
<P>
   Like birthdays for others, elections have served as signposts in
Clinton's life, and he seemed in a philosophical mood Tuesday.
Answering a handful of questions before a lengthy meeting with his
economic advisers, he seized on a reporter's observation that
Election Day marked his ``sixth anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been six very good years, very good years for our
country,'' Clinton said. ``And as I tell everybody around here,
even the bad days are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke Tuesday with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico
about storm damage in Central America, and with Prime Minister Tony
Blair of England about Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But though his aides said that the president seemed focused on
such matters, they said that he was quite nervous about the
election. His political director, Craig Smith, regularly updated
him throughout the day, and the president placed several calls to
friends around the country, asking, in the words of one adviser,
``Whaddaya hear, whaddaya know, whaddaya think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's desperately worried about the money,'' the adviser said,
referring to a $110 million Republican Party advantage in
fund-raising in this election. ``All the late information was good,
all the polling and the anecdotal stuff, but they've got so much
more money, and he's just haunted by how much more money they
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, some White House aides speculated that
Democrats might actually gain seats in the midterm elections. But
such talk faded as the Monica Lewinsky scandal intensified this
summer. Now they are emphasizing that money, rather than any
presidential dalliance and lies, gave the Republicans a powerful
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a historical last-minute push for help from
donors, Clinton and other Democrats worked hard in recent days to
encourage black voters _ among the most reliable Democrats _ to go
to the polls. That strategy appeared to be paying off, White House
aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of recent interviews with news organizations
oriented toward black and Hispanic Americans, Clinton repeatedly
urged his listeners to vote, warning that Republicans would
obstruct policies beneficial to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how much his political position has recovered
since his acknowledgment of an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton
tried to turn the scandal to his advantage, suggesting that
Republicans who were focused on it could not govern effectively.
The president presented himself as the victim of relentless
political enemies obsessed with scandal, in an interview broadcast
Monday night on the cable network BET.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of a permanent political class in Washington
that tends to thrive on such matters because they're not affected
by what I came here to do,'' Clinton said. He reeled off policy
goals, like raising the minimum wage, that he said did not matter
to such people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group in America where the acquisition of political
power is more important than the purpose for which it's used,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton said that some of his opponents never thought they would
have another Democratic president in their lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that are consumed with personal animosity toward me
or toward Hillary,'' he said, ``I think are just angry because they
thought they and their crowd would always be able to drive up to
the West Wing to work every day.'' He said that he was ``not even
angry at them anymore, adding, ``I'm just sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Clinton said the elections of 1992
and 1996 were the most important of his career. But this election,
he said, is ``very important to me because it will determine how
much I can do for the American people in the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has done few campaign-style rallies this year. His aides
said they decided on a Rose-Garden strategy well before Clinton was
enveloped by scandal. In 1994, they said, sending Clinton out to
campaign seemed to hurt candidates' chances, and previous
presidents seemed to do little good for their parties' candidates
in off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton raised money for Democrats and doggedly
highlighted a select handful of issues, even as the furor over Ms.
Lewinsky seemed to be drowning him out. Other Democrats picked up
on those same themes _ shoring up Social Security, raising the
minimum wage, modernizing classrooms _ with a unanimity not seen
since 1992, White House aides said.

WITH RE-ELECTION BEHIND HIM, BUSH PONDERS RUN FOR PRESIDENCY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ With re-election behind him, Gov. George W. Bush says
he is looking forward to pushing his agenda through the Legislature
and making the most momentous decision of his life _ whether to run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is struggling with whether he wants to put his
family in the spotlight of a presidential campaign. If he decides
the quest is worth it, he said he will send his first affirmative
signal by March.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to think this is a simple decision, but it's not.
It's a complex decision,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just reach inside your soul and ask the question: Is this
what I want to do? It's not a decision to make based on other
people's expectations or what sounds interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been the focus of intense national speculation about
his presidential ambitions _ taking front-runner status 18 months
before the GOP nomination is decided _ and Democratic challenger
Garry Mauro tried to little avail to make it a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wants to take time over the Christmas holidays to
discuss seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 with
his wife, Laura, and twin 16-year-old daughters before deciding
whether to press forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the (legislative) session is under way, I know I'm going
to have to indicate one way or another whether I'm interested in
seeking the presidency,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a final decision and a formal announcement would not
be made until around the time the Legislature ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he regretted a statement he made last month about the
``bubble'' of the presidential spotlight. He said it was
misinterpreted by the national news media to mean that he feared
scrutiny of his ``irresponsible youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is most concerned about the imposition on his wife
and daughters. He said Laura Bush refers to his re-election as
``four more years of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened his family
in 1991 when his father, President George Bush, took the nation
into the Persian Gulf War. He said that gave his girls an
understanding of what it is like to have around-the-clock Secret
Service protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really understand it. This is not a glamorous life to
them,'' Bush said. ``They've seen what it is like, what families go
through. They were raised with Secret Service agents because when
they were kids Saddam made the threat to our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also is wrestling with whether to give up an
``idyllic'' life in Austin. Bush said the decision would be easier
if he had been driven to be president most of his life, but he said
he did not even know he wanted to be governor until about five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't wake up saying, if I'm the eighth-grade class
president I can parlay that into something; then avoiding my
irresponsible youth _ don't do that because that may come back to
haunt you; then the post-irresponsible youth period; then whatever;
then run for governor, run for president.''
</P>
<P>
   But his first priority is to prepare for the upcoming
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to immediately start work on getting an agenda in
place, immediately start working with members of the legislature on
my agenda: on the tax cuts, on the budget, on education matters,''
Bush said. ``I want to prepare my inauguration speech and my State
of the State speech.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will not allow a possible presidential bid to
interfere with his job as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it becomes a distraction I won't let it become a
distraction. I've got a job to do during the session,'' Bush said. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   He sounded a little frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bone fishing,'' he keened. ``Country music. Grandkids. Bar.
Scaasi. Skull and Bones. Speedboats. Spaniels. Best sellers by
spaniels. `We Bushes believe.' I'm not sure I'm ready to go back.
Have we had enough of a breather?''
</P>
<P>
   I understand how he feels. I know there's a lot of bunk in the
Clinton presidency, but there's bunk in Kennebunkport, too. I still
wake up sometimes, shivering, with Lee ``I'm Proud to be an
American'' Greenwood and John ``I'm taking the military plane to
the dentist'' Sununu ringing in my ears.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy and I covered the Bush White House together for four long
years. We chased President Bush around more golf courses, fishing
streams, Texas barbecues, horseshoe pits, quail-killing zones and
pork rinds than you could shake a beef jerky at. Duffy, who works
at Time magazine, co-wrote a book about the Bush years called
``Marching in Place,'' analyzing the administration's scintillating
status quo domestic policy and status-quo-plus foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   And now, after Tuesday night's election, the new generation of
Bushes, from their vote-rich perches in Texas and Florida, are
poised to act on their birthright and behave dynastically.
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s ten-gallon victory in Texas makes it even more
likely that the 2000 race will be a tournament of juniors, a
face-off between two baby-boomer scions, Bush and Gore. I can
picture the debate of the dauphins now: ``Your daddy helped you
more. No, your daddy helped you more. You spent more time growing
up in the East. No, you did. Your daddy got you a better deal
during Vietnam. No, yours did. Harvard's better. No, Yale's better.
Andover rules. No, St. Alban's rules.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the best thing might have been a huge Republican
victory last night. Then he could have run for president on the
persuasive platform of
Don't-let-the-lunatics-take-over-every-wing-of-the-asylum.
</P>
<P>
   George W., on the other hand, is better off with a good
Democratic night. That way it's the liberal, libertine Democrats
who are scary again. He can run on a platform of Bush family
values, railing against the permissive '60s. (George W.'s
equivalent of ``I didn't inhale'' is his admission that he liked
the Beatles, but only before they got into a ``kind of a weird
psychedelic period.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Bush boys, who learned fanatic competition in sports and
life from their father and grandmother, are driven by their desire
to avenge Poppy's loss to Slick. Sometimes I think George W. wants
to run just to put back the horseshoe pit that President Clinton
covered over with a picnic area. And, of course, to get rid of that
Grandee seven-seat hot tub out on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   I have the dread feeling that I have already covered George W.'s
race, even though it hasn't started. The saga of a Yalie who became
a ``self-made'' man, a Midland oilman, a bidnessman, a family man
with a short attention span who likes to ``power pack,'' in Bush
jargon, wolfing down a full meal in three and a half minutes, and
play speed golf, finishing 18 holes in an hour and 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   I feel as if I've already lived through the overstuffed Bush
Rolodex and all those fund-raising receptions thrown by hostesses
named Muffie and Buffie where the only hors d'oeuvres are a slim
wedge of brie and a wilted clump of grapes.
</P>
<P>
   It's deja vu all over again when I hear George W. _ in contrast
to the New Age psychobabble of the president and vice president _
tell a reporter for GQ, ``I'm not a very good psychoanalyst guy.''
His father often begged me, ``Don't stretch me out on the couch.''
(Of course, Bush pere was so against introspection that he
considered even a discussion of books and movies suspiciously
``psychoanalytic.'')
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, maybe we should just get it over with. We
don't want Jeb lurking around, trying to clamber onto the ticket in
2008. Maybe we should just go whole hog with a sibling rivalry
Bush-Bush ticket, leaving it to George W. and Jeb to scrap over
which Bush gets top billing.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know how competitive this family is, consider
this: When the patriarch Bush was told by a friend that I was
writing a column proposing a Bush-Bush ticket, the former president
instantly replied: ``I'm not sure I want to run again.''

CHRYSLER'S OCTOBER SALES ARE UP 20 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Chrysler Corp. reported Tuesday that its October car
and truck sales rose 20 percent over a year ago, indicating yet
another strong month for vehicle sales industrywide despite waning
consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler sold 226,179 cars and trucks this October. Its
percentage increase over the same period last year is significantly
larger than that of many other automakers because of a particularly
weak October last fall. At that time, Chrysler was in the process
of introducing some critical new products and its plants were not
making those new vehicles at expected capacity.
</P>
<P>
   It was those new cars and sport utility vehicles, however, that
buoyed Chrysler's October sales this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's truck sales rose 17 percent to 158,820 vehicles on
the strength of its enormously popular Dodge Durango. The Durango,
introduced last fall, recorded its most successful month ever, with
October sales exceeding September sales by 4,000 vehicles. Jeep
sport utilities, except for the Grand Cherokee, which was
redesigned for this fall and remains in its introductory phase,
also contributed to higher truck sales.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's car sales rose 27 percent to 67,359 vehicles, largely
due to the popularity of its newest models, the Chrysler Concorde
and Dodge Intrepid, introduced a year ago, and the Chrysler 300M
and LHS, which went on sale in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling across enough segments with either strong
contenders in each segment or with a segment leader that regardless
of which way the market goes _ to trucks to sport utilities to
luxury sedans or to minivans _ we've got strength,'' said Jamie
Jameson, Chrysler's director of sales and marketing operations.
``That's a fairly recent phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Chrysler's minivans declined despite cash rebates
ranging from $750 to $1,500. Ever since Chrysler invented them 15
years ago, its minivans have dominated the market but have been
barraged with new competition this fall from Ford's redesigned
Windstar and Honda's new Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our minivan sales are off compared to last year, but we still
sold 37,000 in October and that's a good month,'' Jameson said.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Sales said it recorded its best October ever for
its Toyota and Lexus divisions. Sales for the two divisions totaled
121,216 cars and trucks, up 27 percent from the same period last
year. Toyota division sales rose 24 percent; Lexus sales soared 58
percent.
</P>
<P>
   American Honda said its Honda and Acura car and truck sales in
October increased 10 percent to 91,196, for its best October in
history. Honda's strongest sales were for its Civic, one of the
only small cars on the market with higher sales for the year, its
CR-V sport utility vehicle and its new Acura TL model, introduced
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Also reporting higher sales today were BMW, Volkswagen, Saab,
Mitsubishi, Subaru, Mazda and Kia. Volkswagen reported its best
October sales since 1985 with sales 13 percent higher than a year
ago. BMW reported its best October in history with sales up 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to report
higher sales as well on Wednesday. Analysts predict light-vehicle
sales for the month will be about 6 percent ahead of last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than consumer confidence being off because of the
selloff in the stock market, the other fundamentals are strong,''
Jameson said. ``The factors that would lead you to think a
recession is coming seem to be fading.''

 &HT;    Change of season reflected in wine choices
 &HT;    By Tim Borgert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Seasons change _ as if we need to be reminded
this time of year _ and our palates and gustatory preferences lurch
along in lockstep.
</P>
<P>
   Those chilled pasta salads,
smoked-turkey-and-white-grape-stuffed croissants, and all their
cool-and-light, foo-foo brethren? History. Gone. Replaced by that
big pot of chili simmering on the stove or tomorrow's hearty stew.
</P>
<P>
   The change of seasons reboots the palates of wine and beer
drinkers just as dramatically. The summer taste for light, white
wines withers with the autumn leaves, replaced by a hankering for
heavier, meat-on-the-bones red wines. The seasonal change just
happens to correspond with the release of the first red wines of
the harvest, the Nouveau Beaujolais. Hmm. Those sneaky winemakers
and their marketing departments know what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, legions of beer lovers throttle down on the ultralight
gliders and rev up for the B-52s of brews, embracing the
Octoberfest brews and moving to the more substantial selections.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Simon, corporate sales manager of Arrow Wine &AMP; Spirits in
Dayton, Ohio, said colder weather brings wine customers out of
summer hibernation and into Arrow's stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's thoughts turn more to red wines and to bigger wines,
wines that stand up to the hearty foods of winter,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of wines such as white zinfandel _ the light, semisweet,
quaffable pink wine _ fall in autumn while sales of red wines such
as merlot and Beaujolais rise, said Marshall Harris, owner of
Marshall's Wine &AMP; Liquor in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who has sold wine in northern Montgomery County, Ohio,
for 17 years, sees a similar seasonal shift in beer tastes, from
the Miller Lites and Bud Lights to the Molsons and Labatt's of
fall.
</P>
<P>
   That lesson's not wasted on the folks at the Miami Trail Brewing
Co., the fledgling microbrewery in Xenia, Ohio. Steve Betts, master
brewer at Miami Trail, had just assembled a batch of Doppelbock
brew last week in hopes of matching his seasonal brews with the
palates of the region's beer enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Betts called the dark, comparatively heavy, high-alcohol
Doppelbock and beers like it ``winter warmers.'' Unlike the
lighter, thirst-quenching beers of summer, these are sipping beers
to enjoy over the holidays when socializing with family and
friends. The Doppelbock is scheduled for release by the end of
November, and the price has not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you won't see the Bud Light 12-packs exactly languishing on
the shelves, and the light whites such as sauvignon blanc, riesling
and pinot grigio certainly have their year-round fanciers. We're
not talking about rules or guidelines here. Drink what you like,
whenever you like it.
</P>
<P>
   But take a second look at that six-pack of stout. Zone in on a
zinfandel, real and red. Revel in a Rhone from France. Make off
with a merlot. Or call for a cab _ cabernet sauvignon. The time of
year is right for it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll put the chili on.

 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Center used to be a place where, as one critic
complained, a cloud of dust rose when Tosca stamped her foot.
</P>
<P>
   The neo-Moorish fantasy on West 55th Street began its second
life in 1943 as a ``people's theater,'' where the performing arts
could be enjoyed for $5.95 an orchestra seat, a price raised only
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The former Shriners' temple soon became known as a lovably dowdy
home for the arts, where generations of audiences grew up watching
all-American companies like the New York City Opera, the New York
City Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet grow with them. Theatergoers
could see the Lunts, Paul Robeson and Tallulah Bankhead perform,
along with a raft of musical revivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the years that followed, the center had as many ups and downs
as that opera heroine. There were lean years when it struggled to
keep its doors open, a poor relation to the gleaming Lincoln Center
a few blocks north and a daunting challenge to a succession of
would-be saviors.
</P>
<P>
   The latest is Judith E. Daykin, a briskly pleasant 57-year-old
former administrator with the Paul Taylor Dance Company and the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. Seven years after she was appointed
president and executive director by the theater's board, City
Center is sporting a gleaming new look and personality.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that fresh spirit is attributable to the huge success of
``Encores: Great American Musicals in Concert,'' which opened at
City Center in 1994. The series of rarely heard musicals performed
in semi-staged concert versions with original orchestrations and
star turns by popular performers has become the darling of critics
and audiences alike.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, another theatrical group, the Stratford Festival of
Canada, opens for a two-and-a-half-week season. If successful, the
troupe plans to return each year to City Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daykin has expanded many of City Center's activities,
including fund-raising, marketing and booking. The number of weeks
that the theater is occupied has increased from her first season:
22 companies and events are scheduled over 33 weeks this season;
while 13 companies performed over 17 weeks in the 1991-92 season.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring the theater's accumulated debt of about $750,000
in her first year, she has increased the number of board members,
educational programs and box office hours. She also created an
annual gala that nets $300,000, representing the bulk of donations
from a board that is recognized more for its ideas than its ability
to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   The current annual operating budget is $9.5 million, about 60
percent of which is earned. The red-upholstered 2,300-seat theater
itself _ with its wide, shallow mezzanine and first and second
balconies _ and the backstage warren of small offices and studio
spaces have been spruced up.
</P>
<P>
   A major goal for Ms. Daykin and her board is for City Center to
be booked 11 months of the year. One step in that direction has
been to make the theater almost exclusively a rental, a departure
from the years when City Center presented, or paid, companies to
perform, taking care of their expenses in return for box office
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   This season, under the new scheme, there have been some
disappointments when several well-reviewed troupes failed to do
expected business at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her admirers believe that Ms. Daykin is on her way to
making City Center a viable, financially healthy institution in an
era of declining attendance at music and dance performances. ``What
was a struggle to survive is now a struggle to grow,'' said Raymond
A. Lamontagne, who has been on the board for four years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ms. Daykin has her detractors. City Center's changing
relationship with dance over the last decade has been the subject
of much report-writing and pained discussion in dance circles both
in and outside New York. Some believe that City Center, once a
theater with seven resident dance companies, has abandoned the art,
and there are frequent complaints that the staff can be difficult
to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Ms. Daykin said, ``I think we have the most
extraordinary arts staff in the city, and we bend over backward to
provide services for our user companies.'' Company directors and
others working in dance who were interviewed for this article
declined to speak critically about City Center on the record.
``There's nowhere else to go,'' one administrator said.
</P>
<P>
   The days are gone when the center regularly presented companies
that performed dance, though dance troupes account for 12 of the 22
bookings in the current season. The only attraction that City
Center is financing on its own is the ``Encores'' series.
</P>
<P>
   It is co-presenting the Stratford engagement with the Canadian
theater company, a $1 million project for which the two
institutions have raised $300,000 and are projecting an $850,000
box-office return.
</P>
<P>
   The center charges a $35,000-a-week rental fee to nonprofit arts
companies for use of the theater, some equipment and some services.
That sum, Ms. Daykin said, is only 46 percent of the total cost of
keeping the theater open for a week, so that City Center ultimately
subsidizes the remaining 54 percent of the cost. (Three dance
companies with annual seasons at City Center _ the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater, the Paul Taylor Dance Company and American
Ballet Theater _ receive an additional discount of $5,000.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the cost of performing at City Center is prohibitively
high for most dance companies, in part because of stagehand wages,
which are not included in the rental fee and are comparable to
stagehand rates at Broadway theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a New York season is still considered an important part of a
dance company's development and companies regularly raise money to
lose at City Center. The total cost of a week's engagement there
for a major New York ballet or modern-dance troupe, can range from
$130,000 to $800,000, depending on the company's size, the
lavishness of its productions and whether it uses taped music or an
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   (The top orchestra seat price for dance at City Center is $58
for American Ballet Theater.) Most mainstream ballet and
modern-dance troupes are too big for the chief alternative, the
472-seat Joyce Theater on Eighth Avenue in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we could not afford to present, because if we
presented one company we would have to present all of them,'' Ms.
Daykin said. As a result, she has brought in more drama, including
the National Theater of Greece, in response to what she perceives
as a changing cultural climate. ``The dance boom is over,'' she
said. ``I couldn't keep the theater lit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Kramberg, executive director of the Paul Taylor troupe,
said: ``City Center is one of the larger prestigious venues
available to us. As I understand it, other comparable venues are
more expensive and scheduling is tighter where there are resident
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater most similar to City Center is the New York State
Theater at Lincoln Center, which has two resident companies and few
open weeks. The State Theater charges $100,000 a week for the
2,792-seat house and the front-of-house staff.
</P>
<P>
   The fee does not include the salaries for stagehands, which are
close to Broadway stagehand wages. But because of the different
services and equipment provided by the two theaters, total
production costs work out to be about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences arriving this week and next to see the Stratford
Festival productions of ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' with Brian
Bedford, Martha Henry and William Hutt, and ``The Miser'' will find
a handsome, freshly painted and carpeted theater.
</P>
<P>
   Built for the Shriners in 1923, the Mecca Temple had passed into
the city's possession for nonpayment of taxes and was to be turned
into a parking garage when Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia stepped in to
save it.
</P>
<P>
   LaGuardia and Newbold Morris, president of the city council,
envisioned a theater like Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera
House in everything but ticket prices, with in-house rehearsal
space for the artists who would perform there. The new theater
would be nonprofit, owned by the city and leased for $1 a year to
City Center's governing organization, today the City Center 55th
Street Theater Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   LaGuardia's rescue was not to be the last time City Center was
saved. One blow to the theater's coffers _ and pride _ occurred
when the City Ballet and City Opera abandoned the theater in the
mid-1960s for the State Theater at the new Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, City Center nearly folded, but was saved by a
consortium of dance companies that took on the running of the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ms. Daykin arrived in early 1992, City Center,
though now a declared landmark, was caught in another downward
spiral. Hired to save as well as run it, her responsibilities
include programming, booking attractions and dealing with the
theater's staff, the labor unions and the companies performing
there.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daykin, who grew up in Illinois, began her professional
career as an actor, director and stage manager and has had long
experience in theater and dance. She now commands a mini-empire
from her ninth-floor offices above the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrical productions have played a major role in City Center's
history, starting from its first month as a theater, when it was
called the New York City Center of Music and Drama. The Manhattan
Theater Club is based at City Center, where it has rented two
auditoriums since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the success of the ``Encores'' series, which Ms.
Daykin began with Theodore S. Chapin, president of the Rodgers and
Hammerstein Organization, that has been crucial in the current
rejuvenation of the center.
</P>
<P>
   The series is now fully subscribed, although some seats are
available, Ms. Daykin said. This season ``Encores'' is presenting
``Babes in Arms,'' Feb. 11-14; ``The Ziegfeld Follies of 1936,''
March 25-28, and ``Do Re Mi,'' May 6-9, for five performances each.
``That's probably all we'll ever do,'' Ms. Daykin said about the
number of performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encores'' is expensive, she added, costing $1.7 million a year
to produce; the series earns $1.35 million at the box office (an
orchestra seat is $55), with City Center making up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we have funders who are very devoted to it,'' Ms.
Daykin said. ``And it got attention from people who, if they were
not interested in dance, had not paid attention to City Center.
Returnees translate to givers, which translates to corporate
givers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally perhaps, membership at City Center has
increased, bringing in $200,000 this year as compared with $8,000
in Ms. Daykin's first year. And the move to Broadway of the
``Encores'' production of ``Chicago,'' with companies performing
around the nation and abroad, has meant small royalties for City
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struggling with how to further exploit that,''
Howard M. Squadron, the longtime chairman of City Center's board,
said with relish. ``I'd like to find out how to take a show like
`St. Louis Woman' and give it some summer weeks or get it on
television.'' The 1946 Harold Arlen/Johnny Mercer musical starred
Vanessa L. Williams and ended last season's series with ecstatic
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daykin's enthusiasm for theater has also brought the
Stratford company to City Center. She attended the festival in
Ontario for 30 years, she said, and she and Richard Monette, the
festival's artistic director, are friends. ``Negotiations would
have broken down, except that Judith was very keen on this idea,''
Monette said. ``I kept giving up, but she was tenacious.''
</P>
<P>
   This shift toward theater occurred in part because Ms. Daykin
sensed that City Center lacked an identity. ``Lots of companies
played here,'' she said. ``The audiences were devoted to those
companies, but not to this theater. There was no money to be raised
because there was nothing to be raised (italics)for.''(end
itallics)
</P>
<P>
   The city contributes about $1 million a year to City Center.
``It's a frail relationship,'' Ms. Daykin said about the city's
role as a financial sponsor. ``The money is nowhere near to keeping
pace with inflation or to the support before 1990, when the biggest
cuts to city buildings occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   That other frail relationship in the life of City Center, its
connection to dance, may undergo some changes. A study is now under
way, commissioned by the dance program of the New York State
Council on the Arts, that addresses the feasibility of creating a
1,000-seat house in Manhattan, larger than the Joyce Theater but
smaller and presumably more affordable than City Center.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Yesselman, who is conducting the study, said that Beverly
D'Anne, the head of the state council's dance program, ``was
reacting to what she'd heard at panel meetings year after year
about the need for affordable theaters and rehearsal space.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, expected to be completed by the end of the year,
explores alternatives to City Center that include booking a block
of time at the theater to be built at Columbus Circle by Jazz at
Lincoln Center, building a new theater or renovating an existing
one.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daykin said she doubted that it would be cheaper for dance
companies to perform in such a theater. ``It will never be cheap to
play a large dance company in New York,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Squadron raised another issue: ``I do think it's true that there
are companies that are too big for the Joyce and not up to a
theater like City Center. But I'm not at all sure that there are
enough such companies that could fill a 1,000-seat theater. We can
close off the second balcony and even part of the first balcony at
City Center to make a 1,200- to 1,600-seat theater. It's very
difficult, it seems to me, for someone to come up with a formula
that is perfect. The companies are so different in size and
resources.'' The rental fee stays the same, however.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daykin said that her vision for the future of City Center,
which was at first simply to keep it open and functioning, did in
fact include dance. ``What should City Center be doing?'' she asked
rhetorically. ``We should try to help insure the dance companies'
success here. We can't afford to pay all their bills. We must
present and produce other arts that do not compete with dance. The
more activity, the better we do.''
</P>
<P>
   A workable mix of bookings, she said, would be for City Center
to finance 30 percent of its attractions; to have 30 percent more
as rentals to nonprofit arts groups, and rent a further 30 percent
at higher market fees to companies operating commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, she said, the new audiences brought in by ``Encores''
and the Stratford Festival will cross over and try the dance
companies, whose brochures are on display in the front lobby: ``If
theater people come in and see all the dance materials, realize
they didn't pay too much and can see the stage, and had a nice
brownie in intermission, maybe they'll come back to see some dance.
The same is true for dance audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music, theater and dance all have a place at City Center, just
as LaGuardia envisioned.''

GOT A DIME? CITIBANK AND CHASE END TEST OF ELECTRONIC CASH
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Electronic cash may be joining jet packs, video
phones and other world's fair wonders that never move from the
future to the present.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest of many notable failures for what has been
promoted as the future of money, Citibank and Chase Manhattan have
decided to shut down their test of electronic cash, the nation's
biggest trial of the technology to date.
</P>
<P>
   The banks issued the so-called smart cards _ cards with embedded
computer chips _ to nearly 100,000 people who live on the Upper
West Side of Manhattan. Customers could transfer cash from their
bank accounts onto the cards at automated teller machines and spend
the money at 600 merchants. In theory, this would make small
purchases faster and easier than with coins and bills.
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, most people who tried the system never loaded
their cards a second time. And with few people using the cards,
two-thirds of the merchants dropped out. Indeed, in the program's
first year, less than $2 million was spent using all of the cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we weren't able to make the consumers' life
easier,'' said Carole Lockie, a vice president of Visa USA, which
worked with the New York banks and Mastercard International on the
test.
</P>
<P>
   Chase and Citibank customers with smart cards will be able to
load their cards and spend money at the remaining merchants until
the end of the year. They will then have until six months after the
expiration date on their cards to transfer any remaining cash from
the cards to their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Other similar tests of electronic cash have produced similar
disappointments. Visa introduced its Visa Cash smart card at the
1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, with the hope of continuing to
operate and expand the system there. In fact, the system has all
but shut down and most of the banks have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mastercard closed the introductory test of its Mondex
smart card system in Swindon, England. And it just said it would
end a similar test in Guelf, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart cards are a technology chasing a business case,'' said
Richard Speer, chief executive of Speer &AMP; Associates, a financial
consulting firm. He said that the widespread acceptance of
inexpensive terminals that merchants can use to accept credit and
debit cards has undercut the need for electronic cash.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of smart cards maintained that the technology will
ultimately prove popular; in the test by Chase and Citibank, they
said, consumers were discouraged because they could not use their
cards in all parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you localize your test on the Upper West Side, you
realize your usage will be suppressed, because everyone leaves the
Upper West Side,'' said Judy Darr, director of smart card programs
at Citibank, a unit of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the banks found it too difficult to expand the number of
places accepting the cards, because there was little appeal to
merchants to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real chicken-and-egg case,'' said Ronald Braco,
senior vice president of Chase. ``Merchants don't want something
where they get only a few transactions a day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While smart-card technology may eventually prove to be faster
and easier than cash, merchants found that the versions in the
tests were slow and cumbersome. Customers chose mainly to use the
smart cards at grocery stores, which already take credit and debit
cards. They were less interested in using the cards at newsstands
and other stores that typically only accept cash.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the card couldn't be used in pay telephones, vending
machines or other devices that require change. The New York banks
did put smart-card readers on laundry machines in some apartment
buildings and found that cards were used 30 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The New York smart-card test was announced in April 1996, and
introduced in October 1997. At its introduction, promoters said
that the combination of New York's two largest banks and the
world's two biggest credit-card companies would give the test the
critical mass it needed to overcome the problems that earlier tests
of the technology had faced.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the difficulties the banks faced in getting customers and
merchants to use the system, their prospects of making money from
smart cards remained daunting. Initially, the banks hoped that
consumers would pay $1 or $1.50 a month to use the cards and that
merchants would pay fees to accept them, just as they do now to
take credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   But during the test, the banks were forced to give cash rebates
to customers to try the cards and to merchants to promote
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither of the banks is giving up on smart cards
completely. Braco said that Chase is working on a new smart-card
product it hopes to test next year. The new version will have
multiple features, including the ability to make purchases over the
Internet and to keep track of bonus points at various merchants'
frequent buyer programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned it takes more than just a plain vanilla
stored-value product to be successful,'' Braco said. ``People find
that if there is an incentive to use the card, they will use it
more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase and Mondex are already testing a smart card system at four
Burger King restaurants on Long Island that reward customers for
frequent purchases.
</P>
<P>
   And Citibank says there is likely to be more use of smart cards
outside of the United States. It is going to introduce electronic
cash products in Mexico, Hong Kong and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The banks and credit card companies say there are also numerous
applications for smart cards in closed environments like college
campuses and military bases, in which the cards can be used both
for payment and identification.

CITIGROUP IS FACING FIRST LAW OF MEGAMERGERS: THE INERTIA OF MASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly 10 years ago, Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc. merged to form Time Warner Inc., promising that
the creation of the world's largest media concern would result in
hefty profits from synergies among distinct products like
magazines, films, music, books and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only in the last year that Time Warner has emerged
from managerial turmoil and difficulties selling a host of products
under one roof to begin delivering on the lofty promises of its
megamerger.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Citicorp and Travelers Group agreed to merge to form
Citigroup, promising that the creation of the world's largest
financial services concern would result in hefty profits from
``cross-selling'' distinct products like mortgages, credit cards,
savings accounts, stocks, bonds, corporate loans and mergers and
acquisitions advice.
</P>
<P>
   Like Time Warner, Citigroup is getting off to a rocky start, and
it may be some time before any of the hype surrounding the creation
of Citigroup becomes reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to cross-sell, the buzzword of this merger, is
going to be harder to deliver in an environment in which there is
less demand for the products,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst
with Mitchell Securities Inc. ``This is like turning a battleship
around _ it's going to take a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Time Warner in its early days, Citigroup has co-chief
executives, and on Sunday those co-leaders, Sanford Weill and John
Reed, acted to quell turmoil within Citigroup's newly minted
executive suite by asking for the resignation of James Dimon, the
company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup employees, analysts and Wall Street have given that
move a sign of approval, arguing that Dimon was the person best
suited to succeed Weill and Reed.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday,
Citigroup's already battered stock took a further hit, plunging $2,
or 4.34 percent, to $44.125.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the emotional reaction to Dimon's departure from
Citigroup, a more basic question remains: How will Weill and Reed
get their troubled corporate businesses, those involving investment
banking activities like stock and bond trading and underwriting
that Travelers specialized in, to mesh with such staid businesses
as corporate lending that were Citicorp's forte?
</P>
<P>
   They are not saying.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reeling from their inability to get off to a smooth
start and the threat of looming defections within the executive
ranks, Messrs. Weill and Reed have been unavailable for comment
over the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two executives selected on Sunday to turn around
the corporate business, Victor Menezes and Michael Carpenter, have
been described by Citigroup as amply suited for their new roles,
neither has been available for interviews. Citigroup's spokesman,
John Morris, did not return repeated phone calls on Tuesdau seeking
comment on the company's plans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sunday, Reed described Citigroup's corporate
business as ``in a class of our own,'' compared with robust rivals
like Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, that view appears true.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in terms of U.S. debt and equity underwriting,
Citigroup has managed $193.7 billion worth of deals so far this
year, compared with $247.8 billion for Merrill Lynch, $179.5
billion for Morgan Stanley and $127.7 billion for Goldman,
according to the Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Citigroup, unlike these competitors, also has access to
Citicorp's savings deposits to feed future deal making. And
Citigroup has $45 billion in shareholders' equity, compared with
$15 billion for Morgan Stanley, $8.9 billion for Merrill and $6.5
billion for Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a flow chart, they may look like they're well ahead of
their competitors, but the working pieces are not yet a well-oiled
machine,'' Peabody said. ``There are reasons to question their
ability to execute because some of the prior deals Travelers has
done have yet to bear fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while one of the reasons put forth for Dimon's forced
resignation was $1.3 billion in bond trading losses Citigroup's
Salomon Smith Barney unit incurred in the third quarter, the
acquisition of Salomon Brothers last year by Travelers was Weill's
brainchild _ and something Dimon had opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The jumble of businesses Weill had assembled before merging with
Citicorp were not completely knitted together, and with an even
larger number of different businesses now being meshed, the task of
coordinating them is even more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are neither fish nor fowl compared with the other big
firms,'' said Raphael Soifer, an analyst with Brown Brothers
Harriman &AMP; Company. ``They are heavily weighted overseas,
especially in emerging markets, have a large foreign- exchange
operation and have a range of investment banking operations that
aren't yet bulge bracket.''
</P>
<P>
   The one great worry for Citigroup is that its problems and
continued squabbling between Citicorp and Travelers executives over
corporate turf, may ultimately cause defections among its clients
to more stable firms on Wall Street. But analysts said that so far
that worry was not a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how apparent it is to customers that there is
turmoil at Citigroup right now,'' said David Berry, an analyst with
Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods Inc. ``But I don't think customers are
seeing service degrading either.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Citigroup still has to prove that the rationale for
its merger was valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If part of the vision of the merger was cross-selling,
Citigroup can't do that until it figures out how to make the
structure work,'' Berry said.

<P>
   The votes Americans cast in Tuesday's midterm elections will
inevitably have an impact on the impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton, and hence on the remaining months of his
presidency. But according to a survey of voters leaving the polls,
that was not what most had on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will have an effect on Clinton's future,'' said
Ferrel Guillory of the University of North Carolina, one of the
swing states in the balloting. ``But that doesn't mean that
Clinton's past had much effect on this election. Everything I've
seen and heard suggests quite the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those elected were all 435 of the representatives who will
be called upon next year, if the process unfolds as expected, to
vote ``yea'' or ``nay'' on articles of impeachment. Also chosen, in
an election in which fewer than four of ten eligible voters
bothered to participate, were a third of those who will sit as
jurors if the House sends the case to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Early results suggested that Democrats had done better than they
feared and the Republicans hoped. In the Ohio River valley, with a
number of close House races in three states, Democrats turned in
powerful showings that had seemed beyond their reach as recently as
two or three weeks ago, and Sen. Ernest Hollings Jr., D-S.C., one
of the last Democratic survivors from the days of the one-party
South, made a strong re-election run in the face of a stiff
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But an unusual number of Senate races appeared headed for photo
finishes, reflecting a close partisan division that also showed up
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, nearly six voters in ten said their vote was
cast neither in support of nor in opposition to Clinton, but for
other reasons. About two in ten told interviewers for a consortium
of five television networks and The Associated Press that they were
expressing backing for the president, and about the same number
said they were expressing disapproval of him.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, neither Republican efforts to demonize the president
for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky through a late flurry of
television ads in pivotal districts, nor the Democrats' efforts to
picture congressional Republicans as mindless partisans determined
to savage the Clinton at all costs, succeeded in making the
election a referendum on the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, in fact, a referendum at all. Unlike the Republican
sweep of four years ago, this was a typical midterm election in the
sense that people tended to respond to the candidates themselves
and to issues that seemed important in their localities rather than
to national imperatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a Seinfeld election,'' said Curtis Gans, who runs an
organization that monitors voter turnout. ``He said his show wasn't
about anything, and neither was this election.''
</P>
<P>
   When people were pressed to say what issue mattered most to
their voting decisions, almost a quarter mentioned either the
Lewinsky affair or ``moral and ethical issues,'' which might be
taken to mean the same thing. But more than three-quarters
mentioned other issues like education or Social Security, jobs or
taxes, with education at the head of the list. Schools were
featured in television commercials, handbills and stump speeches in
a number of the hardest-fought contests this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But preliminary figures suggested that the Democrats may have
succeeded in stimulating a sizeable black turn-out with last-minute
efforts including a visit by Clinton to a black church in Baltimore
on Sunday and a television spot that concluded: ``Next Tuesday,
vote Democratic. And tell Congress we're ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   In a number of ways, the exit poll confirmed the findings of
dozens of surveys taken over the past six months. Voters expressed
approval of Clinton's performance as president, disapproval of his
personal conduct and disappointment at Congress' performance under
Republican leadership. They expressed confidence about the national
economy. Most said they would just as soon see the impeachment
matter dropped, although the electorate was divided, the exit poll
found, on whether Congress should censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the country is happy with its lot,'' a top Republican
strategist said last weekend. ``No winds of discontent, no tidal
waves of change.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors favoring the status quo. Only 34
members of the House of Representatives and only five senators, far
fewer than average, are retiring this year, and most seats change
party hands when they are open. Incumbents also had a strong
advantage in raising money this year.
</P>
<P>
   No president's party in this century has made a net gain in
House seats midway through a second presidential term. That, and
Clinton's travails, led to widespread predictions a month or so ago
of at least modest gains by the Republicans, but that view changed
as Election Day approached.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement in Democratic prospects, apparently borne out in
the balloting, resulted in part from a widespread belief that the
Republicans had overplayed their hand in handling the report of
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. Another factor may have
been a string of successes for Clinton, who wore his governing and
not his campaigning hat last month.
</P>
<P>
   While Vice President Al Gore _ increasingly introduced to
audiences as ``the next president of the United States'' _
barnstormed through more than a dozen states, Clinton, by most
impartial accounts, bested the Republican leadership in the budget
deal; played midwife to a Middle East land-for-peace agreement,
worked within the G-7 group of industrialized nations to stabilize
the global economy, and grabbed a few rays of the limelight when
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, returned to space.
</P>
<P>
   One result must have given particular comfort to Gore, whose
political style is sometimes so wooden that he once compared
himself to an oak plank. Democratic Lt. Gov. Gray Davis of
California, the apparent victor in the gubernatorial race in the
nation's largest state, based on exit polls, is even less colorful,
but that did not hurt him in a race against a strongly ideological
rival, Dan Lundgren. Gore may face a right-wing Republican in the
2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Or he may face Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a studiously
non-ideological politician who was re-elected by a sizeable
majority. Bush and his younger brother Jeb, whom exit polls
projected as the victor in the Florida governor's race, would be
strongly placed in the struggle for the Republican presidential
nomination as governors of two of the nation's four biggest states.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, a good election for moderates, with victories
for Davis, the two Bushes, Gov. George Voinovich of Ohio in a
Senate race and a number of other centrist House and Senate
candidates of both parties, as compared to the avalanche of
right-wing triumphs only four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This was particularly noticeable in the governors' races. As
more and more government power has moved from Washington to the
statehouses, voters have seemed eager to keep the blatant
partisanship that characterizes Washington these days out of
governments that live closer to where they live.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walk inside any major department store, and the
troubles that have torn the fabric of the fashion industry are
evident.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Isaac Mizrahi closed its doors, and Anne Klein
has been put on the block after losing money for several years. A
shakeout among small design companies has left men's, women's and
children's clothing departments dominated by a handful of big
designers such as Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan and Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   And as smaller designers close their doors, the big fashion
companies command even more influence with retailers and gain more
space for their clothing in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk into the stores, you can walk onto a floor and
you can notice immediately who controls that floor,'' said Mari
Harkins, a senior director of merchandising at Donna Karan
International Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The slump in the fashion industry is also evident in Bryant Park
in midtown Manhattan, where the American fashion industry's latest
showcase of women's-wear collections is under way. The roster for
this year's shows is littered with cancellations from companies
that have fallen as well as those that decided to forgo the
hundreds of thousands of dollars required to put on a show.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Kenar Enterprises Ltd. filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection and Andrea Jovine shut its doors. Todd Oldham
has closed his wholesale collection business. Adrienne Vittadini
has resigned from her namesake company, now owned by Marisa
Christina Inc. And Nautica Enterprises will end a licensing
agreement with Bernard Chaus Inc. for its women's business, leaving
the future of the line uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The thinning ranks of independent designers stems to some degree
from a gradual erosion in consumer confidence. With signs of an
economic slowdown ahead, shoppers have been reining in their
free-spending ways. But the industry shakeout is also a ripple
effect from an earlier consolidation among department stores that
weakened fashion's grip on retailing.
</P>
<P>
   After waves of mergers in the 1980s and '90s, there are now only
three major department-store chains: May Co., Federated Department
Stores and Dillard's.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores are putting more pressure on fashion companies
to assume a greater share of the risk for selling their products,
helping to guarantee profits for the store. Department stores keep
inventories low, but they require shipments of new styles more
often and have reduced the numbers of styles they carry.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion companies often bear the brunt of the expense for
ensuring that their products are displayed appropriately on selling
floors, and they may be responsible for covering a portion of
salesclerks' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Department stores are trying to add more value and cut costs
substantially,'' said an investment banker at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   To increase their influence over retailers, Donna Karan, Tommy
Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren have expanded into lower-priced lines.
Discount chains have added to the competitive environment by
introducing their own designer products.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, small designers, especially those that link couture
to mainstream fashion in a product known as a bridge line, are
under intense pressure to justify their existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apparel industry is a microcosm of the big picture'' of
the economy, said Bud Konheim, chief executive of Nicole Miller, a
company once synonymous with a must-have, little black dress.
``It's survival of the fittest, and it offers tremendous
opportunities for those who know how to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the $85 billion women's apparel market has been been
relatively flat, with revenue growing just 12 percent in the last
five years, according to Tactical Retail Monitor, an industry
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   For many fashion companies, that means the only way to gain
market share has been to grab it from other companies, and the
stiff competition has caused designers to cut prices this year by
about 30 percent, retail analysts and executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Even large, publicly held fashion companies have not been
immune, and their share prices have suffered this year. While some
companies have increased their presence in stores and have seen
gains _ often, however, through lower prices _ investors have been
resolutely downbeat about the prospects for consumer spending on
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Donna Karan, for example, are down more than 41
percent this year; they fell Tuesday after the company reported
third-quarter earnings that were below Wall Street estimates and
warned that it would only break even for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Other apparel and fashion stocks have been weak. Liz Claiborne
is down almost 25 percent for the year and Jones Apparel is off 13
percent. Faring slightly better is Polo Ralph Lauren, down about 9
percent, while Tommy Hilfiger is ahead of the pack, with its stock
up about 32 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there are smaller, independent design companies that have
thrived lately, in many cases by rethinking the way they do
business to compete in leaner times.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Nicole Miller and Tahari Ltd., a bridge
sportswear company, are streamlining inventories and speeding up
production to respond more quickly to changing tastes and to
eliminate the need to cut prices to sell slow-moving products.
Others, like the women's suit maker Kasper ASL Ltd., are scrambling
to consolidate to gain more clout with retailers and broaden their
product lines.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they and other companies such as BCBG Max Azria
and Garfield &AMP; Marks are trying to wrest themselves from the
control of the department-store giants by showcasing their fashions
in small specialty shops or in their own retail stores. Selling in
smaller shops means giving up a potentially larger sales volume,
but it also frees them from the pressures of slashing prices to
compete.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Miller now collects 80 percent of its sales through
specialty stores. The change has given the company more control of
its supply, so that it can quickly curb production of unpopular
items and limit price cuts, Konheim, Nicole Miller's chief, said.
</P>
<P>
   For Max Azria, the success of its own stores has given it
increased leverage with department stores. With 70 retail stores in
the United States and 12 overseas, sales at the company have jumped
to a projected $280 million from about $1.3 million nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Max Azria fashions are featured in several display
windows at the flagship Bloomingdale's store in Manhattan. And the
company expects to increase its selling space in the department
store by about 50 percent next year, said Max Azria, the president
and chief designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think this business is an easy business and that
anybody can do it,'' he said. ``But I am a very creative
businessman and a very creative fashion designer. When people think
the two specialties are not possible, it's because they cannot do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The harsh business environment means that a hot young designer
can no longer expect to follow in the footsteps of Calvin Klein and
start a design company that quickly becomes a licensing powerhouse.
Instead, there has been a growing trend of designers for hire,
which lets designers maintain their own independent business while
offering their creative talent to other established firms.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion companies, too, have looked outside their ranks for
designers to bolster their lines.
</P>
<P>
   Tse, known for its luxury line of cashmere clothing, chose an
outside designer, Hussein Chalayan, who has his own successful
line, to design a new sportswear line, Tse New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have to evolve,'' said Rebecca Shafer, creative
director for Tse. ``When you're not open to new rules, you might
get your company into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules may include expanding into new markets and
distinguishing their products by the use of innovative fabrics and
designs.
</P>
<P>
   The upscale sportswear designer Yeohlee Teng, for instance, is
using new fabrics to create an entire line that is stain-resistant
and water-repellent.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, Elie Tahari and his partner, Andrew Rosen, a
former Anne Klein executive, started a new company and a
contemporary sportswear line, Theory, which uses Lycra to create a
line of men's and women's clothing. Theory's sales have tripled
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the line has solidified Tahari's move into the
realm of casual sportswear and away from his 1970s career suits for
women, which earned him the nickname ``king of the jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Tahari has also been successful in using the quick manufacturing
turnaround that is a hallmark of its contemporary sportswear in the
company's broader fashion line.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for example, the company noticed that the new
deep-pocketed cargo pants it had been late to take to market were
selling well. As a result, the company quickly produced 2,000
additional pairs and had them in stores within two months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the leaner times overall, there has not been much
consolidation in the fashion industry. But that may be changing,
according to investment bankers at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Liz Claiborne, which owns the Dana Buchman bridge
line, and Jones Apparel, which produces Ralph Lauren's moderately
priced Lauren sportswear line, have used acquisitions to build
their businesses and edge smaller companies out of department-store
space.
</P>
<P>
   Now other companies are joining in. When news surfaced late last
month about a potential sale of Anne Klein &AMP; Co., another
well-known bridge sportswear line that has been struggling for
years, at least three companies showed interest in buying it, in
part because of its lucrative licensing potential.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger companies have a better chance of withstanding the rough
road ahead that some analysts predict for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Josie Esquivel, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
forecasts that apparel sales will grow about 1 percent to 2 percent
this year, down from an earlier forecast of about 3 percent to 4
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the slowdown is a perceived lack of freshness
among the apparel industry's current offerings, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not all that much that's new,'' Ms. Esquivel said.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion is capable of surprises. There will always be
independent designers who will catch the public's eye, and some may
end up on a different path from that of Mizrahi, who says he plans
to pursue a career in another fickle industry, the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people see something at the right price and it's a product
that they need, they'll buy it,'' Ms. Esquivel said. ``Department
stores, even in a slowdown, don't close their doors. They tend to
focus on those suppliers they can count on.''

U.S. SAYS IT IS ABLE TO STRIKE IRAQ FROM THE PERSIAN GULF  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the United States pressed an intense diplomatic
campaign to isolate President Saddam Hussein of Iraq,
administration and Pentagon officials said Tuesday that they had
sufficient forces and firepower in the Persian Gulf to launch a
strike on Iraq within days.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen began a whirlwind tour of
European and Persian Gulf allies with a stop in London. There,
Britain's minister of defense, George Robertson, joined Cohen in
raising the threat of force if Hussein does not reverse his
decision to end all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen later flew to Saudi Arabia and met with King Fahd and
other senior Saudi officials, whose support _ at least tacitly _ is
important to the administration's diplomatic efforts. In what
amounted to a full-court press on the Saudis, Vice President Al
Gore also spoke by telephone Tuesday with Crown Prince Abdullah, a
day after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made her own call.
</P>
<P>
   During a confrontation with Iraq last winter, Saudi Arabia
refused to grant the United States permission to use Saudi air
bases or air space to launch any attacks against Iraq. In the Saudi
capital, Riyadh, a Saudi official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said King Fahd reiterated that stance to Cohen Tuesday,
the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, who is traveling with
Cohen, later released a statement saying the secretary was
``confident that the U.S. will have the support it needs to take
appropriate action to support the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   Saudi approval may be moot. In the months since the last
showdown, the United States has reshaped its forces in the region,
making Saudi Arabia's approval much less important militarily. The
Pentagon drastically reduced the number of aircraft it has based in
the region, including those at Saudi Arabia's Prince Sultan Air
Base, while it doubled the number of Tomahawk cruise missiles it
has aboard Navy ships and submarines plying the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are fewer fighters and bombers in the region than
there were earlier this year, the Navy now has 250 to 300 cruise
missiles, more than were used during the Persian Gulf war in 1991,
officials said, speaking, as did others who discussed the subject,
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise missiles _ and the 50 or so combat aircraft aboard
the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower _ could enable the United
States to mount an attack against Iraq without having to spend days
or weeks trying to secure permission from gulf states reluctant to
support strikes against fellow Arabs in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully expected we would be where we are now,'' said an
administration official. The official added that Pentagon
commanders had drawn up new plans that rely on the smaller,
reconfigured American force to do what a much larger force had been
prepared to do earlier this year: strike military bases and
factories all across Iraq that are suspected of making chemical or
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq ignited this latest confrontation when it announced on
Saturday it would end all cooperation with inspectors searching out
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs. The move followed
its decision in August to suspend cooperation with certain kinds of
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which faced criticism for failing to
respond forcefully to Iraq's moves in August, has been heartened by
the near-universal anger at Hussein's latest maneuver. Iraq's
sympathizers on the U.N. Security Council, including Russia and
France, have joined in condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia Tuesday, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov warned the
United States against military against Iraq, but also sharply
criticized Hussein for provoking a new crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, meeting at the State Department with Germany's new
foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said Hussein had
``re-invigorated the coalition'' against him. ``Saddam Hussein in a
huge way has miscalculated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that military action was not
imminent, certainly not before the end of the week. In the face of
international outrage, Iraq has already sent mixed signals about
its confrontation with the weapons inspectors, suggesting it may
yet retreat.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq does not, however, administration officials said the
United States was prepared to respond quickly with force.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's trip has been usually secretive. His entourage _
including Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering and the
commander of American forces in the region, Gen. Anthony Zinni _
did not include any members of the news media. Nor has the
itinerary been made public, although he is to travel to Kuwait and
other gulf states on Wednesday, and Turkey announced he would be
there on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the decision to give the trip a low public
profile was a deliberate effort to avoid putting the gulf allies in
a position to have to declare support or not. ``It's hard to judge
from day to day where the mood of the gulf is,'' one official said.
``He's out there sounding them out.''

JAPANESE SALES WERE INFLATED, U.S. MEDICAL COMPANY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than a month after Boston Scientific Corp. was forced to
recall a new medical device because of severe safety concerns, the
company announced Tuesday that its Japanese subsidiary had
improperly inflated sales by millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the medical device company said a routine internal
review had detected that the subsidiary had recently reported $40
million to $50 million in sales of inventory to distributors that
were not true sales. In addition, the subsidiary may have
overstated sales in earlier years by a further $40 million, said
Larry Best, the company's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company is ``aggressively investigating'' the accounting
irregularities, Best said, and will have more information in a few
weeks. Revenue for this year is still expected to top $2 billion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two executives in charge of the company's Japanese operations _
the president of the Japanese subsidiary and the president of
Boston Scientific International _ have offered to resign, Best
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement took Wall Street analysts by surprise.
The company's shares fell $5.875, to $46.375, on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the company has seen an erosion of its credibility,''
said Eli Kammerman, an analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates, who
has not recommended the stock to investors since July because he
said he regarded the company's estimates of future earnings as
exaggerated. ``This problem highlights the intense pressures that
Wall Street puts on companies to meet earnings expectations,''
Kammerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Boston Scientific, which is based in Natick, Mass.,
voluntarily recalled a medical device after at least one patient
died and 26 others were injured. The recall came only two months
after regulators at the Food and Drug Administration began letting
the company sell the device, a new type of catheter, or tube, used
to gain access to internal organs and blood vessels. The product
that was recalled, known as a stent, was used in patients with
heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is now investigating whether Boston Scientific should
have notified federal regulators before it changed its method of
manufacturing the stent.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the investigation, Best said, ``I don't think there
is an issue there at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company was trying to get the product back on
the market by early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, some Wall Street analysts said that they were
disappointed by the announcement of the accounting irregularities,
but that they were relieved that the problem seemed to be confined
to Japan, which now accounts for about 20 percent of the company's
sales.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Glenn Reicin, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said he
did not believe the accounting irregularities were as severe as
those found this year at other companies, such as Cendant Corp., a
marketing and franchising company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this another Cendant?'' Reicin asked. ``Based on the
information presented by management, the answer is probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where the overzealousness of management in
Japan hurt the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also grappling with another big accounting issue
that involves its recent acquisition of Schneider Worldwide, a
medical device manufacturer, from Pfizer Inc. The company has
postponed reporting third-quarter results to try to comply with new
requirements from the Securities and Exchange Commission on
accounting for certain types of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific paid $2.1 billion for Schneider and had
expected to write off hundreds of millions of dollars of that as
the amount paid for Schneider's past research and development. But
the SEC has recently been cracking down on companies that have
tried to write off too much of the cost of an acquisition by taking
a one-time hit to their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   Best said that Boston Scientific's auditing firm, Ernst &AMP; Young,
is now evaluating just how much of the Schneider acquisition can be
written off. The less the company writes off now, the more
goodwill, an intangible asset, the company must add to its balance
sheet. That amount must then be gradually written off, reducing
future earnings.

BUYERS, SEC TRACK PENNY STOCK OF MOUNTAIN ENERGY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL DAVIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dana Moore bought Mountain Energy stock after seeing the Houston
company's claim on the Internet that it owned coal and natural gas
properties worth $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   The free-lance graphic artist, who lives in Birmingham, Ala.,
was hoping to get a bargain, but he wound up with a painful loss
and a job delivering pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and hundreds of other small investors snapped up the
stock, thinking the shares would quickly run up to $5 or more per
share, as touted online.
</P>
<P>
   The stock had already had a striking run-up. From its inception,
Mountain Energy more than tripled in value in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock went from 43 cents per share on May 20, the day before
the formation of the company was announced, to $1.53 per share on
June 1, the day Mountain Energy officially opened its doors.
</P>
<P>
   But the party was over almost before it began. The company born
in May was out of business by August, with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on its trail.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and the company's former chairman say the SEC is
investigating the company. The agency will not confirm or deny an
investigation is under way, said John Heine, SEC spokesman in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Energy's case highlights the pitfalls for investors of
buying penny stocks based on information received over the
Internet. Last week, the SEC filed fraud charges against 44
individuals for stock fraud over the Internet. Mountain Energy
officials were not among those charged.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mountain Energy's stock closed at a half-cent per
share. It trades in the pink sheets, the most obscure market for
thinly traded shares.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Moore lost $6,800 from his wife's individual
retirement fund. Stung by the loss, he took a part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've delivered pizza in a vain attempt to repay the money I
lost,'' said Moore, 50.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and a growing number of other Mountain Energy investors _
about 170 at last count _ have banded together over the Internet to
loudly protest what they say was a blatant and intentional
deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sets this apart is the Internet and how it was initially
used to push the stock and how we have been able to use it to get
the word out,'' said investor Gregg Polley, who lost $50,000 in
Mountain Energy stock. ``This sort of effort would not have been
possible in the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors like Polley and Moore say they understand the inherent
risks in penny stocks, but they are outraged by the extravagant
claim that set off the rally in Mountain Energy stock _ a press
release that said it held natural gas and coal that would be worth
$2.85 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company's press release claimed that state officials in West
Virginia estimated its properties held minerals worth $200 million.
But an official with the West Virginia Geologic and Economic
Survey, the state agency that the company claimed was the source of
the estimates, says the agency doesn't even know where the
properties are located and never offered such an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Energy paid 50 million shares of its stock for the
properties to an attorney, who says he bought the tracts solely for
payment of back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Energy's trail of ownership gets somewhat murkier from
that point. It is estimated that about 20 million Mountain Energy
shares were swapped for shares of International Casino Cruises, the
public shell company that was renamed Mountain Energy. Despite its
name, International Casino Cruises' former line of business was
running convenience stores in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   John Christensen, president of International Casino Cruises,
resigned after the company was renamed. He declined to be
interviewed for this story. His lawyer, Stephen Newhouse, said
Christensen's role at Mountain Energy was ``very limited'' and
consisted mainly of working on the transition from International
Casino Cruises to Mountain Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the pending SEC investigation, ``I don't want my
client spouting off to a newspaper at this juncture to defend
himself,'' Newhouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, his relatives and family members were some of the
largest shareholders in Mountain Energy, holding about 2.5 million
shares of the company's stock as of June 22, according to company
documents posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Usleton, Mountain Energy's former chairman and chief
executive, says he was misled about the company's prospects as well
and lost about $40,000 of his own money in the deal. He said none
of the money from Mountain Energy stock sales found its way into
the company's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he tells investors who lost their shirts in
Mountain Energy stock, Usleton replied, ``Welcome to the club.'' He
says he doesn't know who authored the press releases about the West
Virginia properties other than to say he didn't write them.
</P>
<P>
   There are still messages posted at pennypicks.com, an online
trading site for penny stocks, touting Mountain Energy's stock. One
assessment reads: ``Explosive potential, when announcements and
future projections are made, stock will buoy close to $2. Once
production begins, $5-$10 then NASDAQ and in the teens.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has questioned Mountain Energy investors both in person
and in a questionnaire it mailed them.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has also subpoenaed all of the company's documents,
said Usleton. He said he has given the SEC all of his stock trading
records as well as his personal checking account statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they want me to testify at some time as well,''
Usleton said in a telephone interview from his home in Houston. He
has since started a new company in Houston named Ibis Energy.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC issued a press release in July saying it had halted
trading in Mountain Energy while it looked into the accuracy of
statements made by the company. Specifically, the SEC was looking
at the company's ``ownership of certain properties and the
valuation of the mineral assets on those properties.''
</P>
<P>
   The trading ban was later lifted, and although the stock is
virtually worthless, as recently as Oct. 9, 798,000 shares changed
hands in one day.
</P>
<P>
   The investors who lost their money are looking for where the
money went. They have yet to hire a lawyer, but have been receiving
legal advice on how to pursue a ``disgorgement'' action to recover
money from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Sites on the Internet hold volumes of scanned company documents
showing stock ownership, the legal agreement creating the company
and other documents related to the formation of Mountain Energy.
</P>
<P>
   The most comprehensive of these is at
twinjet.simplenet.com/MTEI, where company documents have been
posted by disgruntled investors.
</P>
<P>
   Another investor, Lisa Thomas, is a former teacher. She goes by
the online name of Raven when posting new information about the
company on the Web site she set up as an information clearinghouse
for investors who feel they were burned buying Mountain Energy
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a veteran penny-stock investor, alleges Mountain Energy
went far beyond the fringes of legitimacy where penny stocks often
circulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know when you buy these stocks that there are built-in
problems,'' Thomas said. ``They are always on the verge of doing a
deal that never quite gets done and things like that, but you do
not buy on the basis of a press release that is an outright lie.''
</P>
<P>
   After the May 21 press release saying the company had properties
containing $200 million worth of coal and coal-bed methane,
Mountain Energy issued a press release on June 18 stating flatly
and with no sources that the properties contained 2 billion cubic
feet of natural gas and 10 million tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
   That same release said the new company had 20,000 acres of oil
and gas properties. Later, on June 24, the company issued a release
saying that the 20,000-acre number was a typographical error and
that the real number was more like 5,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The West Virginia properties that are at the core of the
company's claims comprise 62 tracts totaling about 6,200 acres,
which were bought for payment of back taxes, said Marc Tow, the
California real estate lawyer who sold the properties to Mountain
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Usleton said the company was able to make its claim that the
properties held as much as $200 million in coal and natural gas
based on hypothetical estimates provided by the West Virginia
Geologic and Economic Survey, a state agency that researches oil,
coal and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But Steve McClelland, head of the services section at that
agency, says the agency has no idea what sort of reserves are on
any Mountain Energy properties for a simple reason: It has no idea
where the tracts are located, nor has anyone at Mountain Energy
offered to tell anyone at the agency where they are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their statement about West Virginia properties is very, very
vague,'' McClelland said. ``When we could not get an accurate
location, all we could do is tell people that we could not say for
sure there was not coal or gas on these tracts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in the dark; we are curious where the properties
really are,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Mountain Energy ever seek permits to drill or mine on
any of its properties in West Virginia, according to a spokesman
for the state's Division of Environmental Protection, the agency
that issues such permits.
</P>
<P>
   Tow is astonished that anyone would issue a press release saying
the property was worth $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not understand how those press releases got out there; it
is not the truth,'' Tow said. He would not say how much he paid for
the properties but said he paid ``real money'' for them.
</P>
<P>
   Tow said he was the first person to talk to the SEC. Usleton
says that he has been talking to the SEC since June 2.
</P>
<P>
   For Tow, the Mountain Energy saga has led to a torrent of
unsubstantiated allegations, all of which he says are completely
false. He says he has done nothing wrong but has been pilloried on
the Internet by ``crazies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone called my house and told my son that his father was
going to die,'' Tow said. ``I have been tried on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the questionnaires sent to investors from the SEC, the
claims about the West Virginia properties appear to be the central
issue the agency is looking into. The document contains 12
questions, asking investors how they came to buy the stock, what
they read about it and who they may have spoken to regarding the
stock that might have influenced their choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the company's existence, all eight
employees were let go and Usleton, as the sole remaining director
of the company, accepted his own resignation. He now says that he
was never given a chance to run the company as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   His last act at Mountain Energy was signing over to himself all
of the company's furniture, fixtures and equipment, as well as an
oil and gas lease on 2,900 acres in the Austin Chalk near Giddings.
The Austin Chalk, a geological trend that runs from Central Texas
to Louisiana, is associated with oil and gas production.
</P>
<P>
   The West Virginia properties are still owned by Mountain Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Usleton said he bought the Austin Chalk leases with money
borrowed from the bank and they are the only assets of his new Ibis
Energy, which he is running from his home.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ibis Energy is still a private company, Usleton says
he hopes to take it public soon. &QL;

FOCUSING ON GLAM ROCK'S BLURRING OF IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anyone who watches ``Velvet Goldmine,'' Todd Haynes'
extravagant, silver-spangled, $7 million valentine to glam rock, is
bound to wonder if the filmmaker was himself once a glitter-crazed
teen-age rebel who hennaed his hair, experimented with
cross-dressing and pranced around in six-inch platform shoes. The
answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine,'' which is set mostly in London in the early
1970s, follows the rise, fall and mysterious disappearance of Brian
Slade, a David Bowie-like superstar whose stage alter-ego, Maxwell
Demon, bears striking similarities to Bowie's most notorious
invention, that flame-haired, extraterrestrial androgyne Ziggy
Stardust. The movie also observes Brian's stormy, sexually charged
relationships with two Americans: his flamboyantly theatrical wife
Mandy (Toni Collette), who resembles Bowie's former wife Angela,
and Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), a surly exhibitionistic rocker who
suggests Iggy Pop crossed with Jim Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the characters' resemblances to real people,
``Velvet Goldmine,'' which opened Friday, doesn't pretend to be a
cinematic roman a clef about the glam rock era. What Haynes has
constructed is a surreal pop fantasia that includes 23 songs, some
of them done as lavish production numbers whose opulence rivals the
glitziest fantasies of Busby Berkeley. At these moments, ``Velvet
Goldmine'' looks and feels almost like science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many movies that affected me,'' Haynes says in
an interview, ``but the ones that influenced this film the most
came out of the drug culture _ movies like ``2001,'' ``A Clockwork
Orange'' and ``Performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' also tips its hat to ``Citizen Kane.''
Brian's story is reconstructed through the eyes of Arthur Stuart
(Christian Bale), a reporter who was once one of the star's most
ardent fans. A decade has passed since Brian, at the height of his
stardom, sabotaged his career by faking his own onstage
assassination. Assigned to write a whatever-happened-to story about
Brian (it is now 1984), Arthur embarks on a search that is as much
an investigation into his own troubled youth as it is a ``Citizen
Kane''-like quest for the ``Rosebud'' in Brian's past.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would be easy to assume that the reporter is a
stand-in for Haynes, they share few, if any, similarities. Where
Arthur comes from a brutal English working-class background,
Haynes, 37, grew up in comfortable circumstances in the Los Angeles
suburb of Encino.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes was too young in 1972 (the year Bowie brought his Ziggy
Stardust tour to the United States) to appreciate glam rock at its
height. ``I was only 11,'' the lean, wholesome-looking filmmaker
recalls over a plate of calamari at the Bowery Bar in New York.
``But I remember when suddenly there were these girls wearing
lipstick and bright colored clothes and painting their nails. They
had a tough, cool, blase attitude and talked about Ziggy and Iggy
and bisexual this and bisexual that. It was so antithetical to the
'60s ideology and style that at the time I found it a little
off-putting.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as an undergraduate at Brown University, where he majored
in art and semiotics in the early 1980s, that Haynes became
fascinated with glam rock, the campy, dandified English style
popularized not only by Bowie but by Marc Bolan, Roxy Music and
Gary Glitter and adopted by American rockers like Lou Reed and Iggy
Pop, both of whom were briefly Bowie proteges. Two 1970s pop albums
that were much admired in the artistic circles in which Haynes
traveled while at college were ``Here Come the Warm Jets'' and
``Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy,'' by the rock experimentalist
Brian Eno, who had played synthesizer in Roxy Music. Eno had also
produced three albums for Bowie in the late 1970s. Working his way
back through these albums, Haynes developed a new appreciation for
the glam music culture that had put him off a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I researched, the more I discovered a clear
intellectual lineage that went back to Oscar Wilde,'' he says.
``What glam rock kept demonstrating was the same basic position
against nature, played out in a popular context. I kept seeing
recurrences in the ideas distinguishing the glam artists from the
'60s rock stars who preceded them, and the ideas distinguishing
Wilde from the romantics who had come before him. In both cases
there was a playing with sexual orientation, an emphasis on the
pose, and the notion of self-consciously constructing yourself as a
star.''
</P>
<P>
   Superficially, ``Velvet Goldmine'' could not be more different
in tone from Haynes' last film, ``Safe,'' a cool, visually elegant
portrait of a Southern California woman (played by Julianne Moore)
who develops an environmental disease and flees to a sinister,
pollution-free new-age commune in New Mexico. ``Safe,'' in turn,
seemed a radical departure from ``Poison,'' the notorious 1991 film
that won him the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance and infuriated
right-wing critics of the National Endowment for the Arts, which
had provided $25,000 of the movie's $250,000 budget. ``Poison''
folded together three stories, including a horror film parody and a
prison drama adapted from Jean Genet, into an elliptical parable
about paranoia and social stigmatization in the age of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   That film, an art-house hit that earned $1 million, was a huge
stylistic leap from Haynes' first film, ``Superstar: The Karen
Carpenter Story.'' In that 43-minute bio pic of the singer who died
of anorexia, the characters are played by Barbie dolls. Because of
its unauthorized use of the Carpenters' music, ``Superstar'' has
not been allowed to be shown since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   As different as they are from one another, however, all four of
Haynes' feature films share an attitude that Haynes describes as
``oppositional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a political filmmaker, and the politics of identity is
where I see the core of my focus,'' he explains. ``We live in a
society that insists on prescribing our identities. I think the
glam era posed some of the strongest dangers to that by encouraging
a refusal of any fixed category for sexual orientation or identity
in general. Glam rock was invested in blurring the difference
between masculinity and femininity, heterosexuality and
homosexuality, and that's tough on society. All those lines were
rigorously reinstated in the '80s.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For someone this dedicated to challenging the status quo, Haynes
seems devoid of the hostility often associated with artistic
rebels. The oldest of three children born to parents he describes
as ``doggedly liberal and incredibly loving and supportive,'' he is
mild-mannered and boyishly enthusiastic. His father, a sales
representative for a cosmetics company, recently helped Haynes'
younger brother Shawn set up his own line, ``The Velvet Goldmine
Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I had a wonderful childhood, I still remember being
angst-ridden all my life,'' he says. ``I had friends and was
popular, but I identified with people who were unhappy and often
befriended the person who was the outcast. I felt terrorized by the
notions of what a man is supposed to be in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The realization that he was gay, he says, drove him to explore
sexual politics. His study of feminism provided him with a
theoretical perspective that has exerted a profound influence on
work.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes was only 9 when he made his first film, ``Romeo and
Juliet,'' (inspired by the Franco Zeffirelli film), in which he
played all the parts, using double exposure. During his high school
years, while a student at The Oakwood School, an arts-oriented
private school in North Hollywood, he spent two years producing a
23-minute short called ``The Suicide,'' about a sensitive boy
struggling through high school. His main film project while at
Brown was a 43-minute Godardian study of Rimbaud and Verlaine.
</P>
<P>
   Each of his commercially released films, Haynes says, involved a
different experiment. ``In `Superstar,' I wanted to tell a story
with dolls and in the process make you forget you were watching
dolls,'' he says. `` `Poison' was an experiment in reading, in
asking an audience to actively engage with different ways of
telling almost the same story. `Safe' was an experiment in
restraint and in not giving an audience every answer as to how to
read a character. It follows the exact line that a
disease-of-the-week movie would follow. But when the character
finds a therapeutic or spiritual answer, that answer is wrong.
`Velvet Goldmine's' experiment is in its excess and stylization and
its attempt to keep an emotional engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Haynes' most ardent champions is his producer, Christine
Vachon, whose company, Killer Films, was the co-producer of the
current art-house hit ``Happiness'' by the other hot young
filmmaker named Todd (Solondz).
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd has a special understanding of film language, of how
everything works together from the tiniest prop to the sound
effects,'' Ms. Vachon says of Haynes. ``Each film comes fully
formed in his mind, and then he painstakingly has to fill it out. I
don't know any other director who does that to that degree.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' had a difficult birth. As it was about to go
into production, the French company that had underwritten the
original $8 million budget pulled out of the project. The producers
then had to scramble to get another deal (for only $7 million),
which meant that the shooting schedule had to be cut by several
days. When Bowie refused to let the filmmakers use his songs,
Haynes had to assemble a score that mixed cover versions of
non-Bowie glam rock songs from the 1970s (including several early
Roxy Music numbers) with made-to-order period pastiches. One of his
models was the fictional 1993 movie about the Beatles,
``Backbeat,'' in which young postpunk bands re-recorded and
revitalized the group's early music.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Velvet Goldmine'' at moments resurrects the glamour of
old-time Hollywood musicals, in other ways the movie is pointedly
anti-Hollywood. It isn't a boy meets girl (or boy) and lives
happily-ever-after story. And unlike the typical rock-and-roll
movie, in which the music liberates the characters and makes the
world a groovier place, the glam rock movement is remembered as a
phenomenon that, no matter how liberating it might have seemed at
the time, didn't go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes abhors the way contemporary Hollywood films ``only
confirm social ideas of identity and reward them at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Film is an incredibly powerful medium that both reflects and
instructs,'' he says. ``That's why its job shouldn't be to tell you
the truth or show you the cool way to be. As Fassbinder said, you
can't give people the revolution. All you can do is show them the
problems.''

OUTSIDER ELECTED MAYOR OF WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Mo., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Anthony Williams started life as an abandoned
infant in Los Angeles. On Tuesday, 47 years later, he was elected
mayor of the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he led a peripatetic life that included waiting on
tables at the Park Plaza Hotel in New Haven, Conn., to work his way
through Yale University, four years in the Air Force, and both law
and graduate public-policy degrees from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were bureaucratic and administrative jobs with the
Department of Agriculture, the state of Connecticut, the Community
Development Agency in St. Louis and the Redevelopment Authority in
Boston, and an adjunct professorship at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in short, an outsider, and on Tuesday, Washington, a city
peopled largely by outsiders, elected him to succeed Mayor Marion
Barry, who did not seek re-election. Williams, the Democratic
candidate, defeated the Republican nominee, Carol Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview during the campaign what he knew about his
birth parents, Williams replied that all he knew was that he was
born on July 28, 1951, in Los Angeles. ``That's about it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went from the misfortune of being an abandoned baby to
adoption into a large, warm family, that of Virginia and Louis
Williams, who were both postal clerks. Mrs. Williams gave birth to
six of her own children, and she and her husband adopted Anthony
and also raised a godchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come from a rich family, but from a noble family,''
Williams said. ``We were enriched by our parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis, who died earlier this year, and Virginia Williams
insisted that their children study hard. One result was that all of
them graduated from college.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Ph.D.s, a doctor, a CPA and artists, from Stanford,
MIT, Yale, UC-Santa Clara, Northwestern and UCLA,'' Williams said
of his brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Williams, now retired, worked as a volunteer in her
son's mayoral campaign. She said the other day that she was the
first member of the family to run for public office, seeking a seat
on the City Council in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished 16th in a field of 32,'' she said, smiling broadly
at the inauspiciousness of her political career.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Williams, who improved his family's election record on
Tuesday to two out of three (he was elected to the Board of
Aldermen in New Haven while an undergraduate), has lived in
Washington for less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people haven't lived long in D.C.,'' Williams said the
other day between campaign stops, by way of explaining why his
opponents' charge that he is a carpetbagger had no impact in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Washington is made up people who made their mark
elsewhere before moving here, and in many of the middle class and
more affluent neighborhoods it is an unusual event when two people
meet and find they were both born here.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was able to win the Democratic primary by campaigning
as a cost-cutter in an overspending city when he served as its
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   He won the primary easily, defeating three members of the City
Council who were identified by the voters as part of the government
establishment that brought Washington almost to bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican candidate, Ms. Schwartz, was born in Mississippi,
raised in Texas and has lived in Washington for 33 years. A member
of the City Council, she was the underdog from the start. She is a
Republican in a city where the Democrats hold a 10-to-1 advantage
in party enrollment. She is a white in a city that is about 60
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   She was outspent heavily. Williams said he expected to spend
$1.5 million on the campaign, compared with Ms. Schwartz's
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a black Democrat who ran in a black and Democratic
city. His is not yet a household name.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent staff meeting of the accounting firm Arthur
Andersen, its managing partner for the Washington area, John
Schweiters, tried to build up some enthusiasm for Williams'
appearance by asking the employees: ``How many of you have heard of
Robin Williams?'' Most hands shot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Williams?'' Fewer hands were raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Williams?'' Almost no hands.
</P>
<P>
   That will change, starting Tuesday.

U.S. PLANS FOOD RELIEF FOR RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The United States is planning to provide millions of
tons of food to help Russians stave off hunger and endure a bitter
winter.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Tuesday that at least 3.1 million metric
tons of food would be provided under an accord being negotiated
with Moscow. Much of the food would be provided free. The rest
would be sold with generous long-term financing.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of American aid comes at a time when Russia is
suffering from its worst harvest in 45 years. Grain production is
down because of this summer's drought. Livestock production has
also declined.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a plummeting ruble has led to a devastating
cutback in imports of food. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has
reported that food imports in September were at one-sixth of their
normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts say Russia may have enough food to survive the
winter but that the country's food reserves will be dangerously
depleted by spring.
</P>
<P>
   There are also fears that some of Russia's remote regions will
be cut off from needed supplies and that Russia's poor lack the
money for an adequate diet.
</P>
<P>
   After initially denying that Russia was looking for food aid,
the Kremlin has done exactly that. Primakov asked for assistance
during a recent meeting with the head of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent days, Russian and American officials have been
quietly working out the terms of a food aid package in Moscow.
Clinton Administration officials declined to publicly discuss the
terms of the deal, saying details were being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior American official, who declined to be identified in
print, said that Washington planned to provide at least 3.1 million
metric tons of food.
</P>
<P>
   Under the American plan, 1.5 million metric tons of wheat would
be provided free under a program in which the U.S. government
purchases excess wheat from American farmers for distribution to
needy nations.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1.5 million metric tons of wheat, soy beans and other
commodities would be provided and financed by loans at favorable
terms.
</P>
<P>
   And 100,000 tons of food would be given in the form of direct
aid to charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The sales are expected to benefit to American farmers. Another
American official described the 3.1 million metric ton shipment as
a ``floor'' and not an upper limit. The White House is expected to
issue a statement soon, making clear the American intention to
help.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the negotiations have not been easy. The talks involve
thorny questions of fairness, as well as finance.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by reports of widespread corruption in Russia,
Washington wants to insure that the food reaches those who need it
and that Russian government officials and speculators do not enrich
themselves at the expense of the American taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has insisted that profits the Russian government
receives from the sale of American food be directed to meeting the
nation's pressing social needs.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials have resisted this demand, complaining
that Washington is trying to control both the distribution of the
food and the money that Russia expects to receive from its sale.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of financing social programs, Russian officials have
said they want to use some of the profits to prop up its
agricultural sector. Gennadi Kulik, the Russian deputy prime
minister who is in charge of agriculture, said Tuesday that the
American shipment of food should be used to ``help stabilize the
Russian agrarian sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Russia's latest financial crisis, at least 40 percent of
the food Russians consumed was imported. In Moscow and St.
Petersburg, the percentage was even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Kulik told the Russian news agency Interfax that the two sides
were close to agreement on a scheme that would allow the Kremlin to
use some proceeds from the sale of the food to support Russian
farmers and the nation's agribusiness industry.

 Kertzman Leaves Sybase to Head Oracle Spin-Off  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Sybase Chairman Mitchell Kertzman, once a chief rival to Oracle
chief executive Larry Ellison, is leaving Sybase to take over
Ellison's pet project, Network Computer Inc.
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Kertzman, 49, had relinquished the CEO job at Sybase two
months ago, while company revenues and stock continued to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   He will be president and CEO of NCI, an Oracle spin-off
headquartered near Oracle in Redwood Shores.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle owns a majority stake in privately held NCI, and Ellison
is a director. But Kertzman said he will not work directly for
Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is not involved here. ... I still haven't talked to
Larry,'' Kertzman said. ``It was important to me, coming from
Sybase, that NCI be independent of Oracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Kertzman's role could be to take NCI public, though he
said the company probably won't attempt a stock offering until the
market improves.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle and Sybase both make database software, which keeps track
of vast stores of information like airline reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle established NCI in 1996, with Netscape Communications
Corp. as a major investor. The company originally sought to build
simple, low-priced network computers that would rival the personal
computer _ and therefore pose a threat to Microsoft Corp., the most
dominant maker of software for the PC.
</P>
<P>
   But the network computer never got beyond the drawing board, and
PC prices fell below $1,000, making the NC pointless.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NCI now focuses exclusively on application software for
devices such as interactive television, handheld computers and
slimmed-down computers for specific corporate applications.
</P>
<P>
   At least one area where Kertzman and Ellison always agreed was
their distaste for Microsoft. Microsoft, which also sells database
software, is also a rival in each of NCI's main product areas.
</P>
<P>
   To compete successfully with Microsoft, NCI will have to make
broader applications _ such as word processors and spreadsheets _
for these devices, said analyst Peter Kastner with the Aberdeen
Group.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kastner said, Kertzman will have to survive his new
corporate surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can go to work for Larry. Whether the relationship will
be successful, only time will tell,'' Kastner said. ``It's not just
Larry himself. Oracle the organization is a strange beast that has
eaten up and chewed out some very capable executives who have gone
on to do some very capable things in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Kertzman takes the reins from David Roux, who returns to his
role as NCI's chairman. Roux, an executive vice president at
Oracle, said he helped NCI change its focus, shying away from
pie-in-the-sky press releases and trying instead to build products
and forge partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept forgetting that customers don't ship press releases
and we don't sell press releases,'' Roux said.
</P>
<P>
   Kertzman joined Sybase when it bought his company, Powersoft, in
1995. He became CEO and president the following year and added the
post of chairman in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, Sybase had peaked. Although its stock traded
as high as $54 in 1995, it closed yesterday at $6.75.
</P>
<P>
   The low point came in January, when the company discovered
overly aggressive accounting practices in its Japanese unit and had
to lower its reported 1997 sales by $67 million. The company posted
a $55.4 million loss in 1997, when it had anticipated its first
annual profit since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the company announced an executive shakeup, with
Kertzman to share power as co-CEO with John Chen, who then was the
company's president. In September, Chen became the sole occupant of
the office and Kertzman retained the post of chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sybase announced an improving financial picture,
with a third-quarter profit of $2.2 million on revenues of $233
million, reversing a loss of $6 million on revenues of $210 million
the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Chen said, ``I would like to thank Mitchell
Kertzman for all of his hard work and contributions to Sybase. I
wish him well in his future endeavors.''
</P>
<P>
   NCI employs 200 people. It does not disclose revenues but said
it has doubled its sales during the past year and is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst hailed Kertzman's selection at NCI as the
right person to lead a growth-oriented company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy that likes to build things rather than
run them when they get really big,'' said David Card at Jupiter
Communications in New York.

 Microsoft Suit Puts Spotlight On E-Mail  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft's 27,000 employees exchange more than 3 million e-mail
messages every day. How, in that electronic haystack, did the
government find the needles to use in its landmark antitrust case
against the software giant?
<P>
   And why didn't Microsoft, knowing that its own e-mail could be
used against it as evidence, purge the stuff from its computers
before it could fall into the hands of prosecutors?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions are part of a growing debate over e-mail, the
phenomenon which in the space of just a few years has become the
method of choice for internal communications at companies big and
small.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenally important tool for communicating very
quickly and sharing ideas,'' said Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In the process, it also has become a form of evidence as
acceptable as a written document in legal disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, e-mail is at the heart of the trial in which the U.S.
government and 20 states are trying to prove that Microsoft
illegally tried to crush its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim that internal Microsoft e-mail messages
illustrate how Bill Gates and his gang planned to wipe out Netscape
Communications by bullying computer-makers, including Apple, into
using Microsoft's Web browser instead of Netscape's.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 1997 e-mail disclosed Monday, Ben Waldman, head of
Microsoft's Macintosh division, allegedly told Gates, ``The threat
to cancel Mac Office 97 is certainly the strongest bargaining point
that we have, as doing so will do a greater deal of harm to Apple
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, in turn, has subpoenaed thousands of internal
messages from competitors in an attempt to debunk the charges
against it.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems have used
each other's internal e-mail as ammunition in a showdown over
charges that Microsoft illegally altered &LR;   &LR; Java, Sun's Internet
software.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would seem a herculean task to search through
millions of e-mail messages, experts say it's not all that hard to
track down electronic smoking guns if you know what you're looking
for.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during a deposition, a prosecutor might determine
that an executive had discussed a certain issue with a co-worker
and that e-mail had been exchanged. After using a court order to
obtain all the e-mail between the two people over a certain period
of time, it would be relatively easy to locate a specific message
using standard search techniques on a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty basic stuff,'' said Ira Winkler, an expert on
Internet privacy and author of ``Corporate Espionage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I described the basic concept for you, you could go out and
ask for the same information that prosecutors of Microsoft are
asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Winkler, individuals within and outside
Microsoft probably tipped off prosecutors about some explosive
e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   What has really turned e-mail into a cottage industry for the
legal profession, however, is the fact that many companies save
messages, especially those pertaining to legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At Microsoft, which admits to being fanatical about e-mail,
workers can keep their e-mail on the company's server computer for
up to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also routinely saves messages when backing up its
network. And workers can archive messages on the hard drives of
their desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that its e-mail is now being used as evidence
against it, Sohn said Microsoft believes that keeping e-mail can
help as much as it hurts. ``It tells what really happens,'' he
said, ``and in a lot of cases that's markedly different from what
the Department of Justice is trying to portray.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At Sun, which generates more than 2 million internal messages
a day, officials are a little less zealous about saving e-mail.
Messages in employee in-boxes are generally removed after 30 days,
said spokeswoman Lisa Poulson.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said the company treats e-mail like other documents
for legal purposes, saving anything written by executives that has
to do with contracts and lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to be safe than sorry about executive e-mail, which we
tend to keep longer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For individual workers, the law pertaining to e-mail is gray.
It's unclear, for instance, whether companies own the content of
messages from one worker to another.
</P>
<P>
   Employees generally have the right to delete their messages. On
the other hand, a company can go into employees' computers and look
at their e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency of companies to archive e-mail may change as they
consider the implications of having potentially damaging messages
in their systems. Especially if e-mail becomes primary evidence, as
it appears to be in the Microsoft antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, it works in your favor to purge e-mail,'' said
Winkler. ``It takes up space, and in the long run it can hurt
you.''

 A New Stage for Hazen   By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The three years and 10 months he ran Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. were a rough
ride for Paul Hazen, but now he can relax. With the completion of
Wells Fargo's sale to Minneapolis' Norwest Corp. on Monday, Hazen
stepped down as chief executive in favor of Norwest CEO Richard
Kovacevich.
<P>
   Hazen remains chairman of what's now the nation's
seventh-largest bank, a position that commands the prestige but not
the operating responsibilities of his old job. And he's basking in
the good notices his merger is garnering, a sharp turnaround from
the criticisms leveled at his management of the giant San Francisco
bank.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  When he took the top job at Wells Fargo at the beginning of
1995, he was celebrated as the brains behind the bank's phenomenal
success in the 1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   As No. 2 to legendary CEO Carl Reichardt, Hazen was instrumental
in building Wells Fargo into a lean, mean machine. Aggressive in
the marketplace, its costs cut to the bone, it consistently ranked
as one of the nation's most &LR;   &LR; profitable banks.
</P>
<P>
   But under the aloof, austere-looking Hazen, Wells Fargo lost its
way.
</P>
<P>
   His hostile takeover of Los Angeles' First Interstate Bancorp in
1996 nearly crushed Wells Fargo's _ and by many accounts his own _
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As Hazen pressed ahead with an overly ambitious merger
timetable, computer systems broke down, vaporizing deposits and
bouncing checks. Angry customers fled in droves, especially in
states such Oregon and Arizona where the Wells Fargo brand was new.
</P>
<P>
   Profits failed to match the bank's projections. Longtime
supporters on Wall Street turned into critics.
</P>
<P>
   The First Interstate takeover became a textbook case of how not
to manage a bank merger. Wells Fargo President William Zuendt,
Hazen's chief deputy, ultimately took the fall, resigning in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Hazen was in the eye of the storm, lashed by
investors, business writers and even some members of his own board
as the architect of a failed strategy. Among other things, he was
slammed for pocketing $3 million in pay in 1997 as shareholders,
employees and customers suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a fun time,'' recalled the 56-year-old Hazen in an
interview. ``A lot of criticism became extreme. It was very
difficult _ you do have pride.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hazen stabilized Wells Fargo and the bank returned to
respectable profitability, the reviews became less harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at his whole career, he's one of a handful of
executives who have the best performance records around,'' said
Thomas Brown, an analyst with the New York investment firm Tiger
Management. ``Still, he'll be remembered for the failures of First
Interstate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, it wasn't running Wells Fargo that most
restored Hazen's reputation _ it was selling it.
</P>
<P>
   His $32 billion deal with Norwest became something the First
Interstate takeover never was _ a mutually respectful transaction
that energized staff from both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Norwest's Kovacevich to base the bank in San
Francisco, use the Wells Fargo name and pick managers even-handedly
from both institutions set a positive tone.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest's reputation as a benevolent employer was welcomed by
Wells Fargo people who were used to their own bank's crack-the-whip
management style.
</P>
<P>
   And the Minneapolis bank's stress on personal service may
provide the antidote Wells Fargo needs to soften its image as a
institution that wants its customers to do business with machines
not people.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen won plaudits for picking Wells Fargo's partner wisely even
though at least two other suitors were waiting in the wings,
possibly prepared to pay a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision will turn out to be one of the best we ever
made,'' Hazen declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're solidifying ourselves as the major remaining bank
headquartered out here. We're going to own the West.''
</P>
<P>
   The institution Kovacevich and Hazen created is indeed a
consumer and small-business banking powerhouse, with $196 billion
in assets, 15 million customers, more than 100,000 employees and
bank branches in 21 Midwestern and Western states.
</P>
<P>
   When Norwest's consumer finance and mortgage operations are
included, the new Wells Fargo boasts more than 5,800 offices in all
50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hazen will play a big part in the institution is far
from certain, though.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen said he will use his chairman position to watch over Wells
Fargo's alternative banking techniques, including supermarket
branches and Internet banking, as they are extended to Norwest's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bankers who are kicked upstairs after mergers rarely
stick around. ``It's very seldom that this arrangement is
satisfactory to the person in Paul Hazen's position,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's chairman virtually admitted as much.
</P>

   ``One day you're the CEO, and the next you aren't,'' he
explained.``I don't want to walk away from what's been built here,
but if it turns out that I'm not contributing, I should leave.''

<P>
   Hazen's professional transformation has been paralleled in his
personal life. He recently went through a painful divorce and now
appears publicly with a new female friend.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, the once steely Hazen has turned reflective.
</P>
<P>
   The First Interstate strategy was flawed from the beginning, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with the judgment to do a hostile takeover,'' he
noted. ``We had to make bold claims in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That created circumstances in which we couldn't do what was
always in the Wells Fargo tradition to do: That's to deliver (the
financial results) we had promised.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  One apparent casualty of the merger is Hazen's relationship
with his former mentor Carl Reichardt.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, Hazen and Reichardt got together early every
morning to shoot the breeze, cementing one of banking's most
effective friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's troubles with First Interstate mortified
Reichardt, prompting him to give up his board seat and sell his
stock, according to friends. The two former colleagues stopped
communicating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk, but that's because he's living his own life,
totally independent of Wells Fargo,'' Hazen said. &LR;

2,000 WORKERS WHO STRUCK ARE LOCKED OUT FROM ABC  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MONTE WILLIAMS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two thousand ABC employees who went on a 24-hour
strike on Monday were not allowed to return to work Tuesday
morning. Signs were posted on doors of ABC's offices and studios in
five cities _ New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and
Washington _ announcing a lockout of workers.
</P>
<P>
   After the union went on strike Monday at 5 a.m., affecting both
the network and WABC-TV, its New York affiliate, the network's
management responded by locking the employees out.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers, including camera operators, videotape editors,
couriers, technicians, engineers and some writers, will be locked
out until their union, the National Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians, promises to give ABC warning of future
strikes, said Julie Hoover, a company spokeswoman. Tom Donahue, a
spokesman for the union, which is known as Nabet, said there was
little chance of that happening. ``That would require us to waive
our rights as a labor union,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The union got some moral support Tuesday, Election Day, one of
the busiest news days of the year. Vice President Al Gore canceled
an interview with the network and the Senate candidate Charles
Schumer vowed not to give interviews to ABC reporters. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson joined the picket line in Chicago, and Michael Moore,
the film producer, picketed with workers on Manhattan's Upper West
Side.
</P>
<P>
   According to union officials, workers walked off their jobs over
a dispute about a health care plan that the Walt Disney Co., ABC's
parent, would like the workers to accept. ``The conflict is about
the company's failure to provide information on the proposed
medical plan,'' Donahue said, adding that the network would not
provide details about the costs of out-of-network care under its
proposed health plan. Ms. Hoover said the medical issue was bogus.
``Nabet is trying to put pressure on us at the bargaining table,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the strike, Nabet has made two offers, both of which were
rejected by ABC. It offered not to strike on the health care issue
again and not to strike for 30 days. ``That provides us with
security for 30 days and nothing on Day 31,'' Ms. Hoover said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hoover said the workers would be replaced with ABC employees
trained to do the behind-the-camera jobs and with temporary
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday about 250 ABC workers wearing placards bearing the words
``Locked Out'' picketed outside ABC's studios and offices on
Manhattan's Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, there have been fights,'' said one of the
locked-out workers, Douglas Godly, 39, a maintenance technician who
has worked for ABC for eight years. ``It was like a family
squabble. We've had labor differences before. But this is the worst
I've seen and it's Disney's doing. They have made themselves very
unpopular at ABC.''

 Investment Expert Says Let the Good Times Roll  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Conditions for buying U.S. stocks are ``still perfect.''
<P>
   There, I said it.
</P>
<P>
   With a straight face, no less.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm not sure I buy it, those were the precise words of one
of the nation's top investment pundits: PaineWebber's Edward
Kerschner.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Paine's chief investment strategist made such
feel-good remarks in San Francisco yesterday before a ballroom of
battle-weary money managers and fat-cat clients. And he wasn't
kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Asia, schmasia. Monica, schmonica. Forget about looming
recessions, Russia, Brazil or the cracking of our collective
consumer confidence, Kerschner says. He maintains that everything
is copacetic in the land of milk and honey as long as investors
focus on some fundamental economic truisms.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, our federal government is reporting a budget
surplus for the first time in decades. The U.S. economy continues
to grow, albeit more slowly, but without any threat of inflation.
And the U.S. stock market has been expanding for the past seven
years in a row. Long live the raging bull, Kerschner cries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dictionary definition of a perfect economic
environment,'' says Kerschner, who is second only to Goldman Sachs'
Abby Cohen in Smart Money magazine's ranking of national investment
pundits.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the market-moving Cohen and the effusive Kerschner
weren't looking too smart in early October, when their bullish
outlooks were running counter to the then-bearish market. But
thanks to a second interest rate cut by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, the stock market has rebounded and the two
investment strategists are calling for a robust 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Kerschner is nothing but a long-term bull, then how
does he account for the weeks of turmoil that whacked Wall Street
like Hurricane Mitch?
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a market that was fixated on the short term.
Was it a bear market? Who cares what you call it,'' Kerschner said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the (Dow Jones industrial average) was at 7,400, the
market was probably at its cheapest in decades,'' Kerschner says.
</P>
<P>
   And if you listened to the PaineWebber prognosticator, you were
a big buyer during that trough. And if you didn't, it's not too
late, Kerschner says. He predicts that profits for the companies in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 will post earnings increases of 6.5
percent to 7 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's his logic: The fact that the dollar is no longer rising
will boost cyclical stocks and exporters to Europe. The oil patch
will be ``less weak'' next year than it was this year.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sector, especially computer-makers who have
worked out of their inventory glut, will continue to rebound. And
the absence of a strike at General Motors next year will make the
year-over-year comparison of S&AMP;P profits even more favorable, says
Kerschner, who also sits on his company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to say what is going to happen, but he uses a
lot of common sense,'' says Lisa Costa a portfolio manager for
Franklin Advisers in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the Brooklyn-bred Kerschner has been pointing to the
explosion of consumer-driven stocks, and he has been looking pretty
omniscient ever since. Refreshingly enough, Kerschner uses a lot of
behavioral trends and demographics in his economic models. And he
favors breezy, thematic explanations for why markets do what they
do, such as ``changing attitudes are changing consumer behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he says that  &LR; investors should focus on such trends
for the long term and tune out all of the short-term ``noise''
(such as might be found in this column from time to time).
</P>
<P>
   As for his bearish counterparts who are forecasting economic
recession, Kerschner points to their misguided reliance on the
government's gross domestic product figures. Too often, the early
estimates of GDP are way off the actual, revised figures, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, economists and strategists who identify slipping
GDP figures as evidence of imminent recession are being thrown off
course. Nearly 61 percent of all initial estimates of GDP are too
low, Kerschner says.
</P>
<P>
   That little morsel wasn't lost on the strategist's audience.
``The GDP (information) was a real eye opener,'' says money manager
Frank Roddy of San Francisco's West Coast Investments.
</P>
<P>
   And because much of his bullish outlook is based on certain
demographic assumptions, such as continued retirement investing by
aging Boomers, Kerschner says ``you've got at least another 15
years before you can argue that a demographic exodus'' of
retirement money will weaken the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to hear someone say that it's not the end of the
world,'' Roddy says.
</P>
<P>
   As we know it.

SHIFT SEEN IN LONDON TOWARD USE OF EURO 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also EURO-MARKETPLACE)  
(js) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With subtle shifts of tone and emphasis, the British
government is signaling new warmth toward the soon-to-be introduced
European single currency, promising to divulge a ``national
change-over plan'' for the euro earlier than many people had
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   British pundits detected the shift from ministerial statements
on Monday, replacing the word ``if'' with a more decisive ``when''
in references to the conditions for euro membership by Britain _ by
far the biggest economic and political heavyweight of the four
European Union nations outside the current euro club of 11 nations
that will participate in using the new currency on Jan 1.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and political analysts said the shift could mark the
beginnings of a campaign to prepare Britain's deeply divided public
for a less contentious approach to the new currency. In recent
years, the British economy has outpaced those of Continental
Europe, provoking the argument among critics of monetary union that
Britain has more to lose than gain from joining in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   But ``with the economic outlook worsening for cyclical reasons,
this splendid isolation is no longer looking so splendid,'' said
Holger Schmieding, senior economist with Merrill Lynch, and adding,
``That should mean that British public opinion should become a bit
more euro-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, reduced
the government's forecast Tuesday for 1999 growth to a range of 1
percent to 1.5 percent from about 2.5 percent. At issue is what
Brown on Monday called a ``national change-over plan'' to be
published in January setting out the practical steps for Britain to
join the euro at a later date. Previously, the government had
insisted that no decision be made before a referendum after the
next national election, which will most likely be in mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   While Brown did not modify that timetable, he said the
government of Prime Minister Tony Blair wanted to prepare for
joining in euro participation before the proposed referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government has decisively and unambiguously put this
country on a new road of constructive engagement with Europe,'' he
told British business leaders at a meeting in Birmingham. ``We will
set out the stage-by-stage procedures that will need to be
followed. We will spell out the practical implications of changing
to the euro, and we will give new advice to companies on the way to
take forward their preparations.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, the trade and industry secretary, said: ``It
would be economic lunacy for the sake of Euro-skeptic ideology to
marginalize Britain on the sidelines of what should be its own
market. We have made clear that we will join the single currency
when it is in Britain's economic interests to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks had little effect on the market, with the pound
already well down from highs earlier this year against the German
mark, the key European currency. The pound was quoted Tuesday at
2.75 marks, compared with 3.10 marks at its strongest level several
months ago. Part of the pound's strength was ascribed by dealers to
its role as a potential hedge against the euro.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue remains deeply divisive, with the opposition
Conservatives demanding a much longer delay before a referendum,
while the bulk of British business is in favor of joining in the
new currency. Even on the current schedule, Britain will be outside
the euro zone not only in January, when it goes into use in
electronic business _ including huge euro-denominated stock, bond
and derivatives markets _ but also when euro notes and coins enter
circulation in January 2002.
</P>
<P>
   And some economists expressed puzzlement on Tuesday at reports
that Brown was considering a 40-month gap between announcing a
referendum and introducing euro notes and coins _ a schedule that
could delay full British membership until 2005, later than many
financial institutions here had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way we look at it is that the government has
decided that it's the right thing to do and it's just a question of
time after a referendum,'' said David Mackie, an economist at J.P.
Morgan &AMP; Co. ``But I'm a bit puzzled. The government gives the
impression that it's a done deal, but they also give the impression
that a pretty long timetable is needed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue has touched off heated debate. For instance, The Sun
tabloid _ a staunch and powerful opponent of the euro _
characterized Brown and Mandelson as ``euro fanatics'' in an
article Tuesday _ echoing assertions by Tories that the Labor
government was seeking to stampede Britons into supporting the
single currency without proper debate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, many business leaders at the Birmingham meeting
urged the government to go further and set a date for joining,
complaining that official vagueness made it hard to plan for the
euro's introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our members very much support joining the single
currency, but we are concerned that there is not enough leadership
given by the government in terms of preparation by business for the
euro,'' said Sir Clive Thompson, president of the Confederation of
British Industry, the influential employers' group. &QL;

DEMOCRATIC GAINS APPEAR TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the White House played down expectations Tuesday night,
the Democrats were well on their way to racking up enough victories
to give President Clinton the mandate he wanted to finish his last
two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute push by the party to boost black voter turnout,
including efforts by Clinton, seemed to have paid off as Democrats
were locked in competitive races in such states as Illinois and
South Carolina where they were not expected to do as well.
</P>
<P>
   With the outcome likely to determine whether Republicans in
Congress have the momentum to impeach Clinton, White House
officials said they were counting a good night as victories in the
California governor's race, the New York Senate race and a few
others, and holding down Republican gains in the House. But early
returns showed them on the path to exceeding those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from the election was that people in this country
want to know what you are for,'' said White House senior aide
Douglas Sosnik. ``If you are an elected official, they want to know
where you are going to lead the country,'' he said.``People are
sick of all the negative partisan attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton watched the returns come in from the office of his new
chief-of-staff, John Podesta, along with political director Craig
T. Smith. Clinton also made the first of several victory calls to
Democratic candidates _ Evan Bayh, who won the Senate race in
Indiana, Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and
Senator Charles Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been a tireless campaigner on
behalf of Democratic candidates, partly because of the impeachment
distraction for the president, holed up in the White House theater
watching the new movie, ``Beloved,'' starring Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were later expected to gather in theater with
friends, staff and members of the Cabinet to watch the returns,
said White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss Toby.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton told reporters before meeting with his economic
advisers that results of the election would ``depend upon who makes
the effort to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is a referendum on all the hopes of the
American people for the future, and their assessment of the present
condition, and how we get from here to a better tomorrow. I think
that's what it will be. That's what all elections are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart knocked down
suggestions that the president was responsible for any damage his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky may have caused Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is the leader of the Democratic Party. I think
he's done a fine job of articulating the agenda and the issues,
especially where we differ from the Republican Party,'' Lockhart
said. He and other aides noted that the president worked feverishly
to raise money for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But, because of the impeachment shadow, Clinton's help was
limited to fundraising at private functions. He did not stump for
candidates at massive rallies and was mere background noise in most
Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   White House strategists say they have come to learn that
presidential appearances do not translate into votes for candidates
and that they also are too costly for the candidate. Instead, they
had Clinton adopt a Rose Garden strategy of using the White House
as a perch for policy announcements that would highlight
differences between Republicans and Democrats on issues such as
Social Security, education, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most frequent efforts were made on behalf of two
big-state Senate Democratic candidates. He aggressively raised
money for New York Representative Charles Schumer, who faced
Republican incumbent Alfonse M. D'Amato, and California incumbent
Senator Barbara Boxer, running against Republican Matt Fong.

DEMOCRATS TAKE GOVERNORSHIPS IN ALABAMA, SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Democrats defeated Republican incumbents to capture the
governorships of South Carolina and Alabama Tuesday, in a pair of
upset victories that signaled a partial Democratic reemergence in
state capitals after years of overwhelming Republican rule.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 governorships on the line, Democrats were poised Tuesday
night to make a gain of several seats, including, most importantly,
the California state house, which had been held by Republicans for
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Democratic state Representative Jim Hodges
defeated Republican Governor David M. Beasley, partially on the
strength of Hodges' proposal to launch a state lottery to fund a
widespread education reform program.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley, a telegenic governor presiding over a growing economy,
was also haunted by video poker. In 1994, he accepted money from
the video poker industry, only to vocally oppose the game years
later, prompting the industry to contribute heavily to Hodges.
Beasley was also hurt by accusations that he carried on an
extramarital affair with his former press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman also
pushed a statewide lottery to fund education reforms in his
victorious campaign against Republican incumbent Governor Fob James
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In initial network projections, Republican incumbents won with
relative ease in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arkansas
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush, son of the former president, coasted to
easy victory in Texas in a campaign that could launch him toward a
race for the White House. In Florida, Jeb Bush, George W. Bush's
brother, was the projected winner against Democratic Lieutenant
Governor Buddy MacKay. Not since 1971, when members of the
Rockefeller dynasty held the governorships of New York and
Arkansas, have two brothers served as governor at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, incumbent Republican governors had displayed
an activist flair on such issues as education reform and health
care, in contrast to their congressional counterparts, who had done
battle with Democratic reform proposals. With this activism, the
GOP was looking to keep a lock on most of the 10 largest states,
the notable exception being California, where they appeared
destined for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 36 governorships were decided Tuesday night, with
Democratic and Republican leaders each predicting they would gain
two or three seats. In state after state, especially Ohio, many of
the television advertisements were negative to the point of being
brutal. But President Clinton's political and legal troubles over
his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky barely surfaced as an issue in
any of the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Bushes, other luminaries were seeking
governorships. In Minnesota, Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III, son
of the former Democratic vice president, was locked in a difficult
race in which a former professional wrestler nicknamed ``The Body''
was siphoning crucial votes away from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And in Ohio, Republican Robert Taft, great grandson of President
William Howard Taft, was widely believed to hold an advantage
against Lee Fisher, the former Democratic attorney general. That
campaign had evolved into a particularly spiteful battle,
characterized by dueling advertising campaigns about each other's
ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   California remained the biggest prize, with Lieutenant Governor
Gray Davis in a strong position to bring the governorship into
Democratic hands. His opponent, state Attorney General Dan Lungren,
was criticized by fellow Republicans for his decision to wrap
himself in the Reagan legacy.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast, many of the gubernatorial candidates raised
record amounts of cash, often pouring their funds into hard-edged
advertising campaigns.

   What is it about music? If Milton Babbitt were a painter, and
not a composer, his work would be a familiar part of the mental
landscape. By now, at 82, he would have had a major retrospective
at the Guggenheim Museum. Tableware decorated with his imagery
would be available at the Museum of Modern Art gift shop. No museum
would be able to consider its collection of contemporary American
art adequate if it did not own an earlyish example of his work.
</P>
<P>
   He would be widely admired for his continuing pursuit of a high
abstract style, and widely loved for his charm and comedy. What he
drew from Mondrian and late Kandinsky would be generally
understood: the derivation would be obvious in his fantastically
patterned canvases, some dense and gray, others brilliantly
colored, most small.
</P>
<P>
   But he would be valued above all for his independent qualities:
the optical sleight of hand through which ascertainable shapes
might seem to be hovering just behind the intricate networks of
dots and lines, the exhilarating sense of an instability that is
for one precarious moment stabilized by creative logic, the sheer
fun of improbable ideas' being taken utterly seriously and played
for all they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that his pictures did not look much like Rembrandt's or
Picasso's would hardly be thought worthy of comment. The important
criterion would be to have done what those predecessors did: fill
the frame with meaning.
</P>
<P>
   If, as a composer, Babbitt has so far failed to make it with the
large public, the first performance of his Piano Concerto No. 2,
next Sunday at Carnegie Hall, may start a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   The concerto is a big piece, running about 25 minutes without a
break, though that is just about the only quality it shares with
similarly titled works by composers like Bartok, Beethoven and
Rachmaninoff. Indeed, the absence of common reference marks is part
of the point: part of Babbitt's essentially American sense of
himself as an artist who must find a new alternative to the
techniques of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, it may helpful to compare him with Americans of
his own generation rather than the great European composers, whose
music his evokes only in its mastery. Like Conlon Nancarrow, who
devoted himself to complex rhythmic-canonic studies for player
piano, Babbitt has invented and explored a musical world that is
entirely his own, constructed afresh.
</P>
<P>
   Like John Cage, he stimulated many younger composers by his
example while remaining without peer. Like Cage's, too, his music
poses a challenge to the cultural world it has to inhabit. It
withholds many of the common satisfactions. It refuses all the
usual routines of performance and presentation.
</P>
<P>
   As he has always done in the past, Babbitt creates music in his
inimitable fashion and asks of his audience only an open mind and
attentive ears. In this case, though, the plot is unusually clear,
thanks to the tensions and harmonies throughout between the piano
and the orchestra, and the work has an engaging lightness that has
been intensifying in Babbitt's music during the last decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   The opening is a particularly teasing invitation. Here the
orchestra fills in the gaps between the piano's bunches of notes,
and does so entirely with octaves and multiple octaves: bright,
simple sounds that fit oddly into the complexity and quickly
encourage one to trust the composer's sense of humor and sense of
purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Trust is the key issue. Few people could expect to follow a
Babbitt score at first hearing _ or indeed, at 21st, if by
``follow'' one means to form in real time some coherent explanation
for what is going on. The music does not require that. Such
understanding may come. Meanwhile, one can enjoy the momentary
pleasures and oddities.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, speaking recently at an event in the excellent Works
and Process series at the Guggenheim, remarked that concertos are
all either duets or duels, and left his audience to understand that
his concerto is of the duet kind. The orchestra is relatively
small: a Mozart orchestra but with trombones and tuba, a tuned
percussion group consisting of vibraphone, marimba and harp, and no
timpani.
</P>
<P>
   It is an orchestra made to equal the piano, not overwhelm it,
and the soloist often plays with a modest ensemble, as if the score
were a quick-flickering succession of chamber pieces. Horns, tuba
and first violins might play with the soloist at one moment,
bassoons and bass clarinets at another.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing happens in the orchestra, Babbitt said on the same
occasion, that has not already happened in the piano, is not now
happening or will not happen soon. Both partners are virtuosos. The
pianist must be at once agile and strong, rhythmically alert, and
able to make the instrument sound well at the extremes of register
Babbitt likes to use.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra, too, needs a steady, lively mind in control, and
some exceptional players among its ranks, since the score has
hair-raising passages for soloists and small teams.
</P>
<P>
   These two brilliant partners, piano and orchestra, move together
like neighboring currents, and there are few places where either is
silent. The piano plays for about 95 percent of the time; the
entire work is, as Babbitt put it, one long accompanied cadenza.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondingly, the piano is rarely left alone, and the
passages where it is left alone are especially charged. One of
them, about halfway through, propels the music toward one of its
occasional brief slower sections.
</P>
<P>
   Later, there is what sounds like a cadenza within the cadenza,
with the marking ``rubato,'' unusual in the work of a composer
whose characteristic note repetitions depend on a precise pulse for
their wit and bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the composer, two people were essential to the
genesis of the work, and both will of necessity be there when it is
performed. One is James Levine, who recorded an earlier piece by
Babbitt (``Correspondences'' for strings and electronic sounds) and
made possible the commissioning of this concerto for the Met
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Robert Taub, who has played Babbitt's piano music
regularly for 20 years and insisted in his programming, as in his
performances, that this music is equal to that of the grander Bs of
music history: Bach, Beethoven and Brahms.
</P>
<P>
   Taub will pair Babbitt with Brahms on Monday evening in a
concert that Carnegie Hall has intelligently planned in its Making
Music series to provide an upbeat to the premiere of the concerto.
</P>
<P>
   From Babbitt's large output for piano, Taub will play
``Reflections,'' with a tape part that sounds as if it were being
played by a six-armed god on a three-dimensional keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Other musicians closely associated with Babbitt will also
perform, and the composer himself will be there, talking to his
colleague Ellen Taaffe Zwilich. Their conversation alone should be
worth the price of admission. Babbitt seems only to get faster and
funnier with the years. His music likewise.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC DISCLOSES $45M IN QUESTIONABLE SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston Scientific Corp., stumbling for the second time
in recent weeks, disclosed Tuesday that it found about $45 million
worth of questionable sales this year at its Japanese subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The Natick-based maker of medical devices also said it found
about $40 million of what it called ``improper sales'' in previous
years in Japan, and announced a management shake-up in its
international division.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the company fell 5 7/8, or 11 percent, on the New York
Stock Exchange Tuesday morning on rumors of the problems, before
trading was halted for the day at 10:28 a.m. They last traded at 46
3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific shares were already down from a high of
81 &UR;  &LR; 11/16 in August, following a recall of a new coronary stent
device on safety concerns and because of uncertainties about the
pending financial impact of an acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they weren't concerned about the immediate impact
on earnings from the problems in Japan, but &UR;  &LR; the company still
faced tough questions on a conference call about how they relate to
the company's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really haven't said what's happened,'' said BancBoston
Robertson Stephens analyst Jeffrey T. Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The company offered few details of what it called accounting
``irregularities'' in Japan, except to say its own auditors found
them with the aid of a new software system that went into operation
at its Tokyo subsidiary last April.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese rules and practices prevent Boston Scientific, like
other large US corporations, from selling its wares directly to the
country's consumers _ in this case hospitals. Rather, it is
required to maintain close ties to domestic distributors there.
</P>
<P>
   In question are some of these shipments to distributors, said
the company's chief financial officer, Larry Best.
</P>
<P>
   What the company calls irregularities total $40 million to $50
million during the first nine months of the year, plus about $40
million previously. The figure seems to refer to lost inventory,
analysts said, but it is unclear whether the company is seeking to
recover the goods.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific is still trying to determine whether there was
intentional wrongdoing among its employees, Best said. ``As you can
imagine, Boston Scientific is embarrassed and disappointed'' by the
disclosure, he said. The company hasn't yet involved authorities in
its investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overall financial impact won't be severe. In 1998,
Boston Scientific expects to sell roughly $400 million worth of
goods in Japan, out of total sales expected to be around $2.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   That estimate is still valid, Best said, though he added the
company hasn't decided whether it will take charges against
third-quarter earnings to account for the problems, or whether it
will restate results for the first three quarters of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, several executives have been replaced as a result of the
irregularities. Best said the head of the company's international
division, James Corbett, has stepped down, though he remains an
employee. &UR;  &LR; Corbett has been replaced by Paul LaViolette, who had
been in charge of the company's nonvascular products division for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Japanese subsidiary will also retire, Best
said, after a replacement is named.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in Japan come at a difficult time for Boston
Scientific, which was riding high this summer on forecasts of
robust growth and lucrative new products.
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasm for the stock dropped off this fall as the
company sparred with the US Food and Drug Administration over
whether it followed proper steps in making manufacturing changes to
a new coronary stent product meant to clear clogged heart arteries.
At issue is whether FDA officials were properly made aware of
manufacturing modifications, and whether the stents are safe for
medical use. Best said the company expects to resolve the
regulatory concerns sometime next year, though he declined to be
more specific.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, analysts have pressed the firm to reveal just what
will be the impact of its $2.1 billion purchase of the Schneider
Worldwide unit of Pfizer Inc. Best said Tuesday the company would
disclose that figure along with its third-quarter results in coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Best said he expected trading would be allowed to resume
Wednesday.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a dogged professional
politician once dismissed as an uncharismatic underdog, became the
fourth Democrat this century to win the governorship of California,
defeating state Attorney General Dan Lungren on Tuesday, according
to surveys of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' victory over Lungren, a 52-year-old Republican former
congressman from Long Beach, put the Democrats in control of all
three branches of government in Sacramento _ and thus control of
legislative and Congressional redistricting _ for the first time
since Jerry Brown left office 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was as Brown's chief of staff that Davis began his public
career in 1975. He has, by his own account, spent the last two
decades in a single-minded struggle to move a few feet down the
hall of the state Capitol to the governor's chair, first serving
four years in the Assembly from a district that included part of
Beverly Hills, then four years as controller before winning the
lieutenant governor's seat four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, the prevailing rap on Davis was that his first
name summed up his personality. Despite years of tireless fund
raising and base-building, this election year began with most
political professionals deeply doubting his chances of succeeding
Gov. Pete Wilson, the two-term Republican incumbent who was barred
by law from seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Davis made his final campaign swing around the
state, with polls showing him with a double-digit lead over
Lungren, he took gleeful note of the doubters by dubbing the trip
his ``road-kill comeback tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a 55-year-old Vietnam veteran who won a Bronze Star for
service, pieced together a broad coalition of voters by
methodically portraying Lungren _ who tried to run as a Reaganesque
conservative _ as an extremist outside the mainstream of a
fundamentally moderate and increasingly Hispanic electorate on
issues from abortion to the environment. Davis neutralized
Lungren's crime-fighting credentials with his own longtime support
of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of voters leaving the polls found Davis, the first white
male to win his party's nomination since Brown, racking up
majorities among almost all voter groups, except white men,
Republicans and Protestants, and taking about six in 10 votes from
those who described themselves as moderates. Lungren won only about
20 percent of Hispanic voters, about half of what Wilson won in his
first election in 1990, before his stands against affirmative
action and illegal immigration alienated many minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   Mervin Field, the dean of California poll-takers, said of Davis,
``He's riding the tide of what I'd call contented apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to turn back welfare reform,'' Field said.
``He's not going to try to do anything about overturning capital
punishment. He's not going to do anything real about re-instating
affirmative action. He's going with the tide.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly eight in 10 voters said the state's economic
condition was good or excellent, and nearly half said it would stay
about the same in the coming year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last winter, Davis was all but written off by much of the
state's Democratic establishment, which considered him too
phlegmatic to take on Lungren, the two-term attorney general. In
fact, Davis' very blandness seemed to work in his favor, as he
slipped past two self-financed millionaire rivals, Al Checchi and
Rep. Jane Harman, to decisively win the Democratic nomination in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Checchi, former co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, and Ms.
Harman together spent more than $55 million, most of it on dueling
television advertisements. Davis, who still managed to tie the old
spending record of $9 million for a primary, lacked enough money to
go on the air early and emerged unscathed at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Lungren, a vocal Catholic and staunch
opponent of abortion, was whether he would be seen as too
conservative for swing voters in a state that is among the most
supportive in the nation of abortion rights. In his first
one-on-one debate with Davis this summer, Lungren emphasized how
little say a governor has over the matter, and managed to rattle
Davis by questioning the Democrat's past support for the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign advisers later said that Davis had not prepared
diligently enough for that first encounter, but he consistently
dominated the campaign dialogue from then on. Public opinion polls
showed that he was regarded as better than Lungren on the No. 1
issue of education, along with health care, environmental
protection and abortion and Lungren holding a significant advantage
only on the issues of crime and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lungren never seemed able to move much beyond his
law-and-order background. Wary of opposition to his main
educational proposals _ vouchers that would let parents of public
school children send them to private and parochial schools instead
_ he seldom mentioned them on the stump. That disappointed some
campaign advisers, who believed the issue offered him a chance to
contrast his own ideas with Davis' reluctance to take on the
powerful teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the campaign, according to the polls, Davis was
drawing the support of fully half of voters who identified
themselves as moderate Republicans, a vital part of Wilson's
winning coalitions and the key to any victory in a state where
partly loyalty is fairly evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gray has always been underestimated, because he was in
Jerry's shadow for so many years, and because they thought of the
stereotype and didn't go much deeper than that,'' said Stephen
Rivers, who managed Davis' first campaign for state Assembly in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always, `Oh, he's gray, and not very exciting.' All
that superficial stuff missed how tenacious he is. He's an
incredibly focused person. He takes his job both as an elected
official and a politician very seriously. He's methodical and he's
unrelenting.''

 PATAKI SWEEPS TO VICTORY; VACCO AND McCALL ALSO WIN RE-ELECTION  
(sw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Pataki swept to a second term as governor of
New York on Tuesday, defeating his weak and splintered opposition
by one of the largest margins in history, a victory so resounding
that it is certain to raise his national profile.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, seeking a fourth term, was locked in the
toughest contest of his long career, against Rep. Charles Schumer
of Brooklyn. Schumer appeared to lead the contest as balloting
concluded on Tuesday night, according to interviews with voters
leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's triumph capped a remarkable transformation from a
little-known state senator waging an uphill fight for governor in
1994, to a governor who has shifted the state markedly rightward on
crime, welfare and taxes, and has made himself its most popular
political figure.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he narrowly defeated a liberal icon, Gov. Mario
Cuomo, with considerable help from D'Amato. This year, it was the
senator who turned to Pataki for help, and the governor spent more
energy in the final weeks stumping for his one-time patron than for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Pataki, a Republican who was also the
candidate of the Conservative Party, with more than half the vote,
and a lead of about 20 percent over his Democratic challenger,
Peter Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, who was also
nominated by the newly founded Working Families Party. B. Thomas
Golisano, the Independence Party candidate making his second run
for the office, was a distant third, and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey
Ross, the Liberal Party nominee, trailed in fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat who also ran on the Liberal and Independence
lines, had a modest lead over D'Amato, a Republican who was also
nominated by the Conservative and Right to Life Parties, according
to the exit polls. Those surveys showed D'Amato doing much worse
among New York City voters and among Jewish voters throughout the
state than he did in 1992, when he narrowly won a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old split in New York's legislature appeared to hold
fast, with Republicans easily retaining control of the State
Senate, and Democrats keeping a strong hold on the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls indicated that the Liberal Party had survived the
near-death experience of nominating Ms. McCaughey Ross, then
watching her husband, the financier Wilbur Ross, withdraw much of
her financial backing. She appeared to have topped the 50,000 votes
a party needs in a gubernatorial election to maintain an automatic
place on New York ballots for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign did not present much of a test for Pataki, who
campaigned sparingly, ignored his opponents and refused to debate
them.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate contest made up for what the race for governor
lacked in drama and vitriol. Despite the best efforts of both sides
to get their supporters to the polls, turnout statewide was low,
with elections officials projecting that it would fall well below
40 percent, signaling that voters lacked interest in the contests
and were disturbed by the tone of the state's most closely watched
race.
</P>
<P>
   A loss by D'Amato would end one of the more remarkable political
careers the state has seen, one that often seemed to have at least
nine lives. It would also leave his former protege, Pataki, as the
undisputed leader of the state Republican Party and clearly the
most powerful figure in state politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, in fact, as polls showed the governor running
away with this race, Pataki and his aides grew so elated that they
began to talk openly about that prospect. Like the last Republican
elected New York's governor, Nelson Rockefeller, Pataki might be
favored by moderate Republicans for the presidency, but is widely
considered a dark horse, especially with the larger body of
conservative GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this year, as in much of the country, the election
season lacked defining issues or ideological chasms. There was none
of the economic unrest that animates some contests, and local
fights were overshadowed by President Clinton's troubles, though
they did not cut clearly one way or another with voters. In such an
atmosphere, voters were content mostly to return incumbents to
office, even if it meant ignoring party lines and splitting their
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was headed for the third-largest winning margin in
a gubernatorial race in state history, in both percentage terms and
in raw votes, and the largest ever by a Republican. The biggest
margins were set by Cuomo, a Democrat, in 1986 and 1990; he won
each time by 32 percent, and 1.4 million and 1.3 million votes,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls and early returns indicate that Pataki won a higher
percentage of the vote than any Republican candidate for Governor
since Thomas Dewey was elected to a second term with 57 percent in
1946.
</P>
<P>
   The governor did not outpoll Vallone in the city, as some of his
advisers had hoped, but the breadth of his victory was still
remarkable. Exit polls showed him leading Vallone two-to-one in the
downstate suburbs and upstate. They also showed that one-fourth of
the people who voted for Schumer also voted for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has said little about what he would do in a second term,
beyond continuing to cut taxes and toughen criminal penalties, but
the magnitude of his victory could allow him to claim a mandate for
whatever his second-term agenda may hold. If the economy slows,
however, Pataki's plans could be overtaken by budget woes,
precisely the opposite of the circumstances that he has enjoyed for
the last four years, as the economic expansion and Wall Street boom
allowed the governor to do what he promised and more,
simultaneously cutting taxes and raising spending.

DEMOCRATIC GAINS APPEAR TO TAKE PRESSURE OFF CLINTON

<P>
   While the White House played down expectations Tuesday night,
the Democrats were well on their way to racking up enough victories
to give President Clinton the mandate he wanted to finish his last
two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute push by the party to boost black voter turnout,
including efforts by Clinton, seemed to have paid off as Democrats
were locked in competitive races in such states as Illinois and
South Carolina where they were not expected to do as well.
</P>
<P>
   With the outcome likely to determine whether Republicans in
Congress have the momentum to impeach Clinton, White House
officials said they were counting a good night as victories in the
California governor's race, the New York Senate race and a few
others, and holding down Republican gains in the House. But early
returns showed them on the path to exceeding those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from the election was that people in this country
want to know what you are for,'' said White House senior aide
Douglas Sosnik. ``If you are an elected official, they want to know
where you are going to lead the country,'' he said.``People are
sick of all the negative partisan attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton watched the returns come in from the office of his new
chief-of-staff, John Podesta, along with political director Craig
T. Smith. Clinton also made the first of several victory calls to
Democratic candidates _ Evan Bayh, who won the Senate race in
Indiana, Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and
Senator Charles Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been a tireless campaigner on
behalf of Democratic candidates, partly because of the impeachment
distraction for the president, holed up in the White House theater
watching the new movie, ``Beloved,'' starring Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were later expected to gather in theater with
friends, staff and members of the Cabinet to watch the returns,
said White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss Toby.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton told reporters before meeting with his economic
advisers that results of the election would ``depend upon who makes
the effort to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is a referendum on all the hopes of the
American people for the future, and their assessment of the present
condition, and how we get from here to a better tomorrow. I think
that's what it will be. That's what all elections are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart knocked down
suggestions that the president was responsible for any damage his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky may have caused Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is the leader of the Democratic Party. I think
he's done a fine job of articulating the agenda and the issues,
especially where we differ from the Republican Party,'' Lockhart
said. He and other aides noted that the president worked feverishly
to raise money for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But, because of the impeachment shadow, Clinton's help was
limited to fundraising at private functions. He did not stump for
candidates at massive rallies and was mere background noise in most
Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   White House strategists say they have come to learn that
presidential appearances do not translate into votes for candidates
and that they also are too costly for the candidate. Instead, they
had Clinton adopt a Rose Garden strategy of using the White House
as a perch for policy announcements that would highlight
differences between Republicans and Democrats on issues such as
Social Security, education, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most frequent efforts were made on behalf of two
big-state Senate Democratic candidates. He aggressively raised
money for New York Representative Charles Schumer, who faced
Republican incumbent Alfonse M. D'Amato, and California incumbent
Senator Barbara Boxer, running against Republican Matt Fong.

   RESTABAL, Spain _ In January 1986, Ian Gibson received a message
he had awaited for years: Salvador Dali was ready to see him. An
Irish-born author, Gibson was writing a biography of Federico
Garcia Lorca, the Andalusian poet, and Dali had finally agreed to
talk about his intimate friendship with Garcia Lorca, forged during
their school days in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson sped to the Teatre-Museu Dali in the Catalan town of
Figueras. He was led to an imposing chamber with an interminably
long red carpet. At its end was the celebrated Surrealist, bedecked
in a white silk cloak, perched on a throne.
</P>
<P>
   But Dali, 81, was hardly in shape for an interview. ``He was a
sack of bones,'' Gibson recalls. ``His eyes were vacant and his
body was terrible to behold. It was awkward and anguishing. He had
these tubes up his nose, and he couldn't articulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, says Gibson: ``I couldn't but be awed. I was suddenly in
the presence of this myth. I've interviewed thousands of people,
but none affected me like this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be so awed now, I have to say,'' he adds. ``But I
was awed then.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though this was Gibson's only meeting with the artist, who died
in 1989, he went on to know him all too well. He spent six years
working on an 800-page biography, ``The Shameful Life of Salvador
Dali,'' which was published here this month by Norton.
</P>
<P>
   When the book was released in London a year ago, most critics
praised Gibson's approach, citing his sensible focus on Dali's
early years and his unflinching look at the artist's progressive
debauchery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Dali is that he's an objectionable human
being,'' says Gibson, a robust man of 59 with a graying mop of
reddish curls. ``We're talking about someone who never developed
emotionally. It worked well when he was young and fit. But not
later. The mask fell off.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The title of Gibson's Dali biography, a twist on the artist's
1942 memoir, ``The Secret Life of Salvador Dali,'' signals Gibson's
predominant theme: that a man infamous for his exhibitionistic
antics was, at heart, timid, guilt-ridden and sexually repressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He writes about it himself in `The Secret Life,' '' says
Gibson. ``It's there more frankly than in any Spanish
autobiography.'' Yet as Gibson acknowledges, ``The Secret Life'' is
hardly a historical document; it is a novelistic approach to
autobiography by an artist consciously trying to create his own
myth.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, to determine what is fact and what is fantasy? ``It's
a feeling for the text itself,'' says Gibson, who went back to the
unpublished French original. ``And comparing it with what's in
other sources. I tried to be skeptical. But every so often I
probably lowered my guard.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those other sources include correspondence, like letters between
Dali and Andre Breton, not seen by other scholars, as well as
parish and newspaper archives in Dali's native Catalonia. (Gibson
taught himself Catalan to read them.) Among his discoveries were
details about the suicide of Dali's paternal grandfather, an event
that Salvador probably learned of when he was in his 20s, and that
Gibson believes had a profound effect on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It convinced me he was terrified of being paranoid,'' he says,
citing Dali's famous dictum: ``The only difference between a madman
and me is that I am not mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson attributes much of Dali's lifelong sense of shame to his
sexual anxieties: about the size of his penis and about the fact
that masturbation was virtually his only means to orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dali was the first serious artist in history ever to make
onanism one of the principal themes of his work,'' Gibson writes in
his book. While ``The Great Masturbator'' of 1929 is undoubtedly
Dali's best-known work on the subject of self-satisfaction, Gibson
believes that many other paintings from throughout the artist's
career are variations on the same theme.
</P>
<P>
   He also speculates that Dali had resisted admitting the
possibility that he might have had homosexual leanings,
particularly toward Lorca, and that this was one reason he waited
so long before giving an interview to Gibson about his relationship
with the poet.
</P>
<P>
   Such anxieties came to the fore, Gibson writes, when Dali met
his future wife, Gala, and worried that he would not be able to
perform. Fortunately, though, the Russian-born Gala was open to
mutual masturbation, which became the couple's preferred method of
satisfaction. As the years passed, Gala found a series of
successively younger lovers to satisfy her.
</P>
<P>
   Dali, meanwhile, directed both male and female members of the
entourage that followed him between his principal haunts _ among
them, Paris hotels and his seaside home in Cadaques _ in erotic
games for his voyeuristic pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Dali's orgies were not really orgiastic in the Dionysian
sense,'' writes Gibson, ``because he planned them down to the last
detail and constantly intervened to tell the actors what to do,
what to stop doing (he enjoyed interrupting them when they were
just on the point of orgasm, for example) or how to do whatever
they were doing better.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Fifth day is relaxing for Glenn and the Discovery Crew
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas _ As Mondays go, John Glenn's wasn't
too bad.
</P>
<P>
   Other than having some more blood drawn, his hardest duties were
getting up and getting ready for bed as Discovery's crew sailed
smoothly through its fifth day in space.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he had a video visit with his family, and he and
mission commander Curt Brown had on-camera interviews with five TV
networks.
</P>
<P>
   That was work. Glenn also got some time to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have some time off today, and we did some things like
making balls of water that can float out in front of you,'' he said
during the TV interviews, while he and Brown bobbed gently up and
down in the orbiter's middeck.
</P>
<P>
   One of the experiments on this mission is to study the effects
of space flight on sleep patterns. Monday morning, Glenn and fellow
payload specialist Chiaki Mukai removed the electrode-studded
headgear and body harnesses they wore for the first time Sunday
night and recorded their impressions of their sleep period.
</P>
<P>
   They had to put the gear back on again Monday night. The
so-called ``sleep net'' headgear and harness measure the body's
respiration, brain and muscle activity during sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The crew's biggest job today will be retrieving the Spartan 201
solar observation satellite at 3:45 p.m. (EST). The satellite was
cast off Sunday, and Spartan mission manager Craig Tooley said it
has been doing ``extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn, the 77-year-old spacefarer, had plenty of time to
enjoy life in Zero-G.
</P>
<P>
   On his first space flight more than 36 years ago, Glenn was
strapped into his tiny Mercury capsule with little chance to
experience the sensations of weightlessness. Now, he floats float
freely _ as he demonstrated during the TV interviews by turning
from a standing position to float briefly on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``An average 77-year-old person in good health could certainly
come up here and experience this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn even suggested a good view of the earth from space might
reduce conflict on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could just look down from up here and see what a
beautiful earth we live on, perhaps everyone would be a little more
peacefully inclined than we've been in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he doesn't foresee average citizens journeying into
space anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will come a time in the not too distant future
where people may be able to go up. I think it'll be a little while
yet, because you know, these are very expensive missions, and the
major reason we have these things is to do basic research up here,
not just to provide spots to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's crew members used a private NASA video link to visit
with their families Monday morning as they orbited about 340 miles
above the earth. Speaking to his wife, Annie, and his children
David and Lyn from space was an opportunity Glenn didn't have on
his first flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Glenn said it was wonderful; said the Senator looked
wonderful,'' said Jack Sparks, Glenn's senate aide

 RESTABAL, Spain: doing better.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the milieu was sordid _ ``I didn't want to meet any more
people involved with orgies,'' Gibson says _ the type of detective
work involved is the author's specialty.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Spain since 1978, he has made a career of
examining some of the most complex and controversial episodes in
the country's recent history, notably at the time of its Civil War.
The first of his 12 books, on the death of Lorca at the hands of
Fascist soldiers in Granada in 1936, was banned by Franco's
government when it was released in Spain in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the first volume of his Lorca biography came out
in 1985, the Socialists were in power and Gibson became a
full-fledged literary celebrity, a familiar presence on television
talk shows and in the daily press. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ian is popular for two reasons,'' says his friend Tom Burns, a
British-born, half-Spanish journalist who has written several books
on modern Spain. ``One is that he has a natural empathy for Spain.
He takes life with both hands and enjoys it. The other is the
intelligent way he has been able to research and write about
Spanish ghosts. Spaniards are still uneasy about fellow Spaniards
reporting their own history. Ian has explained Lorca, for instance,
to Spaniards in a way that Spaniards themselves couldn't have
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's star faded a bit when the conservative government came
to power in 1996. But by then, he had already fled the limelight by
moving from Madrid to Restabal, a whitewashed town near Granada
with a stunning view of the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The villa he shares with his wife, Carole (who edits his books),
is framed by a fragrant tangle of orange and lemon trees; the
couple also cultivate olives, pomegranates and almonds. Out back is
a swimming pool built with the proceeds of Gibson's recent sale
(for what he says was ``a modest sum'') of his Lorca archive to the
Lorca Casa-Museo in Fuente Vaqueros, the poet's birthplace. ``I
call it the Federico Garcia Lorca memorial pool,'' he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brought up in a Methodist family in Dublin, Gibson got hooked on
Spain during a summer course in Madrid after his freshman year at
Trinity College, where he studied French and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   He planned to move abroad, as his idol James Joyce did, but
instead, in 1963, he married Carole, his college sweetheart. Two
children soon followed. To support his family he took jobs teaching
Spanish at the Queen's University in Belfast, and later at the
University of London. In between, he made frequent trips to Spain
to pursue his research on Lorca.
</P>
<P>
   Initially his investigations concerned the folk sources of
Lorca's poetry in and around the Vega of Granada. But literature
soon paled beside what he was hearing about Spain's Civil War. ``I
met so many people who suffered,'' he says. ``It engaged my
missionary zeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, his Lorca book became the subject of ``Death in
Granada,'' a movie about Lorca's death starring Andy Garcia. When
it was released last year, it was not well received on either side
of the Atlantic. ``It just wasn't the film one had envisaged,''
Gibson says diplomatically. ``Critics thought some elements were a
bit corny.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So did some of his admirers. ``Foreigners have a certain sort of
tendency to idealize Spain, and Ian sometimes falls into that
trap,'' Burns says. ``That is something that Spaniards resent quite
a lot.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is finished with Dali, Gibson has returned to a
project he began 20 years ago, a study of Henry Spencer Ashbee, a
19th-century British millionaire, traveler, Hispanist, bibliophile
and collector of erotica.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson hopes to prove that Ashbee wrote an infamous tome called,
appropriately, ``My Secret Life,'' an account of erotic adventures
in Victorian London that is thought to be a memoir. ``I've always
been interested in secret lives,'' Gibson says. ``In what's beneath
the surface.'' And when he finishes with Ashbee, he hopes to go to
Greece. ``I'll take my computer with me and write a memoir of my
life,'' he says. ``Maybe I'll fictionalize it.''

 &HT;    Democrats not popular in Warren County
 &HT;    By Ken McCall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No wonder Democrats have such a hard time in Warren County,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Sizemore, chairman of the Warren County Democratic Party,
says he feels like he's ``swimming up-water'' and voter
registration records show why:
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been on a decade-long slide that has left them
with only 6.9 percent of the total registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Democrats haven't won a countywide partisan race
since the 1970s, and the Republicans, as they are this year, run
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, registered Democrats in the county have fallen from
19.9 percent, or 12,009 voters, to 6.9 percent or 5,920 registered
voters. That's more than a 50 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County Republicans have also lost registered voters,
though not nearly as much. From a high of 34.5 percent in 1994, the
Republicans now have dropped to 24 percent or 20,734 registered
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers of non-affiliated voters, meanwhile, soared to a 10-year
high of 76.3 percent in 1997 and make up 69.1 percent of registered
voters this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend isn't restricted to ultra-conservative Warren
County.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery County where Democrats once held a 2-1 majority,
Democrats began a rapid decline in 1995 that has left them in
second place. As of Oct. 22, 1998, registered Republicans outnumber
Democrats 61,534 to 58,091.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from Greene County generally mirror the trend, while
those from Miami County show no such changes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schramm, director of the Ashbrook Center for Public
Affairs at Ashland University, sees the figures as a sign of a
diseased political system.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, Schramm says, the parties ``have become
confused'' in the minds of the voters. And that, he says, has led
to increasing voter skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Ohio governor's race. When Democratic
candidate Lee Fisher backs ing a tax cut and Republican Bob Taft
calls it irresponsible, the political science professor asks, what
does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   What it means, he says, is the parties are increasing hard to
differentiate and increasingly uninterested in partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials in local counties say that the voter
registration numbers have changed because of a 1995 state law.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who do not go to the polls for a party primary for two
calendar years now are reclassified as neither Republican nor
Democrat but non-affiliated. Many counties, including Warren, have
partisan elections only in even years, so voters who skip or miss
voting in only one primary are classified as unaffiliated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, anyone who registers to vote after a primary is
classified unaffiliated. The only way to become affiliated with a
party is to request a partisan ballot at a party primary.
</P>
<P>
   What you get after the new law, says Frieda Brigner, deputy
director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections, is ``your
hard-core party membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Looked at that way, there can be little dispute that the
Democratic Party in the region is struggling. In three counties,
the Democrats are losing more of their ``hard-core'' supporters
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore , in Warren County , and Dennis Lieberman, chairman of
the Montgomery County Democratic Party, blame the apparent lower
interest on boring primaries and changes in demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton lost 100,000 voters in the p l ast 20 years, Lieberman
says, while growth has boomed in the more conservative suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Warren County, Sizemore has seen a suburban invasion across
the northern border, mostly into higher-income housing. The average
family income in Springboro is $67,000, he says, and more affluent
folks tend to be Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the primary problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman says Montgomery County Democrats haven't had a
``primary of any substance'' since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore has a similar explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no primary for Democrats in '96,'' he says. ``Bill
Clinton didn't have any opposition. And '94 was just a desperately
bad year for Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But you have to go back a long time to find a good year for
Democrats in Warren County. There hasn't been a Democratic
candidate for county commission since 1992, and it's been 14 years
since a Democratic challenger came within 10 percentage points of a
Republican in a commission race.
</P>
<P>
   The last really close election was in 1982 when newcomer
Republican C. Michael Kilburn, who is running unopposed for his
fourth term this year, beat Democrat Bob Turner with 51.2 percent
of the vote. Since then, most of the races have gone 2-1 for the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   After awhile, says Sizemore, it gets tough to find somebody
willing to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can recruit people to run probably, but just to run for
the sake of running is not the thing to do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It costs a lot of money to campaign in Warren County, Sizemore
says. There are six telephone exchanges, so everything's long
distance. You can't just go to one newspaper or TV station to buy
ads for the whole county.
</P>
<P>
   And trying to get publicity from the traditionally Republican
newspapers in Lebanon and Cincinnati, he says, ``is kind of like
pulling teeth from a chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't gotten that bad in traditionally Democratic Montgomery
County, but Jeff Jacobson, chairman of the county's Republican
Party, sees a trend in the figures he likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their base is disappearing,'' Jacobson says.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are not only leaving the city, he says, they're also
``becoming less and less interested in voting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's transformed a county that has long been Democratic into a
county that is at best, for them, 50-50. I think these kinds of
population trends are long-term bad news for the Democratic
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, naturally, doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'd expect Jeff to say,'' he says. ``But if
anything our base is becoming stronger with all the mean-spirited
stuff the Republicans are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, see the trend as long-term bad news for
more than just the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of interest and partisanship, says Schramm, is bad
``because there is less possibility of principled conversation and
debate over the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way,'' Schramm says, ``you can see it as the death of the
party system, which has been a kind of guardian of our liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   Chet Sutherland, media director for the Ohio Libertarian Party,
says the two-party system needs to die. Ohio, he says, has ``rigged
the rules to try to limit competition'' to a two-party system that
no longer serves the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising that the Democratic and Republican parties
are losing voters,'' Sutherland says. ``They don't really offer
that much of a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are seeing that they're both doing the same thing.
They're both using attack ads as a substitute for discussion of the
issues that people are concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Asher, political science professor at Ohio State
University, cautions about jumping to conclusions. The trends may
be a real reflection of political disaffection, he says, or it
might be an artifact of the election law change or it might be a
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just proposed an excellent research project,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the causes or effects, Sizemore, deep in the heart of
Republican country in Warren County, will just keep working for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't give up,'' he says. ``We keep working hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be opportunities where we can get Democrats in.
Eventually there will be. Every trend has a changing point.''

DEMOCRATS TAKE GOVERNORSHIPS IN ALABAMA, SOUTH CAROLINA

<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrats defeated Republican incumbents to capture the
governorships of South Carolina and Alabama Tuesday, in a pair of
upset victories that signaled a partial Democratic reemergence in
state capitals after years of overwhelming Republican rule.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 governorships on the line, Democrats were poised Tuesday
night to make a gain of several seats, including, most importantly,
the California state house, which had been held by Republicans for
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Democratic state Representative Jim Hodges
defeated Republican Governor David M. Beasley, partially on the
strength of Hodges' proposal to launch a state lottery to fund a
widespread education reform program.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley, a telegenic governor presiding over a growing economy,
was also haunted by video poker. In 1994, he accepted money from
the video poker industry, only to vocally oppose the game years
later, prompting the industry to contribute heavily to Hodges.
Beasley was also hurt by accusations that he carried on an
extramarital affair with his former press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman also
pushed a statewide lottery to fund education reforms in his
victorious campaign against Republican incumbent Governor Fob James
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In initial network projections, Republican incumbents won with
relative ease in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arkansas
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush, son of the former president, coasted to
easy victory in Texas in a campaign that could launch him toward a
race for the White House. In Florida, Jeb Bush, George W. Bush's
brother, was the projected winner against Democratic Lieutenant
Governor Buddy MacKay. Not since 1971, when members of the
Rockefeller dynasty held the governorships of New York and
Arkansas, have two brothers served as governor at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, incumbent Republican governors had displayed
an activist flair on such issues as education reform and health
care, in contrast to their congressional counterparts, who had done
battle with Democratic reform proposals. With this activism, the
GOP was looking to keep a lock on most of the 10 largest states,
the notable exception being California, where they appeared
destined for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 36 governorships were decided Tuesday night, with
Democratic and Republican leaders each predicting they would gain
two or three seats. In state after state, especially Ohio, many of
the television advertisements were negative to the point of being
brutal. But President Clinton's political and legal troubles over
his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky barely surfaced as an issue in
any of the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Bushes, other luminaries were seeking
governorships. In Minnesota, Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III, son
of the former Democratic vice president, was locked in a difficult
race in which a former professional wrestler nicknamed ``The Body''
was siphoning crucial votes away from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And in Ohio, Republican Robert Taft, great grandson of President
William Howard Taft, was widely believed to hold an advantage
against Lee Fisher, the former Democratic attorney general. That
campaign had evolved into a particularly spiteful battle,
characterized by dueling advertising campaigns about each other's
ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   California remained the biggest prize, with Lieutenant Governor
Gray Davis in a strong position to bring the governorship into
Democratic hands. His opponent, state Attorney General Dan Lungren,
was criticized by fellow Republicans for his decision to wrap
himself in the Reagan legacy.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast, many of the gubernatorial candidates raised
record amounts of cash, often pouring their funds into hard-edged
advertising campaigns.

 &HT;    Wright State Basketball coach, familiar with life's ups and
downs, hopes to turn team around
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio_Rod Foster pulled up the green pant leg of his
Wright State warm-up suit and eased down the top of his white
cotton sock until you saw the faint, two-inch scar just above his
left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all you can see of it anymore,'' he said with a shrug.
``From this, you can't really tell how big of a deal it was in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, this thin line of flesh is really more like the
great divide. On one side there was the National Basketball
Association, where Foster was a Phoenix Suns shooting guard known
for his speed and spring. He was called Rocket Rod, a nickname he
picked up in his glory days as a UCLA Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the other side of the scar, you find basketball stops
far beyond those marquee seasons with UCLA and the NBA. The
travelogue of teams includes Savannah, Quad Cities (Ill.), Rapid
City (S.D.) and San Jose of the Continental Basketball Association,
Erie of the World Basketball League, the barnstorming Athletes in
Action, Master's College, an NAIA school in California, and now,
Wright State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rocket has landed,'' Foster, the Raiders new assistant
basketball coach, said quietly as he headed to the team's Monday
afternoon practice in the Nutter Center. ``But you know something,
I couldn't be in a better situation. I've got no remorse over what
once was. What I like is this group of kids we have here. I really
hope I can help them turn things around.''
</P>
<P>
   In Foster, Wright State _ which opens its 1998-99 basketball
season tonight with an exhibition game against the Dayton-based
Supreme Court _ may have found a guy who can help it rebound from
last year's 10-18 season. After all, the 38-year-old coach has
engineered quite a turn around of his own.
</P>
<P>
   As a prep All-American at St. Thomas Aquinas High in New
Britain, Conn., in the late 1970s, Foster said he had one dream:
``Since I'd been in the seventh grade, all I thought about was
playing in the NBA. Growing up, my idol was Julius Erving and I
tried to emulate him, even with the big Afro.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruited by everyone, Foster finally chose UCLA over Syracuse,
Louisiana State and Marquette: ``As soon as I walked around Pauley
Pavilion and saw those 10 national championship banners, I was in
awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster was a four-year starter for the Bruins. All-PAC 10 as a
freshman, he was on a team that played in the NCAA Final Four. It
was during a nationally-televised game against DePaul, as Foster
was streaking up and down the floor, that Al McGuire, the coach
turned commentator, tagged him Rocket Rod. By the time he was a
senior, the Rocket led the nation in free throw shooting percentage
(.950) and was All-PAC 10 again.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Suns drafted Foster in the second round of the 1983
draft and in three season's he was making a name for himself as a
three-point shooter. Then came the incident that forever changed
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it like yesterday,'' he said. ``It was a Sunday in
March in 1986. The night before we'd come back from playing the
Utah Jazz and we had the day off. Two of my teammates, Ed Pinckney
and Mike Sanders, went with me in my Jeep to drive around some
desert trails out by Lake Pleasant beyond Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was toward evening an we came over a hill and I lost
control of the Jeep. For some reason, as it was tipping over on
it's side, I stuck out my leg like I was on a bicycle and the Jeep
landed on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster suffered major fractures of the tibia and fibula in his
left leg. Nobody else was hurt in the accident, but because the
Jeep flipped in the remote foothills of the Bradshaw Mountains, it
took his teammates four hours to get him to a hospital, where he
underwent three different surgeries and one total ``change in
perspective,'' as he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember thinking this had to have happened for a
reason,'' Foster said. ``I was so dependent on my legs. Speed was
my trademark and I had stuck my leg out. After a while, it all came
to me. And it was pretty humbling. God had a different plan for me.
I had lost my way and he did the one thing to get my attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``See, I had gotten really caught up in the NBA lifestyle. I was
young, had a lot of money and a lot of free time. I was more
concerned with what was happening after the game.''

 &HT;    Cincinnati's career receptions leader hopes to return to team in
1999
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ After getting reprimanded by head coach Bruce
Coslet for his outburst during the Bengals' 33-26 loss to Denver on
Sunday, Carl Pickens questioned his eagerness to return to
Cincinnati in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The club's career receptions leader becomes a free agent at the
end of the season when his contract runs out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the nicest way I know how to say it. I'll just play out the
year,'' Pickens said Monday. ``I don't want to step on anyone's
toes or be misunderstood. But (after) eight weeks, we'll see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens caught five passes for 65 yards Sunday, but showed his
frustration against the Broncos' double-team coverage with constant
animation.
</P>
<P>
   Callers on sports talk shows assaulted Pickens for what they
perceived as his blatant attempt to undermine or ``show up''
quarterback Neil O'Donnell and the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens wrote off his demonstrative behavior as being ``caught
up in the game.'' But Coslet said Pickens was wrong. ``I can
dismiss a lot of things during a game that come under the category
of `in the heat of battle,' but I couldn't dismiss that,'' Coslet
said. ``I addressed that to Carl in front of the team. I told him
my point of view, and the case is closed. Basically it was wrong
and I don't want to see it happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said Carl is a tremendous football player. He's
highly motivated, plays hard, practices hard, prepares tough and
does everything I want him to do. But he gets frustrated when
things don't go his way. We try to get the ball to Carl as much or
more than anybody on the team. Why wouldn't I? He's a playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickens, 28, leads the NFL in catches with 49 for 664 yards (a
13.6 average) and three TDs. He owns the league's single-game high
of 204 yards this year (on 13 receptions) against Pittsburgh on
Oct. 11. Since then, he's been limited to two, two and five catches
by Tennessee, Oakland and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football's an emotional game,'' Pickens said. ``Your emotions
play a big part of it. I'm a competitor. I'm very aggressive out on
the field and when I do stuff like that I'm not trying to point the
finger at anybody or bring that much more attention to myself. I
just I'm caught up in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's misunderstood, then that's not my problem. I play to
win . . . How hard is that to understand?''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals own a 35-69 record (.337) since drafting Pickens in
the second round out of Tennessee in 1992. His advice for O'Donnell
to get him the ball?
</P>
<P>
   ``Just throw it high. How hard is that? I can jump pretty
good,'' Pickens said. ``We just have to figure out the time of the
game to do that. Defenses are not going to allow me just to run
down the field and jump up and catch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to figure out ways to where I can become more involved
and Darnay (Scott) can become more involved when they play certain
coverages.''
</P>
<P>
   While defensive end John Copeland is due to return to practice
Wednesday from a torn left Achilles tendon injury suffered in
April, guard Ken Blackman is scheduled for arthroscopic surgery
today to repair a cartilage tear in his left knee. Anthony Brown
will start in place of Blackman, who will be sidelined at least two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker James Francis will try to practice Wednesday with a
small cartilage tear in his right knee. If Francis can't go,
trainer Paul Sparling said the knee will be scoped.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver James Hundon (cracked left rib) is doubtful;
defensive end Glen Steele (two sprained ankles) and linebacker
Steve Foley (lower back strain) are questionable. Wide receiver
Darnay Scott (Achilles tendon strain) is probable.

 &HT;    Democrats not popular in Warren County
 &HT;    By Ken McCall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No wonder Democrats have such a hard time in Warren County,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Sizemore, chairman of the Warren County Democratic Party,
says he feels like he's ``swimming up-water'' and voter
registration records show why:
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been on a decade-long slide that has left them
with only 6.9 percent of the total registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Democrats haven't won a countywide partisan race
since the 1970s, and the Republicans, as they are this year, run
unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1988, registered Democrats in the county have fallen from
19.9 percent, or 12,009 voters, to 6.9 percent or 5,920 registered
voters. That's more than a 50 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County Republicans have also lost registered voters,
though not nearly as much. From a high of 34.5 percent in 1994, the
Republicans now have dropped to 24 percent or 20,734 registered
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers of non-affiliated voters, meanwhile, soared to a 10-year
high of 76.3 percent in 1997 and make up 69.1 percent of registered
voters this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend isn't restricted to ultra-conservative Warren
County.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery County where Democrats once held a 2-1 majority,
Democrats began a rapid decline in 1995 that has left them in
second place. As of Oct. 22, 1998, registered Republicans outnumber
Democrats 61,534 to 58,091.
</P>
<P>
   Figures from Greene County generally mirror the trend, while
those from Miami County show no such changes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schramm, director of the Ashbrook Center for Public
Affairs at Ashland University, sees the figures as a sign of a
diseased political system.
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, Schramm says, the parties ``have become
confused'' in the minds of the voters. And that, he says, has led
to increasing voter skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Ohio governor's race. When Democratic
candidate Lee Fisher backs ing a tax cut and Republican Bob Taft
calls it irresponsible, the political science professor asks, what
does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   What it means, he says, is the parties are increasing hard to
differentiate and increasingly uninterested in partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials in local counties say that the voter
registration numbers have changed because of a 1995 state law.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who do not go to the polls for a party primary for two
calendar years now are reclassified as neither Republican nor
Democrat but non-affiliated. Many counties, including Warren, have
partisan elections only in even years, so voters who skip or miss
voting in only one primary are classified as unaffiliated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, anyone who registers to vote after a primary is
classified unaffiliated. The only way to become affiliated with a
party is to request a partisan ballot at a party primary.
</P>
<P>
   What you get after the new law, says Frieda Brigner, deputy
director of the Montgomery County Board of Elections, is ``your
hard-core party membership.''
</P>
<P>
   Looked at that way, there can be little dispute that the
Democratic Party in the region is struggling. In three counties,
the Democrats are losing more of their ``hard-core'' supporters
than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore , in Warren County , and Dennis Lieberman, chairman of
the Montgomery County Democratic Party, blame the apparent lower
interest on boring primaries and changes in demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton lost 100,000 voters in the p l ast 20 years, Lieberman
says, while growth has boomed in the more conservative suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Warren County, Sizemore has seen a suburban invasion across
the northern border, mostly into higher-income housing. The average
family income in Springboro is $67,000, he says, and more affluent
folks tend to be Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the primary problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman says Montgomery County Democrats haven't had a
``primary of any substance'' since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore has a similar explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no primary for Democrats in '96,'' he says. ``Bill
Clinton didn't have any opposition. And '94 was just a desperately
bad year for Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   But you have to go back a long time to find a good year for
Democrats in Warren County. There hasn't been a Democratic
candidate for county commission since 1992, and it's been 14 years
since a Democratic challenger came within 10 percentage points of a
Republican in a commission race.
</P>
<P>
   The last really close election was in 1982 when newcomer
Republican C. Michael Kilburn, who is running unopposed for his
fourth term this year, beat Democrat Bob Turner with 51.2 percent
of the vote. Since then, most of the races have gone 2-1 for the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   After awhile, says Sizemore, it gets tough to find somebody
willing to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can recruit people to run probably, but just to run for
the sake of running is not the thing to do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It costs a lot of money to campaign in Warren County, Sizemore
says. There are six telephone exchanges, so everything's long
distance. You can't just go to one newspaper or TV station to buy
ads for the whole county.
</P>
<P>
   And trying to get publicity from the traditionally Republican
newspapers in Lebanon and Cincinnati, he says, ``is kind of like
pulling teeth from a chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't gotten that bad in traditionally Democratic Montgomery
County, but Jeff Jacobson, chairman of the county's Republican
Party, sees a trend in the figures he likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their base is disappearing,'' Jacobson says.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are not only leaving the city, he says, they're also
``becoming less and less interested in voting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's transformed a county that has long been Democratic into a
county that is at best, for them, 50-50. I think these kinds of
population trends are long-term bad news for the Democratic
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, naturally, doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'd expect Jeff to say,'' he says. ``But if
anything our base is becoming stronger with all the mean-spirited
stuff the Republicans are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers, however, see the trend as long-term bad news for
more than just the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of interest and partisanship, says Schramm, is bad
``because there is less possibility of principled conversation and
debate over the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way,'' Schramm says, ``you can see it as the death of the
party system, which has been a kind of guardian of our liberties.''
</P>
<P>
   Chet Sutherland, media director for the Ohio Libertarian Party,
says the two-party system needs to die. Ohio, he says, has ``rigged
the rules to try to limit competition'' to a two-party system that
no longer serves the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising that the Democratic and Republican parties
are losing voters,'' Sutherland says. ``They don't really offer
that much of a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are seeing that they're both doing the same thing.
They're both using attack ads as a substitute for discussion of the
issues that people are concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Asher, political science professor at Ohio State
University, cautions about jumping to conclusions. The trends may
be a real reflection of political disaffection, he says, or it
might be an artifact of the election law change or it might be a
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just proposed an excellent research project,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the causes or effects, Sizemore, deep in the heart of
Republican country in Warren County, will just keep working for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't give up,'' he says. ``We keep working hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be opportunities where we can get Democrats in.
Eventually there will be. Every trend has a changing point.''

 &HT;    All polls say Ohio State is No.1, but the Buckeyes already knew
that
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Most Ohio State players still do not fully
understand how the new Bowl Championship Series rankings are
determined but they do understand this: The Buckeyes are No. 1 this
week and in their eyes, that means all is right again in college
football.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of scrunched noses and perplexed looks last
week when the Buckeyes were told they were No. 1 in the Associated
Press and USA Today /ESPN coaches' polls but No. 2 in the BCS
standings behind UCLA. Monday, when they were told they had jumped
to No. 1 in this week's BCS ratings, all of the number-crunching
seemed to make more sense to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were definitely disappointed we were No. 2 (last week),''
OSU quarterback Joe Germaine said. ``We definitely think of
ourselves as being a No. 1 team.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, so do the voters and the computers. OSU is first in the BCS
with 3.71 points, a lower total than last week. (The lower the
point total, the higher the rank.)
</P>
<P>
   Poll rankings, computer ratings, strength of schedule and
won-loss records each count 25 percent in determining the BCS
standings. The top two teams at the end of the season will be
invited to play in the national championship Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4 in
Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   A lackluster performance against a weak Stanford (1-7) team last
Saturday dropped UCLA in the polls and as a result in the BCS, from
No. 1 to No. 3 with 6.62 points. Tennessee, which features
Meadowdale High graduate Peerless Price at wide receiver, moved
into the No. 2 spot in the BCS (5.70 points) after its eighth
straight victory Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach John Cooper said it's nice to be No. 1 across the
board. ``I'd rather be No. 1 than No. 2, 3 or 4,'' he said. ``But
I'm not going to worry about it like I didn't worry abut it last
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper still maintains that if OSU finishes the season
undefeated, the Buckeyes will play for a national championship. But
if UCLA, Tennessee and Ohio State each win the remainder of their
games, at least one undefeated team will be left out of the title
game. Kansas State, Wisconsin, Arkansas and Tulane also still have
shots at undefeated seasons. OSU offensive lineman Rob Murphy said
he just wants to make sure the Buckeyes stay on top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we're there, I'm a happy kid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine, too, said getting to the Fiesta Bowl is his main
focus. An emerging Heisman candidate and Arizona native, Germaine
said he thinks more about playing for a national title in his home
state than accepting the Heisman at the Downtown Athletic Club,
where the award is presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really all I think about in the back of my mind: Go to
Tempe and finish out the season there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If OSU and the rest of the teams vying for the top two spots
learned one thing about the complicated BCS this week it was this:
Squeezing out a victory against a weak opponent, as UCLA did
against Stanford, will cost you.
</P>
<P>
   Two of OSU's remaining three opponents are unranked: Michigan
State (4-4) on Saturday and Iowa (3-6) next week.

 &HT;    Mace sentenced to prison after death of Michigan man
 &HT;    By Rob Modic

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio_A courtroom of victims' survivors converged in
tears and hugs Monday, moments after David Leroy Mace was sentenced
to 18 years to life in prison in the strangulation death of Matthew
Lehmann, 26, of Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   From one side, Bruce Lehmann, still wiping away tears after he
gave an impassioned eulogy over the loss of his son, walked over to
Melissa Engle, Mace's girlfriend, who had been crying throughout
Lehmann's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sorry for your loss,'' Lehmann said, extending both
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you're going through,'' Engle answered
sympathetically. ``I lost someone like that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Engle in March was in an adjacent Montgomery County
courtroom pleading with a different judge not to release the man
who in 1992 stabbed to death Michael David Goff, 26, the father of
Engle's son, now 9.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom Monday night, Engle broke into sobs again,
over Mace. She said he had been addicted to crack cocaine and
needed to be under stricter control in treatment while on probation
for a felonious assault in January.
</P>
<P>
   Butler Twp. police said Mace and Lehmann, an electrician, met on
a job site at Sinclair Community College. Lehmann of Kalamazoo
checked into the Days Inn, 7470 Miller Lane, and was found dead
June 9. He had been hit in the head with a blunt object and
strangled with a television cord.
</P>
<P>
   Tanis Polaski, the mother of Matthew Lehmann, told Montgomery
County Common Pleas Judge David A. Gowdown that Mace should also
have been charged with ``taking of part of all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was sentenced, Mace, cuffed at the wrists, turned to
Lehmann's family and said, ``Nothing I say or do can change what I
have done. I would like to say I am truly sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mace had earlier pleaded guilty to felonious assault with a
mandatory three-year firearm specification in the Jan. 17 shooting
of Ronald Hill, 38, who had been had been visiting Mace at his home
when he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Mace also pleaded guilty to receiving a stolen motor vehicle
stemming from his March 13 arrest, after police found a stolen van
stripped of its tires and center caps parked in a field behind a
bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   Following a plea agreement between assistant county prosecutors
John Slavens and Douglas Miley and defense attorney Dennis
Lieberman, Gowdown ordered a mandatory 15-year-to-life sentence,
consecutive to the three-year firearm specification from the
felonious assault. Gowdown ordered an eight-year sentence for the
felonious assault and an 18-month sentence for the stolen van
served during the murder sentence.

PROJECTIONS GIVE D'AMATO SENATE SEAT TO DEMOCRAT SCHUMER

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Democrat Charles Schumer appeared headed for victory
Tuesday night in his Senate race against three-term Republican
incumbent Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The news services projected Schumer to be the winner seconds
after the polls closed at 9 p.m. Exit polls all afternoon had shown
the Democrat ahead, 54-46.
</P>
<P>
   A Schumer win would signify a major triumph for the Democratic
Party. D'Amato has been a major figure in the national
rightward-leaning Republican resurgence and the king of New York
state's GOP organization.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a cause for celebration in the White House.
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore each came here twice
to campaign for Schumer. Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke at Schumer
rallies four times, most recently before an enthusiastic union
group on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are popular in New York and Schumer, who sits on
the House Judiciary Committee, which could vote on impeachment
hearings later this year, has defended the president in his hour of
crisis, saying he should be punished but not impeached.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, on the other hand, has refused to take a position on
the issue, but he famously chaired the Senate Banking Committee's
Whitewater hearings, which went nowhere, but not before D'Amato
lambasted the Clintons, especially Hillary, who is particularly
admired here.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are an important ethnic group in any New York election, and
D'Amato, who pulled in 40 percent of the Jewish vote in his last
race, an extremely high figure for a Republican, had been losing
ground among them this time around. Exit polls Tuesday showed his
support was down to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One factor here is that Schumer is Jewish. Another is that
D'Amato made a possibly fatal blunder a few weeks ago when,
speaking to a small group of Jewish supporters, he referred to
Schumer as a ``putzhead,'' a Yiddish vulgarism that apparently
offended many Jews, not so much as an ethnic slight as for its
crudity.
</P>
<P>
   Every preelection poll painted this contest as a statistical
dead-heat, with Schumer way ahead in New York City, D'Amato
somewhat ahead upstate, and the two virtually tied in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this equation, D'Amato was thought to have an edge
because, in recent elections, a smaller percentage of residents of
New York City _ Schumer's stronghold _ have actually turned out to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, exit polls Tuesday suggested a higher-than-usual
turnout in New York City, with the vast majority of the extra
voters pulling the lever for Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer was expected to attract two-thirds of the city's
voters, the exit polls showed him winning 78-22 in the five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby said such an extraordinary margin suggests a
relatively vast turnout in the black and Hispanic neighborhoods of
Brooklyn, the Bronx, Harlem, and Washington Heights _ whose
residents are nearly all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and several municipal unions waged a strong campaign to
get the black vote out. The exit poll numbers, if they hold,
suggest the effort was successful.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer &UR;  &LR; did well with senior citizens, too, winning 59 percent
of their vote in exit polls. In the exit polls, a quarter of his
supporters cited Social Security and Medicare as the most important
issue. Schumer has played up his support of these programs, while
painting D'Amato as having voted for Rep. Newt Gingrich's budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was also able to repel D'Amato's efforts, early in the
campaign last September, to paint him as a ``liberal.'' The
Democrat emphasized his record as a tax-cutter and a crime-fighter,
noting especially his authorship of the crime bill that put 100,000
extra police on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato picked up momentum when he shifted gears and started
denouncing Schumer for missing a large number of votes in the House
while he was out campaigning. He turned this into his main theme
the last few weeks, saying Schumer's absenteeism showed he put his
political goals above his public obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The main source of D'Amato's strength is his reputation as
``Senator Pothole'' for his unparalleled constituent services and
his ability to eke favors from the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His most popular endorsers _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
Governor George Pataki, the Daily News, and two influential black
ministers, Floyd Flake and Calvin Butts _ all emphasized that, in a
Republican-controlled Senate, New York will get more federal
dollars with a senior Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   In the other major New York race, Pataki seemed sailing to a
second term in the governorship. As in the preelection surveys,
exit &UR;  &LR; polls showed him defeating Democrat Peter Vallone, the
soft-spoken speaker of the New York City Council, by more than 20
points.

THE ECHO OF SOUNDS OF SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just across the street from Madison Square Garden,
Paul Vellios was sitting with a dozen of his regulars at the bar of
Cafi 31 Tuesday night, with his eyes fixed on an empty dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the sports bar would have been packed with Knick fans
by early evening and filled with players late at night. Normally,
Allan Houston would have taken a table with some friends and sat
quietly eating an appetizer. Normally, John Starks would have
popped in and shaken a few hands as he found a seat in the back.
</P>
<P>
   But normality fell victim to the reality of the National
Basketball Association lockout Tuesday night. With eager waiters
standing in the background, Cafi 31 was bare. By about 8:10 p.m.,
the originally scheduled tip-off for the Knicks game against the
Celtics, the Garden looked like the first cousin to an abandoned
warehouse without a player, fan or vendor to fill its famous space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quiet around here, isn't it?,'' said Vellios, who is part
owner of Cafi 31. ``We go as the Garden goes. If there are people
over there, there are people in here. Now, everything is different.
I'm just trying to hold on because the holidays are coming up, and
I don't want to let go of any of my regular people. It's not an
easy situation for anyone right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses are hurt, and the fans are hurt. Usually, we have
kids coming in after the game, lining up for autographs. I guess
maybe those kids will do better in school now, because they'll get
home early enough to get their homework done.''
</P>
<P>
   An easy going and warm man, Vellios smiled and seemed to be
taking the lockout as well as he could even though the rhetoric
officially turned into reality Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to some fans and players, the night will go by without a
second thought. What is on television? What movie is playing? To
others, the first canceled game night of the NBA season meant an
unsettling adjustment to their normal routines.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 17 years, Buck Williams has had his body ready for
the NBA's opening night. Instead of feeding off the optimistic buzz
of a new season, instead of getting his ankles taped, the Knick
veteran forward said he would be cleaning off the dining-room table
after dinner. ``I'm going to be domestic,'' Williams said on
Monday. ``I'm going to be doing all the chores around the house.
I'll be taking kids to school, packing up the dishwasher. I'll be
doing it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do feel a little empty. The leaves are turning different
colors, and your body clock is a certain hour. It's telling you
it's time to go to work. It's telling you that it's November and
it's time for the regular season. You walk around and you get this
feeling that something isn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Something is wrong when a longtime ticket-holder such as Fred
Klein, who has missed only 15 Knick home games since 1959, sees the
word ``canceled'' next to opening night. All these years, Klein has
been taking his seat beneath the Knicks' basket. Through
championship seasons and forgettable slumps, he has been sharing
his love of the game and a piece of his life with his courtside
buddies while the price of his seat has risen from $2.50 to $175 a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the game, and when it's there, I'm there,'' said Klein,
a restaurant broker and investor. ``If the players and owners want
to ruin it for themselves, let them do it. To me, it's a social
thing. I know everyone who sits around me. We've all been friends
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is getting hurt here except the fans and the poor guys
who sell you a soda. The other guys, they're rich no matter what.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That sentiment was shared by other season ticket-holders. Some
are increasingly bitter toward the lockout, and feel their voices
are going unheard in the debate. Most had plans to settle in front
of the television or work late.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else can you do?'' said Lee Fein, a manufacturer in the
garment district, who has been going to Knick games for more than
20 years. ``I feel that this whole thing is absurd on both sides.
Neither side should be so arrogant in their position _ as reports
have shown _ because time is wasting. There are other options for
the fans and viewers. We all have long memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in the metropolitan area, with all the options there
are for us, we can be unforgiving as a fan base. I think we'll
definitely miss it because we love basketball and the NBA. But I
think that even though you remember how great it can be, no one is
going to sit home and pine for the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ticket-holders will be in a bind without the Knicks. Where
else will celebrities get their camera time? Where else can Spike
Lee get under Reggie Miller's skin? Where else can corporations
entertain clients?

BUSH BROTHERS INCREASE GOP HOLD ON SOUTHERN STATEHOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ With the Democrats' historic hold on the South
under siege, voters elected two Republican sons of a Connecticut
Yankee Tuesday to serve as governors of the region's two biggest
states.
</P>
<P>
   But two other Republican governors were ousted.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Governor George W. Bush, son of the former president,
easily won a second term, giving him a strong sendoff toward an
expected run for the Republican presidential nomination, while his
younger brother, Jeb Bush, captured the chief executive's office in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush brothers were doing their part to build a
Republican base in the South, results were less favorable for the
GOP in other major races where a strong black vote appeared to be a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Fob James of Alabama and Governor David Beasley of
South Carolina were both driven from office by a pair of Democrats
who espoused state lotteries to finance educational initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hodges, a former legislative leader in South Carolina, was
projected as the winner in his bid to unseat Beasley, a favorite of
the Christian right who antagonized many conservatives by his vain
attempt to bring down the Confederate battle flag from atop the
state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman of Alabama dealt
defeat to James, another far-right incumbent who survived a threat
from a candidate backed by the state's business leadership in the
Republican primary but could not stop another offensive in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia served as the scene for another close contest, with
state Representative Roy Barnes, a Democrat, battling Guy Millner,
an Atlanta businessman, for the right to succeed Governor Zell
Miller. If successful, Millner would become the first Republican to
hold the office since Reconstruction, but he narrowly lost
gubernatorial and Senate races earlier in the decade and, according
to tallies shortly after polls closed, he had no assurance of
victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night's counting, 8 of the 11 states in the
old Confederacy had Republican governors, and party strategists had
hoped to make further inroads in state legislatures that have been
dominated for decades by Democrats. In recent years, Republicans
have managed to win a share of the state house in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Florida, and Virginia, but their sweep across Dixie
has been stopped in scores of local races.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were showing signs of a resurgence in Senate races,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest surprises of the night, Republican Senator
Paul Coverdell of Georgia found himself struggling for survival
against Michael Coles, a successful businessman who has never held
public office. Pre-election polls showed Coverdell with a
double-digit lead, but that advantage did not hold up in the first
real returns. Incomplete returns showed that Coles, who amassed a
fortune with a cookie company, served as state Democratic chairman,
and made his first political venture two years ago when he ran
unsuccessfully against House Speaker Newt Gingrich, was running
neck-and-neck with Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the veteran South Carolina Democrat,
held off a challenge by Representative Bob Inglis, winning a sixth
term in one of the most conservative states in the region on the
strength of near-unanimous support by black voters, who represent
about 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Next door in North Carolina, 70-year-old Republican Senator
Lauch Faircloth was being hard pressed by John Edwards, a Raleigh
attorney running as a fresh face, and the contest was indecisive an
hour after polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for a Senate seat in the border state of Kentucky
between two former sports stars who moved their careers to Congress
was not expected to be determined until late in the night.
Representative Jim Bunning, a Republican who first made a name for
himself as a major league baseball pitcher, and Representative
Scotty Baesler, a former University of Kentucky basketball star who
won the endorsement of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, engaged in
one of the nastiest campaigns of the fall and were carrying their
fight to the bitter end.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If glam is sweeping the fashion world, Marc Jacobs,
Hussein Chalayan and Geoffrey Beene have not been told. And thank
goodness. A more contrived trend there never was. Designers are in
too much of a reflective mood to embrace anything as
confrontational and wildly ersatz as glam-rock fashion _ a trend
hailed by a few style-setters as the next big thing. Think of 1970s
David Bowie, and glam-rock style suggests some ripe possibilities.
But stretch the ruminations to present-day vestiges of glam like
Kiss, and it quickly becomes clear that the possibilities are not
so attractive after all.
</P>
<P>
   More appealing by far is Beene's pastiche of design and
dressmaking loosed on his signature tube dresses and chemises. When
Erica Jong fantasized zipless sex, she was misguided in Beene's
view.
</P>
<P>
   For it was zippers that Beene made a tool of seduction in his
show Tuesday. A zipper curved up the back of a slithery dress,
traversed the bosom and shot down the front, where it was unzipped
to disclose a flash of leg.
</P>
<P>
   Beene's designs suggest a new woman in an old world combining
classic notions with the modern idea of comfortable clothing.
Rolled seams traversed the waist of jersey dresses, defining a
waist by placement above and below it. Skinny folds of fabric that
began as little button-down collars, as on a man's shirt,
disappeared into the sleeves of a dress or shirt.
</P>
<P>
   If any other designer played with as stuffy an icon as a man's
button-down shirt, one could assume that the point was humor. Not
so with Beene.
</P>
<P>
   If he is as humourless about his work as he is reputed to be, it
may be with good reason. While fashion's conceptual side can soar
with inspiration, the business can be brutal. Few know the
downsides better than Beene, who has been worshiped and snubbed in
high places and low.
</P>
<P>
   Just five years ago, if anyone had shouted, ``Raise your hands
whoever wants to do glam,'' Jacobs' arm would have shot up. He and
his friend Anna Sui (whose show Wednesday will have a glam theme)
were the twin trend-setters driving home the most brazen
pop-culture trends.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jacobs has turned patrician. He's found religion, the
religion of Mainbocher, the quintessential American designer, who
defined luxurious, understated style in the 1950s and '60s. Jacobs,
however, is not designing for C.Z. Guest, one of Mainbocher's most
admired clients. He's appealing to a younger set. Those who fancy
themselves today's royalty can pull up outside Jacobs' SoHo store
and find the most indulgent but lasting, clothes.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hint of chilling resignation in this fascinating
evolution. It bespeaks the pressure of economics in shaping
fashion's creativity. It is very American, and in this, Jacobs is
true to his heritage. He is not immune to the new pressures of his
industry. Charivari, the chain that was once a shrine to
experimental designers (and employed Jacobs as a clerk in the
1980s), is in bankruptcy. Chastened by that example and by his own
near-death experience at Perry Ellis, Jacobs is now clearly trying
to create enduring fashion.
</P>
<P>
   His pretty, calculated show drew a clear enough border between
his work for Louis Vuitton and his own collection, even if Jacobs'
Vuitton work used more of his energy than was evident in his own
line.
</P>
<P>
   His loosely structured trouser shorts with back flap pockets and
grosgrain ribbons fluttering from the hems are descended from last
season's wide-leg sailor pants. A leather apron skirt and coat,
both with scalloped edges, conjured the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Peeking from beneath black dresses with scalloped hems were
slivers of clear cellophane. A look both futuristic and modern
appeared in white dresses with a veil of black tulle or shimmering
pewter.
</P>
<P>
   Ingenues, it seems, will always exist, Jacobs' collection seemed
to say. Despite the absence of the big stars like Donna Karan,
Calvin Klein and Helmut Lang on the runways this week, there is a
crackle of interest and a subdued focus in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Glamour _ not to be confused with glam _ can always be counted
on to brighten any proceeding, and glamour was served by Badgley
Mischka, Zang Toi and Carolina Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the dark, brooding garden dotted with stone pillars that
was the Badgley Mishcka runway, models twinkled like fairies in a
midsummer night's dream. There were amazing flashes of aurora
crystal on a tank top. Clusters of glass ornamented limpid gowns or
fell from blouses like precious icicles on a frosty windowpane.
</P>
<P>
   While his peers were whiling away their time with minimalism and
street style in department stores, Toi was quietly holding out for
sumptuous dressing sold piece by piece, customer by customer, in
small specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   His return to a central point _ the tents _ is nothing less than
a triumph of will, one underscored by a collection containing a
baroque silk print that he airily described as the ``House of Toi''
print.
</P>
<P>
   Toi has survived in business long enough to have real customers,
rather than celebrities who don't pay, at his show. Jamie Gregory,
Hillary Geary and Ivana Trump all watched the parade of exquisite,
embroidered, molten-gray long skirts and gowns and gray Shantung
suits, some with langourous trousers, others with shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Toi has stolen these customers from under the nose of designers
like Ms. Herrera, whose specialty has long been the social set. It
is no wonder that Ms. Herrera jolted her own staid collection to
life with pink leather jackets and halters, and hipster wide-leg
taffeta pants.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter Carolina Herrera Jr. has been a successful
influence. The next step for the older Mrs. Herrera is to reconcile
the dual nature of the collection, which was one part slick
sportswear, another part elegant embroidered dresses. It was not
clear what the collection had to with a Man Ray exhibition now in
Milan, which Ms. Herrera mentioned in her program notes. The
reference might just have been a bit of the pretense that designers
sometimes wander off into.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Herrera's case it was harmless; in the case of BCBG Max
Azria, it was lethal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aiming for the nonchalance that has come to fashion with apron
dresses and layered pieces, Azria too often overreached, landing in
a puddle of forced hipness with odd combinations of wool pants over
sequined leggings or chiffon tops over cashmere ones. Extending his
impressive and growing empire, recently enlarged with the agreement
to purchase the French fashion house of Herve Leger, seems to come
much more naturally to Azria than creating effortless clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In recent seasons, Susan Lazar has been trapped between the
desire to switch from prosaic, urban fashion to a more artistic
approach. She is beginning to settle into a creative new identity
and has improved her collection with halter dresses with gathered
necklines and simple soft jackets. It is a sexier, more evolved
look, but Ms. Lazar still has a case of fashion laryngitis. She
needs to find a pitch that is stronger and surer.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Chang-Lima and Linda Allard for Ellen Tracy were also in
search of a voice. Whatever happened to Chang-Lima's rich panoply
of interesting tailoring and inspired, feminine decoration? In its
place was an aggressive screed that drew on Helmut Lang, John
Bartlett and Veronique Branquinho _ just about everyone except
Chang-Lima himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allard's belief in strong, coordinated career sportswear was
replaced by lackadaisical, semitransparent nubby skirts, flapping
wide-leg pants and flyaway jackets. At least she did not borrow
from anyone. In her program notes she said she had gone back to the
Ellen Tracy archives and found many forgotten pieces.

IN PENNSYLVANIA'S 13TH DISTRICT, A BELLWETHER OF BACKLASH  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NORRISTOWN, Pa. _ Election Day broke bright and prosperous in
the Philadelphia suburbs, and Sy and Miriam Kershner awoke early,
eager to cast two of the most valuable votes in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With turnout nationwide expected at lamentably low levels, and
the local race for Congress a rematch of the closest House contest
in 1996, the ballots cast by the Kershners and every other voter at
the Plymouth Valley Fire Station were potential kingmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And when the smoke clears on these midterm elections, the
outcome of this campaign is likely to be seen as a referendum on
the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   Just 84 votes separated the winner two years ago, as two-term
Representative Jon Fox, a constituent-service Republican, beat
challenger Joseph Hoeffel, a pothole-fixing Democratic county
commissioner. This year, the same charisma-challenged candidates
are vying for the same wealthy swing district, debating pretty much
the same issues.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference is that since Fox and Hoeffel last faced the
voters, the nation has been rocked by a president outed as an
adulterer and accused of being a perjurer.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, this race is a bellwether of backlash. Some is
directed at the president and his fellow Democrats for getting the
country into this mess, but just as much is aimed at the
Republican-controlled Congress, which is widely viewed here as
overplaying its hand.
</P>
<P>
   For every voter in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District
who has switched to Hoeffel out of frustration with the Republicans
in Congress, it seems that another is throwing a first-time vote to
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what they're doing in D.C.,'' said Sy Kershner, a
retired construction estimator. ``They're spending our money, and
all they care about is putting the screws to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kershners voted for Hoef-fel this year, abandoning their
1996 vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelle Miller, a pharmaceutical research assistant, strode
purposefully into the Montgomery County Vocational Technical School
to cast her vote for Fox. She had one simple reason, and it had
nothing to do with either individual on the ballot. ``The
Republicans stand for the values I believe in,'' Miller said.
``President Clinton's example for the country is pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are couples like Mark and Beverly Schwartz, whose
mixed feelings canceled each other out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the Republicans' handling of things offensive, and I
want fewer Republicans in office if this is the way they think they
should manage the country,'' said Beverly Schwartz, a nonpracticing
lawyer who voted for Fox in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, then I'm voting for Fox,'' said Mark Schwartz, a
practicing lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns understood that their candidates were viewed as
stand-ins for national political leaders, and both knew they were
helped as well as hurt by it. That is particularly true in this
moderate but politically fickle district, where Clinton won in both
1992 and 1996, even though Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 2
to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel, for one, turned away some fellow Democrats _ and
Republicans, too _ by refusing to appear with Clinton at a
fund-raiser in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people understand I was trying to avoid the distraction
of the Lewinsky matter,'' Hoeffel said in an interview Tuesday.
``I'm not sure I succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoeffel, who urged censure rather than impeachment, said he
thinks he was ultimately helped by Republicans' treatment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And Fox had to agree. ``Some people may vote against me because
of the perception of what's going on in Washington,'' Fox said in
an interview Tuesday. ``The GOP maybe could have handled this
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that my record will be more important to them,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the president has overshadowed other issues, but
a few voters said they would vote for Fox because he is more
willing than Hoeffel to restrict abortions. Hoeffel's
abortion-rights stand won him some votes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls showed that the race was a toss-up down to the
wire, there were indications that Fox had at least one potentially
decisive advantage. While by all accounts Hoeffel rode Clinton's
coattails to near-victory in 1996, this year the ticket has two
popular Republicans at the top, Governor Tom Ridge and Senator
Arlen Specter, both of whom were expected to win easily.
</P>
<P>
   But here, as everywhere, nothing is permanent in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Kershners, after voting for Hoeffel, said they were happy
with their decision but hardly committed for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems like he can do a really good job,'' Miriam Kershner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he doesn't, we'll vote him out next time,'' added her
husband.

PATERNITY-TESTING ADS NO PROBLEM FOR DNA-SAVVY PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Even in a nation where researchers have found that many
adults do not know whether the earth revolves around the sun or the
sun around the earth, a Houston advertising agency is betting that
people driving down the highway or flipping through a magazine in
these days after the O.J. Simpson trial and Kenneth Starr report
will know what DNA is.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems to be right.
</P>
<P>
   An ad for Identigene Inc., a Houston company that provides DNA
tests to determine children's paternity, uses the simple teaser
``Who's the father?'' written in Day-Glo pink against a black
background along with the tell-all phone number, 1-800-DNA-TYPE.
The only graphic is the company logo, a thumb print with a
squiggly, spermlike tail.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards with that sparse message started appearing in about
25 major cities in 1995. The ad made its national magazine debut in
the October issue of Esquire.
</P>
<P>
   Though a few people have complained about the subject matter, no
one had to ask what it meant, said executives at Freed Advertising,
the agency handling the $300,000 account. ``People generally know
what we're saying,'' said Allison Bond, an account executive at
Freed.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Caskey, the 31-year-old president and founder of
Identigene, agreed. ``We never have to educate a person on that,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Identigene opened for business in late 1994, with advertising on
billboards and in regional newspapers and on television beginning
in 1995 _ just as Simpson went on trial in the slaying of his
former wife.
</P>
<P>
   News reports were full of the results of DNA tests on blood that
the police said they found in Simpson's Ford Bronco, on socks in
his bedroom and at the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``That helped educate the public,'' Ms. Caskey said. But, she
added, her ads had already been prepared. ``It wasn't premeditated.
It was just a lucky coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The lucky breaks have just continued. ``Now DNA is talked about
all the time with the Monica dress,'' she said, referring to the
scandal involving President Clinton and tests for semen stains on
Monica Lewinsky's navy blue dress. All that, of course, was part of
Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The original newspaper ads for Identigene were designed by a New
York boutique ad agency, Goldsmith/Jeffrey Inc., which has since
been acquired by Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, part of the Lowe Group unit
of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Those ads were similar but
more oblique _ done in stark black and white and with smaller
print.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldsmith ads won a gold Clio award in 1996 but were not
bringing in customers, Ms. Caskey said, calling them ``too subtle
for people,''
</P>
<P>
   She moved the account to Freed and made the artwork brighter,
driving around Houston herself to help come up with ideas for bold
colors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the phone number is larger now, the text remains
basically the same, with no definition of DNA. ``I love the
simplicity of the message,'' Ms. Caskey said.
</P>
<P>
   And it is effective, she added. She said she received 400 calls
a day based on the billboards alone, helping increase her client
load to an expected 8,000 this year from the 1,500 she had in her
first year in business. New York has no billboards, but for six
months last year the ads appeared on Big Apple taxi roofs. They won
a 1998 American Advertising Award, or Addy.
</P>
<P>
   The full-page ad was placed in Esquire because of the magazine's
upscale male audience. About 60 percent of Identigene's customers
are men, Ms. Bond said. The typical client is a white, middle- to
upper-middle-income male, age 23 to 39. But Ms. Caskey said, ``It's
not just dads trying to get out of paying child support or mothers
trying to get down on deadbeat dads.'' Many of the men, she said,
want to establish paternity to gain visitation rights with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caskey said she and Freed would decide later whether to
continue in Esquire or even expand into other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain. Americans can grasp a scientific
concept _ if it's something closer to them than the sun.

DEMOCRATS POSITION THEMSELVES TO THWART REPUBLICAN GAINS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The broad middle of American politics held Tuesday.
And to the relief of Democrats, that's where enough of their
candidates had positioned themselves to thwart Republican designs
on major gains in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Well-rehearsed Republican cries of ``liberal, liberal, liberal''
were insufficient to propel the GOP to a significantly stronger
hold on the House or Senate. And last-minute Republican chants of
``liar, liar, liar,'' as they attempted to focus voter attention on
President Clinton's sex scandal, were either ineffective or
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The marginal shifts in party dominance on Capitol Hill,
reflected in returns and exit polls, point to an electorate which
remains content with narrow majority control in Congress and with
clearly divided government in Washington overall.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, the results mean at least two more years of
government by niggling, as Clinton on one end of Pennsylvania
Avenue and Republican leaders on the other cobble together
compromises when they think the voters demand it and rag each other
unceasingly the rest of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have grown strangely accustomed to, if not fond of,
this act. They're willing to tolerate it as long as the economy is
bouncing along, and an amazing 84 percent of respondents in CNN's
early exit polling said they viewed the national fiscal picture as
excellent or good.
</P>
<P>
   The results also lay out a very interesting landscape on which
the 2000 presidential campaign _ both in the primaries and in the
fall _ will be waged.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the modest GOP showing nationally
actually could be good news for a mainstreamer such as Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas. With a broad center-right appeal that celebrated
his state's diversity, Bush showed that a Republican can be
triumphant in a basically conservative state without kowtowing to
what his ex-president father once called the ``extra chromosome''
wing of the party. That should be an important lesson for
Republicans nationally, although there is no certainty they will
learn it.
</P>
<P>
   For Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner, the
election was a sign that at this point at least he need not fear
his close association with Clinton _ not that he could do much to
shake it.
</P>
<P>
   If Tuesday's voting was a referendum on Clinton and impeachment,
which is arguable, then the president won, sort of. Voters were not
so disturbed by the sex scandal that they decisively strengthened
the Republican hold on Congress, nor were they so committed to
cutting off the Republican move toward impeachment that they
delivered either house into Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his supporters will take great heart, and glee, from
the defeat of first-term Sen. Lauch Faircloth, the North Carolina
Republican who has been one of the president's chief tormentors.
Faircloth's television ads sought to tie Democratic challenger John
Edwards to Clinton's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have voted repeatedly on Clinton's character,
beginning in 1992 when they elected him with full knowledge that he
was a flawed but engaging figure. That view held up not only in his
1996 re-election but in poll after poll amid the unfolding sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters (55 percent) do not want Clinton impeached,
according to CNN's exit surveys. That only slightly &UR;  &LR; lags behind
the general public's opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Given these consistent numbers, Republicans were delusional in
their belief that there was political profit in the last-minute
television ads attacking Clinton. Only slightly less daft was the
idea of some Democrats that there was a big advantage in lashing
themselves to the president.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties these final gambits were always about juicing
up their base, and it appears to have worked less than might have
been expected for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP was certain it would benefit from a low-turnout
election, which is what Tuesday's voting appears to have been in
most places. But a Republican advantage was hard to detect,
especially in the South, where Democrats showed surprising
strength, defeating at least two incumbent GOP governors.
</P>
<P>
   The initial indication was that it was Republican turnout that
was off. And that in several close races, including some in the
South, an increased black vote fueled narrow Democratic victories.
That is a reversal from 1994, when low black turnout was one of the
reasons that Republicans won control of both houses of Congress for
the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Republicans should have done much better in
congressional races nationally in the second mid-term election of a
Democratic president _ even given the fact that Clinton's Democrats
lost control of Congress in the 1994 mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans, especially in the House, reflect on their less
than stellar showing, some might be chagrined enough to wonder if
they still have the right leader in Speaker Newt Gingrich. A big
question is whether that mood would make it easier for Gingrich to
decide it's time to move on and launch a serious presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats considering a challenge to Gore for their party's
presidential nomination, there was little to hang their hat on. &QL;

BUSH BROTHERS INCREASE GOP HOLD ON SOUTHERN STATEHOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ With the Democrats' historic hold on the South
under siege, voters elected two Republican sons of a Connecticut
Yankee Tuesday to serve as governors of the region's two biggest
states.
</P>
<P>
   But two other Republican governors were ousted.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Governor George W. Bush, son of the former president,
easily won a second term, giving him a strong sendoff toward an
expected run for the Republican presidential nomination, while his
younger brother, Jeb Bush, captured the chief executive's office in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush brothers were doing their part to build a
Republican base in the South, results were less favorable for the
GOP in other major races where a strong black vote appeared to be a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Fob James of Alabama and Governor David Beasley of
South Carolina were both driven from office by a pair of Democrats
who espoused state lotteries to finance educational initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hodges, a former legislative leader in South Carolina, was
projected as the winner in his bid to unseat Beasley, a favorite of
the Christian right who antagonized many conservatives by his vain
attempt to bring down the Confederate battle flag from atop the
state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman of Alabama dealt
defeat to James, another far-right incumbent who survived a threat
from a candidate backed by the state's business leadership in the
Republican primary but could not stop another offensive in the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia served as the scene for another close contest, with
state Representative Roy Barnes, a Democrat, battling Guy Millner,
an Atlanta businessman, for the right to succeed Governor Zell
Miller. If successful, Millner would become the first Republican to
hold the office since Reconstruction, but he narrowly lost
gubernatorial and Senate races earlier in the decade and, according
to tallies shortly after polls closed, he had no assurance of
victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Tuesday night's counting, 8 of the 11 states in the
old Confederacy had Republican governors, and party strategists had
hoped to make further inroads in state legislatures that have been
dominated for decades by Democrats. In recent years, Republicans
have managed to win a share of the state house in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Florida, and Virginia, but their sweep across Dixie
has been stopped in scores of local races.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were showing signs of a resurgence in Senate races,
too.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest surprises of the night, Republican Senator
Paul Coverdell of Georgia found himself struggling for survival
against Michael Coles, a successful businessman who has never held
public office. Pre-election polls showed Coverdell with a
double-digit lead, but that advantage did not hold up in the first
real returns. Incomplete returns showed that Coles, who amassed a
fortune with a cookie company, served as state Democratic chairman,
and made his first political venture two years ago when he ran
unsuccessfully against House Speaker Newt Gingrich, was running
neck-and-neck with Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the veteran South Carolina Democrat,
held off a challenge by Representative Bob Inglis, winning a sixth
term in one of the most conservative states in the region on the
strength of near-unanimous support by black voters, who represent
about 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Next door in North Carolina, 70-year-old Republican Senator
Lauch Faircloth was being hard pressed by John Edwards, a Raleigh
attorney running as a fresh face, and the contest was indecisive an
hour after polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for a Senate seat in the border state of Kentucky
between two former sports stars who moved their careers to Congress
was not expected to be determined until late in the night.
Representative Jim Bunning, a Republican who first made a name for
himself as a major league baseball pitcher, and Representative
Scotty Baesler, a former University of Kentucky basketball star who
won the endorsement of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, engaged in
one of the nastiest campaigns of the fall and were carrying their
fight to the bitter end.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrats captured the California governor's office Tuesday, the
single most coveted prize in the midterm elections, but Republicans
maintained their domination of governorships around the country,
according to surveys of voters leaving the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gray Davis, the lieutenant governor of California, defeated Dan
Lungren, the Republican attorney general, to become the first
Democrat elected governor in 16 years. The outcome carries enormous
national political implications because of the influence the
governor of California, the largest state, will have in the 2000
presidential campaign. Davis will also preside over the redrawing
of the state's congressional boundaries after the 2000 census,
which will affect the composition of 52 House districts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Republicans' loss in California, the party hung onto
governorships around the country. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was
re-elected by a wide margin, solidifying his position as the early
favorite among many in his party for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000. It was the first time in 24 years that a
governor of either party has been re-elected to a consecutive term
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Other incumbent Republicans who were re-elected as governors of
major states Tuesday _ some of whom also have presidential
ambitions _ were George Pataki of New York, Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Voters who went to the polls in what was the last national
election of the century were hard-pressed to describe an
overarching issue on which they based their vote. In interviews as
they left their polling stations, many voters cited many issues
that moved them to vote.
</P>
<P>
   It was a marked contrast to four years ago, when voters rebelled
against incumbents and handed control of the House to Republicans
for the first time in 40 years. Two years ago, President Clinton
was re-elected and some voters said they were disturbed by what
they viewed as the extremism of Speaker Newt Gingrich and the new
Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 34 Senate seats were up for election, as were all 435
seats in the House of Representatives. There were contests for
governor in 36 states.
</P>
<P>
   Many races were excruciatingly close at all levels. While
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky was a subtext for the
entire election season, voters leaving the polls said they were not
particularly driven by the scandal one way or another.
Nevertheless, Republicans and Democrats were watching the returns
closely Tuesday night; politicians in both parties said an
unusually strong showing one way or the other could affect how
aggressively the House pursues its impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were gleeful about the California outcome, even though
Davis had outpaced Lungren in the polls for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest political trophy in this midterm election in
sheer size and importance in presidential politics in the year
2000,'' Douglas Sosnik, a senior White House adviser, said Tuesday
night. ``California has proven to be on the leading edge of where
the country's going politically.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Republican National Committee said his party
was still optimistic. ``The South as a region is trending
Republican,'' said the spokesman, Clifford May. Borrowing a Wall
Street metaphor, he said. ``It's a bull market for us, despite an
occasional correction.''
</P>
<P>
   In other returns, former Gov. Evan Bayh recaptured a Senate seat
in Indiana that had been held by Republicans since his father,
Birch Bayh, was defeated for re-election in 1980. But Republicans
also grabbed a Democratic seat in Ohio. Gov. George Voinovich were
elected to succeed Sen. John Glenn, who was orbiting earth this
week aboard the shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senators who were re-elected included Barbara
Mikulski in Maryland, Bob Graham in Florida, Patrick Leahy in
Vermont, Christopher Dodd in Connecticut, John Breaux of Louisiana,
and Byron Dorgan of South Dakota. Republicans who were re-elected
included the party's whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma; Judd Gregg in
New Hampshire, Sam Brownback in Kansas and Arlen Specter in
Pennsylvania, Ben Nighthorse Campbell in Colorado, Christopher Bond
in Missouri, and John McCain of Arizona. Sen. Richard Shelby of
Alabama was re-elected in his first election since he switched to
the Republican party in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Other governors who were elected to new terms included Democrats
Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Howard Dean of Vermont. Among
Republican governors, Frank Keating romped to victory in Oklahoma,
as did John Rowland in Connecticut, Bill Graves in Kansas and Don
Sundquist in Tennessee. Mike Huckabee won his first full term in
Arkansas. He took office when his predecessor resigned after a
Whitewater conviction. In Maine, independent Angus King also won
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had been concerned about spotty turnout in both
parties. But in some heavily black precincts turnout amnog black
voters _ who are reliably Democratic _ was impressive. In
Representative Elijah Cummings' largely urban Baltimore district,
turnout among black voters was heavier than in past races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I went today, folks were lined up,'' said Cummings,
a two-term Democrat. In one inner-city precinct, 187 people had
voted by noon Tuesday, nearly four times the turnout at midday at
the same precinct in 1994, Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings attributed the surge to President Clinton's appeal in
the district on Sunday. ``This was the first time African Americans
had the opportunity to do something in support of the president,''
Cummings said. ``People are fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters were largely approving of Clinton, confident about the
economy, resentful of the impending impeachment hearings and
disappointed in Congress's performance, according to a survey of
voters leaving polling places around the country. Voters said the
issues that mattered to them most were education, taxes, Social
Security, jobs and ethical and moral standards, rather than any one
overriding concern.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lewinsky affair loomed over the entire campaign
season, 6 in 10 voters surveyed said they did not think the
president should be impeached, did not approve of the way Congress
has handled the matter, and did not even want the House to hold
impeachment hearings. Voters were divided on whether, as a lesser
punishment, Congress should censure Clinton.

IN PENNSYLVANIA'S 13TH DISTRICT, A BELLWETHER OF BACKLASH

<P>
   NORRISTOWN, Pa. _ Election Day broke bright and prosperous in
the Philadelphia suburbs, and Sy and Miriam Kershner awoke early,
eager to cast two of the most valuable votes in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With turnout nationwide expected at lamentably low levels, and
the local race for Congress a rematch of the closest House contest
in 1996, the ballots cast by the Kershners and every other voter at
the Plymouth Valley Fire Station were potential kingmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And when the smoke clears on these midterm elections, the
outcome of this campaign is likely to be seen as a referendum on
the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   Just 84 votes separated the winner two years ago, as two-term
Representative Jon Fox, a constituent-service Republican, beat
challenger Joseph Hoeffel, a pothole-fixing Democratic county
commissioner. This year, the same charisma-challenged candidates
are vying for the same wealthy swing district, debating pretty much
the same issues.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference is that since Fox and Hoeffel last faced the
voters, the nation has been rocked by a president outed as an
adulterer and accused of being a perjurer.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, this race is a bellwether of backlash. Some is
directed at the president and his fellow Democrats for getting the
country into this mess, but just as much is aimed at the
Republican-controlled Congress, which is widely viewed here as
overplaying its hand.
</P>
<P>
   For every voter in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District
who has switched to Hoeffel out of frustration with the Republicans
in Congress, it seems that another is throwing a first-time vote to
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what they're doing in D.C.,'' said Sy Kershner, a
retired construction estimator. ``They're spending our money, and
all they care about is putting the screws to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kershners voted for Hoef-fel this year, abandoning their
1996 vote for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelle Miller, a pharmaceutical research assistant, strode
purposefully into the Montgomery County Vocational Technical School
to cast her vote for Fox. She had one simple reason, and it had
nothing to do with either individual on the ballot. ``The
Republicans stand for the values I believe in,'' Miller said.
``President Clinton's example for the country is pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are couples like Mark and Beverly Schwartz, whose
mixed feelings canceled each other out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the Republicans' handling of things offensive, and I
want fewer Republicans in office if this is the way they think they
should manage the country,'' said Beverly Schwartz, a nonpracticing
lawyer who voted for Fox in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, then I'm voting for Fox,'' said Mark Schwartz, a
practicing lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns understood that their candidates were viewed as
stand-ins for national political leaders, and both knew they were
helped as well as hurt by it. That is particularly true in this
moderate but politically fickle district, where Clinton won in both
1992 and 1996, even though Republicans outnumber Democrats nearly 2
to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hoeffel, for one, turned away some fellow Democrats _ and
Republicans, too _ by refusing to appear with Clinton at a
fund-raiser in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people understand I was trying to avoid the distraction
of the Lewinsky matter,'' Hoeffel said in an interview Tuesday.
``I'm not sure I succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoeffel, who urged censure rather than impeachment, said he
thinks he was ultimately helped by Republicans' treatment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And Fox had to agree. ``Some people may vote against me because
of the perception of what's going on in Washington,'' Fox said in
an interview Tuesday. ``The GOP maybe could have handled this
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that my record will be more important to them,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the president has overshadowed other issues, but
a few voters said they would vote for Fox because he is more
willing than Hoeffel to restrict abortions. Hoeffel's
abortion-rights stand won him some votes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although polls showed that the race was a toss-up down to the
wire, there were indications that Fox had at least one potentially
decisive advantage. While by all accounts Hoeffel rode Clinton's
coattails to near-victory in 1996, this year the ticket has two
popular Republicans at the top, Governor Tom Ridge and Senator
Arlen Specter, both of whom were expected to win easily.
</P>
<P>
   But here, as everywhere, nothing is permanent in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Kershners, after voting for Hoeffel, said they were happy
with their decision but hardly committed for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems like he can do a really good job,'' Miriam Kershner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he doesn't, we'll vote him out next time,'' added her
husband.

 UNDATED: censure Clinton. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation into the president's relationship
with Lewinsky, Clinton has been buoyed by a high job approval
rating, and voters said Tuesday that they liked the way he was
running the country. More than half said they approved of the job
he was doing, even though most had a negative view of his personal
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a last-minute television blitz by the Republican Party
to remind Americans of Clinton's conduct during the inquiry, 6 in
10 voters surveyed said they disapproved of the way Republicans in
Congress had handled the matter. More than half also said that
Republicans in Congress had not done a particularly good job in the
last session, and those voters tended to support Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews with voters also help explain why Clinton and
other prominent Democrats invoked Gingrich in their drives to move
people to the polls. More than half the voters said they did not
have a favorable view of Gingrich; those people voted largely for
the Democratic House candidate in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp contrast to the midterm elections four years ago,
voters said overwhelmingly Tuesday that the nation's economy was
strong and they fully expected it to stay that way. People also
registered contentment with their own lives. Most voters said their
family's finances had either improved in the last two years, or at
least not deteriorated. As a result, most voters said the country
was on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts described the elections as a competition
between the most extreme wings of both parties _ the loyal
partisans who are always most likely to vote _ half the voters
Tuesday described themselves as moderates. The survey of voters
also found a gender gap of about seven percentage points, roughly
what it was in the 1994 elections; men voted more heavily for
Republicans while women favored Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, invited a
small group of friends to the White House theater Tuesday night to
watch television coverage of the returns. While his political
director, Craig Smith, checked returns on a computer in the office
of John Podesta, his chief of staff, the President quickly called
three Democrats to congratulate them on their re-election: Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina, Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Tom
Daschle of South Dakota. He also called Bayh, who had just won
election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never remember a time when we had probably eight Senate
seats within a few points one way or the other,'' Clinton told
reporters earlier in the day, ``and it appears to me almost three
dozen House seats within a few points one way or the other.''
Marking the sixth anniversary of his own election, he said they had
been ``six very good years, very good years for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The president shrugged off a question about whether the election
was a referendum on his fate. ``I think this election is a
referendum on all the hopes of the American people for the future,
and their assessment of the present condition, and how we get from
here to a better tomorrow,'' he said. ``I think that's what it will
be. That's what all elections are. And none of us know what is
going to happen. That's the honest truth. None of the pollsters
know; nobody does.''
</P>
<P>
   At his polling place Tuesday morning in Marietta, Ga., Gingrich
expressed confidence that the outcome would be encouraging for
Republicans. ``There's no intrigue,'' he said. ``We're going to win
an election today.'' Gingrich said Clinton's tenure in office had
brought on ``an ongoing, slow-motion collapse of the Democratic
majority that Franklin Roosevelt created.''

PROJECTIONS GIVE D'AMATO SENATE SEAT TO DEMOCRAT SCHUMER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Democrat Charles Schumer appeared headed for victory
Tuesday night in his Senate race against three-term Republican
incumbent Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The news services projected Schumer to be the winner seconds
after the polls closed at 9 p.m. Exit polls all afternoon had shown
the Democrat ahead, 54-46.
</P>
<P>
   A Schumer win would signify a major triumph for the Democratic
Party. D'Amato has been a major figure in the national
rightward-leaning Republican resurgence and the king of New York
state's GOP organization.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be a cause for celebration in the White House.
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore each came here twice
to campaign for Schumer. Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke at Schumer
rallies four times, most recently before an enthusiastic union
group on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are popular in New York and Schumer, who sits on
the House Judiciary Committee, which could vote on impeachment
hearings later this year, has defended the president in his hour of
crisis, saying he should be punished but not impeached.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, on the other hand, has refused to take a position on
the issue, but he famously chaired the Senate Banking Committee's
Whitewater hearings, which went nowhere, but not before D'Amato
lambasted the Clintons, especially Hillary, who is particularly
admired here.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are an important ethnic group in any New York election, and
D'Amato, who pulled in 40 percent of the Jewish vote in his last
race, an extremely high figure for a Republican, had been losing
ground among them this time around. Exit polls Tuesday showed his
support was down to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One factor here is that Schumer is Jewish. Another is that
D'Amato made a possibly fatal blunder a few weeks ago when,
speaking to a small group of Jewish supporters, he referred to
Schumer as a ``putzhead,'' a Yiddish vulgarism that apparently
offended many Jews, not so much as an ethnic slight as for its
crudity.
</P>
<P>
   Every preelection poll painted this contest as a statistical
dead-heat, with Schumer way ahead in New York City, D'Amato
somewhat ahead upstate, and the two virtually tied in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this equation, D'Amato was thought to have an edge
because, in recent elections, a smaller percentage of residents of
New York City _ Schumer's stronghold _ have actually turned out to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, exit polls Tuesday suggested a higher-than-usual
turnout in New York City, with the vast majority of the extra
voters pulling the lever for Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer was expected to attract two-thirds of the city's
voters, the exit polls showed him winning 78-22 in the five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby said such an extraordinary margin suggests a
relatively vast turnout in the black and Hispanic neighborhoods of
Brooklyn, the Bronx, Harlem, and Washington Heights _ whose
residents are nearly all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and several municipal unions waged a strong campaign to
get the black vote out. The exit poll numbers, if they hold,
suggest the effort was successful.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer &UR;  &LR; did well with senior citizens, too, winning 59 percent
of their vote in exit polls. In the exit polls, a quarter of his
supporters cited Social Security and Medicare as the most important
issue. Schumer has played up his support of these programs, while
painting D'Amato as having voted for Rep. Newt Gingrich's budget
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was also able to repel D'Amato's efforts, early in the
campaign last September, to paint him as a ``liberal.'' The
Democrat emphasized his record as a tax-cutter and a crime-fighter,
noting especially his authorship of the crime bill that put 100,000
extra police on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato picked up momentum when he shifted gears and started
denouncing Schumer for missing a large number of votes in the House
while he was out campaigning. He turned this into his main theme
the last few weeks, saying Schumer's absenteeism showed he put his
political goals above his public obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The main source of D'Amato's strength is his reputation as
``Senator Pothole'' for his unparalleled constituent services and
his ability to eke favors from the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His most popular endorsers _ New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
Governor George Pataki, the Daily News, and two influential black
ministers, Floyd Flake and Calvin Butts _ all emphasized that, in a
Republican-controlled Senate, New York will get more federal
dollars with a senior Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   In the other major New York race, Pataki seemed sailing to a
second term in the governorship. As in the preelection surveys,
exit &UR;  &LR; polls showed him defeating Democrat Peter Vallone, the
soft-spoken speaker of the New York City Council, by more than 20
points.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: WHEN WILLPOWER ISN'T ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Talk radio, Philly style. Flak jacket required.
One recent afternoon, the Philadelphia Eagles' owner, Jeffrey
Lurie, a common target for fed-up Eagles fans, was again being
savaged by callers. ``You know what I want, I want the Eagles to
lose the rest of their games,'' one raspy-voiced man said, ``so
Lurie will give up and sell the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk radio. Coach Ray Rhodes doesn't listen anymore. His Eagles
are 1-7, and this has been one of the worst years of his
professional life, so the last thing Rhodes needs to to hear is
some guy from Cherry Hill, N.J., telling him he stinks. Rhodes
knows that he and the Eagles are on the verge of a divorce. The
question is not if Rhodes will be dismissed, but when.
</P>
<P>
   The end could come soon. On Monday night, Philadelphia suffered
perhaps its worst loss in Rhodes' tenure, a 34-0 wipeout by Dallas.
One Eagles official who asked not to be identified said he expected
Rhodes to be let go before season's end and replaced on an interim
basis by the team's defensive coordinator, Emmitt Thomas. A top
candidate to replace Rhodes on a permanent basis, the official
said, is Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Jim Haslett.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put endless hours into doing this stuff, and all of a
sudden it blows up in your face,'' Rhodes said at a news conference
here Tuesday. Asked if he was tired of all the defeats, and the
accompanying embarrassment, Rhodes' voice rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I beat up and wore out? Is that the question you're asking?
It's been a long, long year. It's been hard. I ain't going to lie
to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What's happened to the Eagles, and to the relationship between
Rhodes and Lurie, is one of the more puzzling stories in football.
At one point, it was one of the more promising situations in the
NFL. Lurie was a progressive owner who in February 1995 made Rhodes
only the third black head coach in NFL history and gave him
front-office control of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Eagles fans loved Rhodes from the start _ a smart, fiery leader
who cursed at millionaire players to work hard or get out of town.
Rhodes, who had earned five Super Bowl rings in his 12 years as a
San Francisco 49ers assistant, once said he coached as if he had a
.38-caliber gun to his head. He told cornerback Bobby Taylor four
years ago that the then-rookie had to turn games ``into a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Notre Dame college thing with the little beanie on his
head _ that's out,'' Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes took the Eagles to the playoffs his first season and was
named coach of the year. It seemed Rhodes and Lurie were primed to
rule the National Football Conference East and maybe all of
football. And yet now, both men know the end of the Rhodes regime
is near, even though neither will publicly say it.
</P>
<P>
   So what did happen to the Eagles? How did it all collapse so
quickly? On Nov. 3, 1996, the Eagles beat a then-dominant Dallas
team at Texas Stadium, 31-21. Philadelphia had gone to the second
round of the playoffs in 1995, and now, in the second year of the
Rhodes regime, this game seemed to be the one that would put
Philadelphia over the top, that would make them a viable Super Bowl
contender.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, just the opposite occurred. After the Dallas game, the
Eagles lost four of their next seven games, dropping from 7-2 to
10-6. They made the playoffs as a wild-card team, but were shut
out, 14-0, at San Francisco. And then came last season, when the
Eagles dropped to 6-9-1 in a hint of the disaster that awaited them
this year.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the Eagles' initial success under Rhodes was
more a tribute to his coaching ability than to anything else. The
Eagles were a marginally talented team, and they won because of
Rhodes' tactical skills and strong will. But willpower takes a team
only so far. Talent wins, and by the latter part of Rhodes' second
season, the lack of top players would begin to take its toll.
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors, too. Until this season, Rhodes was in
charge of drafting college players, and his results have been
questionable. The Eagles traded two picks to move up in the first
round of the 1995 draft and take defensive end Mike Mamula, who has
been a disappointment. He is too small to overpower blockers and
has just one speed move. In his first two years, he had only 13{
sacks, including just 4 last season. This past August, he blew out
a knee and will miss the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 draft, Philadelphia took offensive lineman Jermane
Mayberry in the first round. He gave up 15 sacks last season. That
was almost as bad as offensive lineman Barrett Brooks, a
second-round pick in 1995 who surrendered 13 sacks last season. And
then there is Jon Harris, a defensive end who was a first-round
pick in 1997 but who that year was deactivated for the first three
games and finished with one sack. This year, he has had little
impact.
</P>
<P>
   In all, under Lurie and Rhodes, the Eagles have selected 46
college players, and none of them have made the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie feels poor talent evaluation has been a major weakness of
the organization and he said so in an interview with Philadelphia
Magazine in August. ``After this past season, when we were 6-9-1, I
said to myself: `What is the key weakness here? What is really
preventing us from going forward?' It's a consistent lack of
top-notch talent evaluation,'' Lurie told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rhodes had had the final say in that area, Lurie's words
seemed to be a shot at his coach. Lurie declined to be interviewed
for this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about comments that are made like that,'' Rhodes
said. ``The thing is, I've been fortunate to win Super Bowls and be
in a winning organization like the 49ers. I know what it takes to
win. And what it takes to win is not get caught up in comments like
that. If I let myself even think about that kind of stuff, I need
my butt kicked.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Lurie did remove Rhodes from the football
operations part of the job in the off-season and gave those
responsibilities to Tom Modrak, a longtime scout with the Steelers
who has a good reputation throughout the league and could pave the
way for Haslett to come to the Eagles once Rhodes departs. Joseph
Banner, the executive vice president and a close friend of Lurie's,
negotiates player contracts.
</P>
<P>
   While Rhodes' ability to judge talent can be argued, one thing
cannot _ Lurie does not spend enough money in the free-agent market
to keep the Eagles competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has not gone after key free agents like quarterback
Mark Brunell, defensive ends Neil Smith and Mike McCrary, defensive
tackle Henry Thomas and offensive lineman Lomas Brown. The Eagles
have also allowed too many of their own players to leave, with
teams plucking away at the Eagles' talent like apples from a tree.
Linebacker Bill Romanowski departed for Denver and cornerback Mark
McMillian left for Kansas City. Both players are key parts of their
new teams.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Eagles' practice facilities are believed to be
among the worst in the league. The Eagles were embarrassed when
Dana Stubblefield, the 1997 defensive player of the year for the
49ers, not only rejected Philadelphia earlier this year to sign
with rival Washington, but also ripped the Eagles' entire practice
complex, saying the team will never sign free agents with the
facilities being the way they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to duck in one of the meeting rooms to keep from getting
hit with a piece of tile hanging from the ceiling,'' Stubblefield
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes, of course, isn't ducking anything. He is taking his hits
and hanging in there, and when the losing really gets to him, he
can think of the past and how he overcame tougher times than this.
In the 1960s, he helped integrate the all-white high school in his
tiny hometown of Mexia, Texas. He was a long shot to make the
Giants as a 10th-round pick in 1974 but played four seasons at
receiver and defensive back. As the defensive secondary coach for
the San Francisco 49ers, he took a group of raw players _ Ronnie
Lott, Carlton Williamson, and Eric Wright _ and turned them into a
great backfield.
</P>
<P>
   And when things get really bad, so bad he has a hard time
sleeping, Rhodes pulls out all those Super Bowl rings, the gold
glistening in the light. They remind him of something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those rings remind me that I know how to win in this game,''
Rhodes said. ``They never let me forget it.''

   NEW YORK _ Rafael Rivera, a welder, was too busy working. Marty
McCarthy, a maintenance man, forgot all about it and never
registered. Anna Kang, a bank manager, felt she did not have enough
information about the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie, 78, who declined to give his last name, had too much
information. ``I've seen all their commercials _ thank God they
won't be on anymore,'' he said as he passed the noon hour on
Election Day at the Tree Top Cafe, an Irish bar in Norwood in the
northwest Bronx. ``I don't believe anything that any of the
candidates have said.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the closed government offices and a barrage of newspaper
and television coverage, Tuesday was just a regular day for
millions of New Yorkers who did not cast ballots. The heated Senate
race between Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican, and Charles Schumer,
the Democrat, was background noise for these people: Many have
never voted, though others, like Bernie, said they were sitting out
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten to the point where I don't trust any of them,''
said Bernie, a retired printer who said he had spent his life in
the Bronx, except for six years in the Air Force. ``Their promises
they never keep, watch my lips and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   At each election, it seems, officials announce a record-low
turnout, with fewer than half of registered voters typically going
to the polls. Tuesday was no different: At about 6 p.m., election
officials estimated a 40 percent to 45 percent turnout in New York
City, down from 48 percent in 1994, the last midterm election. They
could not provide specific figures for an individual neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Seated north of Fordham University at the last stop of the D
train, Norwood is a place where if you stand under Tree Top's green
awning, you can see a half-dozen other Irish bars. It is also a
neighborhood where 200 Bengali families recently asked the school
board to start a bilingual program. On a two-block stretch of
Bainbridge Avenue, salons specializing in African-American hair
share space with a Mexican deli and a halal meat market.
</P>
<P>
   According to 1997 estimates based on census data, 90 percent of
the neighborhood is made up of renters, and the median household
income is $34,000 a year. Norwood's population is 57 percent white,
16 percent black and 9 percent Asian. Forty-five percent of the
neighborhood's residents are of Hispanic origin; Hispanics can be
of any race.
</P>
<P>
   It is a community where people get involved. Two years ago,
residents began an anti-graffiti campaign, and last spring,
merchants established a business-improvement district. Many people
interviewed on Tuesday, particularly elderly Irish immigrants and
younger black parents, said that they never missed an election.
</P>
<P>
   But about two dozen others _ construction workers, retirees,
some newly minted citizens from Ireland, the Balkans and the
Caribbean _ said they had no plans to vote, even though some had
taken the time to register.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sunny Fruits and Vegetables stand, Manuel Gonzalez picked
peppers with care but said picking politicians was a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't vote, not in this country,'' said Gonzalez, 47, a
superintendent from Puerto Rico, wearing paint-splattered pants
with a cellular phone on one hip and a beeper on the other.
``Doesn't count, anyway _ the politicians do what they like. It's
not a people's country. It's a money country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kang, 34, a mother of three who lives in Valley Stream on
Long Island, said she could not muster the energy for an election
that seemed irrelevant to her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make a decision on what I don't know,'' she
said as she finished a slice at Sal's Pizzeria with a bank
colleague.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lilyanna Pekic, 34, an Albanian who immigrated from Yugoslavia
when she was a child, sipped coffee from a paper cup at Nikita's
luncheonette and pondered her options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up this morning thinking, `Will I make a difference
whether I vote or not?''' said Ms. Pekic, a real-estate broker, who
decided that indeed her vote would not matter. ``The choices that
we have aren't so drastic. They haven't done much for us. They
didn't prove it to us _ to me, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Tree Top Cafe three hours later, some regulars
remained, but a new crop of young men, buddies of the barkeeper,
had joined them. Ryan Hopkins, 26, said he voted for George Bush in
1992 _ but Bush lost.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, 20, who has lived his whole life in the Bronx, said he
was surprised _ and disappointed in himself _ when he saw an
election poster in his building Tuesday morning and realized he had
not registered in time. ``It's important to vote, I feel,'' he
said. ``Some countries can't vote. I'll probably go register
tomorrow for next time.''

VOTING MAKES LITTLE CHANGE IN DEMOCRATIC HOLD ON LEGISLATURE  
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts Republicans struggled to add a handful of
seats to their precarious toehold in the state Legislature Tuesday
night, as the Democratic chairwoman predicted the GOP would move
further toward extinction on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   With two-thirds of races uncontested, both sides' most
optimistic projections involved shifting no more than a handful of
seats from one side to the other, with Democrats expected to
continue to outnumber Republicans more than 4-1 when the new
Legislature takes office in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be modest about it, I think our chances are for plus one on
the Senate and plus three to five in the House, but we have to hold
what we have, too,'' said Marc DeCourcey, the Republican State
Committee executive director.
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Joan Menard of Somerset, the state
Democratic chairwoman, said, ``I'd like to win one or two more
seats in both chambers to say we are still making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were pinning their hopes in part on getting a member
of their party elected to a seat being vacated by a member of the
other party, particularly Senate seats in the Shrewsbury-Worcester,
Andover-Lawrence, and Sharon-Walpole areas and House seats on Cape
Cod and in Lowell, Melrose and Walpole. Three of the most closely
contested Senate races featured:
</P>
<P>
   _Republican state Representative Jo Ann Sprague of Walpole
battling Democrat James E. Timilty of Walpole for the seat being
vacated by state Senator William R. Keating, a Sharon Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   _Worcester Democrat Guy W. Glodis against Shrewsbury Republican
Karyn E. Polito for the seat being vacated by Republican Matthew
Amorello of Grafton, who was running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _Incumbent freshman Democratic Senator Susan Fargo of Lincoln
being challenged by Concord Republican Thomas F. Healy. The
district had been represented for several years by Republicans
before Lucile P. Hicks of Wayland did not run for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Brighton Democrat Steven Tolman, a first-term state
representative, was expected to claim the Senate seat of his
brother, Warren, who was running for lieutenant governor with
Democrat Scott Harshbarger. Tolman was being challenged by
perennial Republican candidate Guy A. Carbone of Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, Democrats were pinning hopes of adding to
their domination of the chamber on Chelmsford selectmen chairman
William F. Dalton, a Democrat opposing veteran Republican incumbent
Carol C. Cleven of Chelmsford, and on the vacant Melrose seat.
</P>
<P>
   In Melrose, Democrat Michael E. Festa, a former alderman and
School Committee member, was expected to have a close race with
Republican Paul T. O'Neill, a former aide to Senator Richard R.
Tisei.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the handful of closely fought races, more than two out
of three state legislative seats were uncontested, with incumbents
or winners of the September Democratic primary facing a free ride
to office.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six of the 40 Senate seats had no contested race Tuesday,
as did 109 of the 160 House seats.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Republicans _ who are holding on by their fingernails
in both chambers _ were hoping to stanch the steady erosion of
their strength since the 1990 election that catapulted William F.
Weld to the governor's seat and took the GOP to a high-water mark
of 16 Senate seats. Republicans currently hold only 7 of 40 Senate
seats and only 29 of 160 House seats, leaving them far short of
votes to back up vetoes of legislative bills by Republican Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci.

CENTRAL AMERICA ATTEMPTS TO DIG OUT FROM BENEATH HURRICANE'S
DESTRUCTION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ With a tropical sun occasionally piercing
the dying clouds of a hurricane called Mitch, Central America on
Tuesday continued to dig out from beneath the storm's rubble,
recover bodies of its victims and struggle to aid those who
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch, which hovered off Honduras for much of last week and then
cut a deadly path across the impoverished waist of Central America
over the weekend, killed at least 7,000 people in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials say the storm claimed at least 5,000 lives in
that country alone, though the bodies of only a fraction of that
number have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, up to 2,400 people are feared dead, and 1,338
deaths have been confirmed. El Salvador has reported 222 deaths,
and Guatemala has confirmed 157. Mitch-related deaths also have
been reported in Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico and Jamaica. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; On Tuesday, after being downgraded to a tropical depression and
moving through Guatemala and southern Mexico, Mitch reignited into
a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico with sustained winds of 45
mph. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said it was moving
toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In a seemingly cruel twist of nature, the Cerro Negro volcano _
located about 22 miles from the site of a mudslide on Saturday that
killed up to 2,000 Nicaraguans _ began to erupt. No damage or
casualties were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Central America officials say they fear many of those reported
missing in the aftermath of Mitch _ some 11,000 people in Honduras
alone _ may, in fact, be dead. But Mitch's final human toll may
never be known.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims remain buried beneath tons of mud. Many have been
swept away by swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Entire sections of Central America remain cut off by flood
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that as much as 80 percent of Honduras' crops
_ which account for half the country's $4 billion annual economy _
have been destroyed. In Nicaragua, officials estimate that as much
as 30 percent of the country's income-generating coffee crop and a
huge proportion of its grain fields have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua on Tuesday, rescue teams burned many bodies where
they found them in an effort to prevent the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Nicaraguan victims died Saturday, when the
rain-filled crater of a dormant volcano burst its seams, unleashing
a mudslide a few miles wide and many feet high that obliterated
four villages. Only a handful of the 4,500 people who lived in
those villages have been found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have anywhere to run,'' a middle-aged man who
survived but lost his family to the mud told Nicaraguan television
from his hospital bed Tuesday. ``It was higher than our house. We
couldn't get anything out of the house. We couldn't save any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Nicaraguan officials have suggested that the site of the
mudslide, near the northwestern agricultural center of Chinandega
on the Pacific coast, should be left untouched as a ``national
cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch wreaked havoc on nearly every piece of Nicaragua _ one of
the poorest countries in the hemisphere, where the U.S. government
spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support a civil war
against the socialist Sandinista government throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population's situation is tragic,'' Alfonso Ortega Urbino,
Nicaragua's ambassador to the United Nations said at a New York
news conference broadcast on television here. He said his country
needs at least $50 million in immediate aid.
</P>
<P>
   At a telethon held Tuesday in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua
to collect money, food and clothing for storm victims, President
Ricardo Aleman announced that ``massive'' aid from the United
States and Latin American countries would begin arriving by plane
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguan Transportation Minister Jaime Bonilla said that
stormwaters had flooded 30 major highways across the country and
destroyed or damaged 42 bridges, making transportation in much of
the nation impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Roads leading to the city of Leon opened Tuesday. Bonilla said
roads to Chinandega, Matagalpa and other towns in the sodden north
would open Wednesday. ``We are doing everything possible,'' Bonilla
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastors of Prostestant churches along Nicaragua's isolated
Caribbean coast reported that the badly flooded Coco River, which
forms the border with Honduras, had cut off villages. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In one village, 1,200 people had been without food or water
since the weekend, one pastor announced at the Managua telethon. In
another, nearly 1,000 people had taken refuge from floodwaters in a
Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help these people,'' the minister implored, ``or their fate
will be on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help the flood victims, thousands of Managua
residents flocked to the gym of an elite Roman Catholic high
school, where Tuesday's telethon was held. People carried money,
medicine, bags of food, truckloads of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   During a long afternoon filled with countless pleas for help
from civic leaders, politicians and clergy, people donated more
than $500,000 in cash as well as tons of food and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguans _ often bitterly divided by social position,
religion and politics in the past _ came together for a common
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age children of Managua's wealthiest families worked
alongside residents of some of the city's grimmest slums, sorting
clothing and toting food and furniture to waiting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Women arrived in chauffeur-driven sports utility vehicles that
lined up behind cars on bald tires to drop off donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they needed volunteers, so we came,'' said Francisco
Javier Rojas, 17, one of a half dozen young men who came to the
telethon from a working-class neighborhood to help.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas and his friends, whose own neighborhood was flooded over
the weekend when Lake Managua surged over its banks, stayed busy
throughout the day loading heavy sacks of food onto trucks bound
for the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of uniformed boys from a Catholic prep school
carried the supplies to Rojas and the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you wouldn't see guys like us anywhere near a place
like this,'' Marlon Velasquez, a friend of Rojas, said. ``And you
wouldn't see guys like those doing anything that would make them
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicaragua is a country that has suffered a lot with war and
weather and every sort of disaster,'' Velasquez said. ``But we're
still here. And we have to work together.'' &QL;

YOSHII AND NOMO STATUS HOLDS UP METS' STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In theory, General Manager Steve Phillips has an
abundance of starting pitching to deal from in his search for help
in the New York Mets' outfield and at either second base or third
base. But Phillips still needs to decide how much he wants to work
out deals with Masato Yoshii and Hideo Nomo, all while he
negotiates with Armando Reynoso's representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter, Rick Reed, Bobby Jones and Willie Blair are all
signed. But as of Tuesday, Yoshii _ the team's fifth starter most
of last season _ was not. His agent, Don Nomura, said Tuesday that
the two sides had 12 days to reach an agreement or Yoshii would
become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura is looking for at least a two-year deal for Yoshii, but
would prefer three years. Nomura said the Mets were offering a deal
similar to the one Yoshii signed before last season _ a one-year
contract with a base salary of about $200,000, with incentives that
could increase the value of the deal to about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy's a proven big-league pitcher,'' Nomura said of
Yoshii, 33, who went 6-8 with an 3.93 earned run average in his
first major-league season, after pitching parts of 13 years in the
Japanese leagues. ``It was just that he was given no run support by
his offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets often said the same thing about Yoshii during the
season: that he pitched well enough to keep them in games, but that
he was never given much offense to work with. Phillips has
indicated that he would like to re-sign Yoshii as well as Reynoso,
who has already filed for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked several times,'' Nomura said of his discussions
with Phillips regarding Yoshii. ``And I expect we'll talk some more
in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Nomo, Nomura is basically playing a waiting game. Nomo
struggled for most of last season for both the Los Angeles Dodgers
and the Mets, finishing with a 6-12 record and a 4.92 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But Nomo's last outing of the year _ four scoreless innings in
Atlanta on the final day of the season in his first major-league
relief appearance _ left the Mets' pitching coach Bob Apodaca
scratching his head at the potential that was unrealized last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to wait until the 20th of December to see if
they renew him,'' Nomura said, meaning Nomo's contract. If the Mets
do so, then Nomo will in all likelihood file for salary
arbitration.

EDITORIAL: MALAYSIA ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 4:
</P>
<P>
   The trial of Anwar Ibrahim, which opened Monday in Malaysia, is
a battle for the future of Southeast Asia. Anwar, once Malaysia's
deputy prime minister and leader-in-waiting, faces four charges of
interfering with investigations of his alleged sexual misconduct.
More charges await him. They are all questionable. The more likely
reason for his arrest is that Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
worried by the fall of President Suharto in Indonesia, felt
threatened by Anwar's popularity and reform agenda. But Mahathir
has miscalculated. His attack on Anwar, the most important of a new
generation of Asian leaders, is fueling support for reformist ideas
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who is 51, has been arguing for an independent judiciary,
free media and laws to control corruption and nepotism, a program
that gained public support with Asia's economic crisis. Western
free-market liberals claim him as their own, but Anwar also has
great appeal at home. He was once a Muslim radical, and argues that
tolerance and democracy are not Western imports, but grow out of
Asian ideals and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Like Suharto, Mahathir brought his country steady growth but
also crony capitalism, a repressive Internal Security Act and a
subservient judiciary and media. He has now withdrawn Malaysia from
the world trading system and instituted capital controls, which
greatly concentrate control of the economy in his hands. Anwar's
opposition to such ideas may have provoked his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile outrages of Anwar's case, including his beating
in custody and the media's adherence to the Mahathir line, have
spurred the reform movement. Even though hundreds of protesters
have been arrested or clubbed, public demonstrations in Malaysia
are growing. Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, and the
Philippine president, Joseph Estrada, have criticized the arrest,
breaking a code of silence among Asian leaders about one another's
internal affairs. Estrada has said that such frankness should
extend to all issues. It is not yet clear whether the idea of
reform can spread to the more repressive nations in the region,
such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar. But reformist leaders may
now be more willing to press their neighbors to democratize.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia will be host to a Pacific economic summit meeting in
two weeks. President Clinton and other Asian leaders can make a
powerful statement by asking to see Anwar in jail, and visiting his
wife. Mahathir has kept power for 17 years by banning newspapers,
dismissing judges and purging opponents. He apparently thinks he
can buy himself a few more years with another purge. But this time
it may have made his country, and parts of the region, more
restless for change.

   Many victims remain buried beneath tons of mud. Many have been
swept away by swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Entire sections of Central America remain cut off by flood
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that as much as 80 percent of Honduras' crops
_ which account for half the country's $4 billion annual economy _
have been destroyed. In Nicaragua, officials estimate that as much
as 30 percent of the country's income-generating coffee crop and a
huge proportion of its grain fields have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua on Tuesday, rescue teams burned many bodies where
they found them in an effort to prevent the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Nicaraguan victims died Saturday, when the
rain-filled crater of a dormant volcano burst its seams, unleashing
a mudslide a few miles wide and many feet high that obliterated
four villages. Only a handful of the 4,500 people who lived in
those villages have been found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have anywhere to run,'' a middle-aged man who
survived but lost his family to the mud told Nicaraguan television
from his hospital bed Tuesday. ``It was higher than our house. We
couldn't get anything out of the house. We couldn't save any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Nicaraguan officials have suggested that the site of the
mudslide, near the northwestern agricultural center of Chinandega
on the Pacific coast, should be left untouched as a ``national
cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch wreaked havoc on nearly every piece of Nicaragua _ one of
the poorest countries in the hemisphere, where the U.S. government
spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support a civil war
against the socialist Sandinista government throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population's situation is tragic,'' Alfonso Ortega Urbino,
Nicaragua's ambassador to the United Nations said at a New York
news conference broadcast on television here. He said his country
needs at least $50 million in immediate aid.
</P>
<P>
   At a telethon held Tuesday in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua
to collect money, food and clothing for storm victims, President
Ricardo Aleman announced that ``massive'' aid from the United
States and Latin American countries would begin arriving by plane
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguan Transportation Minister Jaime Bonilla said that
stormwaters had flooded 30 major highways across the country and
destroyed or damaged 42 bridges, making transportation in much of
the nation impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Roads leading to the city of Leon opened Tuesday. Bonilla said
roads to Chinandega, Matagalpa and other towns in the sodden north
would open Wednesday. ``We are doing everything possible,'' Bonilla
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastors of Prostestant churches along Nicaragua's isolated
Caribbean coast reported that the badly flooded Coco River, which
forms the border with Honduras, had cut off villages. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In one village, 1,200 people had been without food or water
since the weekend, one pastor announced at the Managua telethon. In
another, nearly 1,000 people had taken refuge from floodwaters in a
Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help these people,'' the minister implored, ``or their fate
will be on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help the flood victims, thousands of Managua
residents flocked to the gym of an elite Roman Catholic high
school, where Tuesday's telethon was held. People carried money,
medicine, bags of food, truckloads of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   During a long afternoon filled with countless pleas for help
from civic leaders, politicians and clergy, people donated more
than $500,000 in cash as well as tons of food and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguans _ often bitterly divided by social position,
religion and politics in the past _ came together for a common
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age children of Managua's wealthiest families worked
alongside residents of some of the city's grimmest slums, sorting
clothing and toting food and furniture to waiting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Women arrived in chauffeur-driven sports utility vehicles that
lined up behind cars on bald tires to drop off donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they needed volunteers, so we came,'' said Francisco
Javier Rojas, 17, one of a half dozen young men who came to the
telethon from a working-class neighborhood to help.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas and his friends, whose own neighborhood was flooded over
the weekend when Lake Managua surged over its banks, stayed busy
throughout the day loading heavy sacks of food onto trucks bound
for the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of uniformed boys from a Catholic prep school
carried the supplies to Rojas and the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you wouldn't see guys like us anywhere near a place
like this,'' Marlon Velasquez, a friend of Rojas, said. ``And you
wouldn't see guys like those doing anything that would make them
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicaragua is a country that has suffered a lot with war and
weather and every sort of disaster,'' Velasquez said. ``But we're
still here. And we have to work together.'' &QL;

LOS ANGELES TIMES TO CUT WORK FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its advertising revenue falling short of projections and
three resource-intensive news initiatives just getting under way,
The Los Angeles Times announced Tuesday that it would cut its
6,400-member work force by 250 people, or nearly 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper is trying to return its staffing to the leaner
level of 1995, when it eliminated the equivalent of 700 full-time
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   High-margin help-wanted advertising, which accounts for more
than 16 percent of total advertising revenue, fell sharply in the
third quarter. This setback came as the paper, which is owned by
Times Mirror Co., was bringing out its Southern California Living
section, which started on Sunday, and its national edition, which
started Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 new positions have been added to the news
department this year for these ventures and for expanded business
and health coverage. About 50 jobs in the regional Ventura and
Valley editions _ about one-third of the total _ are now being
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those employees are expected to find jobs elsewhere in
the 1,100-member news department. Overall, 30 news employees will
leave the newspaper through a voluntary severance program, as will
20 in the operations department.
</P>
<P>
   Customer-service calls will be contracted to APAC Teleservices;
130 employees who did this work will be laid off. The remaining
layoffs will be scattered around the newspaper.

McBRIDE MAKES SPECIAL EFFORT FOR UCLA 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eighteen months ago, UCLA receiver-turned-safety
Tod McBride had surgery to repair small tears in both patella
tendons. But compared to being demoted _ he was replaced as the
starting strong safety 2{ weeks ago _ surgery was a stroll down
Bruin Walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts,'' said McBride, a senior from Walnut. ``There's not
a day I wake up and don't think about it. But I've got a lot of
pride in everything I do, and I'm trying to help the team any way I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride has become UCLA's best punt blocker, with two this
season and three in the last 12 games. Saturday, he rushed from the
left wing, fended off a Stanford blocker with one arm and slapped
Kevin Miller's punt with the other. UCLA recovered at the Cardinal
33 and scored its first touchdown on the ensuing play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bull rush,'' McBride said. ``I got enough
penetration to get close and block it.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride uses his natural aggression _ one of UCLA's most
physical players, he was chastised in training camp for hitting
during non-contact drills _ and receiver instincts to elude
blockers. He sets them up like cornerbacks, feigning a charge to
the left, for instance, then cutting right.
</P>
<P>
   Once past the blocker, McBride either goes for the block
(thereby risking a roughing-the-kicker penalty) or eases off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roughing is one of the worst penalties you can get,'' he said.
``It's a split-second decision. Usually, it's all a blur to me.
After the play, I look back and think, `Did I do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   If the punt's been blocked, he probably did.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State update: Second-year coach Mike Riley has abandoned
the wishbone offense (aka: Beaver Bone) and installed a 90s-style
passing attack. Directing the offense, for now, is redshirt
freshman quarterback Jon Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith threw for 380 yards !ital!in the second half of a failed
comeback at Washington two weeks ago. He replaced Terrance Bryant,
a junior college transfer who had started all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrance may come back on a rotation basis; we haven't
decided,'' Riley said. ``We got more plays downfield with Smith in
one game than we did all year. That's why Smith was in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Stat of the week: If the Bruins draw approximately 85,000 fans
for the USC game, they'll shatter the school single-season record
and win their first Pac-10 attendance title.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is averaging 70,117 fans through four games. The school
record is 69,812, set in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Washington leads the league with 71,149 per game. The Huskies
have one game left at 72,500-seat Husky Stadium, UCLA on Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Short stuff: Tight end Mike Grieb, safety Larry Atkins and
McBride (special teams) were named UCLA's players of the game for
Stanford. Atkins forced one fumble and recovered two. Grieb had two
catches.... Guard Andy Meyers and fullback Craig Walendy will join
quarterback Cade McNown and Atkins as captains this week....
Saturday's game will be televised on Fox Sports West.... Kickoff
for the Washington and USC games, Nov. 14 and 21, respectively, is
12:30 p.m.

LEAGUE OFFICIAL CALLS TALKS `DEAD IN THE WATER'  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a week of bargaining and optimism, the two
sides in the National Basketball Association's labor dispute are
now faced with a sobering obstacle: they can't agree on the
mechanics of a basic economic issue, a development that may soon
lead to canceling more games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we appear to be dead in the water,'' the league's
deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, said Tuesday night. ``Maybe
something will happen tomorrow to put some wind back in the sails.
But after Billy's comments on Monday, we seem to have a long way to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik was referring to the union's executive director, Billy
Hunter, who after a meeting between lawyers from the two sides
indicated that the owners and players were ``far apart'' from
reaching a compromise and belatedly starting the season. He said
his gut feeling was that the season would begin in January.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter informed league officials on Monday that a full union
bargaining team, comprising 15 to 20 players, would not be coming
to New York for a hoped-for meeting. Instead, internal negotiating
teams will meet at a midtown law firm Wednesday morning with the
intention of trying to work out details of a proposed escrow
system.
</P>
<P>
   That plan would go into effect after two or three years of using
a luxury-tax system to curb salaries. In those escrow plan years,
the sides would figure out at the end of each season how much
revenue was devoted to player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   If a target number was exceeded, part of the escrow money would
go all the 29 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the owners nor the players would divulge details, but it
appears that the issue has killed any progress toward agreement on
a mechanism to divide revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without going into specifics, the NBA just dug in, and they
want more,'' Hunter said. ``They're not satisfied with the
concessions we've made. The more I put out there, the sweeter the
deal gets for them. That's what this is about right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue is total revenue distribution; the players want
to earn 60 percent of basketball-related income while the owners
are offering a 50-50 share.
</P>
<P>
   After an unproductive exchange Monday over how an escrow system
would work, the two sides are concerned that talks may break off
soon after they start Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we were getting somewhere, but right now we are
back to square one,'' Granik said.

MCCALL RE-ELECTED AS NEW YORK STATE COMPTROLLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ H. Carl McCall, who climbed from an impoverished
childhood to become the first black candidate elected to statewide
office in New York, easily won re-election Tuesday to a second term
as state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, a 63-year-old Democrat, handily dispatched a challenge
by Bruce Blakeman, a Republican who is majority leader of the
Nassau County Legislature. McCall was first appointed to the
Comptroller's post to fill a vacancy in 1993 and won a full term in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, McCall won a tight race against Herbert London,
a New York University professor, surviving the Republican tide that
lifted George Pataki to the State House. This year, McCall scared
off potential challengers by amassing more than $5 million in
campaign money and he did not face serious opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman, a 43-year-old lawyer who has been majority leader of
the Nassau County Legislature since it was created in 1995, was
selected to run against McCall during a telephone conference call
among state Republican Party leaders last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller is the sole trustee of the state pension fund,
which is worth about $100 billion and is one of the single largest
pools of capital in the nation. McCall collected millions in
campaign contributions from lawyers, real estate advisers and
investment companies that do business with his office.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions do not violate state campaign finance laws.
Still, Blakeman sought to make criticism of them the thrust of his
bid for office. Polls, however, consistently showed McCall ahead by
about 30 points, and the race received little attention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, similar questions were raised about the
fund-raising of prominent Republicans, including Gov. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   In the final week, McCall's campaign spent $3.8 million on
advertising and kept up a busy schedule of events.
</P>
<P>
   McCall had considered running against Pataki this year but was
dissuaded by the governor's own aggressive fund-raising. By August
1997, Pataki had raised more than $9 million and McCall, saying he
was content in his job as comptroller, announced he would seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   At campaign stops, McCall repeatedly trumpeted his success in
directing the investments of the pension fund, noting that under
his stewardship the fund had nearly doubled to more than $100
billion from $56 billion. He also described his conducting of
various audits of state and local agencies, and said the audits had
benefited the state on many issues, like education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Blakeman pushed his close ties to Republican officials including
Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and on the
campaign trail he suggested that McCall, as a Democrat, could not
be as effective with the Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, on his part, paid scant attention to his opponent and
rarely, if ever, mentioned him.

DEMOCRATS WIN SOME, BUT REPUBLICANS KEEP CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the control of Congress and President Clinton's impeachment
fate hanging in the balance, scandal-weary voters Tuesdaygave
Democrats some key victories Tuesday, but were expected to reelect
most incumbents in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, scene of the most expensive and perhaps nastiest
Senate race, Democratic Representative Charles E. Schumer beat
Republican Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, according to
television network projections.
</P>
<P>
   And in the South, Democrats cheered two early key Senate
victories in a region where Republicans had hoped voters would back
the GOP, partly out of disgust with Clinton's sex scandal. In South
Carolina, Senator Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings defeated Republican
Representative Bob Inglis, and in North Carolina, Republican
Senator Lauch Faircloth was defeated by Democrat John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also picked up at least two Southern governorships, in
South Carolina and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Democratic victories in widely watched races, the
bottom line was that Republicans were expected to win most
campaigns for reelection and retain control of the Senate and
House.
</P>
<P>
   Still, exit polls conducted by Voter News Service for five
television networks and the Associated Press raised serious
questions about the GOP decision to spend $10 million last week on
ads in 68 key districts that highlighted Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls found that only one in 20 voters thought the
president's relationship with the former White House intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky, was the most important issue. About 60 percent of
those surveyed said they disapproved of the way Congress has
handled the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the most closely watched Senate races went down to
the wire, with Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and
Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois in close races.
</P>
<P>
   In a final round of campaigning, Democrats concentrated on core
constituencies including minorities, women, and senior citizens,
while Republicans appealed to suburban and rural voters,
particularly conservatives and males.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the election, Republicans controlled the House 228 to
206, and the Senate 55 to 45. Democrats were hoping that a strong
showing would give them enough power, when combined with some
moderate Republicans, to prevent Clinton's impeachment and to have
more input into the congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The election was notable for the success of political family
legacies. Two sons of former President Bush were expected to, and
did, win their elections for governor, George W. Bush in Texas and
Jeb Bush in Florida. That could set up a powerful electoral
combination in advance of George W. Bush's possible presidential
bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, meanwhile, Democrat Evan Bayh, the son of former
Senator Birch Bayh, was projected by the television networks to be
elected senator, picking up a seat now held by Republican Senator
Dan Coats.
</P>
<P>
   But polls taken in the closing days of the campaign found that
the impeachment issue had little impact in most races, with some
analysts expecting a backlash against Republicans for focusing on
the issue. If there is a consensus that a backlash developed, that
could hurt House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who reportedly endorsed the
ad campaign and who is up for reelection as speaker when the newly
elected Republican caucus convenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was widely expected that the election would be
interpreted as a vote for the status quo, with only slight shifts
in the makeup of the Senate, House, and governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans entered Election Day with a huge financial
advantage, with the three GOP national committees having raised 73
percent more money than their Democratic counterparts between Jan.
1, 1997, and Oct. 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Corrado, a government professor at Maine's Colby
College, said the election will be remembered for the way so much
money was poured into a relatively small number of races, with
incumbents getting most of the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In over half of the congressional races, we had challengers
outspent by incumbents by margins of at least 10 to one,'' Corrado
said. ``So essentially they didn't have the minimal amounts needed
to run a viable campaign. We had 30 to 40 races around the country
that were considered the key races which were the focus of tens of
millions of dollars in spending, both in terms of the money raised
by candidates and the money flooded in by outside interest groups
and the national parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The money factor became the prime issue in the reelection bid of
Democratic Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, the cosponsor of
a measure to ban unregulated and unlimited contributions of soft
money. As a result, the race between Feingold and Republican
Representative Mark Neumann was viewed as a referendum on campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties were closely watching turnout, which analysts
predicted would be between 36 percent to 38 percent. A slightly
higher turnout, and especially one heavy with senior citizens,
would tend to favor the Democrats, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a relatively small number of congressional races were
considered highly competitive. Of the 435 House races, incumbents
were running for reelection in 402, and nearly all were likely to
be reelected, analysts said. Fifty-six Republicans and 39 Democrats
in the House had no opposition except for some third-party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate contests, about eight were considered too close
to call at the end of the campaign. One of the closest races was in
Kentucky, where Republican Representative Jim Bunning, a baseball
Hall of Fame pitcher, faced Democratic Representative Scott
Baesler, a former University of Kentucky basketball star. While
Bunning was favored early in the race, he may have suffered a
backlash from his harsh advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the national attention was focused on the races
for Congress, many of the most important and interesting races were
for the governorships, back in the state capitals, where the
day-to-day work of education and welfare reform is actually done.
Of the 36 governorships up for election Tuesday, 24 were held by
Republicans, including most of the nation's largest 10 states,
prompting GOP loyalists to constantly refer to the mantra that 75
percent of the population live in a state with a Republican
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Democratic state Representative Jim Hodges
defeated Republican Governor David M. Beasley, who had presided
over a strong economy but had no effective proposal to counter
Hodges's plan for a state lottery to fund wholesale education
reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman also
pushed a state lottery proposal to finance his education reforms,
and defeated incumbent Republican Governor Fob James Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Still, popular Republican governors won in many of the nation's
largest states, besides the Bush victories in Texas and Florida.
Republican incumbents won in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Arkansas, and Tennessee, according to early
projections. In Nebraska, an open seat relinquished by a Democrat,
Lincoln Mayor Mike Johanns, a Republican, efeated Democratic
businessman Bill Hoppner.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republican Governor George S. Pataki also coasted
to an easy reelection over Democratic New York City Councilor Peter
Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton sex scandal was not given a high priority by
voters, about 20 percent of those surveyed in exit polls said moral
and ethical standards were the top matter in selecting House
candidates. An equal percentage said that the most important issue
in the election was education.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, voters expressed approval of the nation's direction and
Clinton's job performance, a trend that usually helps the incumbent
party. Analysts expected that would result in a continuation of
divided power in Washington, with a Democrat in the White House and
Republicans controlling Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Tuesday night told reporters earlier in the day that he
felt good about Democratic prospects on the sixth anniversary of
his election as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is a referendum on all the hopes of the
American people for the future and their assessment of the present
condition, and how we get from here to a better tomorrow,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   While pundits predicted that the election results would
determine the fate of his presidency, the president sounded
content.

   ``It is my sixth anniversary, isn't it?'' Clinton said. ``They
have been six very good years _ very good years for our country.
Even the bad days are good. It's an honor to serve, and my
gratitude today is immense to the American people for giving me two
chances to do this.''

ROWLAND IS RE-ELECTED GOVERNOR IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut, a
Republican, rode an economic recovery and a listless opposition to
win re-election Tuesday, defeating U.S. Rep. Barbara Kennelly
throughout the state, including her own congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who has become more moderate with each year in
office, wanted to use his victory speech to reach across party
lines. ``We are fiscally conservative, but we are aggressively
inclusive,'' he said in prepared remarks. ``There's room in our
tent for anyone who wants to work with us to make Connecticut a
better place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the overwhelming result was a mandate to continue
pursuing his agenda of lower taxes and less government. ``The
outcome of this election has nothing to do with anything
Congresswoman Kennelly did wrong,'' he said. ``The outcome of this
election is a testament to what we've done right for the last four
years. The best campaign ad is job performance.''
</P>
<P>
   After less than 10 percent of the vote had been counted, Mrs.
Kennelly conceded the race. She drew cheers speaking to supporters
at the Arch Street Tavern in her hometown of Hartford when she
referred to the more moderate stands that Rowland took during the
campaign, and urged him to remain the governor he had been for the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Rowland,'' she said, ``you promised in your campaign
that you would put education as a priority. You promised that open
land was important to you. You promised all the things I've lived
for. And I say to you, governor: Keep those promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the first time since 1944 that Connecticut
re-elected a Republican governor. The breadth of Rowland's victory
was especially impressive because Connecticut had historically
voted Democratic. Now, 40 percent of the state's registered voters
are unaffiliated, 35 percent are Democrats and 25 percent are
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   With poll after poll showing Rowland swamping Mrs. Kennelly, the
campaign had all but disappeared from public view in recent weeks,
as Rowland tried to sit on his lead and Mrs. Kennelly sought to
avoid questions about her lackluster campaign. As Rowland voted at
a Hartford school on Tuesday, groups of supporters for the two
candidates began chanting and elections officers struggled to
separate them. ``This is the most activity we've had in a year,''
he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who at 41 is the nation's youngest governor, is a
schmoozer who thrives under the television lights. Mrs. Kennelly,
62, did not seem comfortable with the demands of a modern campaign,
and admitted frankly that she preferred the comfort of Capitol
Hill, where she has represented the 1st District for eight terms.
Her district, which encompasses Greater Hartford, joined the state
in voting overwhelmingly for Rowland.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As she conceded, Mrs. Kennelly alternately smiled and looked
grave as she thanked her family and listed the issues that she said
caused her to embark on such an uphill journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered it a privilege for being allowed to be the
standard bearer of the Democratic party,'' she said. ``A real
privilege. And I tried to do the best job possible, and I tried to
speak for the families of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought the issues into the light, where they belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats once had great hope for Mrs. Kennelly, who is a
daughter of John Bailey, a former Democratic National Committee
chairman, and is the widow of James Kennelly, a former speaker of
the state House of Representatives. So much suspense had built up
about her potential run that in September 1997, she made her
announcement by calling a news conference at the Old State House
and tearing aside the shroud on a royal-blue sign that said simply,
``Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of trouble appeared quickly, though, as even Democratic
audiences found Mrs. Kennelly to be an uninspiring and confusing
speaker. A small but powerful group of Democratic leaders had
convinced her to run, then did little to help her as her campaign
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, whose own polls had shown him to be vulnerable on
education and other issues just a year ago, used this winter's
session of the state Legislature to methodically saw planks off
Mrs. Kennelly's platform. He began advertising on television in
January, building a rosy reputation, while Mrs. Kennelly stayed off
the campaign trail, saying she was raising money. The icing on
Rowland's cake was an income-tax rebate that began arriving in
mailboxes in July, helping to salve voter anger at his failure to
win repeal of the state income tax, which was the signature promise
of his 1994 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign was notable for the dearth of promises or
attacks. Rowland talked up the recovering economy, which he called
``the Connecticut comeback,'' and said he would continue to push
for tax cuts, but offered few specifics. He said his main mission
in his second term would be to revitalize the struggling cores of
the state's biggest cities, but even that amounts to monitoring and
promoting projects that have already begun.
</P>
<P>
   At various times, Mrs. Kennelly promoted a plan to reign in
health-maintenance organizations; a 10 percent cut in property
taxes, and a college scholarship for youngsters who get top grades
in high school.

REPUBLICAN HOLD MAJORITY, BUT DEMOCRATS PICK UP HOUSE SEATS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans held their majority in Congress
Tuesday, but early returns indicated that the Democrats might add a
few seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Voters appeared to favor incumbents over challengers for the
most part and Democrats over Republicans in some key areas of the
country where House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., had predicted
solid GOP victories. A few weeks ago Republicans had predicted a
gain of 20 to 40 seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged by the turnout,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio of
California, chairman of the Democratic conference in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republicans likely would be held to a modest gain in
the House, thanks to a larger than expected voter turnout, setting
up chance for the Democrats to retake control of Congress in the
2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great ramp-up to the year 2000,'' a delighted Fazio
said on CNN. He said a majority for the Democrats would be ``very
attainable in the next presidential election.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, who heads the Republican conference
in the House, continued to predict that Republicans would add at
least 12 more seats to their 228 majority when all the votes are
tallied.
</P>
<P>
   But even a dozen new members would still be a disappointment for
Republican leaders who had hoped that the Monica Lewinsky scandal
would help drive voters to their party. In fact, early exit polls
Tuesday showed that about one in 20 voters listed the president's
relationship with the young woman as a deciding factor in how they
voted. Most ranked the candidates' positions on education, the
economy and Social Security as more important than the Lewinsky
matter, although they indicated that ethics and morals do matter in
their political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press also reported that six out of 10 people
questioned after they voted said they did not approve of the way
the Republican leadership in Congress had handled the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going exactly how Republicans had hoped,''
former Gingrich press secretary Tony Blankley said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is we're beating the spread,'' added former White
House Press Secretary Mike McCurry of the Democrats' showing.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, casting his ballot Tuesday in his home district of
Marietta, Ga., where he was re-elected to an 11th term, said he was
still confident despite the early exit polls that the election
represented the ``ongoing, slow-motion collapse of the Democratic
majority that Franklin Roosevelt created.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no intrigue, we're going to win an election today,''
Gingrich said, fighting off questions about whether GOP gains would
fall short of his earlier predictions.
</P>
<P>
   All together there were 94 incumbent House members _ 39
Democrats and 55 Republicans _ running for re-election this year
unopposed. But there were plenty of other members who were forced
to spend money fending off challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Among the early winners was Republican Rep. Dan Burton, of
Indiana, who once called Clinton a ``scumbag'' and is leading an
investigation into Democratic campaign finance matters.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, the Republican Ernie Fletcher won an open
Democratic seat, but a short while later Democrat Ken Lucas picked
up an open seat left vacated by Republicans. The GOP had predicted
that it would win both those seats with little problem.
</P>
<P>
   In another hard-fought Kentucky contest, Republican Rep. Anne
Northup was ahead of her Democratic challenger Chris Gorman in
early returns.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the Republicans lost an effort to defeat incumbent
Rep. Julia Carson, D-Ind. Carson had been targeted by Republicans
as one of the most vulnerable Democrats this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, early polling reports showed that incumbents likely
would retain their seats, leaving the delegation's current makeup
of 17 Democrats and 13 Republicans intact.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped to knock off conservative Democrat Charles
Stenholm in the 17th District of West Central Texas. But in early
returns, Stenholm was ahead of GOP challenger Rudy Izzard.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, in mid-presidential term elections the party with
control of the White House ends up losing at least two dozen or
more seats in the House. That's one reason the GOP had predicted
such big gains.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain what happened, House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Irving, said as returns were still coming in that it was
``too early'' for Republicans to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long night. When it's all over we're going to have more
Republicans in the House, more Republicans in the Senate,'' he said
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in proclaiming his re-election victory, also noted
that despite GOP shortfalls, Republicans had still come out on top
for the third election in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first time in 70 years that Republicans kept
control of the House for a third term,'' he told supporters. &QL;

JAMES DAY, 73, BATTLE OF OKINAWA HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Hawaii)  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James L. Day, a former Marine Corps squad leader who belatedly
won a Medal of Honor earlier this year for almost single-handedly
killing more than 100 advancing Japanese at the height of the
battle for Okinawa, and went on to become an unofficial ambassador
of good will on the island, died on Oct. 28 at his home in
Cathedral City, Calif. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Day did not receive the medal until President Clinton presented
it to him last January at a White House ceremony, because most of
the men who witnessed his gallantry were soon killed in another
action.
</P>
<P>
   There were snags as well. Over the years, paperwork got lost,
then discovered and then lost again.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1995, statements from eight witnesses were assembled
telling how Day, who retired from the Marine Corps as a major
general, repelled enemy attacks by hurling hand grenades and
blazing away with his carbine and a light machine gun. All this
despite suffering white phosphorus burns over much of his body
(from friendly fire) and fragmentation wounds on his hands when his
machine gun overheated and exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Some waves of enemy infantry consisted of as many as 40 men,
according to the citation, and nearly a dozen of them came to
within a few feet of Day's fox hole.
</P>
<P>
   After being knocked unconscious by an artillery shell, Day was
found surrounded by the bodies of the more than 100 Japanese
infantrymen he had killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was really no good reason for me to fall back,'' he said
in an interview. ``I expected help to come at any time. It just
never came, so I kept doing what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The action took place on May 14 and 15, 1945. Day was then a
member of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Marines, 6th Division, which bore
the brunt of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for Okinawa, which began on Easter Sunday, was not
only the last but also one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific
war. U.S. and Japanese commanders recognized that the island, only
350 miles south of the nearest of the Japanese home islands, was
the final barrier to an invasion of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In 81 days of intense fighting, with a sharp increase in the use
of kamikaze aircraft, U.S. losses came to 12,500. The Japanese
death toll rose to 120,000, and more than 150,000 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   Day returned to Okinawa in 1984 as commanding general of U.S.
Marine Corps bases in the Far East with headquarters in Okinawa. On
that tour, he said, he became aware of how little Okinawan cultural
property had survived.
</P>
<P>
   Since his discharge in 1986, he played a major role in returning
more than 130 works of art and artifacts that had been removed by
Americans during and after the war.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most important recoveries came in 1991, when Day
secured approval for the return of a 15th-century temple bell
seized by Marines on Okinawa in June 1945; for the next 45 years,
it was exhibited as a war trophy at the Virginia Military Institute
in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Day was praised for his efforts to recover lost Okinawan
cultural property by Shizuo Kishaba, president of the Ryuku-America
Historical Research Society in Okinawa who flew from Japan to
California to attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture was in danger of being erased from the earth,''
Kishaba said. ``General Day spared us that fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Day is survived by his wife, Sally; a daughter, Gayle Eustice,
of Barstow, Calif.; and three sons, Bill, of Atlanta, Jim, of
Honolulu, and Matt, of San Diego.

ELECTION RESULTS SET STAGE FOR POSSIBLE GORE-BUSH CLASH IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 A News Analysis   
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Tuesday's election out of the way, potential
presidential candidates will now begin publicly declaring their
long-whispered candidacies for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The flood gates will have to open wide to accommodate a large
troupe of White House aspirants lining up for the first
presidential election without an incumbent since Ronald Reagan
retired in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the would-be contenders, Vice President Al Gore and
Texas GOP Gov. George Bush came out of the Tuesday results headed
for a showdown for the White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore benefited as much as President Clinton from the
Republicans' failure to roll up big gains in the House and light a
fire under the House impeachment investigation. With Clinton
stronger, it is less likely that Gore would face a divisive
Democratic primary challenger for the party's nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the eldest son of former President George Bush, emerged
strong by demonstrating a stunning appeal to traditionally
Democratic Hispanic voters in his landslide victory for a second
term as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush boosted his share of the Hispanic vote from 28 percent in
1994 to 46 percent in 1998 _ a staggering 64 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with a matching gubernatorial victory by his brother Jeb
Bush in Florida, the Texas governor can look to Hispanic voters in
2000 to potentially help sway the outcome in California, Texas,
Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and New York _ states with large
Hispanic populations that control 67 percent of the 270 electoral
votes needed to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The latest national survey pitting Gore against Bush, completed
on Oct. 25, showed Bush leading Gore, 57 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore wins the Democratic nomination in 2000, he faces long
odds historically: Only one of the last three vice presidents to
seek the presidency has succeeded _ Vice President George Bush in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush can take solace from history: Sixteen governors have
served as president, including three of the last four presidents _
Clinton, from Arkansas; Ronald Reagan from California; and Jimmy
Carter from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls already showed Gore, 51, a former Tennessee
senator and defeated 1988 presidential primary candidate, holding a
wide lead over his closest Democratic rivals.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Wall Street Journal survey in mid-September, Gore
draws 51 percent compared to 12 percent each for House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and former Sen. Bill Bradley,
D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats vowing to declare their intentions include: Gore,
Gephardt, Bradley, Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., and Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Bush emerges from his victory in Texas with polls showing a wide
lead over prospective rivals for the Republican nomination, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans expected to announce their plans in coming months
include Bush; Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.; former GOP vice
presidential candidate Jack Kemp; former Vice President Dan Quayle,
former 1996 GOP presidential primary candidate Malcolm ``Steve''
Forbes Jr.; former Tennessee GOP Gov. Lamar Alexander; former GOP
Cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole; conservative Republican Gary Bauer,
a domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan; two-time GOP
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan; Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.;
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn.; outgoing California Gov. Pete Wilson.

<P>
   Apparent setbacks for Republicans in the House spelled immediate
trouble for the presidential prospects of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., the mastermind of the GOP's historic 1994 takeover
of the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the mid-term election results show the
electorate turned off by Republican efforts to exploit Clinton's
sex scandal, some GOP presidential aspirants appear to have landed
on the wrong side of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Both Quayle, the former Indiana senator who joined Bush on the
GOP ticket in 1988, and Ashcroft have sought to exploit the Clinton
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-term contests gave both Democratic and Republican
contenders for their party's presidential nominations ample
opportunity to gain political debts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, a two-time Democratic
presidential primary candidate, emerged from Tuesday's midterm
congressional elections as a stronger force in the Democratic
party.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's Chicago-based Operation PUSH help turn out black
voters who voted Democratic by margins in excess of 80 percent,
helping to tilt key races including the re-election of Sen. Carol
Moseley-Braun, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' inability to gain traction with the impeachment
issue also may strengthen the presidential prospects of House
Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio. He made it a point
of working on budget issues rather than getting enmeshed in the
political firestorms of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results also buoyed the vice presidential fortunes of
a variety of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Ohio Gov. George Voinovich won his bid to
fill the Senate seat of retiring Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio. New York
Gov. George Pataki scored a landslide for a second term; Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy Thompson swamped his opponent to win a fourth term;
Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating won a second term.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Indiana Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh won a
Senate seat from his traditionally GOP state, raising the
possibility of a national role in 2000 for the son of former Sen.
Birch Bayh, D-Ind., a Democratic presidential candidate in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The low turnout in Tuesday's nationwide election is expected to
bolster claims by political outsiders that the nation's traditional
politicians are turning off the electorate. The results may help
revive the populist-oriented campaigns of Buchanan or independent
Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire who competed unsuccessfully for the
presidency in 1992 and 1996.

BUSH WINS IN TEXAS LANDSLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a race overshadowed by the future, Gov.
George W. Bush on Tuesday crushed Democrat Garry Mauro in a
landslide victory that surpassed the Republican's own expectations
and may set the stage for a presidential run in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In early returns, the incumbent won 68 percent of the vote to
become the first Texas governor elected to consecutive four-year
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Bush's presidential plans were pervasive during
the election. While the son of former President Bush said he was
interested in the presidency, he said he would not make up his mind
about running until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's brother, Jeb, was elected governor Florida
after an unsuccessful bid for the office in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided victory over Mauro surpassed the governor's own
hope of winning 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush won about 46 percent of the Hispanic
vote, a record for a Texas Republican. In the 1994 race, Bush won
24 percent of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored,'' Bush said of the Hispanic vote as he watched
early returns at a downtown hotel. ``This is a big vote, and I'm
working hard to earn the respect of los Espanos.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had campaigned hard this time among Hispanics, which was
seen by some as a test of his ability to reach out to
non-traditional Republican voters should he decide to run for
president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the governor tried to stay focused on his re-election
campaign, he was hounded with questions about whether he would run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation generated a crush of state, national and
international media attention. And Tuesday was no different, with
an astonishing 275 reporters and photographers covering the
election night rally at the downtown convention center in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the day in Austin voting, jogging and getting ready
for an evening victory rally.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, a four-term Texas Land Commissioner, hit the campaign
trail one last time, making stops in Waco, Dallas and San Antonio
before returning to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The race never was close, but the two men campaigned as if it
were up until the closing days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, outdistanced Mauro, 50, in the polls and in
fund-raising from the start. By the end of the campaign, Bush had
raised $17.2 million, compared to $4.8 million for Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Because of problems raising cash, Mauro hit the streets early,
embarking on a grassroots campaign of knocking on doors across
Texas. He aired television commercials for a brief period early in
an attempt to raise his name recognition, but he didn't have enough
money to go back on television until the final days of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the final week, the two candidates criss-crossed the state
stumping for votes and encouraging people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's platform included plans to end the practice of passing
failing students, cutting local school property taxes by $2 billion
and eliminating the sales tax on over-the-counter drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro wanted to give all teachers in the state a $6,000-per-year
pay raise; eliminate the sales tax on cars, trucks and vans; and
put 10,000 more police officers on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro sought to portray Bush as a popular governor with a famous
family but also a politician who was out of touch with Texans. He
insisted he would win because he was ``right'' on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigned across Texas, Mauro noted that polls for the
governor's race had been wrong before, and he predicted they would
be wrong again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so far behind in the polls,'' Mauro said Tuesday in
San Antonio. He added he thought a barrage of television
commercials he aired the final weekend in Houston and Dallas would
``give me a little punch.''
</P>
<P>
   Skies were mostly sunny across Texas on Election Day, but
Secretary of State Al Gonzales predicted a low turnout of between
3.3 million and 3.6 million voters, down from the 4.4 million
Texans who voted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He attributed the low early turnout primarily to a lack of voter
interest and recent weather disasters in some parts of Texas.

DEMOCRATS WIN SOME, BUT REPUBLICANS KEEP CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   With the control of Congress and President Clinton's impeachment
fate hanging in the balance, scandal-weary voters Tuesdaygave
Democrats some key victories Tuesday, but were expected to reelect
most incumbents in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, scene of the most expensive and perhaps nastiest
Senate race, Democratic Representative Charles E. Schumer beat
Republican Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, according to
television network projections.
</P>
<P>
   And in the South, Democrats cheered two early key Senate
victories in a region where Republicans had hoped voters would back
the GOP, partly out of disgust with Clinton's sex scandal. In South
Carolina, Senator Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings defeated Republican
Representative Bob Inglis, and in North Carolina, Republican
Senator Lauch Faircloth was defeated by Democrat John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also picked up at least two Southern governorships, in
South Carolina and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Democratic victories in widely watched races, the
bottom line was that Republicans were expected to win most
campaigns for reelection and retain control of the Senate and
House.
</P>
<P>
   Still, exit polls conducted by Voter News Service for five
television networks and the Associated Press raised serious
questions about the GOP decision to spend $10 million last week on
ads in 68 key districts that highlighted Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls found that only one in 20 voters thought the
president's relationship with the former White House intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky, was the most important issue. About 60 percent of
those surveyed said they disapproved of the way Congress has
handled the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the most closely watched Senate races went down to
the wire, with Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer of California and
Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois in close races.
</P>
<P>
   In a final round of campaigning, Democrats concentrated on core
constituencies including minorities, women, and senior citizens,
while Republicans appealed to suburban and rural voters,
particularly conservatives and males.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the election, Republicans controlled the House 228 to
206, and the Senate 55 to 45. Democrats were hoping that a strong
showing would give them enough power, when combined with some
moderate Republicans, to prevent Clinton's impeachment and to have
more input into the congressional agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The election was notable for the success of political family
legacies. Two sons of former President Bush were expected to, and
did, win their elections for governor, George W. Bush in Texas and
Jeb Bush in Florida. That could set up a powerful electoral
combination in advance of George W. Bush's possible presidential
bid in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, meanwhile, Democrat Evan Bayh, the son of former
Senator Birch Bayh, was projected by the television networks to be
elected senator, picking up a seat now held by Republican Senator
Dan Coats.
</P>
<P>
   But polls taken in the closing days of the campaign found that
the impeachment issue had little impact in most races, with some
analysts expecting a backlash against Republicans for focusing on
the issue. If there is a consensus that a backlash developed, that
could hurt House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who reportedly endorsed the
ad campaign and who is up for reelection as speaker when the newly
elected Republican caucus convenes.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was widely expected that the election would be
interpreted as a vote for the status quo, with only slight shifts
in the makeup of the Senate, House, and governorships.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans entered Election Day with a huge financial
advantage, with the three GOP national committees having raised 73
percent more money than their Democratic counterparts between Jan.
1, 1997, and Oct. 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Corrado, a government professor at Maine's Colby
College, said the election will be remembered for the way so much
money was poured into a relatively small number of races, with
incumbents getting most of the advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In over half of the congressional races, we had challengers
outspent by incumbents by margins of at least 10 to one,'' Corrado
said. ``So essentially they didn't have the minimal amounts needed
to run a viable campaign. We had 30 to 40 races around the country
that were considered the key races which were the focus of tens of
millions of dollars in spending, both in terms of the money raised
by candidates and the money flooded in by outside interest groups
and the national parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The money factor became the prime issue in the reelection bid of
Democratic Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, the cosponsor of
a measure to ban unregulated and unlimited contributions of soft
money. As a result, the race between Feingold and Republican
Representative Mark Neumann was viewed as a referendum on campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties were closely watching turnout, which analysts
predicted would be between 36 percent to 38 percent. A slightly
higher turnout, and especially one heavy with senior citizens,
would tend to favor the Democrats, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a relatively small number of congressional races were
considered highly competitive. Of the 435 House races, incumbents
were running for reelection in 402, and nearly all were likely to
be reelected, analysts said. Fifty-six Republicans and 39 Democrats
in the House had no opposition except for some third-party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate contests, about eight were considered too close
to call at the end of the campaign. One of the closest races was in
Kentucky, where Republican Representative Jim Bunning, a baseball
Hall of Fame pitcher, faced Democratic Representative Scott
Baesler, a former University of Kentucky basketball star. While
Bunning was favored early in the race, he may have suffered a
backlash from his harsh advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the national attention was focused on the races
for Congress, many of the most important and interesting races were
for the governorships, back in the state capitals, where the
day-to-day work of education and welfare reform is actually done.
Of the 36 governorships up for election Tuesday, 24 were held by
Republicans, including most of the nation's largest 10 states,
prompting GOP loyalists to constantly refer to the mantra that 75
percent of the population live in a state with a Republican
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Democratic state Representative Jim Hodges
defeated Republican Governor David M. Beasley, who had presided
over a strong economy but had no effective proposal to counter
Hodges's plan for a state lottery to fund wholesale education
reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman also
pushed a state lottery proposal to finance his education reforms,
and defeated incumbent Republican Governor Fob James Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Still, popular Republican governors won in many of the nation's
largest states, besides the Bush victories in Texas and Florida.
Republican incumbents won in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Arkansas, and Tennessee, according to early
projections. In Nebraska, an open seat relinquished by a Democrat,
Lincoln Mayor Mike Johanns, a Republican, efeated Democratic
businessman Bill Hoppner.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Republican Governor George S. Pataki also coasted
to an easy reelection over Democratic New York City Councilor Peter
Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton sex scandal was not given a high priority by
voters, about 20 percent of those surveyed in exit polls said moral
and ethical standards were the top matter in selecting House
candidates. An equal percentage said that the most important issue
in the election was education.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, voters expressed approval of the nation's direction and
Clinton's job performance, a trend that usually helps the incumbent
party. Analysts expected that would result in a continuation of
divided power in Washington, with a Democrat in the White House and
Republicans controlling Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Tuesday night told reporters earlier in the day that he
felt good about Democratic prospects on the sixth anniversary of
his election as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is a referendum on all the hopes of the
American people for the future and their assessment of the present
condition, and how we get from here to a better tomorrow,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   While pundits predicted that the election results would
determine the fate of his presidency, the president sounded
content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my sixth anniversary, isn't it?'' Clinton said. ``They
have been six very good years _ very good years for our country.
Even the bad days are good. It's an honor to serve, and my
gratitude today is immense to the American people for giving me two
chances to do this.''

A TRIUMPHANT ROLE BEFITS HER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   Benedict Nightingale is the chief theater critic of The Times of
London.  
 (af)  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Who is the greatest living British actress? Maybe the
question is silly, since it makes an infinitely demanding art sound
like a steeplechase for mature fillies, and maybe it is
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is not exactly easy to measure Maggie Smith, with
her droll wit and sly timing, against Diana Rigg, who is currently
giving a fierce, febrile performance as Racine's Phedre in the West
End. Or Dame Maggie against Vanessa Redgrave, who, sadly, seldom
brings that wonderful emotional clarity of hers to the stage these
days, or Dame Diana against Helen Mirren, of whom more in a moment.
But if I were to nominate a woman for top spot at the theater's top
table today, it would be Judi Dench.
</P>
<P>
   Those Americans who have yet to discover Dame Judi, or know her
primarily for her Oscar-nominated Queen Victoria in the movie
``Mrs. Brown,'' will get the chance to fill the gap when she comes
to Broadway next spring as the prickly, warm, gullible, shrewd
protagonist of David Hare's ``Amy's View.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she is giving a performance in London that makes
still greater demands on her multiple skills. She plays the title
role in Peter Hall's revival of Eduardo de Filippo's ``Filumena''
at the Piccadilly: Filumena is an illiterate Neapolitan
ex-prostitute with a steel-plated hide, a canny brain and a
maternal heart doughtily thumping away inside.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Filumena'' is a somber comedy, and its author shuns
opportunities for hilarity that lesser dramatists would eagerly
embrace, we don't observe the trick that gets the action moving. On
storms Michael Pennington as the wealthy merchant, Domenico,
expostulating so unstoppably that one fears he will send his dapper
little mustache spinning into the stalls; he is followed by an
eerily unimpressed figure with strings of black hair straggling
down a white nightgown.
</P>
<P>
   This is Dame Judi's Filumena, quietly celebrating an improbable
triumph over her aging lover. She has decided that 25 years is long
enough to wait for a marriage proposal, especially as Domenico is
now displaying a taste for younger flesh, so she has staged a
deathbed scene and conned him into making a respectable wife of
her.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this the last of Filumena's surprises. It emerges that
long ago she bore three sons and had them secretly adopted. How can
Domenico try to annul their marriage when, as she proceeds to
reveal, one of the boys is his own?
</P>
<P>
   There is some gorgeous comedy as Pennington quizzes the three
young men about their mating and musical habits, and can't decide
if his son is the cheery plumber, the supercilious shirt maker or
the poetically inclined clerk.
</P>
<P>
   De Filippo, who died in 1984, set the play in his native Naples
in 1946, so the situation is also deeply serious and the stakes
high. Wedlock, blood and paternity all matter far more than in the
London or New York of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For de Filippo this is a dramatic advantage, but for actors in
Europe's chilly northwest it's a challenge. I've seen British
productions of the great Neapolitan's work that have left me
feeling I was watching parody, Italian waiters flinging about
feelings like overcooked lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   Can Peter Hall's cast resist spaghetti-house accents and rococo
gestures and still create the intensity and tension that all this
Mediterranean bonding requires? The answer is yes it can, thanks
largely to Pennington, who successfully engineers Domenico's
transition from arrogance through unease to a touching humility,
and overwhelmingly to Judi Dench.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is a squat, rough-voiced Filumena who has been toughened by
life and who still has a sort of slum truculence about her. A
rasping cackle of glee gives way to a big triumphant smile as she
reveals to the outraged Domenico that she has been robbing him
blind to finance her sons' upbringing; and when she announces in a
blunt, matter-of-fact way that she will kill him if he ever tells
the boys that one of them is his son, one feels he would be most
unwise to disbelieve her.
</P>
<P>
   But if the character demanded nothing but aggressive
unsentimentality from an actress, the play would be less
interesting and the role less tricky to perform.
</P>
<P>
   There comes a point when Filumena must admit to Domenico that,
despite his neglect and his womanizing, she loves him, maybe more
than ever. Eventually, there comes another when a woman who claims
never to have wept finds that (to quote Timberlake Wertenbaker's
full-blooded translation of one of de Filippo's stage directions)
``tears are running down her face like pure water from a polished
rock.''
</P>
<P>
   By some marvel of human geology, Dame Judi gives us the granite,
gives us the purity of emotion trapped inside, and makes the
mixture more than merely plausible. In its unpretentious way it is
a heart-splintering performance, one that could only have been
created by a major actress in total command of her protean
strength.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, Dame Judi has formidable rivals. Given the voltage that
Helen Mirren generated when she last appeared on the London stage,
in 1994, one had expected her to fizz and dazzle in ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' now at the National Theater. But, no, her Egyptian
queen isn't as excitingly unpredictable as her lovelorn Natalya
Petrovna in Turgenev's ``Month in the Country,'' though this is
largely for reasons beyond her control.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Mathias' production lacks energy and depth, and Alan
Rickman inexplicably chooses to see Shakespeare's grizzled hedonist
as a sullen melancholic who cares little more for Cleopatra than
for his own clarity of diction. It would be easier to strike sparks
from a wet blanket, or throw a successful party for the ghost of
Hamlet's father, than form an electric bond with this glumly
inarticulate Antony.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Mirren has her moments, starting with her very
first words, ``If it be love indeed, tell me how much,'' which come
across as a particularly challenging question in some ontological
quiz game. As one might expect of so incisively intelligent an
actress, hers is a smart, ironic, mocking Cleopatra, but, despite
the odd burst of rage or wail of regret, not a particularly
passionate one.
</P>
<P>
   Only toward the end, when death has provided Rickman's Antony
with a definitive exit, does Ms. Mirren rise fully to the emotional
occasion, bringing us the grief and gravity that Shakespeare
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, one of the National's former artistic directors _
that's right, Peter Hall again _ is giving a first major London
revival to one of the greatest box-office successes in that
theater's 35-year history. Not content with bringing ``Filumena''
to the West End, the workaholic veteran is at the Old Vic with
``Amadeus,'' whose premiere he himself staged back in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I had better anticlimactically confess that I
have never been a huge fan of Peter Shaffer's death-of-Mozart play.
</P>
<P>
   When the court composer Salieri is destroying Mozart while
seeming to befriend him, the piece admittedly has the awful
fascination of a well-plotted revenge drama; but when this Iago
turns out also to be an 18th-century Faust, and starts orating
about his war with the God who has showered his rival with the
musical gifts he himself has been denied, the effect is of a
melodrama living way above its intellectual means.
</P>
<P>
   Still, David Suchet's Salieri, while lacking the darkness of
soul that Paul Scofield originally brought to the role, is suave
and menacing and notably nimble when it comes to shifting his eyes
and lips from smile to sneer. The acting around him is strong, too,
and that of his victim superb.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are unlikely to have heard of Michael Sheen. Despite a
high-powered Peer Gynt for the Japanese director Yukio Ninagawa, we
British have barely registered him ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   But his Mozart is not only the scampering, snickering egomaniac,
the ``obscene child'' that Shaffer's thematic pretensions require
him to be: as the eyes weirdly glinting above pasty, sweaty cheeks
emphasize, he is vulnerable, baffled and helplessly in pain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a moving portrait of an unacknowledged genius on the brink
of his unmarked grave, one that only a most talented young actor
could create.

 &HT;    Barnes takes Georgia governor's race
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    and Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrat Roy Barnes defeated Republican Guy Millner on Tuesday
in the most expensive governor's race in Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   The four major television networks and The Associated Press
declared Barnes a winner before 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated Democrat Mark Taylor had a comfortable
lead over Republican Mitch Skandalakis in the lieutenant governor's
race.
</P>
<P>
   With 47 percent of precincts reporting, Barnes was leading
Millner 52 percent to 45 percent. Libertarian Jack Cashin had 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the lieutenant governor's race, Taylor had 59 percent of the
vote to Skandalakis' 37 percent, with 13 percent of the votes
counted.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia's U.S. Senate race, incumbent Republican Paul
Coverdell was declared a winner by CNN over Democratic challenger
Michael Coles.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, trying to become the first Republican governor in
Georgia since Reconstruction, had hoped demographic trends in the
state would finally deliver the key to the governor's mansion to
the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was buoyed by an apparently high turnout, especially in
predominantly black areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel good when there is a good turnout,'' said
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout around the state appeared to be heavy, according to Kara
Jones, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office. She said
the turnout could surpass the 45 percent that the office had
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In the contest for state attorney general, Democratic incumbent
Thurbert Baker was trailing Republican David Ralston.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes fought until the final bell Tuesday, greeting riders at
the Indian Creek MARTA station in DeKalb County an hour and a half
before the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done the best I can do,'' said the 50-year-old Barnes.
``I don't know anything else I could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner, 62, took most of the day off after voting at the
precinct near his Buckhead home.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates had predicted a close race. ``They don't call me
landslide Millner,'' joked the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second governor's race for both Barnes and Millner.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a veteran state lawmaker from Cobb County, had run for
governor in 1990 but finished a disappointing third in the
Democratic primary. This year, he easily defeated his primary
opponents to become the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, an Atlanta businessman who built the Norrell Corp. into
a major temporary services company, was the Republican nominee for
governor in 1994, when he narrowly lost to Zell Miller. He ran for
the U.S. Senate in 1996, when he was edged by Democrat Max Cleland.
He defeated former Attorney General Mike Bowers in the GOP primary
this year to win his third statewide nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The contest between Barnes and Millner was the most expensive in
state history, and one of the most negative.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, who reported personal wealth of almost $167 million
earlier this year, spent at least $11.5 million of his own money on
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also did his part toward record spending in a Georgia
governor's race, raising and spending about $10.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Millner said his status as a political outsider, along with his
successful track record in business, would enable him to bring
needed changes to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes pointed to his 22-year record in the state Senate and
House, and told voters that Georgia had prospered because previous
governors had similar government experience.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates touted their own virtues, they attacked
each other. The two sides spent about $9 million on TV ads in the
general election, and many of them were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Millner was the first to go on the offensive, firing off
negative commercials within days of the party primaries labeling
Barnes as ``soft on crime, too liberal for Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Millner followed up that assault with a multimillion-dollar
series of commercials that portrayed
</P>
<P>
   Barnes as a plaintiff's lawyer who voted to let convicted drug
dealers out of jail on bail, a state legislator who fought against
Gov. Miller's wildly popular lottery-funded HOPE scholarship and a
master of double-speak who opposed racial quotas when speaking to
white voters and championed affirmative action when talking to
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes slapped back, referring to Millner as a throwback to the
years of political extremists who tries to separate Georgians based
on race, and who opposes equal opportunity for women as well as
blacks. Barnes questioned Millner's business record, saying the
temporary services company Millner built left a string of lawsuits
and citations by state health departments for improper activities
by the company's former health care division.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates accused the other of lying and distorting their
respective records.
</P>
<P>
   The election lacked a single galvanizing issue, like the lottery
for education that propelled Miller's campaign to victory eight
years ago and helped ensure his re-election in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barnes and Millner pushed a clamp-down on crime, with
Millner encouraging a complete end to parole. He also proposed
putting prisoners to work at minimum wage in private-sector
manufacturing plants built on prison grounds. Barnes favored work
camps and prisoners who work to repay society rather than earning
wages.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates promised to improve education, with Barnes
putting more emphasis on a move to restore discipline in the
classroom and technical education. Millner emphasized a spending
program to build 7,500 new classrooms and hire 7,500 new teachers,
along with a merit-pay and salary-hike package for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Millner said he would order an outside audit of state government
and cut the budget by 7 percent, while eliminating the auto tag tax
and cutting property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he would increase the homestead exemption on houses
and family farms to $50,000.

 &HT;    Bastrop County firing prompts First Amendment lawsuit
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Jane Campos-Cisneros agreed to talk to an
Austin reporter last summer about the dozens of Cuban inmates
housed at the Bastrop County Jail, she didn't mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, they can be locked up here forever,'' the sheriff's
department correctional officer said in an interview about the
inmates who are awaiting deportation as detainees of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the article appeared in a San Antonio weekly
magazine, Campos-Cisneros was fired. The department told her she
broke department rules about talking to the press. But
Campos-Cisneros said the department violated her First Amendment
right to freedom of speech, and she has filed a lawsuit against
Sheriff Richard Hernandez and the county.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has drawn attention to the Cuban immigrants housed
at jails around the United States who endure lengthy
incarcerations. Often they are caught between policies of their
home country, which frequently won't accept them, and those of this
country, which can't simply release them.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez declined to explain the department's media policies.
Capt. Charles Littleton, who is mentioned in the lawsuit, also
declined to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there is litigation going on, our pat answer is,
`We're not going to discuss the case,''' Littleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Whittenton, an Austin attorney representing the
department, could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Greenstein of the Austin law firm Greenstein &AMP; Kolker is
representing Campos-Cisneros in her federal lawsuit. Greenstein
said he has handled several wrongful termination lawsuits, but this
one is unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most wrongful termination suits do not involve First Amendment
issues,'' Greenstein said. ``She got fired for exercising her
fairly basic constitutional right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campos-Cisneros began working at the Bastrop County sheriff's
department in October 1990. During the next eight years, according
to her lawsuit, Campos-Cisneros was commended, given pay raises and
promoted to the rank of senior sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton would not comment on Campos-Cisneros' employment
record.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Campos-Cisneros' job was to supervise the many inmates
housed in the Bastrop County Jail, including about 20 Cuban
detainees of the INS, which contracts with jails around the country
to hold illegal immigrants until they can be deported back to their
countries. In return, the jail is paid about $42 a day per inmate,
said Ray Dudley, INS public information officer in San Antonio.
That amounts to about $300,000 per year for the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Dubose, an editor at the Austin magazine Texas Observer,
said he contacted Campos-Cisneros for an interview after obtaining
signed releases from the Cuban inmates and forwarding copies to the
INS and the jail. Campos-Cisneros agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was straightforward and relaxed,'' Dubose said last week.
``She had no reason to fear anything so she was probably as
surprised as anybody else'' (when she got fired). ``She was just
being a critic'' of bad prison policy.
</P>
<P>
   Dubose said he was impressed with how efficiently
Campos-Cisneros handled the inmates, whom she told Dubose can get
pretty rowdy. ``This was a well-run jail,'' he said. ``She took a
place that was a potential powder keg and turned it into a jail
that worked.'' Dubose also interviewed some of the Cuban inmates
and INS officials. His three-page article, ``Cubans Behind Bars,''
appeared in the June 25-July 1 edition of the San Antonio Current.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, according to the lawsuit, Campos-Cisneros was called
into Littleton's office, where he asked her to read the article.
When Campos-Cisneros finished, Littleton told her she could either
resign or be discharged. According to the lawsuit, Littleton said
the INS was upset with the article.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley was quoted in Dubose's article as saying ``We don't have
any Cubans, unless they are in Port Isabel, but that's not a county
jail. We might also have some in Eden, up in the Panhandle, but
that's not a county jail, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dudley said ``there mightbea few'' inmates in the
Bastrop county jail awaiting deportation hearings, but he did not
know why they were serving time. Dudley also said he knew nothing
about Campos-Cisneros' lawsuit and could not answer questions about
any of the inmates interviewed by Dubose.
</P>
<P>
   In his article, Dubose said that, unlike immigrants from Mexico
or El Salvador, Cubans represent a special class of deportable
alien. ``The United States doesn't have diplomatic relations with
Cuba, so there is no way to send these prisoners back home,''
Dubose wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley said that is not entirely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are cases where Cuba refuses to accept people,'' Dudley
said. ``But in some cases they are repatriated to Cuba. In other
cases they are removed to a third country that has agreed to take
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the prisoners choose to stay in jail, Dudley said.
``They're fighting their removal,'' he said. ``They appeal their
cases and that prolongs the time they are incarcerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubose said that if there were any inaccuracies in the article,
he has not been contacted by Bastrop County or the INS about
clarifying or correcting them. James Garci(accent)a, editor of the
San Antonio Current, said the magazine also has not been contacted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I can tell, the story is solid,'' Garci(accent)a
said.

 &HT;    `Late train' politics: Make lobbyists pay
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lobbyists and political action committees try to
pick winners when they make campaign contributions _ after all, a
loser doesn't have much influence. But handicapping legislative
races can be difficult, and many contributors end up betting on the
wrong horse.
</P>
<P>
   How should winning candidates treat those who backed their
opponents? A handful of likely Republican House winners got this
advice from a state GOP official: Make 'em pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win, every lobbyist in the state wants to be your
friend,'' longtime GOP state political director Royal Masset wrote
in an Oct. 29 memo to potential Republican freshmen. ``Make them
pay plenty to get on your late train.''
</P>
<P>
   Masset reminded the candidates that they aren't allowed to
collect contributions within 30 days of, or during, the legislative
session, which begins Jan. 12. So to retire their campaign debts,
he advised them to hold a ``late train reception'' for lobbyists in
late November or early December.
</P>
<P>
   Republican spokesman Robert Black described the memo, addressed
to ``candidates about to become legislators,'' as ``completely
unauthorized'' and ``a completely inappropriate mistake.'' Black
said it wasn't reviewed by party leaders and shouldn't have been
sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party of Texas does not and will not get
involved in the interaction between legislators and lobbyists as a
matter of policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Black refused to say whether Masset, who couldn't be reached for
comment, would be face punishment for the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Austin consultant Bill Miller said the memo ``could have been
more carefully worded'' but was an accurate reflection of political
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of the process. No one ever picks 100 percent
winners. Everybody finds themselves in that position at one time or
another,'' Miller said. ``Late trains run in all elections.''

LAST YEAR'S BEST TAKE DIFFERENT ROUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ How is this for a head-turning change in the
cast: Patrick Byrne became an instant success in horse racing one
year ago when he saddled Favorite Trick and Countess Diana and won
both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and the Juvenile Fillies, then won
Trainer of the Year when Favorite Trick was voted Horse of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in one of those upheavals that embroil the racing world,
the trainer and his best horses are back for this year's Breeders'
Cup, but they are competing in different colors.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne, who surrendered his stable of champions last December to
accept a job as the private trainer for Frank Stronach, returns
with four different horses in three different events in this year's
milestone day at the races. And Favorite Trick, now nobody's Horse
of the Year, still makes the cast with a new trainer, Bill Mott,
and a new race, the Mile, and on a new surface, grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not easy to give up two champions,'' Byrne said Tuesday
at Churchill Downs, where the next act in the drama will be played
on Saturday. ``Favorite Trick is a great horse. But this was the
chance of a lifetime for me, and I had to give up the horse of a
lifetime to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a deliberately slow start in his new job, working with
new owners and new horses and losing his first 11 races, Byrne
began to hit home runs. Since then he has won with about 40 percent
of his runners, and he has won 9 of 12 starts with the four he has
brought to the Breeders' Cup: Wild Rush in the $1 million Sprint,
Bag Lady Jane in the $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and
Awesome Again and Touch Gold in the $4 million Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne watched his two Classic contenders working Tuesday
morning, and said: ``This is going to be the best Classic yet. All
of my horses have had their big works. We'll likely just gallop up
to the race. I will have no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch Gold and Awesome Again have shown me exactly what I
wanted to see at this point. I don't imagine any scenarios for the
race. It will be dictated by the jockeys at race time. All I know
is that I have two horses ready to run their races.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Byrne comes loaded with jockey talent to go with his horse
talent: Pat Day aboard Awesome Again and Chris McCarron on Touch
Gold. And both horses are well-bred 4-year-old sons of Deputy
Minister.
</P>
<P>
   Awesome Again has won his last five starts and 8 of 11 overall.
In the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs in June, he
outran Silver Charm, winner of last year's Kentucky Derby and this
year's Dubai World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold has won 6 of 14 and has run in the money 10 times,
and will forever be remembered as the horse who defeated Silver
Charm in last year's Belmont Stakes and denied him the chance to
sweep the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   So when Pat Byrne gave up Favorite Trick for a new stable, he
gave up the king but not the kingdom. And where does that leave
Favorite Trick?
</P>
<P>
   It leaves him in the hands of perhaps the country's premier
trainer, Bill Mott, who has made some hard early decisions about
the Horse of the Year and his limitations.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mott decided that the Kentucky Derby at a mile and a
quarter in May was not the race for his new star. He was right, but
the horse ran, tired in the homestretch and finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mott made the kind of momentous decision, in reverse, that
made Cigar a superstar after switching from grass to dirt. He
decided that Favorite Trick might be better suited by pedigree and
style to running on grass, so he switched him from dirt last month.
Favorite Trick promptly won the Keeneland Mile by three and a half
lengths, and opened a new career, which is a pretty neat trick for
a Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Mott sent his favorite runner through a half-mile workout on the
Churchill grass Thursday morning, and Favorite Trick responded by
zipping the distance in 48 2/5 seconds. It was nearly three seconds
faster than the next quickest time at that distance. The colt won
all eight of his races as a 2-year-old and 4 of 7 this year at 3,
so he is 12-for-15 going into the Breeders' Cup Mile.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mott reviewed his decision to switch Favorite Trick
to the grass after 14 straight starts on the dirt, and said: ``It's
taken us an entire year to decide what he wants to do best, but
eventually it looked like the Mile would be the logical choice.
We've been breezing him on the grass since July, and he seems to be
a happier horse. I don't think he's good enough to handle the top
3-year-olds at the classic distances. He used every bit of his
courage to make a mile and an eighth. Now on the green stuff, he
moves better and is more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES:
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, the leading candidate for Horse of the Year in 1998
and probably the favorite in the Classic, stepped down from his van
in midmorning after an overnight trip from New York, and was met by
his trainer, Sonny Hine, who said: ``He's on top of his game, from
what I can tell. He had two good works at Belmont Park, and I have
no reason to believe he won't take these horses. I didn't come here
to get beat. I came here to show the world how great he is.'' &QL;

NO DECISION IN EARLY RETURNS FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Buffeted by a surge of energized Democratic voters,
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci Tuesday night found himself in a
tight battle with Attorney General Scott Harshbarger as the
Massachusetts gubernatorial race went to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed Cellucci and Harshbarger locked in a dead
heat in a race that election-eve polls showed favoring the
Republican acting governor and his running mate, Jane M. Swift,
over Harshbarger and Warren E. Tolman.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly tight race reflected a national trend Tuesday
in which Democrats _ benefiting from what some say is a backlash
against Republican impeachment attempts _ made strong showings in
US House and Senate races as well as gubernatorial contests.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cellucci was unexpectedly hit by an unusual political
phenomenon that threatened to sink his attempt to win a full
four-year term. Democrats nationwide bucked a historic trend in
which the party that controls the White House loses large numbers
of congressional seats in off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger has benefited from that,'' said US
Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Lowell Democrat. ``The base of
the Democratic Party, including the unions in Massachusetts, was
mobilized to get its members to polls in numbers no one realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters at both camps Tuesday nightwere settling in for a
long night as returns trickled in with no definite trends.
</P>
<P>
   The strong Democratic voting Tuesday also helped the state party
to sweep the contests for the other constitutional offices.
Secretary of State William F. Galvin, seeking a second four-year
term, and State Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci, first elected to the
post in 1986, handily won reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Shannon O'Brien, a former state senator from
Easthampton, won her bid to replace Republican Joseph D. Malone as
state treasurer, ending the GOP's eight-year lock on that office.
She defeated Bob Maginn, a wealthy business consultant from
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the race for attorney general to replace
Harshbarger, his one-time protege, Middlesex County District
Attorney Thomas F. Reilly, a Democrat from Watertown, easily won
over his Republican rival, Brad Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also failed to gain another foothold in the
state's all-Democratic congressional delegation. In the North
Shore's 6th District, US Representative John F. Tierney of Salem
turned back a rematch challenge from Republican Peter G. Torkildsen
of Danvers, who had held the seat for two terms. Tierney had
defeated him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3rd District, which extends from Worcester to Fall River,
US Representative James McGovern, a first-term Democrat from
Worcester, overcame his Republican challenger, Matthew J. Amorello,
a state senator from Grafton.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of Cellucci's strategy throughout the fall campaign
was to cut into Harshbarger's Democratic base, but surveys of
voters leaving the polls showed the attorney general, while not
widely popular among some rank-and-file members, was able to take
over three-quarters of his party's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harshbarger won a majority of women voters, a bloc
that earlier surveys showed backing Cellucci, in some cases by a
wide margin. Cellucci had courted women voters by citing his work
on domestic violence and by choosing Swift. Cellucci said working
mothers would have a voice in his administration through her.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger also got a big boost from several major
Massachusetts Democratic figures, including US Senators Edward M.
Kennedy and John F. Kerry, who made a series of appearances with
the Democratic nominee on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps more important, Harshbarger received huge support
from organized labor, most notably the state AFL-CIO, which
provided him with workers and paid for mailings and leaflet-drops.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state is in an economic boom, Cellucci had been
struggling to establish an identity since he took over as governor
in July 1997 when William F. Weld resigned. A low-key figure who
had toiled in the state Legislature for the last 22 years, Cellucci
never commanded a high profile like Weld did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cellucci was able to maintain a more disciplined campaign
message than Harshbarger, attacking the attorney general on
so-called wedge issues such as the death penalty, taxes, and
welfare. He was also able to fend off Harshbarger's attempts to
bring his personal finances into the debate. And he was even able
to beat Harshbarger where the attorney general lives _ the largely
Republican Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other races around the country, the Massachusetts
gubernatorial race, in terms of issues, was never about very much
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci argued that he and former governor Weld were
responsible for the economic boom and that he was the fiscal
conservative who would continue the prosperity and impose
discipline at the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger argued that the state needed new leadership, one
that would bring compassion and innovative ideas to state
government.
</P>
<P>
   But no single issue bubbled up to dominate the campaign or
captivate the voters. At the same time, the rhetoric stayed highly
charged, negative, and personal, but the differences between the
two on issues such as education, child care, and expanded health
care seemed small.

A POP POST-MODERNIST GIVES UP ON IRONY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Beck sees dead ends everywhere on his new
album, ``Mutations.'' Creativity and culture are played out, love
has faded away. There aren't even any new jokes to be told. ``Who
wants to be there to sweep the debris, to harness dead horses?'' he
sings.
</P>
<P>
   Well, for the length of the album, it seems that Beck does. He
contemplates entropy and decay with his most lucid and unguarded
songs, as he renounces his old studio tomfoolery. Some of the songs
could be about long-lost love, but nearly all of them also read as
impressions of a time when the only certainty is a free-floating
sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   On previous albums, Beck has been a quizzical but resourceful
post-modernist, sorting through the fragments and juxtapositions of
an era that offers a surfeit of information with no clear
hierarchies or boundaries. ``I'm picking up the pieces and I'm
putting them up for sale,'' he sang on ``Odelay,'' while his music
turned those pieces into sonic collages that could be zany or oddly
affecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mutations'' (DGC) is more reflective. Facing the same
post-modern situation, its songs muse on what it means when ``Dead
ends they won't come to life any more.'' Yet even as he writes
about being immobilized, he finds beauty, insight and sly humor.
</P>
<P>
   The way Beck, 28, tells it, ``Mutations'' simply happened to
fall together. He had just finished more than two years of touring
and had a band sharpened by constant performing. He also had a
backlog of songs and a handful of new ones. He thought he would
make an album for Bong Load Records, an independent label, that
would be a low-key sidetrip from his million-selling albums on DGC
Records, ``Mellow Gold'' from 1994 and ``Odelay'' from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A producer he wanted to work with, Nigel Godrich (who recorded
Radiohead's ``OK Computer''), was available for just two weeks. So
Beck and his band made up arrangements on the spot, mostly
performing live in the studio and often finishing a song a day.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the two weeks were up, Beck had a complete album.
Soon afterward, DGC decided that it was worth a full major-label
release and acquired it from Bong Load.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing it so quickly we didn't have time to think about
it,'' Beck said in an interview in his house. He looks like he
hasn't slept much; he's stubbly and rumpled, speaking slowly and
carefully in a deeper register than his singing voice.
</P>
<P>
   The music on ``Mutations'' sounds old-fashioned in places. It
draws on blues, honky-tonk, folk-rock, country waltzes and bossa
nova; its influences stop short chronologically before the hip-hop
sampling and drum machines that gave Beck his hits. But the tunes
can't take refuge in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Chords wander in wayward directions, away from traditional
paths; oddball instruments and electronic sounds flicker at the
edges. The new songs are stranded between eras in an unmistakably
1990s way, full of anachronisms and odd linkages; they're ``looking
back at some dead world that looks so new,'' Beck sings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People write that I dig through the pickle barrel of the
past,'' he said. ``But I think of the music of the last hundred
years as contemporary. It's all part of a fluid continuous line.
People have a general sense of superiority to the past, but I don't
think we're any smarter or more enlightened. We were still the same
people 80 years ago as we were 20 years ago. I also think that when
you come to the end of something you really have to go back to the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   That end is not, he insists, the end of the century. ``I'm
trying hard not to make any millennial statements,'' he said.
``People are too hung up on that. For the millennium, I just want
to come out with a party record with dumb sounds and dumb songs and
dumb lyrics.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Mutations'' marks a change that's more private than an
adjustment of the calendar. Beck, whose albums, stage shows and
television appearances have been full of deadpan parodies, says he
is ready to give up irony. ``I've been guilty of irony and
cynicism, those things that are symptomatic of our times,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really blame anybody, in the way irony and cynicism
are pounded into everybody's heads in every TV commercial, as if
we're all insiders on the big joke here. But there's got to be more
than just the joke. I'm trying to be more conscientious of certain
attitudes and try to grow beyond them and come up with something
new.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mutations'' doesn't move with the giddy metamorphoses of
Beck's DGC albums. Nor does it go back to the sketchy, folky sound
of ``One Foot in the Grave,'' a 1994 side project that he released
on K Records. Yet the music isn't a complete departure from Beck's
past albums; it's a continuation of woozy, country-and-fuzztone
songs like ``Pay No Mind (Snoozer)'' on ``Mellow Gold'' and ``Lord
Only Knows'' on ``Odelay.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new songs gaze at the general decline with a calm,
thoughtful tone, while bending old frameworks way out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottle of Blues,'' which sees Viagra as something that masks a
deep malaise, has a 12-string strum that harks back to Lead Belly,
but it veers away from the shape of the blues and finds distorted
synthesizer solos and wah-wah guitar sneaking into the mix.
``Nobody's Fault But Mine,'' about the ruins of a romance, could
have been a Neil Young meditation, but floats instead on an Indian
drone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tropicalia'' is a bossa nova that looks at a decaying resort
city where ``The embassies lie in hideous shards/Where tourists
snore and decay''; true to the sonic irreverence of the 1960s
Brazilian musical revolution called Tropicalia, the arrangement
merges typical bossa nova flute and trombone with swooping,
bubbling synthesizer noises.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Sing It Again,'' arranged like a Willie Nelson waltz
complete with an acoustic guitar solo, wanders into unlikely chords
as Beck sings, ``Oh won't you lay my bags upon the funeral fire?''
</P>
<P>
   Beck expects to warp his sources. ``You can't write a pure
country song any more,'' he said. ``You can't write a pure
Appalachian ballad. Because we live in a world where we've all
heard speed-metal, we've all heard drum-and-bass, we've all heard
old-school hip-hop. Even if you're not influenced by it or you're
not using elements of it, they're in your mind. That's why I called
the album `Mutations,' because it's trying to embrace the
evolution, embrace the impurity of the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The old, noisy, style-hopping Beck re-emerges on the album's
last song, hidden after the stately trudge of ``Static,'' a song
about the temptations of resignation and ``convalescent bliss.'' In
the untitled song, Beck starts with the electric harpsichord and
airy harmonies of mid-1960s pop, then dives toward a fuzz-toned
psychedelic bass and freakout drumming, then shifts through some
tempo changes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet within the music's manic thrills, he sings about ``derelict
boulevards'' and ``no direction to be known.'' If there is a way
out, it's the paradoxical perseverance that turns up in ``We Live
Again,'' a dreamy, hovering waltz about old age and death. ``The
end of the end,'' Beck sings. ``We live again/Oh, I grow weary of
the end.'' Somehow, it sounds like hope.

GREENWICH HITS THE JACKPOT: $93,608 FOR POWERBALL WOES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The town of Greenwich has made the Connecticut
Lottery Corp. pay for inflicting Powerball mania on the suburb:
$93,608.03, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   When crowds jammed the suburb's small streets in July to buy a
chance at a $295 million jackpot, Gov. John Rowland promised to
reimburse angry town leaders for their troubles. The town selectmen
submitted a bill for overtime expenses and cleanup costs, and last
Friday they received their check.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut participates with 18 other states and the District
of Columbia in the Powerball lottery game. Since New York and New
Jersey do not, residents of those states streamed into Connecticut
in July when the jackpot reached record levels. And instead of
driving up to New Canaan or Stamford where there were no lines, the
visitors hopped off at the first Turnpike exit and the first train
stop in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The streets quickly became congested. The police were forced to
pay officers overtime to direct traffic, and the Fire Department
had to keep more people on the job because the crowds made it
impossible for other stations to help in emergencies, Fire Chief
Mike Peuterbaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom R. Ragland, first selectman, said it took 25 minutes for a
fire truck to drive three-fourths of a mile to respond to a fire at
a gas station selling Powerball tickets. ``The station could have
blown up and no one got out of line,'' Ragland said. ``And the
machines there were down. That's why I call it a frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   The town will be reimbursed $74,034.68 for police overtime,
$9,531.39 for Fire Department overtime, $9,306.89 for the
Department of Public Works' cleanup efforts and line control and
$735.07 for the ambulance service.
</P>
<P>
   The reimbursement will come from the money the state lottery
usually contributes to the state general fund, said Missy Riordan,
the lottery spokeswoman. During its last fiscal year the
Connecticut lottery earned $264.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of the July frenzy, some Greenwich residents
pressured retailers to stop selling lottery tickets. Three stores
that sold lottery tickets this spring and summer have dropped the
game, Mrs. Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lost thousands of dollars of business and sales because of
the chaos,'' said John J. Laverty, assistant manager of the Food
Emporium, one of the stores that dropped the game.
</P>
<P>
   But 25 Greenwich stores still sell the tickets, and state
lottery officials have a plan to ease the burden if Powerball mania
strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials are creating a brochure to distribute at Grand
Central Terminal to encourage New York and New Jersey buyers to go
to other towns besides Greenwich. Mrs. Riordan said that when the
jackpot gets high enough, they will push buyers to other towns.
</P>
<P>
   But Ragland dismissed such plans as mere public relations.
``When I pick up the phone I want to know they will cooperate and
pull the plug on Powerball in Greenwich,'' he said.

JEB BUSH CLAIMS VICTORY IN FLORIDA GOVERNOR'S RACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIMCOBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republican Jeb Bush became the second son of former President
Bush to claim a governor's mansion, winning his race in Florida by
a wide margin. Brother George W. Bush rolled an easy re-election in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the best parents in the world by far,`` the
younger Bush sibling said to a roomful of cheering supporters in a
nod to the ex-president and Barbara Bush, who'd flown to Florida to
share the victory.
</P>
<P>
   With half the vote counted, Bush had 58 percent to Democratic
Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay's 42 percent. It was Bush's second attempt,
having narrowly lost to incumbent Democrat Gov. Lawton Chiles in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush called his brother about an hour after the
Florida polls had closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one excited person, as I'm sure you can imagine,'' said
the Texas governor. ``Mother and Dad flew over to Miami to surprise
him, and he was in quite a state of shock when Mother and Dad
walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great tribute to them. And it's obviously a
tribute to the way he ran his campaign, and the fact that he got
beat four years ago and it didn't deter his enthusiasm. He came
back and won a big victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans feared losing the biggest prize of the day, with
Democrat Gray Davis running ahead of Republican Dan Lungren in the
bid to replace outgoing Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. The California
state house has been Republican for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tuesday's balloting did not threaten to dislodge the
firm hold overall that Republicans have on the nation's governor's
mansions, despite two upset victories by Democrats in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were choosing a governor in 36 states Tuesday. Before
balloting, Republicans held 24 of those seats, Democrats had 11 and
an independent governed Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Republican Governors Association, South
Carolina's David Beasley, lost to state House Minority Leader Jim
Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   Beasley had to defend himself against eleventh-hour allegations
that he'd had an affair with his former press secretary _ something
he, his wife and the woman in question denied.
</P>
<P>
   And in a state where unregulated video poker has been a big bone
of contention, Beasley accepted money from the industry in 1994 and
then later opposed the game. Subsequently, the well-heeled gaming
interests backed Democrat Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   Another southern state, Alabama, threw out its incumbent
Republican governor, Fob James, in favor of Democrat Lt. Gov. Don
Siegelman. James, 64, was first elected as a Democrat and then
switched parties. He was extremely popular with Christian
conservatives, championing school prayer and a controversial
display of the Ten Commandments in a Gadsden courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   James' opponent, Siegelman, pledged to bring a lottery to
Alabama to help fund education improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But the gubernatorial race with the most entertainment value had
to be in Minnesota, where the two major party candidates were
trailing a former professional wrestler _ Jesse ``the Body''
Ventura, running as a member of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Polling indicated a tight three-way race, though Hillary Rodham
Clinton had dismissed Ventura's bid for governor as a ``sideshow.''
Ventura answered with, ``If I were her, I'd be more concerned about
leaving Bill alone in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, MacKay's campaign suffered from a late start and
poor organization, in spite of his 30 years of political
experience. Bush, 45, jumped to the head of the polls in the early
days of the campaign and never wavered, but padded his already
large GOP base by courting traditionally Democratic minority
voters.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was remarkable since Bush alienated many minority
voters in 1994 when he was asked what he would do for black voters,
and glibly answered, ``Probably nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's overtures to minority Democrats fanned fears that those
who left the party in the governor's race will stay away when it
comes time to elect a president in 2000 _ particularly if the GOP
nominee is the Florida governor's brother.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP has similar fears in California, where lame duck Gov.
Pete Wilson had alienated much of the state's Republican base long
before Tuesday's election. A Los Angeles Times writer noted over
the weekend that a win by Democrat Gray Davis would send an
important signal about the ability of other Republicans to compete
in California if their candidate, like Lungren, opposed abortion
and gun control and had a questionable record on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   In other governor's races, New York Republican George Pataki was
headed to a second term with one of the largest margins in history.
Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening of Maryland won a rematch with
Republican Ellen Sauerbrey, and Democratic incumbents won in New
Hampshire and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Republicans Frank Keating in Oklahoma, Tommy Thompson
in Wisconsin, John Engler in Michigan, and Tom Ridge in
Pennsylvania won easily.
</P>
<P>
   Republican incumbents also won in Arkansas, Arizona,
Connecticut, Kansas, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming. &QL;

 &HT;    MOURNING SIDELINED BY SURGERY, TOO
 &HT;    By TOM D'ANGELO
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Miami Heat finally found a positive in the lockout _ they
won't have to play games as Alonzo Mourning recovers from another
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, the Heat's 6-foot-10 center, underwent surgery
Saturday to have a bone spur removed from his right knee, a
procedure that could keep him off the court for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Had the season started Tuesday as originally scheduled, Mourning
would have lost at least 12 games. But thanks to the lockout he
could return without missing a game or even a shortened training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Heat personnel are not allowed to comment on any players during
the lockout, but they were aware of the surgery, which was
performed by team doctor Harlan Selesnick. Neither Selesnick nor
Mourning were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery was suggested after Mourning's knee started to bother
him while working out this summer. Mourning is among a group of
players _ current and former members of the Heat _ who are playing
at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Bone spur surgery typically is considered minor and involves
removing, or cleaning out, bone or calcium. Mourning's was
performed arthroscopically. He should begin riding an exercise
bicycle within two weeks of the surgery and return to the court
within a month.
</P>
<P>
   With talks resuming today, the lockout is expected to last at
least into next week, meaning the earliest start of the season
would be early to mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   If his rehab goes accordingly, Mourning may not miss a game
because of the surgery. Mourning, though, will sit out the first
game of the season because of the two-game suspension for fighting
with Larry Johnson during Game 4 of the Heat's playoff series with
New York last season.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning has had a series of injuries that have caused him to
miss several games in each of the three seasons since he was traded
to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Last season he missed the first 22 games after having surgery on
his left knee to repair a partially torn tendon. He then missed two
games with a fractured cheek bone.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996-97 season, Mourning missed 16 games _ 14 of
those because of a torn ligament in his foot. His first season in
Miami was cut 12 games short because of a torn tendon in his left
foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat were 28-13 the last two years without Mourning, all but
three were with Isaac Austin as the starting center. With Austin
now a free agent after being traded last season, Miami's only
reserve center or power forward is 7-foot Duane Causwell.
</P>
<P>
   During his three seasons in Charlotte, he missed 31 games, 27
because of injuries. The most serious was a torn muscle in his left
calf his second season.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time he has had a problem with his right knee.

 &HT;    UF'S ALEXANDER SAYS MORE WITH LESS
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Bennie Alexander got the word on the
practice field. In five days, the Florida cornerback would be
making his first start against Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   His response was to say nothing _ which says everything about
this tight-lipped freshman from Raiford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't tell anyone,'' he said. ``Not even my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids find out they're starting their first college game,
and they can't get to a phone fast enough to tell their family,
friends and anyone else they can think of. Not Alexander, who seems
to want to go through life by saying 25 words or less.
</P>
<P>
   It was like that even when Alexander helped lead Union County
High to three consecutive state football championships, or when he
won the 3A 100-and 200-yard state titles as a senior. His coach,
Robby Pruitt, explains Benny ``said all of 10 words in four years
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I raised him,'' said his father, Bennie
Alexander Sr. ``I didn't want him talking all kinds of trash, like
a lot of kids. He's strictly business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask the younger Alexander about his reluctance to speak and
he'll usually smile and nod. It takes another question, or two, to
actually get his lips moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just quiet,'' he said. ``I've been that way my whole life.
But if I need to say something, I'll say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Alexander, his actions have said plenty about
his abilities. After spending last year on UF's scout squad, he
started getting noticed this year when he led the Gators with 14
special-teams tackles.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his work in the fourth quarter of the LSU game, when
the 5-foot-9, 175-pounder twice tackled LSU star tailback Kevin
Faulk in the open field, that convinced UF defensive coordinator
Bob Stoops it was time to let loose his silent terror. With starter
Dock Pollard suspended (missing classes) and backup Robert
Cromartie hobbled by a knee injury, Stoops turned to Alexander
against Auburn and he responded with seven tackles and two pass
deflections.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, even though Cromartie was healthy, Alexander started
again against Georgia and received a game ball after making a key
fumble recovery in UF's 38-7 win. Alexander will start his third
consecutive game Saturday when the Gators (7-1, 5-1) play at
Vanderbilt (2-6, 1-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, Bennie's earned the right to stay there, and I
wouldn't imagine it would be easy to get it back,'' Stoops said.
``He's always been a confident guy. Now he's getting a chance to
show what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   His dad believes his son will eventually become a star kick
returner for the fifth-ranked Gators, but Florida's coaching staff
better not wait for Benny to speak up and volunteer. Alexander's
status as a starter has earned him an invitation to the weekly
interview session with reporters, but that doesn't mean he actually
does much talking..
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just scared I'm going to saeeds to know you before he'll
say too much,'' said his mom, Shirley Alexander. ``He's the type of
person who would rather just do something than talk about it. But I
sure wish he would have told us he was going to be starting. We
were shocked.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush set down his peanut butter and
raspberry jelly sandwich and wrinkled his nose, as though the aide
on the other side of the tiny campaign plane had tossed him
liverwurst by mistake. But it wasn't the sandwich. It was that word
someone just said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dynasty,'' he repeated with a sour edge. ``In a dynasty, you
don't have to earn anything. In a democracy, you've got to earn
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, was bouncing around the state on one of the final
swings of a steamroller of a campaign that, Tuesday, saw him become
the first person in Texas history to win consecutive four-year
terms as governor of the nation's second largest state. (Until
1974, Texas governors served two-year terms.) On the same day, his
brother, Jeb, 45, won the governorship of Florida, the nation's
fourth largest state, rebounding from a narrow loss in the race for
the job four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Their grandfather had been a U.S. senator from Connecticut.
Their father had been president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not a dynasty. But it's not liverwurst, either.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to happen four years ago, when Jeb Bush made
his first run for governor in Florida. Many close to the family had
considered the younger brother the more astute politician, and it
surprised some that it was the older brother alone who won in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said that he has a photograph from his
inauguration that he finds himself looking at every now and then.
In it, he is taking the oath of office while, in the background,
his father can be seen wiping away a tear. ``And there, on the
other side, is Jeb,'' he said. ``He's looking happy and proud, but
also something else, maybe a little sad, too. It's a tough moment,
tough for me to look at. I love my brother, you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else has happened in those intervening years. George
W. Bush had emerged as the early frontrunner in virtually every
poll for the Republican nomination for president in 2000, a goal
that he has not yet said he desires but which Tuesday's Bush
victories will go a significant way toward making more possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that having two brothers and two sons of a
former president as governors of two of the largest and most
politically pivotal states in the country, and one of them as a
potential presidential candidate, makes the Bushes one of the most
remarkable political families of the 20th century,'' said Ralph
Reed, a Republican strategist in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the legitimate manifestation of a Republican dynasty,''
said Rich Bonds, a former Republican national chairman who has
known the Bush family for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear is what it means to the two states. What's a dynasty
to do in the 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   Most government officials and political observers in Austin and
Tallahassee believe that it will do neither brother much good at
home to have a sibling running another state, no matter how
sizable. They will have to make their own way with their own
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that if George W. Bush does decide to run
for president, having a brother in the governor's mansion in
Tallahassee will be very, very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for American political families to produce two
governors at the same time, said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution in Washington who wrote the book,
``America's Political Dynasties,'' in 1966. Usually, he said, such
dynasties are centered in a single state _ the Tafts of Ohio, the
Adamses of Massachusetts, the Frelinghuysens of New Jersey, the
Longs of Louisiana _ though there are exceptions, which Hess calls
``free-floating dynasties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys began in Massachusetts, but later made their mark
in New York and Maryland. The family that most recently held two
governorships at once was the Rockefellers, in New York and
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   One has to go back to the Washburns of the years during and just
after the Civil War to find a family with so many political stars
of such national reach, Hess said. During that period, four
Washburn brothers were congressmen from Maine, Illinois, Wisconsin
and Minnesota, two later became governor, one became a senator and
one was secretary of state under Ulysses S. Grant. But the Washburn
dynasty burned out in one generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when you talk about the Bushes, you are not talking about
a family of ward bosses in Chicago,'' Hess said. ``These folks are
U.S. senators, vice president, president, governors of two of the
largest states in the country. We're talking about quite a
powerhouse. It is sure going to be an advantage if George W. Bush
decides he wants to run for president.''

 &HT;    AVERY GETTING HIS SHOT
 &HT;    By TOM D'ANGELO
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Linda Avery was ready to stick the key into the
lock of her new four-bedroom, ranch-style house in Asheville, N.C.,
when she had a thought.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she was on the phone to her son, Miami Dolphins rookie
running back John Avery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and told him when I put my keys in the door, I
said, `I know how Louise Jefferson felt when they moved into their
new apartment. You can call me 'Weesie.'''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so John Avery isn't George Jefferson (let's see if George
can block a 250-pound blitzing linebacker or return a kick 55 yards
and nearly set up a miracle touchdown), but John knows just how his
mom feels.
</P>
<P>
   John Avery, according to Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson, is, too,
moving on up. Like mother, like son.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Linda Avery moves into the house that her son promised
he'd buy her from the time he realized he had a physical gift few
others had. Today also is the day that Avery graduates from Karim
Abdul-Jabbar's understudy to his equal. Johnson has seen enough of
his short (5-foot-9) but speedy (4.3 in the 40) running back to
declare that he and Abdul-Jabbar are ready to rotate in the
Dolphins backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel like coach is getting more confidence in me,''
Avery said. ``They know my size has nothing to do with it anymore.
I don't miss blocks. I put people on the ground. I compete and I'm
a lot bigger than I look. I don't have any fear. I'm small but I'm
fighting lions and tigers and I'm going out there with a whip.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asheville, Linda, who as a single mom raised John, his sister
and his brother, wonders what took the Dolphins so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they say he's a rookie and he shouldn't take a chance.
... this is why they got him and this is what he does,'' Linda
said. ``Putting him in and taking him out, he's not getting a good
feel for the game. Let that boy run the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   A short conversation with Linda Avery and one learns where John
got his friendly, upbeat personality. In a locker room in which
certain wide receivers curse out reporters and the quarterback
walks through sneering and ignoring questions or requests for
interviews, Avery is polite and always smiling. He addresses women
by saying ``Yes, ma'am,'' or ``No, ma'am,'' and just enjoys talking
to people.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, he enjoys seeing his mom moving on up.
Avery purchased the home after promising his mom that someday he
would prove all the cynics wrong and play in the NFL. Just like
when he proved those wrong who said he was too small. ... to play
football, to play basketball, to dunk a basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like challenges,'' he said. ``I went out for basketball (in
high school) just to prove to them I could play. Then I dunked just
to prove to them I wasn't too small. I was the best sixth man in
the county.''
</P>
<P>
   John wanted to build Linda a home, but Linda fell in love with
her new home, which is located about 10 miles from the projects
into which Linda moved her children after being divorced when John
was 2.
</P>
<P>
   One day, when John was home on break from the University of
Mississippi, Linda was up at 3 a.m., getting ready for work. John
was on the couch. Snow was falling and it was cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rolled over and said, `Mom, where are you going,''' Linda
said. ``I told him work. He shook his head and said, `One day you
won't have to do that. I am going to take care of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Linda worked two jobs. ... for the social service during the day
and a fast-food chain at night. Her children were always cared for
and always on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   And John was always playing ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think he would grow, he was like a little
stump,'' mom said, affectionately.
</P>
<P>
   Some will argue he never did, but John doesn't mind. He sees
running backs barely his size making a run toward the Hall of Fame.
Which brings us to another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   One day, while his teammates from Mississippi were sitting
around chatting, Avery overheard some of them say he was too small
to be a first-round pick and too small to make it in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   They were wrong once _ Avery was the 29th pick in the draft _
and time will only tell if they are wrong twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``After hearing that even I didn't expect to play,'' Avery said.
``I didn't know if I was even going to be the water boy, or what.
Even some coaches were saying, ``You're little, don't expect to get
right in.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the coach just know now I can help this football team a
little more and get better with more opportunities.''

 &HT;    FAVORITE TRICK KNOWS HOW TO MAKE A MOVE
 &HT;    By JOHN CRITTENDEN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Favorite Trick used the 1997 Breeders Cup as a springboard into
history.
</P>
<P>
   When he ran away with the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Hollywood
Park a year ago, that made him Horse of the Year, with eight
winning races in a row.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time a 2-year-old had won in that election
since Secretariat in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Then Favorite Trick, owned by Joseph LaCombe of West Palm Beach,
became racing's first big disappointment of 1998, eighth in the
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   He was not Secretariat Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Headed into the Breeders' Cup for the second time, recently
switched from races on the dirt to races on the grass, Favorite
Trick is in a position to make history again.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in the Mile on Saturday at Churchill Downs, he could
be the first horse to win in the Breeders' Cup in two different
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   What an achievement that would be!
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no horse has ever gone so swiftly from veneration to
ridicule to redemption's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1997 season, the prodigy was canonized. When
he lost at age 3, the front runners from glory days wanted to throw
him out with the garbage. Suddenly, The Trickster is on his feet
again, one step from the top.
</P>
<P>
   That's momumental.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick came in fifth in a New York sprint less than two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Breeders' Cup had no race for him. The Sprint
was too short. The Classic was too long. The 1997 Horse of the Year
was about to fall between the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy because he voted for Favorite Trick a year earlier, Andy
Beyer, The Washington Post columnist, asked if there was any way to
impeach a horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He disillusioned his admirers, disappointed the people around
him and discredited himself,'' announced Beyer.
</P>
<P>
   That's poppycock.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick was never discredited. He was undefeated at 2.
That he did not turn out to be a wonder horse at 3 is no discredit.
</P>
<P>
   While the other males in his generation got taller and broader
as time passed, Favorite Trick stayed about the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the 1997 Horse of the Year didn't go as fast as his
contemporaries but he ran with heart and vigor always. It makes no
sense to shoot a horse because he cannot overcome his genes.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Favorite Trick is winning again, the bandwagon-jumpers
have to find a way to get their pom-poms back.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the people around Favorite Trick were never
disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the year it seemed that both LaCombe and
trainer Bill Mott knew the horse had limitations.
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances almost demand that a colt voted Horse of the
Year at 2 try to run in the Kentucky Derby at 3, even if the race
is too long for him to win.
</P>
<P>
   When the Derby ordeal was done, Mott didn't hurry Favorite Trick
into a series of rematches with horses he couldn't beat.
</P>
<P>
   He dodged the top 3-year-olds until Favorite Trick found his
niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every horse has a favorite surface and a favorite distance,''
Mott said after Favorite Trick finally raced on the grass, winning
at a mile at Keeneland Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   With one race on a surface that is new to him, it would be
misguided to think of Favorite Trick as one of the favorites
Saturday against the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The bettors remember him. He will not go off at high odds.
</P>
<P>
   But great expectations have followed this horse all his life.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes Favorite Trick's story so fascinating.

 &HT;    COLUMN: RILEY MISSING THE MAIN EVENT
 &HT;    By GREG STODA
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCONUT GROVE, Fla. _ Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Heat coach Pat Riley heard the tune, sung by Marvin Gaye and
Tammi Terrell, and he felt it. He knew. He just knew.
</P>
<P>
   Ain't nothing like the NBA real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss it,'' Riley said. ``I miss being out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley spent Tuesday morning at home working with an electrician
trying to determine how best to shine a light on the crown of a
tree. He spent a portion of Tuesday afternoon speaking to children
at Carver Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't do was worry about dealing with Reggie Miller or
Rik Smits or any of the other Indianapolis Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 NBA season was scheduled to begin Tuesday night, and
Miami Arena _ Heat vs. Pacers _ was one of the places it was
supposed to happen. But the reality of a lockout that has already
wiped out the league's November schedule and could soon erase some
or all of December's games has closed professional basketball's
theatres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing opening night,'' Riley said. ``Usually, there's
enthusiasm and great excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there's acrimony and bitterness as a labor vs.
management fight drags on.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, gagged by threat of league-imposed fine, wasn't talking
about the negotiating impasse. He did say, however, that he feels
rejuvenated despite having a team in name only.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last season, which ended in disappointment for
Riley when the Heat were eliminated from the playoffs by New York,
he said coaching was not appealing in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   A ``lifer'' on the bench?
</P>
<P>
   Riley didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's 53 years old ... and perhaps reconsidering with two
coaching years remaining on his Heat contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown to love coaching more than I did,'' Riley said.
``Maybe it's age and a sense of what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, he said, ``not cluttered'' with conflicting thoughts
about his future. There was a time, after he left a glorious
coaching run with the Los Angeles Lakers, when he thought he might
not want to return to the grind.
</P>
<P>
   But television work was unsatisfying, and Riley went first to
New York and the Knicks for four years before landing in (escaping
to?) Miami three seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that it was those Knicks who stopped the Heat in the
playoffs _ and stoked an already nasty rivalry _ may have much to
do with Riley's desire to get back to the fray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said there was unfinished business,'' Riley said. ``It ended
without an exclamation point on the season.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes dealing with the question mark hanging over
this season more bothersome for Riley, who, instead of preparing to
play the Pacers, was working with an electrician and talking to
grade-school students.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he had a good time at Carver where students had painted a
mural and taped signs _ most of them displaying various forms and
colors of the Heat's burning basketball symbol _ on the walls and
halls of the school. Riley accomodated a young interviewer and
later delivered a child-friendly version of one of his motivational
speeches _ ``be dedicated, determined and disciplined'' _ for which
corporate giants routinely pay him thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't be heading to Miami Arena dressed in a designer
suit.
</P>
<P>
   And he was going to miss that.
</P>
<P>

REPUBLICANS HOLD MAJORITY IN SENATE; 2 CLINTON CRITICS LOSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans held their majority in the Senate in
elections Tuesday but lost two of President Clinton's most vocal
critics _ Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina and Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP may offset the losses by knocking off two Democratic
incumbents _ Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois and Russell Feingold
of Wisconsin _ who trailed in the polls going into Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the GOP was falling short of winning enough seats to
provide a filibuster-proof majority that a month ago many
Republican leaders had predicted was within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Senate races too close to call late Tuesday were re-election
bids by Barbara Boxer in California and Patty Murray in Washington.
Also close was the open-seat contest between Republican Rep. Jim
Bunning and Democratic Rep. Scotty Baesler in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   When all votes are counted, Republicans are expected to pad
their current 55-44 Senate majority with no more than three
additional seats. If the GOP picks up any seats, it will be the
most the party has held in the Senate since 1931, when Republicans
held 56 Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing a fatal blow to Republican chances of boosting their
Senate majority by even larger numbers this year was D'Amato's loss
in New York to Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer, an eight-term House
member from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched D'Amato-Schumer race was expensive and nasty
with the two candidates trading public insults and accusations. The
two candidates spent more than $32 million in what is expected to
be the most expensive race in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Faircloth was ousted by Democrat John
Edwards, a trial lawyer who was making his first run for political
office. Edwards dominated early stages of the campaign and fought
off a late challenge from Faircloth, who switched his party
affiliation from Democrat to Republican before running for the
Senate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Also crippling Republican chances of building on their Senate
majority was veteran Sen. Ernest Hollings' easy win over Republican
challenger Bob Inglis, a three-term member of the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings, who has served 32 years in the Senate, currently is
the only Democrat holding statewide office in South Carolina,
arguably the most Republican state in the South until Tuesday. Not
only was Hollings returned to office, South Carolina voters elected
Democrat David Hodges to replace incumbent GOP Gov. David Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate races on the ballot, most of the other
incumbents were expected to win re-election easily. Five of the
seats up for election had no incumbent,
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed Democrat Evan Bayh winning a seat
previously held by the GOP in Indiana and George Voinovich winning
a seat held by a retiring Ohio Democrat, astronaut John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, Democrat Blanche Lambert Lincoln won the Senate
seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Dale Bumpers, a Democrat.
Lincoln quit the House after two terms following the birth of twin
sons, then re-entered politics this year easily defeating
Republican Fay Boozman.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, the first
African-American woman elected to the Senate, trailed Republican
Peter Fitzgerald in early returns and in exit polls. Public opinion
surveys in the final week of the campaign showed Moseley Braun
behind, but closing on her GOP challenger.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, early returns showed Feingold slightly ahead of
Republican Rep. Mark Neumann. Feingold, the incumbent Democrat who
fought unsuccessfully in the Senate for campaign finance reform,
promised to limit his re-election campaign spending to $3.8
million. It robbed him of the fund-raising advantage normally
enjoyed by incumbents. As a result, by election day his early
advantage in the polls had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Coast, Boxer _ one of five Democratic women elected
to the Senate in 1992's Year of the Woman _ was in a tight race
against Republican Matt Fong, the California state treasurer. Boxer
was targeted by the GOP for her liberal voting record and her
political and personal ties to scandal-tainted President Clinton.
Boxer is married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother.
</P>
<P>
   In the open-seat contest to replace retiring Sen. Wendell Ford
of Kentucky, early returns showed Bunning and Baesler in a race too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Among those re-elected to six-year terms were Sens. Tom Daschle
of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader; John McCain,
R-Ariz., a potential 2000 presidential contender; and Sens. John
Breaux, D-La., Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Also returning to the Capitol will be Sens. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who won a fourth term. Sens. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn.; Sam Brownback, R-Kan.; Richard Shelby, R-Ala.; and
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., were re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Also re-elected were Democratic Sens. Bob Graham of Florida and
Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Leahy swamped GOP challenger Fred Tuttle,
a 79-year-old dairy farmer who gained celebrity after starring in a
1996 film spoofing congressional politics and who admitted he had
no interest in being elected.
</P>
<P>
   Republican hopes for increasing their majority were based, in
part, on history. Since World War II, the party not holding the
presidency has picked up an average of four seats in each midterm
election. The average pickup was nearly nine seats in the elections
held in the sixth years of the terms of Presidents Eisenhower,
Nixon and Reagan. &QL;

 AUSTIN, Texas: for president.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush crumpled up the paper that held his sandwich and glanced
out the plane's window toward the flat, green fields of north
central Texas, striated with wiggling creeks and their bright
yellow flood plains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We inherited a great name,'' he said. ``It's a great political
legacy. It's obviously a political advantage. But to me, the
election of two sons as governors is a tribute to George H.W. Bush
and Barbara Bush. It's a great tribute to my mom and dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The former president and first lady showed up Monday at a
raucous rally in downtown Houston while their eldest son was making
his final campaign swing, but neither spoke or took part in the
news conference that followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never sat around our house discussing issues,'' George W.
Bush said. ``We talked about what the Astros did that day or
whether Marvin had finished his peas yet. My father never tried to
put his stamp on my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to The New York Times in August, responding to
written questions for a profile of the Texas governor, former
President Bush said that ``both George and Jeb are strong enough to
take it,'' referring to the stresses of public life. ``They are men
of conviction and integrity,'' he wrote. ``Both Jeb and George were
at my side in some pretty tough times.''
</P>
<P>
   The two oldest Bush brothers are seven years apart in age, and
it was a significant difference when they were younger. But now, as
middle-aged men with their own families, the difference seems
almost trivial. Geography and the demands of their campaigns have
kept them apart, but they have tried to keep in touch and, through
their parents, their three siblings and the friends of the family
keep tabs on the other's advancing prospects. ``The truth is, we're
very close,'' George W. Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   They are products of a intensely driven and tightly knit family.
``It's a competitive family,'' said Chase Untermeyer, who was
George Bush's appointments secretary and has known the family for
many years. ``I don't think it's competitive with a hard edge to
it, but if you ever see the Bushes playing tennis or even
backgammon, it can be pretty frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe the relationship between the two
brothers, Bonds answered instantly. ``Spirited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   George Strake, a former Texas secretary of state and Republican
chairman who also knows the family well, said, ``They may be
competitive on one level. But when it comes to politics, they go
back to being bloodbrothers and allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush was the first son to take an interest in a political
life, and it came as a surprise to many when it was not him, but
his older brother, who was successful in 1994 when the brothers
first ran for governor.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush alienated many black Florida voters in 1994 and
stridently pushed a conservative message that scared off some
moderates. His older brother, although just as conservative as Jeb
on many issues, ran a more upbeat, unconfrontational campaign and
has governed in such close partnership with Democratic leaders that
Texas' retiring Democratic lieutenant governor backed Bush for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Jeb Bush seemed to have learned a lesson from
his brother's success.
</P>
<P>
   He aggressively courted liberal Democrats and voter groups
usually ignored by Republican candidates in Florida, stressing
compassion and inclusiveness as campaign themes. He also reached
out to blacks and stressed his own family's diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children are Hispanic,'' he said of his two sons and
daughter during campaign stops in South Florida in fluent, slightly
accented Spanish while his Mexican-American wife of 24 years,
Columba, appeared on Spanish-language television ads on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Susan A. MacManus, a political scientist at the University of
South Florida in Tampa, said that she believes Jeb Bush has ``seen
that a middle-of-the-road strategy has been extremely effective in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Jeb Bush say that the 1998 campaigner _ the one
who adopted a style more like his brother's _ was the result of
soul-searching and personal growth over the last four years, and
they expect it to continue throughout his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no epiphany,'' said Jeb Bush. ``Life is a journey. I
hope I never stop learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers said they look forward not only to leading their
respective states but to working together on issues of common
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great moment for me,'' George W. Bush said. ``It's
going to be great to see him at that first Republican governor's
conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers intend to be at each other's inaugurations. Then
they will face fresh legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   And then, George W. Bush will face a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his standing in the polls and a network of political
supporters who once supported his father, Bush has consistently
tried to deflect presidential speculation by saying that his focus
was on winning re-election in Texas (``I hardly ever think about
it,'' he said, ``Except every day when people ask me about it.'').
He has also said that he had some reluctance about putting his
family into a national political spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said that he has not encouraged his brother to run for
president because ``that decision has to be personal'' but that he
hopes he will.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the campaign wound down, George W. Bush still
insisted that he had not made up his mind, but said he knew that he
could not wait much longer.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, he needs to work on his inauguration address.
Then, he needs to make sure that the legislative session that opens
in January is off to a solid start. Sometime, probably around
April, he said, he will take some uninterrupted time and think
through the whole notion of a presidential bid. An answer will most
likely come soon afterward, he said, later in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign plane began to dip down along the edge of East
Texas, the thick, dark Sabine River twisting languidly along the
Louisiana line. The governor didn't want to talk about delegate
counts or presidential strategies. That's for later.
</P>
<P>
   But surely he had to acknowledge that having a brother running
the fourth largest state in the union wouldn't be a bad thing for a
presidential candidate?
</P>
<P>
   He cocked his head and a smile crept up one side of his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be helpful, wouldn't it?'' he said.

 &HT;    MURRAY LOOKING FOR MORE THAN EFFORT
 &HT;    By CHERYL ROSENBERG
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. - Florida Panthers coach Terry Murray didn't
throw any chairs or yell and scream or even necessarily point
fingers. The closed-door team meeting after Florida's 6-2 loss to
the New York Islanders Monday was more a chance for everyone to
clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a time to get in there and lose your composure,''
said Murray after practice Tuesday.``That's not what happened.
These kinds of meetings are beneficial. But the only way you know
if there are results on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   That will happen Wednesday against the Chicago Blackhawks at the
National Car Rental Center. Until then, Murray had to gather clues
from the way the team practices Tuesday and today.
</P>
<P>
   He's found he's had to be patient with this team, which he said
played so well coming out of training camp. If the Panthers can get
to - and maintain - that level of play for 10 or 15 games, Murray
could get a better feel of exactly what the potential of each
player is and what he should expect from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy to accept if you're overmatched or
overpowered,'' Murray said. ``But a game against the Islanders,
with a team you have to be competitive with, the way we played was
a bigger red flag. We can't mistake activity for achievement. We're
chasing the puck with no purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers don't sustain any sort of intensity level
throughout the game. They got scored upon 71 seconds into the game
against the Islanders, but came back to take a 2-1 lead. But that
was it.
</P>
<P>
   Players were caught out of position, there were too many
turnovers, and goalie Sean Burke made easy target practice for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, according to the players, is their
inability to stick to Murray's system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get frustrated and you do things you wouldn't normally
do,'' Bill Lindsay said. ``It's tough on the coach when he sets the
game plan and the players don't follow it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not, no matter how it may appear, a lack of effort. It
might actually be too much effort. The team gets down, and everyone
wants to make every play on the ice, even when it's not his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, the better things go for us, we start to fall
apart,'' said captain Scott Mellanby, who played in his first game
after missing xx games with a groin pull. ``Sometimes, it takes
patience to say in you position. Sometimes you get overanxious.
That commitment is hard work, to stay put. There's a fine line
between working hard and being overcommitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when a team is made to look unorganized, or made to
look lost, or to look like their not working. Guys work harder,
chase the puck more, and it accomplishes less.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray is not panicking. He doesn't need to do anything too
drastic yet. He sent a little shock wave with the benching of
Robert Svehla and Ray Whitney Oc.t 24. Since then, the Panthers are
1-3.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's confident Florida will find the consistency it's
lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing problems on ourselves,'' Murray said. ``We're
the problem. We feel we can correct that. We're just talking
fundamentals here. We're not talking about building the space
shuttle.''

 &HT;    A giant cocoon? OK, now we're paying attention
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service-Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Giant Cocoon Crushes Fashion Editors!'
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Fashion Week. Five days in a park in midtown
Manhattan, with designers showing their Spring 1999 clothes and
doing whatever they can to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   A runway show is simple _ 20 minutes of tall, thin women
strutting in a designer's new stuff. The problem is, with a dozen
shows a day things start to run together.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Badgley Mischka show had a real grass runway,
complete with cricket chirpings while people took their seats. (The
models' Manolo Blahnik heels looked, and acted, like oversized golf
tees.)
</P>
<P>
   And that's why, perhaps, the BCBG show played a dance mix of
that Celine Dion Titanic song. (Try and get that out of your head.)
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, the cocoon. It rolled out at the end of the Buggirl
show, looking like a piece of Wrigley's someone chewed without
unwrapping. As a model emerged wearing what was touted as the
``look'' for 1999, the cocoon tipped off the runway onto the first
row of editors, who pushed it back upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown craft paper,'' explained Mimi That, wife of Buggirl
designer Alex That. ``Sprayed with silver and stuffed with
plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's events started at 9 a.m. and ended about the time
rapper Sean ``Puffy'' Combs yawned in the front row of the 9 p.m.
Marc Jacobs show.
</P>
<P>
   Combs came with a bodyguard, and Marla Maples showed up with one
at BCBG. (Not that fashion shows are dangerous events, populated as
they are with wispy models with names like Haylynn and Noot.)
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump was at the Marc Jacobs show with girlfriend Melania
Knauss, and Ivana came to Carolina Herrera and Badgley Mischka.
</P>
<P>
   Ivana said she didn't know whether daughter Ivanka, 17, would
model in any shows this week. Working the shows in Paris made her
miss school.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a day of shows, spring 1999 hair looks like long and
wispy. The folks at Badgley Mischka were so determined they slapped
wigs on the shorter-haired girls.

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton watched the election returns roll
in Tuesday night much the same way that he had campaigned: from the
White House, in the company of loyal friends and quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has bitterly complained in the last two days about
the political culture of Washington, the president remained
sequestered with his wife, Hillary, here rather than venture into a
country that was molding his political fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us know what is going to happen,'' Clinton said
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if this election, with impeachment hearings looming,
was a referendum on whether he should stay in office, the president
replied that it was ``a referendum on all the hopes of the American
people for the future and their assessment of the present
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton monitored the returns for part of the evening in the
office of John D. Podesta, his chief of staff, and telephoned
several Democrats across the country as they won or lost their
campaigns. Hillary Rodham Clinton spent the evening watching the
movie ``Beloved'' in the White House theater.
</P>
<P>
   Like birthdays for others, elections have served as signposts in
Clinton's life, and he seemed to be in a philosophical mood
Tuesday. Answering a handful of questions before a lengthy meeting
with his economic advisers, he seized on a reporter's observation
that Election Day marked his ``sixth anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been six very good years, very good years for our
country,'' Clinton said. ``And as I tell everybody around here,
even the bad days are good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke Tuesday with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico
about storm damage in Central America, and with Prime Minister Tony
Blair of England about Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But though his aides said the president seemed focused on such
matters, they said he was quite nervous about the election. His
political director, Craig Smith, regularly updated him throughout
the day, and the president placed several calls to friends around
the country, asking, in the words of one adviser, ``Whaddaya hear,
whaddaya know, whaddaya think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's desperately worried about the money,'' the adviser said,
referring to a $110 million Republican Party advantage in
fund-raising in this election. ``All the late information was good,
all the polling and the anecdotal stuff, but they've got so much
more money, and he's just haunted by how much more money they
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, some White House aides speculated that
Democrats might actually gain seats in the midterm elections. But
such talk faded as the Monica Lewinsky scandal intensified this
summer. Now they are emphasizing that money, rather than any
presidential dalliance and lies, gave the Republicans a powerful
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a last-minute push for help from donors, Clinton
and other Democrats worked hard in recent days to encourage black
voters _ among the most reliable Democrats _ to go to the polls.
That strategy appeared to be paying off, White House aides said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of recent interviews with news organizations
oriented toward black and Hispanic Americans, Clinton repeatedly
urged his listeners to vote, warning that Republicans would
obstruct policies beneficial to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of how much his political position has recovered
since his acknowledgment of an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton
tried to turn the scandal to his advantage, suggesting that
Republicans who were focused on it could not govern effectively.
The president presented himself as the victim of relentless
political enemies obsessed with scandal, in an interview broadcast
Monday night on the cable network BET.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of a permanent political class in Washington
that tends to thrive on such matters because they're not affected
by what I came here to do,'' Clinton said. He reeled off policy
goals, like raising the minimum wage, that he said did not matter
to such people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a group in America where the acquisition of political
power is more important than the purpose for which it's used,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton said some of his opponents never thought they would have
another Democratic president in their lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones that are consumed with personal animosity toward me
or toward Hillary,'' he said, ``I think are just angry because they
thought they and their crowd would always be able to drive up to
the West Wing to work every day.'' He said that he was ``not even
angry at them anymore,'' adding, ``I'm just sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Clinton said the elections of 1992
and 1996 were the most important of his career. But this election,
he said, is ``very important to me because it will determine how
much I can do for the American people in the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took part in few campaign-style rallies this year. His
aides said they decided on a Rose-Garden strategy well before
Clinton was enveloped by scandal. In 1994, they said, sending
Clinton out to campaign seemed to hurt candidates' chances, and
previous presidents seemed to do little good for their parties'
candidates in off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton raised money for Democrats and doggedly
highlighted a select handful of issues, even as the furor over Ms.
Lewinsky seemed to be drowning him out. Other Democrats picked up
on those same themes _ shoring up Social Security, raising the
minimum wage, modernizing classrooms _ with a unanimity not seen
since 1992, White House aides said.

WITH NIEDERMAYER BACK ON ICE, DEVILS BEAT RANGERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Scott Niedermayer is well aware of what
the New Jersey Devils expect of him now that he has signed a $6.5
million contract for two seasons. He knows that no Devils player
will be saddled with higher expectations for the remainder of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer made his season debut Tuesday night, and the Devils
seemed more offensive minded as they posted their third consecutive
victory, a 3-1 defeat of the New York Rangers at Continental Arena.
It was the Rangers' first loss in their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richter had not allowed a goal in 140 minutes 57 seconds
after posting shutouts in two previous games. His scoreless streak
came to an end at 14:53 into the game, when Brendan Morrison took a
pass from Dave Andreychuk on the right, moved into the middle and
converted his own rebound for his second of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison's goal came while the Devils were on their second
manpower advantage in the game that was created when Peter Popovic
cross-checked Jason Arnott in front of Richter while the Devils had
pinned the Rangers in their zone.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Stevens tied the score for the Rangers with his second
goal of the season at 9:30 of the middle period, when he jumped on
a rebound from a shot by John MacLean, the former Devil who was
jeered loudly every time he touched the puck.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean did well to come around from left to right and take a
shot from the high slot before Stevens found the target. MacLean's
assist must have been gratifying because he probably expected
better treatment from Devils fans in his first appearance back
after 15 years of service with the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   MacLean's best chance for a goal came with 6:39 left, when he
found himself alone near Martin Brodeur, but the Devils' goaltender
denied him from close range, holding his ground for his best save
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens put the Devils ahead with his first of the season
with 1:57 left in the second period, when he took a pass from Brian
Rolston on the left and beat Richter with a shot from a stride
inside the blue line. Richter appeared to be handcuffed on the shot
because he was partially screened by his defenseman Ulf Samuelsson
as the puck sailed by his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Pandolfo sealed the triumph with 2:27 left and extended the
Devils' undefeated streak against the Rangers to 11 games (7-0-4).
Pandolfo beat Richter from close range after a pass by Rolston at a
time Samuelsson and Wayne Gretzky failed to clear just a foot away
from Richter.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a restricted free agent without a deal, Niedermayer had had
four difficult months to think about what he wanted to accomplish
upon his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect a lot from me, and I have some expectations of
myself, especially after what I did last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer has led the Devils' defensemen in scoring the last
three years, but last season was his best with 14 goals and 43
assists. The 57-point total tied him for second in scoring among
the league's defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   One reason people expect Niedermayer to be even more productive
this season is that the Devils are trying to play a more open game
under their first-year coach, Robbie Ftorek, than they did for five
years under Jacques Lemaire.
</P>
<P>
   Ten games into this season, the Devils have failed to show any
signs of breaking away from Lemaire's style, which emphasized
defense first and foremost. The Devils have yet to score more than
three goals in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Defense is still their priority, and it appears that it will
continue to be for a while despite Niedermayer's return. Slava
Fetisov, the top assistant in charge of defensemen, confirmed this
after Niedermayer's first practice with the Devils on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has all the tools of a great offensive defenseman,''
Fetisov said, ``but I still want him to do defense. With his
skating ability he can play good defense and still jump into the
attack and join the rush.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about when he will carry the puck into the attacking
zone, Niedermayer said, ``Slava has a couple of ideas on the
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Niedermayer enters the attacking zone with the puck,
multiple options and opportunities seem to unfold for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real good about the possibilities because Robbie lets
you know what he wants all the time,'' Niedermayer said, referring
to Ftorek. ``The thing is you try to have fun when you play.''

EDITORIAL: THINKING AHEAD ON TRAFFIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman's plan to open the underutilized car-pool
lanes on Interstates 80 and 287 to all vehicles may well pacify
irate motorists in northern New Jersey. But it is a short-term
response that can only delay the kind of creative experimentation
necessary to improve traffic flow in the New York metropolitan
area, which is notorious for dirty air, bottlenecks and rush-hour
jams.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, opposition to these high-occupancy-vehicle,
or HOV, lanes sounds reasonable. I-80's lanes have met the minimal
target of carrying 700 vehicles an hour, but those on I-287 never
did. So why not convert them to regular lanes, easing traffic flows
for everyone? The answer lies in the state's own forecasts. Even if
the HOV lanes are converted, I-287 will be congested by 2005 or
2006, while I-80 is already close to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does New Jersey want to drop these two HOV lanes, it
intends to walk away from repaying Washington the $240 million in
federal aid spent building them. Members of the state's
congressional delegation inserted language in the omnibus budget
bill waiving $140 million that built the I-287 HOV lanes. They are
seeking another waiver for the I-80 lanes. These maneuvers could
encourage other states to seek similar relief just when officials
nationwide ought to be daring and creative. On Long Island, for
example, critics of the state-funded car-pool lanes on the Long
Island Expressway want New York state to open them to all traffic
on an experimental basis, an idea the state rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that HOV lanes can serve a useful purpose if used
creatively. Houston, California's Orange County and San Diego have
taken that path. The most innovative experiment is in the San Diego
region. Officials there have employed electronic toll collection to
turn underused HOV lanes into toll lanes. Solo motorists pay a
variable toll tied to time of day and congestion to use the lanes,
which remain free of charge for buses, vans and car pools of two or
more. Use of the fast-moving lanes has risen, opening up space in
other lanes and generating revenue for an express bus service.
</P>
<P>
   The New York metropolitan region cannot pave its way out of
congestion. Expanding rapid-rail alternatives takes years. That
makes congestion pricing an attractive strategy that the region has
been reluctant to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Thruway Authority runs a very modest
experiment at the Tappan Zee Bridge for trucks. Drivers pay higher
tolls during the morning rush hours and a lower toll if they cross
before that and use the E-Z Pass electronic toll system. The
authority is also studying congestion pricing for motorists. The
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which has a huge interest in
speeding traffic flow (and reducing pollution) at bridge and tunnel
crossings, is not even that far along.
</P>
<P>
   Communities have had the option to experiment with congestion
pricing since late 1991. The only major obstacle on both sides of
the Hudson is political inertia.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Charles Schumer's election Tuesday to the U.S.
Senate was more than the crowning achievement of a political career
that has spanned nearly a quarter of a century. It was a testament
to his own tenacity, to the high expectations he set for himself
long before his election to the New York state Assembly when he was
only 23.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had often despaired of finding a candidate dogged
enough to topple Alfonse D'Amato, the powerful three-term
Republican incumbent. But in Schumer, they got everything they
needed and more. They got an exuberant campaigner with stamina to
burn. They got a brawler willing to fight fire with fire, and mud
with mud. And they got someone whose ambition and skill at
self-promotion easily rivaled _ and quite possibly surpassed _
D'Amato's.
</P>
<P>
   Even late Monday, after a Manhattan rally with Hillary Rodham
Clinton provided the perfect finishing touch to weeks of intense
stumping, Schumer insisted on going the extra mile _ actually,
hundreds of them _ and flying to Buffalo for another event. He had
already hit Albany and Rochester earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is unbelievably focused, and when he sets his sights on a
goal, he cannot be deterred,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic
political consultant in Washington who worked on Schumer's
congressional staff in the early 1980s. ``At any given moment in a
24-hour day, he wants to be doing something to move the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   And part of that agenda, friends and colleagues said, has always
been the ascendancy of Chuck Schumer. ``As vain as the rest of us
are, Chuck is a step above,'' said New York state Assemblyman
Alexander B. Grannis, who has known Schumer for nearly a quarter of
a century. ``I've seen a lot of camera hoggers in my time, and
Chuck was one of the better ones.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Schumer, 47, has been reaching for the goal of a
statewide office for decades, almost since his election to the
Assembly in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, still just 30, he graduated to the House of
Representatives, and his 18 years there were characterized by a
steady rise in prominence and an unmistakable shift toward a less
liberal, more moderate political persona, all of which set the
stage for Tuesday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is a career politician in the most literal, truest sense
of the phrase. Politics is the only profession he has really known,
and in one way or another, it has shaped or been entwined with
every aspect of his existence since his graduation from Harvard Law
School in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   After he was mugged in the late 1970s, he recycled the episode
into political fodder, discussing the experience in a leaflet he
passed out during his first campaign for Congress in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He wedged his wedding that year into the gap of time between the
Democratic primary, which he knew would be bitterly contested, and
the general election, which he knew would be a cakewalk.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Iris Weinshall Schumer, who now works as a deputy
commissioner in the New York City Department for Citywide
Administrative Services, recalled that he was so wrapped up in his
campaign and other work that he never glanced at the wedding
invitations long enough to know that when she told him to arrive at
noon, she was factoring in his preoccupations and habitual
tardiness. He predictably showed up an hour later, not realizing he
was right on time.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said in a recent interview that he has always had a way
of getting wholly absorbed in the challenges _ big and small,
meaningful and meaningless _ that he puts before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was little and sick once I said to myself, `I'm going
to turn all 2,220 pages of the dictionary,' and I sat there and
turned them,'' Schumer said with a broad smile. ``And I liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused briefly, as if trying to divine the moral of his own
story. ``I'm not that introspective a soul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ellis Schumer was born on Nov. 23, 1950, and grew up in
a middle-class Jewish family in Flatbush. His father, Abe, owned a
small exterminating company. His mother, Selma, stayed home to
raise Chuck and his younger siblings, Fran and Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Schumer hated his job but felt bound to it, and he and his
wife instructed their children to achieve more. Chuck, as his
parents called him, heeded that lesson well. He towered over many
of the other kids in his Brooklyn neighborhood not just in terms of
his uncommon height or intellect. He perhaps stood out most of all
for his determination to excel, and for how much he reveled in
whatever stature he attained.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be one of the smartest,'' his father said. ``No
question about it. He was competitive. He always had a competitive
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated first in his class at James Madison High School in
1967 and went on to Harvard University for college and law school.
In 1974, he postponed taking the bar exam so he could campaign for
the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer had been bitten by the political bug as an undergraduate
during the late 1960s, a time of social unrest and activism, and
understood himself well enough to know that he would enjoy the glow
of the public spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   In the Assembly and then in Congress, he elicited both respect
and resentment for how relentlessly he pursued his legislative and
political intentions, how hard he charged.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest testimony to his diligence and perseverance
was the sweeping 1994 crime bill, which banned the sale of assault
weapons, added tens of thousands of police officers to city streets
across the country and expanded the applicability of the death
penalty to scores of federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was a principal architect and proponent of the
legislation, which also shored up his claim _ crucial to his appeal
over the last few months to a statewide electorate more
conservative than the voters in his congressional district of
Brooklyn and Queens _ that he was a centrist, flexible Democrat
more interested in solving people's problems than hewing to any
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer both portrays himself and seems to see himself as a
politician atypically in touch with life outside Washington. His
wife and his two children, Jessica, 14, and Alison, 9, do not even
accompany him there when Congress is in session. They stay in the
family's apartment in Park Slope, and Schumer crashes on a bed in
the living room of a town house on Capitol Hill that he shares with
three other lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   One of his roommates, Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said that
during the Senate campaign, Schumer came back to the town house
from the office later and later, because he had realized that there
was indeed a way to expand the usable hours of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He learned there were different time zones,'' Gejdenson said,
``and that he could continue making fund-raising calls into the
night by working his way west. Chuck has new friends in Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   And they now have a new friend in the U.S. Senate.

SARAH KOREIN, 93, PROPERTY INVESTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sarah Korein, who acquired some of the choicest real
estate in Manhattan through bare-knuckle tactics cloaked by
grandmotherly charm, died on Thursday at the North Division of Beth
Israel Medical Center. She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter,
Elysabeth Kleinhans, a lawyer who manages the real-estate business
with other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city where real estate is a popular obsession on a par
with sports and soap operas, Mrs. Korein (KO-reen) was almost
unknown outside professional circles _ exactly as she preferred it.
Her name rarely appeared in public.
</P>
<P>
   And the face that she did present was more Dresden doll than
Machiavellian negotiator. But buyers or sellers who assumed they
were sitting across the table from sweetness and light did so at
their peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the toughest deal maker imaginable,'' said Mary Ann
Tighe, executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, a real-estate
brokerage and management concern. ``She squeezed out every last
penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Korein could even profit from property she never owned.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, for instance, she put a $250,000 deposit on
the Osborne Apartments, 205 West 57th St. Advised against
consummating the purchase because the building had no long-term
investment value, she had to figure a way out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   So she reached out to a New York Times reporter to say that she
planned to demolish the Osborne and replace it with a new tower,
her son, Dr. Julius Korein, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When tenants besieged her office the next day, she comforted
them. ``I don't want to take anyone's home away,'' she insisted,
offering to sell them the contract. They paid her $500,000, not
only taking her off the hook but also leaving her $250,000 richer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She certainly was one of the best negotiators I've ever met,''
said the developer William Zeckendorf Jr. ``Perhaps in the
beginning, people didn't take her seriously enough. It didn't take
them long to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   A common story in the real-estate industry was that Mrs. Korein
would keep different buyers in separate rooms and shuttle back and
forth among the parties until she had extracted the terms she
sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even into her old age, everyone thought she was a charming,
lovely little woman,'' her daughter said. ``Let me tell you, that's
not where she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Korein's trophies speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At her death, her properties _ either land alone or both land
and building _ included Lever House, the modernist landmark at 390
Park Ave.; the old Equitable Building, 120 Broadway, a tower so
gargantuan that it inspired New York's first zoning law in 1916,
and One Penn Plaza on Seventh Avenue, between 33rd and 34th
streets, the fifth-largest office building in the city.
</P>
<P>
   She also owned the Delmonico Hotel, 502 Park Ave.; the Swiss
Center, 606 Fifth Ave.; and two apartment towers on Central Park
South, Nos. 220 and 240, overlooking Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Korein bought and sold the Beresford Apartments, 211
Central Park West; the former Croyden Hotel, 12 East 86th St.; the
former Fifth Avenue Hotel, 24 Fifth Ave.; and the Schwab House
apartments, a full-block complex between West End Avenue and
Riverside Drive, 73rd and 74th streets.
</P>
<P>
   The family will not estimate the size and value of her
portfolio, and not only because owners are customarily loath to
disclose such things (tax assessors read the newspapers). Rather,
Mrs. Korein held a variety of positions with any number of
partners, making it difficult to apportion her share.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the bottom line, there was no question that she was
wealthy and tough _ a ``great Realtor,'' in the words of Leona
Helmsley, perhaps the only figure to whom she might immediately be
likened.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tighe said Mrs. Korein was ``always an object of
fascination, certainly to women coming up in the business, but even
to men, because there was no one else of her gender who
accomplished what she did when she did.''
</P>
<P>
   But while both Mrs. Korein and Mrs. Helmsley were known for
being as aggressive as necessary to survive in the male-dominated
industry, there was a significant difference: Mrs. Korein created
her portfolio from scratch.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sarah Rabinowitz was born in Germany and reared in Palestine,
where she met Isidor Korein, a Hungarian engineer who arrived there
after World War I. They married and immigrated to the United States
in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, for $6,000, the Koreins bought a six-story apartment
house in Brooklyn _ not as an investment but so that family members
would have a place to live rent-free.
</P>
<P>
   Their first substantial investment, in 1941, was a large
apartment building at 8701 Shore Rd. in the Bay Ridge section of
Brooklyn. To make the units more attractive, Mrs. Korein bought
dozens of refrigerators and stored them in the building's emptied
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of World War II, refrigerator production
virtually ended as industry retooled for military needs. So Mrs.
Korein was able to sell the refrigerators at a high profit. And
because of the shortage of apartments, she was able to rent the
Shore Road building even without the new refrigerators.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of her major secrets was somehow being in the right place
at the right time with the right goods,'' Ms. Kleinhans said.
</P>
<P>
   After the war and against her husband's wishes, Mrs. Korein
pursued investment in Manhattan, beginning with 715 Park Ave., an
apartment building on the southeast corner of 70th Street. In time,
she advised Cardinal Francis Spellman, the archbishop of New York,
on real estate, her children said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Korein made use of the nonamortizing mortgage, under which
she would pay slightly higher interest rates but nothing toward
principal, thus freeing cash for further investments. By the time
the loan itself came due, her properties typically had appreciated
so much in value that Mrs. Korein could easily pay off the amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of her properties, without exception, did nothing but
increase in value,'' said Andrew Singer, the chairman of Singer &AMP;
Bassuk Organization, who arranged financing for Mrs. Korein over
many years.
</P>
<P>
   Isidor Korein died in 1976. But even when he was alive, Mrs.
Korein was the ``driving force,'' said Lawrence Friedland, the
family's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he recalled, Mrs. Korein was about to sign a
contract for the Beresford. At the last minute, her partners
balked, fearing the risk of buying such a big building in what was
then a rough-and-tumble neighborhood. She signed the contract
anyway and more than doubled her money when she sold the property a
few years later, Friedland said.
</P>

   Perhaps Mrs. Korein's biggest false step was a foray into

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most of his 18 years in Washington, Alfonse
Marcello D'Amato has been the senator who never quite fit in. He
was a conservative in a state of moderates and liberals, a
machine-bred politician in an institution sprinkled heavily with
Ivy League-trained debaters, a colorful showman whose predecessors
and colleagues, from Herbert Lehman to Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
were more muted and high-brow.
</P>
<P>
   But until Tuesday, D'Amato, a Republican, had confounded his
enemies time and again with sheer wiliness, energy and gall. Once
the outsider, he had become the consummate Senate inside player.
Dogged by ethics investigations, he had turned inquisitor into
President Clinton's Whitewater dealings. Dismissed by his critics
as a clown, he had learned to champion the hopes and resentments of
suburban and upstate voters who had carried him to victory three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, those voters failed to answer his call for a
fourth time, heeding instead the message of his Democratic
challenger, Rep. Charles E. Schumer, that D'Amato could not be
trusted, had been in office for too long and had embarrassed
himself one too many times.
</P>
<P>
   At Republicans headquarters at the Hilton Hotel and Towers in
Manhattan on Tuesday night, news of D'Amato's loss dampened the
victory celebrations for Gov. George Pataki. Some party loyalists
insisted through the night that D'Amato might still pull it out, as
he did in 1992, while others fretted that upstate New York would be
hurt by a Schumer victory.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls show that D'Amato lost support almost across the
board from 1992, but particularly among Jewish voters, despite his
heavy campaigning in Jewish neighborhoods in the campaign's final
weeks. It also appeared that Schumer did a better job of holding
onto Democratic voters than Robert Abrams did in 1992, when a
quarter of Democrats voted for D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, 61, lost in large part, analysts said, because Schumer
was the toughest candidate he had ever faced. The nine-term
congressman was much better funded and far more aggressive than
Abrams was in 1992. Schumer also had a strong 18-year record in the
House, had positioned himself well as a moderate who could appeal
to independent voters and centrists from both parties and was a
tireless campaigner who answered each of D'Amato's attacks with a
counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, part of D'Amato's problem was himself. Years of
investigations into his ethics and his numerous high-profile gaffes
_ like calling Schumer a ``putzhead'' during the campaign, then
denying it _ had made him dangerously unpopular with a large
segment of voters. Even his handlers were so convinced about the
negativeness of his image that they kept him from speaking in his
own television commercials and relied heavily on more popular
surrogates, like Gov. George Pataki, to carry his campaign message.
</P>
<P>
   But the cartoonish image of D'Amato that voters saw this year
did not do complete justice to his personality and style. D'Amato
was often a man defined by paradoxes. His bitterest rivals reviled
his hardball campaign tactics, then carefully studied and mimicked
them. Democrats called him sleazy, yet found that he was true to
his word when they did business with him. He could be profane and
loutish in public, but gentle even tender in private. He was
brutally vindictive toward his enemies, but doggedly loyal to
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Though a fundamentally conservative politician who staunchly
opposed abortion and gun control and consistently advocated tax
cuts and harsh criminal penalties, D'Amato has always found ways to
moderate his image. No ideologue, his guiding philosophy was a
pragmatism born of the place that nurtured his politics, Nassau
County.
</P>
<P>
   The grandchild of Italian immigrants, D'Amato was born in
Brooklyn but raised in Island Park in the heart of middle class
Long Island. After he helped put himself through Syracuse
University and Law School by working as a janitor, no Manhattan law
firm would hire him. He returned home, getting a job as a lawyer
for Nassau County government. Those experiences forever shaped his
political views.
</P>
<P>
   From that time on, he strove to articulate the fears of
middle-class homeowners infuriated by property taxes and worried
about losing economic ground, the anger of small business owners
beleaguered by regulations and the resentments of working-class
parents toward the ``liberal elites'' who seemed to control their
schools, their newspapers, their banks and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps better than anyone in the Senate, D'Amato understood
that to these voters, Congress was a distant and abstract place. So
he constantly searched for people _ breast cancer patients denied
insurance benefits, Holocaust survivors trying to reclaim stolen
assets _ whose gut-wrenching cases he could champion. Win or lose,
he invoked their stories as evidence that he was a fighter for the
little guy.
</P>
<P>
   A man whose first job came through the patronage system, he ran
his Senate office like a Nassau County ward heeler, returning calls
from almost any elected official, honoring the requests of big city
mayors and small town supervisors alike when they asked for help _
and expecting their support in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate him,'' said Frances Werner, former chairwoman of the
Queens Republican committee whom D'Amato helped oust. ``But when he
says he'll do something, he comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, D'Amato tried to break free from his reputation as
Senator Pothole, embracing larger issues, such as banking law or
Israeli policy. But history may remember him best for his mistakes,
from croaking ``Old MacDonald had some pork'' during a 1994 Senate
debate to using broken English to mock Lance Ito, the judge in O.J.
Simpson's criminal trial, during a 1995 radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   What also defined D'Amato for many voters was his brass knuckles
political style. When he ran for the Senate for the first time in
1980, he did not shy away from reminding voters that the four-term
Republican incumbent, Sen. Jacob Javits, was 76 years old and not
in the best health. In each election since, he has lambasted his
opponents as liberals, as well as ``wimp'' in the case of Abrams in
1992 and ``putzhead'' in the case of Schumer this year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, and many Republicans, were fond of arguing that many
of the people he helped over 18 years were campaign contributors,
particularly financial services companies. In 1991, the Senate
Ethics Committee faulted him for allowing his brother to use his
Senate office and stationary to help a client.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also privately admired the ways in which he fudged
or fine-tuned his political positions to pick off Democratic voters
while holding down his conservative base _ though on one issue, his
opposition to abortion, he remained firm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for breast cancer research money won over women angry
with his opposition to abortion. Pushing to reduce automatic teller
machine fees helped counter assertions that he was too friendly to
big banks. Advocating civil rights for gays and lesbians balanced
accusations that he was an extreme right-winger.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the oddest paradox of D'Amato's long career was that
this year, as he sat atop one of the most potent political
organizations in the country, he had to depend on high-profile
surrogates, like Pataki, to woo back voters who had grown weary of
him. In a testament to his success in delivering for New York City,
D'Amato even managed to bring two one-time enemies, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and former Mayor Ed Koch, to campaign together for him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as he stumped with D'Amato in Brighton Beach, Koch
was asked if this year's race was as close as in 1992, when D'Amato
won by a single percentage point. ``Closer,'' replied Koch, a look
of worry crossing his face.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato, recognizing the time had come to help himself, cut
Koch off. ``We're in better shape than we were in '92,'' he said,
then turned away.

COMMENTARY: GROWING UP WITH IL DUCE THE DELI MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a darkened stage, Marco Greco breathed slowly,
rolled his shoulders and prepared to transport himself back to 1975
and Arthur Avenue. A spotlight vanquished the void, rendering his
face into a chiaroscuro mask of a wide-eyed child. ``Pop,'' he said
in a pleading little boy voice, ``I don't like to make the
mozzarella. I just like to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned slightly to the side and assumed the cocky,
tilted-head stance of an older man. ``Hey, no complain!'' boomed
the heavily accented voice. ``Act like a man. Always treat the
mozzarella like a bella femina. In life, baby, you be good to the
mozzarella and the mozzarella be good to you.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the stuff of Greco's life, in which he mastered the art
of making cheese at Mike's Deli, the Bronx landmark his father has
run for decades at the Arthur Avenue Market. Now he has turned it
into art yet again in ``Behind the Counter with Mussolini,'' a
one-man play about fathers and sons, dictators and dreams. At the
heart of the piece, which opens next week at the Theater at St.
Peter's Church on East 54th Street, is the struggle between an
immigrant father who works like a horse to live like a man, and his
son, who is drawn to another world beyond the deli counter.
</P>
<P>
   It is not one of those I-Hate-My-Parents psychodramas. The play,
like Greco's life, is a loving realization of the strength he drew
from the frenzied marketplace where shoppers shouted and haggled
with countermen for the best deals on ``pro-SHOOT'' and
``mooz-a-REL.'' His father's friends, food salesmen with giveaway
nicknames like Joe Bananas and Nicky Fish, are there. So, too, is
the more complicated figure of Il Duce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were growing up my father had a picture of Mussolini
behind the counter,'' Marco said. ``It's still hanging. We always
thought it was Uncle Fred, who was a sergeant in the U.S. Army. For
me, it became a way to use Mussolini as a metaphor. Who, at some
time in life, has not had the feeling their parents are
dictators?''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption growing up under his stern father was that he
would go into the family business. In the play, his character,
Armando, became the mozzarella king who resists any idea of leaving
the neighborhood. He spends time with his friends, who talk and act
as if they were copping lines from the ``How to Be a Guido
Handbook,'' replete with shorthand references to ``The Godfather,''
parts one and two. Life was ver-ry, ver-ry nice.
</P>
<P>
   But Marco, like Armando, began to change when he went to
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met the first girl who wasn't planning her wedding or
worrying about hair gel,'' Marco said. ``And I had an anthropology
teacher who was something else to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   What she taught him to look at was his culture. Suddenly, the
customers at the deli became real to him in a way he had never
noticed before. He learned their stories. He also began to consider
leaving the deli.
</P>
<P>
   The character in the play goes through Guid-tox and starts
wearing corduroy pants with cuffs,'' he said. ``When your universe
gets bigger, all of a sudden you can look at life very critically.
But when you spend all this time watching your father work, doing
it for you, it's not that easy to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Until somebody swiped a salami. Marco ran after the thief, his
father also in pursuit. They caught him on Crescent Avenue, where
father and son began to yell at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the process of arguing with my father, I grabbed the salami
and whacked the guy twice in the head,'' Marco said. ``There is no
pride in beating a guy with a salami. I couldn't believe I had come
to this over a $20 piece of meat. We were no longer the immigrants
off the boat desperate for two cents. What we did was vent the
frustration between father and son.''
</P>
<P>
   Marco went to study drama, and later he started a theater troupe
in the Bronx. He also traveled to the New World called Hollywood.
He had some roles, but they were the tired bits that the masters of
pop culture reserve for young Italians. Instead, he returned home
and started writing his play. In doing so, he applied one of is
father's lessons: Work is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared,'' he said during a break in rehearsal. ``If this
pleases the critics, my life can change drastically.''
</P>
<P>
   One critic has already approved. His father.
</P>
<P>
   ``By himself, he discovered I gave him something good,'' Michael
Greco said. ``The play, it's 100 percent true. That's why he makes
me a proud father. He finally found out who is Michael Greco.''
</P>
<P>
   No complaints, baby.

NO DECISION IN EARLY RETURNS FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Buffeted by a surge of energized Democratic voters,
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci Tuesday night found himself in a
tight battle with Attorney General Scott Harshbarger as the
Massachusetts gubernatorial race went to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns showed Cellucci and Harshbarger locked in a dead
heat in a race that election-eve polls showed favoring the
Republican acting governor and his running mate, Jane M. Swift,
over Harshbarger and Warren E. Tolman.
</P>
<P>
   The surprisingly tight race reflected a national trend Tuesday
in which Democrats _ benefiting from what some say is a backlash
against Republican impeachment attempts _ made strong showings in
US House and Senate races as well as gubernatorial contests.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cellucci was unexpectedly hit by an unusual political
phenomenon that threatened to sink his attempt to win a full
four-year term. Democrats nationwide bucked a historic trend in
which the party that controls the White House loses large numbers
of congressional seats in off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger has benefited from that,'' said US
Representative Martin T. Meehan, the Lowell Democrat. ``The base of
the Democratic Party, including the unions in Massachusetts, was
mobilized to get its members to polls in numbers no one realized.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters at both camps Tuesday nightwere settling in for a
long night as returns trickled in with no definite trends.
</P>
<P>
   The strong Democratic voting Tuesday also helped the state party
to sweep the contests for the other constitutional offices.
Secretary of State William F. Galvin, seeking a second four-year
term, and State Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci, first elected to the
post in 1986, handily won reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Shannon O'Brien, a former state senator from
Easthampton, won her bid to replace Republican Joseph D. Malone as
state treasurer, ending the GOP's eight-year lock on that office.
She defeated Bob Maginn, a wealthy business consultant from
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in the race for attorney general to replace
Harshbarger, his one-time protege, Middlesex County District
Attorney Thomas F. Reilly, a Democrat from Watertown, easily won
over his Republican rival, Brad Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also failed to gain another foothold in the
state's all-Democratic congressional delegation. In the North
Shore's 6th District, US Representative John F. Tierney of Salem
turned back a rematch challenge from Republican Peter G. Torkildsen
of Danvers, who had held the seat for two terms. Tierney had
defeated him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the 3rd District, which extends from Worcester to Fall River,
US Representative James McGovern, a first-term Democrat from
Worcester, overcame his Republican challenger, Matthew J. Amorello,
a state senator from Grafton.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of Cellucci's strategy throughout the fall campaign
was to cut into Harshbarger's Democratic base, but surveys of
voters leaving the polls showed the attorney general, while not
widely popular among some rank-and-file members, was able to take
over three-quarters of his party's vote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harshbarger won a majority of women voters, a bloc
that earlier surveys showed backing Cellucci, in some cases by a
wide margin. Cellucci had courted women voters by citing his work
on domestic violence and by choosing Swift. Cellucci said working
mothers would have a voice in his administration through her.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger also got a big boost from several major
Massachusetts Democratic figures, including US Senators Edward M.
Kennedy and John F. Kerry, who made a series of appearances with
the Democratic nominee on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But, perhaps more important, Harshbarger received huge support
from organized labor, most notably the state AFL-CIO, which
provided him with workers and paid for mailings and leaflet-drops.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state is in an economic boom, Cellucci had been
struggling to establish an identity since he took over as governor
in July 1997 when William F. Weld resigned. A low-key figure who
had toiled in the state Legislature for the last 22 years, Cellucci
never commanded a high profile like Weld did.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cellucci was able to maintain a more disciplined campaign
message than Harshbarger, attacking the attorney general on
so-called wedge issues such as the death penalty, taxes, and
welfare. He was also able to fend off Harshbarger's attempts to
bring his personal finances into the debate. And he was even able
to beat Harshbarger where the attorney general lives _ the largely
Republican Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other races around the country, the Massachusetts
gubernatorial race, in terms of issues, was never about very much
at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci argued that he and former governor Weld were
responsible for the economic boom and that he was the fiscal
conservative who would continue the prosperity and impose
discipline at the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger argued that the state needed new leadership, one
that would bring compassion and innovative ideas to state
government.
</P>
<P>
   But no single issue bubbled up to dominate the campaign or
captivate the voters. At the same time, the rhetoric stayed highly
charged, negative, and personal, but the differences between the
two on issues such as education, child care, and expanded health
care seemed small.

LOS ANGELES TIMES LAYS OFF 250; MORE CUTS EXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In response to sagging profits and disappointing
ad revenue, the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday announced it laid off
250 employees in the first of three rounds of cuts to be done
before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions, which represent 3.9 percent of the paper's
staff, are the second for the newspaper since 1995, when 700 jobs
were cut, including 100 in the news division.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round also includes the elimination of 30 news
department positions and 20 operations department jobs through a
voluntary severance program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 50 news department jobs at the Times' San Fernando
Valley and Ventura County editions will be eliminated as the Times
scales down those sections. Workers are being offered jobs
elsewhere at the paper, such as in the Orange County edition and
the Times' Inland Empire bureau, where news coverage is being
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Times also cut back on the number of free-lance
reporters it uses for its various editions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the newspaper warned employees that it would reduce
expenses by trimming the size of its pages as well as reduce the
number of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors had circulated for weeks that cuts were imminent.
Tuesday's announcement came on Election Day, a time when most media
outlets were focused on election coverage.
</P>
<P>
   One local expert said the cuts would hurt the newspaper's news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem to me that there would be less depth and less
breadth of coverage in those areas (where jobs are being cut), and
those people who are left are going to have to work harder,'' said
Cynthia Rawitch, chairwoman of the department of journalism at
California State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The paper has about 6,400 employees, including more than 1,100
who work in its news gathering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also is hiring an outside company, APAC Teleservices
based in Deerfield, Ill., to handle customer circulation service
calls, a move that will result in the layoffs of 60 full-time and
70 part-time workers. Those cuts are included in the 250 jobs to be
cut.
</P>
<P>
   APAC employees in an office near Madison, Wis., will handle
Times reader service calls by February.
</P>
<P>
   Job cuts are necessary because of slow revenue growth at the
paper, executives and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times' long-term health depends on growth and we have
invested heavily to achieve that,'' Kathryn M. Downing, the paper's
recently named president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement. ``However, national and classified ad revenues are not
growing at the rates we anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   From July to September, the Times experienced a ``substantial''
decline in operating profit on a year-over-year basis, Downing
said. Newspaper spokeswoman Laura Morgan declined to say how much
profits fell during the three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beebe, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, said it
was likely a double-digit plunge, given that operating profits fell
5.7percent for the entire Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they made clear was that they had planned their cost base
around a budget for higher revenue that had not materialized and
they made it very clear they would do what they could to remedy
it,'' he said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QC; 
(2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror shares closed at $55.625, down 31.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Times hired John C. McKeon of Newsday as the
paper's third top advertising executive in the past 12 months. He
replaced Robert N. Brisco, who left the paper last month to become
president of Universal Studios Hollywood's theme park, CityWalk,
and the Universal City Cinemas, the studio's recreation group.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Times' parent company, Times Mirror Co., said it
would take a pretax charge of up to $225 million this year to pay
for restructuring at the Times and expects it to result in annual
savings of about $25million starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Mark H. Willes, chairman and chief executive
officer of Times Mirror and publisher of the Times, set a goal of
growing circulation at the Times by 50 percent to about 1.5 million
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, the Times launched a national edition, expanded
its Our Times community news sections and recently introduced a
redesigned features section called Southern California Living.
Changes in the Valley and Ventura County sections will be
implemented Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Times managers met early in the day with employees
who were losing their jobs. The company released news of the
reduction after the stock markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   One Valley edition news employee, who asked not to be named,
said the next round of layoffs is expected to come in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Making the announcement on a busy news day like Tuesday's
national election could be an attempt to minimize coverage, said
public relations executive Judy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations who announce news after the stock market closes,
or on Friday, or on the eve of elections usually do so to avoid the
type of news coverage they'd get at other times,'' said Johnson,
senior vice president of Golin/Harris International.
</P>
<P>
   Rawitch said the paper's announcement on Election Day doesn't
make much sense in terms of impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if I was going to have bad news I'd try to announce it
when no one was paying attention,'' said Rawitch, whose husband,
Bob Rawitch, is a former editor of the Times' (San Fernando) Valley
edition. ``But it doesn't mean that's what they necessarily did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times' Morgan said there was nothing special about the
timing.
</P>
<P>
   The Times is the nation's third-largest newspaper, with a
circulation of 1,067,540, according to figures released this week.

LOS ANGELES TIMES LAYS OFF 250; MORE CUTS EXPECTED

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In response to sagging profits and disappointing
ad revenue, the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday announced it laid off
250 employees in the first of three rounds of cuts to be done
before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions, which represent 3.9 percent of the paper's
staff, are the second for the newspaper since 1995, when 700 jobs
were cut, including 100 in the news division.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round also includes the elimination of 30 news
department positions and 20 operations department jobs through a
voluntary severance program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 50 news department jobs at the Times' San Fernando
Valley and Ventura County editions will be eliminated as the Times
scales down those sections. Workers are being offered jobs
elsewhere at the paper, such as in the Orange County edition and
the Times' Inland Empire bureau, where news coverage is being
increased.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Times also cut back on the number of free-lance
reporters it uses for its various editions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the newspaper warned employees that it would reduce
expenses by trimming the size of its pages as well as reduce the
number of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors had circulated for weeks that cuts were imminent.
Tuesday's announcement came on Election Day, a time when most media
outlets were focused on election coverage.
</P>
<P>
   One local expert said the cuts would hurt the newspaper's news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem to me that there would be less depth and less
breadth of coverage in those areas (where jobs are being cut), and
those people who are left are going to have to work harder,'' said
Cynthia Rawitch, chairwoman of the department of journalism at
California State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The paper has about 6,400 employees, including more than 1,100
who work in its news gathering operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also is hiring an outside company, APAC Teleservices
based in Deerfield, Ill., to handle customer circulation service
calls, a move that will result in the layoffs of 60 full-time and
70 part-time workers. Those cuts are included in the 250 jobs to be
cut.
</P>
<P>
   APAC employees in an office near Madison, Wis., will handle
Times reader service calls by February.
</P>
<P>
   Job cuts are necessary because of slow revenue growth at the
paper, executives and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Times' long-term health depends on growth and we have
invested heavily to achieve that,'' Kathryn M. Downing, the paper's
recently named president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement. ``However, national and classified ad revenues are not
growing at the rates we anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   From July to September, the Times experienced a ``substantial''
decline in operating profit on a year-over-year basis, Downing
said. Newspaper spokeswoman Laura Morgan declined to say how much
profits fell during the three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beebe, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, said it
was likely a double-digit plunge, given that operating profits fell
5.7percent for the entire Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they made clear was that they had planned their cost base
around a budget for higher revenue that had not materialized and
they made it very clear they would do what they could to remedy
it,'' he said. &UR;

   Times Mirror shares closed at $55.625, down 31.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Times hired John C. McKeon of Newsday as the
paper's third top advertising executive in the past 12 months. He
replaced Robert N. Brisco, who left the paper last month to become
president of Universal Studios Hollywood's theme park, CityWalk,
and the Universal City Cinemas, the studio's recreation group.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Times' parent company, Times Mirror Co., said it
would take a pretax charge of up to $225 million this year to pay
for restructuring at the Times and expects it to result in annual
savings of about $25million starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Mark H. Willes, chairman and chief executive
officer of Times Mirror and publisher of the Times, set a goal of
growing circulation at the Times by 50 percent to about 1.5 million
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, the Times launched a national edition, expanded
its Our Times community news sections and recently introduced a
redesigned features section called Southern California Living.
Changes in the Valley and Ventura County sections will be
implemented Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Times managers met early in the day with employees
who were losing their jobs. The company released news of the
reduction after the stock markets had closed.
</P>
<P>
   One Valley edition news employee, who asked not to be named,
said the next round of layoffs is expected to come in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Making the announcement on a busy news day like Tuesday's
national election could be an attempt to minimize coverage, said
public relations executive Judy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations who announce news after the stock market closes,
or on Friday, or on the eve of elections usually do so to avoid the
type of news coverage they'd get at other times,'' said Johnson,
senior vice president of Golin/Harris International.
</P>
<P>
   Rawitch said the paper's announcement on Election Day doesn't
make much sense in terms of impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if I was going to have bad news I'd try to announce it
when no one was paying attention,'' said Rawitch, whose husband,
Bob Rawitch, is a former editor of the Times' (San Fernando) Valley
edition. ``But it doesn't mean that's what they necessarily did.''
</P>

timing.

GOP KEEPS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL BUT SUFFERS EMBARRASSING LOSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans apparently kept control of Congress
Tuesday but faced an embarrassing loss of House seats and the
failure to achieve larger gains in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats knocked off two incumbent senators. They scored a
breath-taking victory in New York where Rep. Charles E. Schumer
knocked out Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato in a bitter,
expensive race which saw the candidates spend a total of about $32
million. The result was a shocker because of D'Amato's reputation
for pulling himself out of tight spots.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also scored a major upset in North Carolina where
challenger John Edwards defeated Sen. Lauch Faircloth, a first-term
Republican conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans currently hold a 55 to 45 majority
over Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Republicans have a 22 vote margin over the
Democrats, 228 to 206. CNN projected that Republicans were likely
to lose three seats, cutting their margin to 19. The anemic
Republican showing raised questions about House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's job security.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich told ABC News that he doesn't see any challengers for
his job. He said his House Republican leadership team was the only
such team that has been reelected since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In a closely watched Senate race, Democratic Sen. Ernest M.
Hollings eked out victory for a sixth-term over Republican
challenger Rep. Bob Inglis, a three-term conservative House member.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana also nabbed the seat
vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coates.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., long regarded by pundits as a
goner, surprised her critics by waging a close race with her
Republican challenger, state Senator Peter Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   In a widely predicted victory for Republicans, GOP Gov. George
Voinovich claimed the open seat of retiring Democratic Sen. John
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats actually gain House seats, it would be an historic
reversal of historic trends. The party controlling the White House
customarily faces an uphill battle in mid-term elections. Since
1918, the party holding the White House has suffered an average
loss of 27 seats in the House and six seats in the Senate in
mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the president's party did not lose seats was in
1934, just as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, was
launching the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee had predicted a gain of 10 to 15 House
seats for the GOP. His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas, forecast that Democrats would pick up seats in the House,
but questioned whether they would get the 11 seats they need to get
back into the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer, the general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said the Democrats' strong showing was a message to
Republicans that they should quickly wrap up their impeachment
proceedings and ``get back to business'' because voters don't think
President Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky warrants his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., said the
strong showing by Democratic candidates in the House ``really means
people are saying let's get back to the kitchen-table issues
everybody cares about'' and finish up the impeachment business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tonight the people are saying to do it fairly but do
it quickly,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna
College, said the election was not a referendum on the Lewinsky
scandal, but rather was indicative of other factors such as a
strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent stock market turmoil, the U.S. economy continues
to show surprising perkiness. The gross domestic product grew at a
stronger-than-expected 3.3 percent rate in the third quarter,
interest rates are low and unemployment hovers at a low 4.6
percent. Inflation has been almost invisible at less than 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to look like a disappointing night for
Republicans,'' Pitney said.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., speaking to supporters
at a victory rally in his congressional district in Georgia,
emphasized that despite the outcome, Republicans would retain
control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first time in 70 years that Republicans kept
control of the House for a third term,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich said Republican control remained ``a fairly big deal''
because GOP lawmakers would chair every House committee, every
House subcommittee and hold a 9-to-4 edge in the House Rules
Committee that schedules legislative action.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For MAYOR CLYDE RABIDEAU of Plattsburgh, N.Y.,
Election Day was the end of the campaign that wasn't, which brought
back memories of the hellish night that was.
</P>
<P>
   Rabideau was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for
lieutenant governor in the primary in September. On the final night
of the campaign, he took a Metro-North train from Tarrytown to
Grand Central Terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last recollection was hearing, `125th Street, next stop,'''
he said. ``I fell asleep. I woke up. I didn't know where the heck I
was. I was groggy. I realized I was in a train, but there was
nobody in the train and it was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stepped out in the aisle and tripped and fell on my face and
knocked out a tooth and a denture plate. I twisted my ankle. I
staggered to the door of the train. It's closed and it's locked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go, `Let me out of here.' There's nobody around. You know
that cubicle in the corner? I open the window and climb out. I got
the tooth in my hand. The platform's vacant, it's about 20 minutes
after 12 on Primary Day, and I go, `This is going to be a great day
because it can't get any worse than this.'''
</P>
<P>
   But it did. Rabideau had the tooth reattached, but it fell out
again during a news conference at the state Capitol. And he lost.
No more campaigning for him.
</P>
<P>
   He took the train to Manhattan again Tuesday to go to the
Election Night party for Peter Vallone, who ran against Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Rabideau was not worried about dozing off this time. ``My wife's
with me,'' he said by cellular phone from the train. ``She's going
to keep me awake.''

   NEW YORK _ The mezzo-soprano SUSAN GRAHAM has something that
more often afflicts place kickers: turf toe.
</P>
<P>
   She got it when she accidentally kicked a prop too hard during
Richard Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos'' at the Lyric Opera of
Chicago on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never knew that Strauss would make such physical demands,''
she said, adding that the doctor had taped her foot and that she
would be back on stage for Friday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   WOODY ALLEN'S 91-year-old mother, NETTIE KONIGSBERG, had hip
surgery on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``She fell off a chair at the dinner table'' last Thursday, said
Allen's sister, LETTY ARONSON. Allen and his wife, SOON-YI PREVIN,
visited her at the hospital, and Allen was in the waiting area
outside the operating room during the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good in crises and emergencies,'' Ms. Aronson said.
``He was absolutely fine.''

   NEW YORK _ ``Feel my forehead,'' said the actress SHANNEN
DOHERTY, at a party for the film ``Meet Joe Black'' on Monday
night. All around her at the Metropolitan Club were young male
stars like BRAD PITT (who plays Death in ``Meet Joe Black''),
EDWARD NORTON (without Courtney Love) and CHRISTIAN SLATER.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doherty was warm not because she was so close to so many
heartthrobs. She was aflutter because ANTHONY HOPKINS _ who
unfortunately meets Death (and death) in ``Meet Joe Black'' _ had
just hugged her while a friend took their picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those young guys don't do it for me,'' Ms. Doherty said. ``For
me, it's Anthony Hopkins. Anthony Hopkins and Michael Douglas.
Those are the ones.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Douglas was there too and did not seem to be
giving hugs. And Hopkins looked much more convincing hugging LAUREN
BACALL than he did hugging Miss Doherty, the star of the witch-com
``Charmed.'' Some people at the party were sure he didn't knew who
she was.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)  
 Matt Wolf is an American theater critic and journalist based in
London.  
 (af)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Suitcases pour forth steam to suggest a train station,
even as later in the evening actors attired as peasants become the
train that bears down upon _ and kills _ the title character, Anna
Karenina. Two high-stepping women form a carriage, while rows of
bentwood chairs function as seats as well as weapons of sorts,
debris and, at one point, items of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like the emphatic physical style of the
Britain-based company Theatre de Complicite that has visited New
York of late, think again.
</P>
<P>
   The stripped-down version of Leo Tolstoy's ``Anna Karenina,''
arriving on Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic
Theater, is a production by Shared Experience _ another London
theater company that makes imaginative use of relatively few props.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no simple exercise in minimalist theater. For more
than two decades, the touring troupe has put the actor at the
center of the event, enhanced by only as much set design as is
needed to release the affective heart of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company has worked off and on within the classical
repertory since it began in 1975, Shared Experience has made a name
for itself by adapting novels, more often than not 19th-century
epics like ``The Mill on the Floss'' by George Eliot, ``War and
Peace'' by Tolstoy and ``Jane Eyre'' by Charlotte Bronte.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it has been compared to two other London-based
touring troupes _ Complicite and Cheek by Jowl _ because all three
companies make a point of preferring nonnaturalistic theater and
releasing the physicality of the actor.
</P>
<P>
   Shared Experience is the last of the three to make its debut in
the United States. The Complicite production of ``The Street of
Crocodiles,'' presented last summer at the Lincoln Center Festival,
was greeted with acclaim, as was the company's earlier ``Three
Lives of Lucie Cabrol.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Cheek by Jowl has made three well-received visits
to BAM with highly stylized, virtually choreographed stagings of
Shakespeare and John Webster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get lumped together because we work outside the established
venues,'' said Nancy Meckler, an American expatriate who has run
Shared Experience since 1987 and who is directing six performances
of the three-hour ``Anna Karenina'' in Brooklyn. ``I think we're
all interested in asking questions about what theater is and how to
make it; we're all very interested in process.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shared Experience predates the other two companies and,
given that Cheek by Jowl is on indefinite hiatus, may outlast at
least one of them. Besides, no other troupe in the English-speaking
theater has _ for so long a time _ looked to the novel as a source
for inspiration, notwithstanding the success at various times of
the Royal Shakespeare Company's Tony Award-winning ``Life and
Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby,'' based on the Dickens tale; the
musical ``Les Miserables,'' from the Victor Hugo story; and the
all-male version of Graham Greene's ``Travels With My Aunt'' that
began at the Citizens Theater in Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   (The Citizens, interestingly, staged its own ``Anna Karenina''
in 1987 with five actresses playing the heroine.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, long before Ms. Meckler was making her name as a
freelance director in England of classics like ``Macbeth'' and
``The Cherry Orchard,'' an English director, Mike Alfreds, was
creating Shared Experience. He presented three evenings of
different collections of the ``Arabian Nights'' stories and a
version of Dickens's ``Bleak House'' that ran for 10 hours over 4
nights, with 7 actors played 120 characters; in ``Anna Karenina,''
8 performers assume 54 parts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 Alfreds spent a year away from his company, directing at
the National Theater, and by the time he returned had decided to
move on in his career. Now, he heads another touring company,
Method and Madness, which just opened a stage version of the
American crime novelist James Ellroy's ``Black Dahlia'' at a
theater in Exeter, in southwest England.
</P>
<P>
   But back in the 1970s, Alfreds recalled, ``I thought, I'm a
great believer in narrative. If you give an audience a story,
they've got a narrative to hang on to _ then, you can take them
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   His aim, he said, was to restore an unfettered, even liberating
rapport between audience and actor: ``It wasn't just about doing
literary novels, it was actually very much about the relationship
with the audience that an actor could suggest through words and
movements, things that weren't there, that you evoked for the
audience whatever they wanted to see.''
</P>
<P>
   That concept gave rise to the name Shared Experience, the idea
being that the audience, Alfreds said, ``shared in the creative
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Meckler speaks of keeping that respect for the actor
while wedding it to the Expressionistic style of theater that she
prizes. Ms. Meckler, who grew up in Great Neck on Long Island and
graduated from Antioch College in 1963, has lived in Britain since
1968.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a recent afternoon in the converted Soho laundry
that is Shared Experience's office, she said: ``I know
Expressionism is a dirty word because we always just think of a
Munch painting. To me, Expressionism is when you have theater that
expresses things that are usually hidden, things going on in the
mind and the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence the troupe's fiercely moving 1994 version of ``The Mill on
the Floss,'' which refracted the heroine, Maggie Tulliver, into
three distinct Freudian selves, or appetites. Or ``Anna Karenina,''
which first opened in London in 1992 in an adaptation by Helen
Edmundson, a former actress.
</P>
<P>
   The production, Ms. Meckler said, aims not for a
documentary-like recreation of Tolstoy's Russia but to pierce to
the passionate heart of two distinct yet intersecting souls, the
doomed Anna (played by Teresa Banham) and her lover, the robust,
idealistic, possibly even triumphant Levin (Richard Hope).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Peter Brook's `empty space,' basically,'' said Hope,
referring to the prevailing pared-down esthetic not just of the
Paris-based English theater legend but of that of Shared
Experience, the company that has employed him for much of the
1990s. (Hope played Pierre in the troupe's 1996 staging of ``War
and Peace,'' a co-production with the Royal National Theater.)
</P>
<P>
   Was Hope concerned about an enterprise that required distilling
nearly 1,000 pages of prose, especially since the first five weeks
of rehearsal were spent entirely on Act I? ``I did think it was
madness to attempt,'' he said. ``What you hope is that you can
stand by the novel; though you're not doing the novel exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Shared Experience wants less to create a stage
equivalent of the book than to capture something of its energy and
passion in a theatrical form. ``It's using the medium of theater to
maximum poetic potential,'' said Richard Eyre, the former artistic
director of the National who had invited the company to work on
``War and Peace'' there two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two to three chairs become a palace,'' Eyre continued. ``Eight
people become a train. That to me is the poetry of theater, the
theaterness of theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain isn't alone in such endeavors. In the United States, the
Book-It Repertory Theater in Seattle is in its 10th year of similar
projects, though on a less ambitious scale.
</P>
<P>
   Book-It's artistic director, Jane Jones, will be represented in
New York in February as co-creator and co-director (with Tom Hulce)
of the stage version of John Irving's novel ``The Cider House
Rules'' at the Atlantic Theater Company Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The two-part play, which has been done at the Seattle Rep and
the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, runs for a total of about six
hours, though Ms. Jones said only the first half would be presented
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to see the return of good stories on stage,'' Ms.
Jones said. While some London critics _ Michael Billington in The
Guardian, for one _ decry the trend of novels on stage as a loss
for the literature involved, Ms. Jones argues that critics ``should
consider themselves lucky that they are getting good stories and
some of the most fantastic characters ever written.''

CLINTON-BASHING BACKFIRES ON GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   What happened Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment died; the Senate elected Tuesday night is not a
Senate that will impeach. Bill Clinton came back to political life.
Monica took a giant step back to private life. The voters reclaimed
the initiative from the media barons and the TV talky-squawky gang,
and showed their innate good sense by voting in greater numbers and
with greater independence than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats did better than expected on the ground. The media
prognosticators did worse than expected in the air. The Republicans
were Starr-struck _ their expectations dashed in at least the early
going by unexpectedly broad Democratic gains.
</P>
<P>
   Where turnout was higher than the 38 percent consensus
projections, Democrats seemed to benefit. Last-minute anti-Clinton
ads said to be master-minded by Speaker Newt Gingrich for certain
House races apparently contributed to a broad and deep voter
revulsion against the GOP's impeachment kick.
</P>
<P>
   The ads ran in only 22 districts targetted by the Republican
high command. But the backlash to the Starr-driven strategy of
linking Democratic candidates to Clinton's pecadilloes suggested
the Gingrich scheme to nationalize the election was a colossal
flop.
</P>
<P>
   Following upon the Republican congressional leadership's
end-of-session surrender to Clinton's priorities on the federal
budget and the day-to-day conduct of the government, Tuesday
night's early results seemed to threaten the grip on power of both
Gingrich and Senator Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   For the tobacco lobby and the telecommunications interests, the
Senate majority leader has been Trent Thanks-a-Lott. Off the early
returns, where Democrats ran stronger in close Senate and
governor's races than anyone thought likely, there will be some
long and angry faces in the Republican cloakroom when the Senate
reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
   Having been out-manuevered by Bill Clinton for the second
election in a row, the Gingrich-Lott team will come in for heavy
criticism from Republicans and contributors who want more results
for their support and their money. Gingrich's uneasy perch atop the
greasy pole of the GOP's anti-government edifice is not much more
secure. Gingrich and Lott and their Sunbelt conservative philosophy
played offense against Clinton since Gingrich masterminded the
House takeover four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as though the Gingrich-Lott combine will be forced
to play defense. This overturns the virtually-unanimous media line
that Clinton was not only a lame duck but a dead duck, with
impeachment or a forced resignation his likeliest options. That's
all over. Clinton emerges from Tuesday night strengthened, if not
emboldened.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton and for Democratic victors in states with
substantial numbers of minority voters, the immediate savior
appeared to be a heavier-than-anticipated black turnout. Republican
Governor Fob James of Alabama got only four percent of black votes,
CNN estimated, while the man who beat him narrowly, Democratic
Lieutenant Governor Don Spiegelman, got 96 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's last-minute flurry of campaigning in the welcoming
arms of black churchgoers seemed to pay off big. ``Bill Clinton
even got some help this week from Thomas Jefferson,'' said a man
who follows black voting patterns in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news was bad for the GOP. Victories for governor by
the Brothers Bush in Texas and Florida reinforced a trend toward
centrist, more-moderate-than-rightwing governance as the path to
success for sons of a former president.
</P>
<P>
   Potential presidential candidates like Governor George W. Bush
of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona won handily and did
nothing to besmirch their credentials for a presidential cycle that
began at 12:01 a.m EST today.
</P>
<P>
   No one had a better night than Hillary Rodham Clinton. She
bathed in the glow of Senator Alfonse D'Amato's defeat in New York.
He led the Senate Whitewater inquiry, and fell to US Representative
Chuck Schumer, of whom it could be said that Hillary spent more
time with Chuck than with her husband these past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats winning at least three governor's races in the South
defied the notion that the Republicans would take solid control of
the Old Confederacy for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Across the map, there were outcomes that surprised or stunned,
making it hard to remember that most incumbents won, for Senate,
governor, and in the House races. The big winner, at the polls, as
at the fund-raising trough, is the Incumbent Party. That's our
politics, at the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody wins, somebody loses. The good news? Nobody gets shot.
Nobody gets buried in a slit trench in a Polish wood, a Cambodian
jungle, a Bosnian hillside, a Kosovo cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? Somebody loses. One side or the other, there are
people who are heartbroken this morning. They invested months out
of their working life, or more money than was prudent, or too much
of their emotional firepower, and got wiped out. ``Politics ain't
beanbag,'' is the hallowed phrase Jack Germond re-popularized. The
bullets are rhetorical, but the wounds still hurt. You still cry
when the sword is a computer printout whose numbers don't add up
for your side.

 &HT;    Conductor Marin Alsop taking reins of the ASO for very public
job tryout
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED
BY NY TIMES WIRE.
 &HT;    By Susan Elliott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_At first I thought, `Oh no, this can't be right _
there's been a terrible mistake!''' Conductor Marin Alsop is
remembering the day she was awarded the Leonard Bernstein
Conducting Fellowship, entitling her to a season at Tanglewood _
summer home of the Boston Symphony _ under the tutelage of the
late, great maestro. ``It was a huge turning point for me, because
they didn't know who I was. I had no political connections
whatsoever. They were simply interested in my talent.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been only 10 years since Alsop, in town this week to guest
conduct the Atlanta Symphony, gained acceptance into that bastion
of the Classical Musical Establishment. The only woman to win the
prestigious Koussevitzky Conducting Prize, the 42-year-old New York
native is music director of the Colorado Symphony in Denver and the
Cabrillo Festival in Santa Cruz, Calif., and founding artistic
director of New York's Concordia, an ensemble that specializes in
contemporary American music _ Alsop's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other guest conductors leading the ASO this season,
Alsop, who last led the orchestra in 1995, is a potential candidate
to succeed music director Yoel Levi. Her contract with Colorado
expires in 2000, the same time Levi's does with Atlanta. She is to
meet with the search committee this week and politely admits to
being interested. Alsop is also being considered by the Houston
Symphony and other ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's probably on a list for any orchestra in America right
now that has a music director vacancy,'' says Tom Bacchetti, former
executive director of the Atlanta Symphony and now in that post
with the Colorado Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Atlanta is ready for a woman music director is anybody's
guess. There is none in the top 25 U.S. orchestras and only three
in the top 75: Alsop, JoAnn Falletta in Buffalo, N.Y., and Ann
Madsen in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever major orchestra becomes the first to hire a woman is
going to get so much press and so much interest, because they'll be
doing something risky,'' says Alsop, who has overseen a rise in
both orchestra quality and audience attendance in Colorado since
her arrival five years ago. ``Just think about it: There are no CDs
of a woman conducting standard repertoire.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent breakfast at the Four Seasons, following her
habitual three-mile morning run, the refreshingly personable Alsop,
who is single, traced her evolution from free-lance fiddle player
substituting in the New York Philharmonic and playing on jingle
sessions for Kentucky Fried Chicken to her current status as young
American conductor on the fast track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gotten my master's from Juilliard in violin performance
and I was trying to get some conducting going _ it's what I always
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was a woman and an American and I'm under 6 feet tall. I
mean, really, what else could possibly be wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a sense of humor and a healthy dose of
irreverence: During her audition for Juilliard's conducting
program, Alsop made a wisecrack that caused the entire orchestra to
dissolve into laughter. ``They threw me out,'' she remembers. ``I
was young and it was hard for me to fit in well. But then I
thought, why am I busting my chops to try to get into a school that
clearly doesn't meet my sensibilities?''
</P>
<P>
   Eagerly admitting that ``tradition is not my forte,'' Alsop
simply formed her own orchestra to gain conducting experience.
Financed with her free-lance earnings, she founded Concordia in
1984, and studied technique with Carl Bamberger, whom she lovingly
describes as ``an old Viennese guy _ very old school. We'd drag out
the vacuum player and say, `Okay there are your woodwinds, and the
plants are the brass.' He was in his 80s, but he had the energy of
a 12-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   And he helped give her the equipment to gain acceptance into the
Tanglewood program, where she studied under Seiji Ozawa, Gustav
Meier and, of course, her mentor Bernstein. (She now owns a house
in the Berskshires in western Massachusetts where she studies
musical scores in the summer. She also has a house in DEnver and an
apartment in Manhattan.)
</P>
<P>
   From Bernstein she learned not only the technical and musical
skills to forge her way in a world dominated by white European
males, but, perhaps most importantly, the confidence to put across
her message in her own way, both physically and emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to really work on the physical aspect,'' says Alsop, the
only child of two professional string players. (Her father was
concertmaster of the New York City Ballet Orchestra for 30 years.
Her mother still plays in the same orchestra.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When a woman makes the same gesture as a man, the response is
very different. If a man is very delicate with his hands, people
say, `Oh he's so sensitive.' If a woman is delicate, people say,
`Oh she's too frilly.'
</P>
<P>
   ``By the same token, if a man is very macho, people say, `Oh
he's so strong and virile.' But when a woman does it, they call her
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it was about being very, very strong with people. I'm a
little, `Oh, so sorry,' or `Oh, let me do that for you,' or `Oh,
you played a wrong note, so sorry.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work through that. Because when you give it to the
brass,'' she makes a fist to illustrate her point, ``you have to
stay connected to them. They expect you to be firm and be there for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then Bernstein really helped me to just forget about (the
technique of) conducting and connect on an emotional level. That's
hard not only for the conductor but for the players, too. It's a
very intimate relationship and you have to be open to it _ not
afraid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be little question that the connection comes more
easily for a man on the podium than a woman, if no other reason
than sheer tradition. But either Alsop is sidestepping the issue,
or she truly doesn't worry about the gender barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My way is just to try and be myself. Playing in orchestras for
so long I really can relate to the musicians. And once you get over
that hump, once you're connected, which can happen very quickly,
then it opens up the opportunity to connect on a deeper level.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, she's having success getting through. In addition to
guesting with the major ensembles of Philadelphia, Los Angeles,
Cincinnati, and Washington, Alsop has been well-received in Europe,
where there are virtually no active women conductors outside
conservatories. Reviews from her recent stints in London and Paris
were consistently positive.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on an all-Bernstein program with the London Sinfonia
last week, The Observer's critic wrote that Alsop ``has this music
in her blood. Through her clarity and sense of momentum she managed
to persuade the City of London Sinfonia it was in theirs too,
urging playing of spirit and swing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, she's extremely popular. ``The audience loves her,''
says Bacchetti, who, in an interesting swap, recently brought Levi
to Colorado to guest conduct. ``She's bright, energetic, personable
and makes music very accessible to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Shulgold, music critic at Denver's Rocky Mountain News,
credits Alsop with the Colorado Symphony's consistent rise.
``Before Marin, we had nothing but Europeans with thick accents as
music directors,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marin was absolutely perfect for this community. She was not
only American, but she was very hip, very communicative,
accessible, unpretentious, unsnobby. People just really took to
her, and her being a woman was never really an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider her to be a potentially very hot property. And I
expect an announcement sometime between now and the end of her
contract that a major orchestra has hired her as music director. I
wonder if Atlanta would be a good fit.''

ON HOCKEY: BURE-PALFFY DEAL IS WHAT ISLANDERS NEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Evaluating hockey standings a month into
the season is like surveying indicator precincts on election
morning. The early numbers might accurately predict the final
results; or they might seriously mislead. An example might be the
pecking order of the Eastern Conference and the Atlantic Division
Tuesday night as the New York Rangers and the New Jersey Devils met
in the Meadowlands. Both Hudson River rivals looked north in the
standings to the first-place New York Islanders, who have won
little since the first Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lease-busting shenanigans of their owners, their
poor attendance, their embarrassment over their dwindling
television visibility and the absence of their best player, the
Islanders were one game over .500 and tied with Philadelphia and
Ottawa at 12 points. Adding intrigue for pundits is their interest
in Pavel Bure, the flashy right wing who refuses to return to
Vancouver. The Islanders have talked with the Canucks about a trade
involving Zigmund Palffy, their flashy right wing who has not
signed a contract.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would seem logical and doable for the Islanders and
would strike a blow against the Rangers, who also have expressed
interest in the Russian Rocket, who scored 51 goals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a six-game undefeated streak coming into Tuesday night's
game, the Rangers had only 16 goals in 10 games. They need Bure as
much as the Islanders do, but they have less to offer in trade.
While it is a credit to Coach John Muckler that his Rangers have
evolved from a country-club team into a scrappy bunch of
competitors, it is also a reality that teams with such limited
talent and such little depth don't always sustain this approach
successfully for 82 games. A serious injury here, a major slump
there or an attitude problem anywhere could chill them before
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who featured the recently signed Scott Niedermayer
back in the lineup, had only 17 goals in their first nine games.
Leading the league in goals with nine was Edmonton's Bill Guerin,
who was traded by New Jersey last season after a contract dispute
like Niedermayer's. Certainly the Devils could use a player with
the skill and charisma of Bure. Clearly, they have more depth than
most teams and could offer more in a trade. But the business
history of general manager Lou Lamoriello suggests that $7.2
million a year in contract money will be spent on two or more
players, not on just one, even a great one like Bure.
</P>
<P>
   The big spenders locally in recent seasons have been the
Rangers, and even they seem to be counting beans more closely under
their Cablevision ownership. Over the past several years, the suits
at Madison Square Garden have scoffed over rumors that the
Islanders would try to acquire a star through free agency or trade.
They have accurately pointed out that their Long Island rivals
chronically suffer from financially questionable ownership and
rumors that turn out to be fantasy. Could this change in the matter
of Palffy and Bure?
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kraus, the agent for Palffy, said Tuesday that ``it makes
sense to me on a couple levels,'' and he added: ``Zigmund wants to
play. He's not anxious to get out of the Island. But, if he gets
traded, I don't think he would object to Vancouver.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kraus said he discussed the matter on Monday with David Seldin,
the president of the Islanders. ``No insults were traded,'' Kraus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the subject of Vancouver had come up in the
conversation, Kraus said, ``Yes, it did.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Kraus added that he had not yet spoken to Brian Burke,
the Vancouver general manager, who would have to negotiate a
contract with Palffy, who scored 45 goals last season. Trying for
Bure makes sense for the Islanders in many ways. With Trevor Linden
and Gino Odjick emerging as team leaders, it would reunite Bure
with two former Canuck teammates who admire him. Bure's presence
might help sell tickets in a building that is often less than half
full.
</P>
<P>
   A successful Islanders season might repair some of the new
ownership's self-inflicted public relations wounds. It could stoke
interest in the new arena they say they need, if not in Nassau
County then perhaps elsewhere on the land mass. (And wouldn't
Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, with its Russian community, be an ideal
place for Bure to live and work?)
</P>
<P>
   Best for local fans, it might help get the Islanders back on
television on a regular basis. So far, they have been treated like
shirt-tail relatives by Cablevision, which owns the Rangers, owns
the Garden and controls the television rights of all three local
hockey teams. Cablevision has capriciously bumped the Islanders off
some telecasts, and its cryptic economic explanations have been
specious at best. (Friday night's Rangers-Devils game appeared
locally on not one but two cable outlets: Fox Sports New York and
ESPN).
</P>
<P>
   Should the Islanders put together a competitive team featuring a
star like Bure, it would be hard for Cablevision to keep them off
the air while favoring the Rangers first and the Devils second.
What a strange alliance. Monopoly control makes for strange
bedfellows.

EXCERPTS FROM PATAKI'S VICTORY SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   (With ELN-NY-GOV)  
(sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from Gov. George Pataki's victory speech
on Tuesday night, which he delivered at the Hilton Hotel and Towers
in New York City, as transcribed by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the people entrusted the future of this state to
my hands. We kept our word. We said we were going to change the
state and put in place new policies that would free the spirit of
the people of New York from an oppressive government. Well it's
four years later, and let me tell you something, this is a better
state than it was four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   We have kept our word in making this a safer state, making this
a healthier state, making it a state with more environmental
opportunities for our children and the children of the next
generation. We have made it a state where we have freed the people
from oppressive government and taxation and returned their spirit
and their ability so that we can create more jobs and more
opportunity and have less dependency. And we have a stronger New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   But let me tell you something. The job isn't done. We still have
to continue every day to work to make this a better state. And let
me pledge to you today that the policies that have worked so well
for the last four years are going to allow us to have even greater
confidence in the future; that what we have done to give back the
people of this state confidence in the future is what New Yorkers
have always had.
</P>
<P>
   You know, there's something special about our great state. When
I think of what that is, it's that New Yorkers have always believed
that tomorrow would be better than today, that next year would be
better than this year, that our children would have a better life
than we did, that the next generation would have more opportunity
than the generation that preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   With your help, with your confidence, we're not going to just
let New Yorkers think that about their future. We're going to let
them know that about their future.
</P>
<P>
   I'm extremely thankful tonight that the people have chosen to
give us another term to lead this state into the next century. And,
with your continued support, with your continued confidence, we're
going to continue to move this state forward, we're going to make
sure that the 21st century was better than the 20th century. We're
going to make sure that the next generation is proud of the fact
that this is again the Empire State, again the place where dreams
come true for people and for their families. We are going to
guarantee you that with your continued confidence and this
tremendous historic victory tonight, that the best New York is yet
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. God bless you and let's make
the 21st century again New York century. God bless you. Thank you.

EARLY PROJECTIONS COUNTER GOP'S FORECAST OF BIG GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The country Tuesday elected a new Congress that may look _ and
legislate _ much like the current class of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans earlier this fall were expecting big gains in
the House and perhaps a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority in the
Senate, early projections Tuesday night showed the GOP holding on
to a modest majority in the Senate retaining and a slim hold on the
House.
</P>
<P>
   That could give the GOP enough power to stymie some of President
Clinton's agenda on education, health care, and his other prized
issues. But Republicans would not have enough clout to achieve many
of their top initiatives, from cutting taxes to privatizing Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the apparent GOP failure to substantially strengthen
the party's grip on the House and Senate is expected to slow, if
not stall, momentum toward Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders said before the election that supporters of
Clinton's impeachment lacked the 67 votes they would need to remove
him from office. And the early projections Tuesday night indicated
that Republicans, who now control 55 Senate seats, may pick up no
more than one or two additional seats, fewer than party leaders had
hoped and too few to increase the pressure for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee poised to open impeachment
hearings this month, the lack of support in the Senate to remove
Clinton from office increases the chance the process will end in a
negotiated compromise between the White House and congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs of the GOP's apparent failure to post substantial
gains in the Senate were pivotal losses by such GOP incumbents as
Senators Alfonse D'Amato in New York and Lauch Faircloth in North
Carolina. The defeats were projected by several television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who was defeated by Representative Charles E. Schumer,
and Faircloth, who lost to trial lawyer John Edwards, ranked among
Clinton's leading nemeses in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the race to succeed another Clinton foe, retiring
Senator Dan Coats, also was won by a Democrat, former governor Evan
Bayh.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, who was
considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents, was
projected as the winner over Representative Bob Inglis, a
Republican who serves on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also successfully defended the seat of retiring
Senator Dale Bumpers in Arkansas, who will be succeeded by former
Representative Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a Democrat, according to
network projections.
</P>
<P>
   However, voters apparently were leaning toward sticking with a
Congress ruled predominantly by House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
other Southern conservatives, such as Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Whether rank-and-file Republican lawmakers will stick with
Gingrich and Lott is another question, though, as the GOP leaders
could come under fire for failing to substantially expand their
majorities while Clinton was weakened by his sex scandal involving
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich narrowly survived an attempted coup in 1997, and
conservatives assailed him last month for pushing a $500 billion
spending compromise that exceeded a balanced-budget cap by more
than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did pick up a former Democratic seat in Ohio, where
the GOP governor, George V. Voinovich, will succeed Senator John H.
Glenn Jr., the space hero and four-term Democratic stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also were running neck-and-neck with Democrats for
open seats in several other states, most notably Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Hotly contested House races across the country were too close to
call early Tuesday night. Among the incumbents facing tough
reelection races were two members of the Judiciary Committee:
Representatives Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican, and Mel Watt, a
North Carolina Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the House was expected to become slightly more
conservative, despite apparently minuscule Republican gains. Among
the reasons is the retirement of several longtime liberal
Democrats, who are expected to be replaced by more centrist,
pro-business Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The new class of Democrats is expected to include Charlie
Gonzalez, a retired state judge who is the son of retiring
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a leading liberal during his 38
years in the House.

LONG ISLAND FAITHFUL WORK TO GET OUT THE VOTE FOR BOTH PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDARHURST, N.Y. _ From dawn to well past dusk, Andrew Parise,
the mayor and Republican leader in this Long Island village, worked
the phones ceaselessly Tuesday, trying to churn out the vote for
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a colleague and a close personal friend.
</P>
<P>
   Parise's view from the white clapboard headquarters of the
Lawrence/Cedarhurst Republican Club early on Election Day was that
every vote mattered. Wearing his lucky elephant tie and holding a
cup of coffee in one hand, he used a red telephone shaped like a
race car to keep in constant touch with party loyalists in the
field.``Every single call counts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-mile away, in an empty storefront next to a bagel
shop, Democratic leaders and their union allies organized
assignments for two dozen volunteers to distribute leaflets at the
train station and canvass door-to- door for D'Amato's challenger,
Rep. Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   The party faithful worked feverishly in this part of Long Island
and across the state invigorated by an election that harked back to
the low-tech past _ before exit polls and focus groups _ when
campaigns actually had to work the streets for votes.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Schumer prevailed. But it was weeks of neck-and-neck
predictions that drove voter interest in this affluent southwest
corner of Nassau County, known as the Five Towns, where D'Amato is
a neighbor, Schumer is a frequent visitor, the electorate is highly
educated and where, for many, voting is as routine as the
thundering takeoffs from nearby Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   As dawn broke Tuesday, the race appeared so tight that
individual actions that often get lost in the sweep of a statewide
campaign took on added significance, party leaders said. So James
Piedimonte, a Republican committeeman, found himself trying a bit
harder to arrange a ride for an elderly voter who told him she was
feeling ill and had been unable to get out to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts turned out voters early in the day. They lined up in
school cafeterias, gyms and one unlikely polling place, the
Keystone Yacht Club overlooking the blue expanse of Woodmere Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in this predominantly Jewish area said they had
agonized over the Senate race because D'Amato and Schumer were both
strong on issues important to them, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at this point, people don't know who to vote for,'' said
Todd Richman, president of the Five Towns Democratic Club. ``People
are really battling within themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Mison said she had no idea that she would vote for Schumer
until she entered a voting booth in the yacht club. ``But when I
saw D'Amato on the Right to Life line, that did it,'' said Ms.
Mison, an office manager.
</P>
<P>
   After wrestling with her own decision, Ilana Lent said she was
determined to vote, even after she showed up at the wrong polling
place in Woodmere. Undeterred, Ms. Lent, 34, hustled the half mile
to another public school in Cedarhurst, struggling down the stairs
with her infant son, Joshua, still asleep in his stroller. It was
well worth the effort, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an extremely important year to vote because it's
so close,'' Ms. Lent said. ``Both candidates are quite good, but
it's a chance to show your appreciation for a senator who has done
a good job.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In this area of Long Island, where D'Amato won in 1992, the
Democrats have a slight edge in registration but the Republicans of
Nassau County are considerably better organized.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, each of Parise's 28 troops had a list with the
names of several hundred registered Republicans. The committeemen
spent their afternoon calling people on their lists and reminding
them to vote, and then checking the polling places to see whether
they had. Republicans who had not shown up by 4 p.m. received a
second phone call.
</P>
<P>
   When they had breaks, the committeemen filed in to headquarters
for heaping plates of cold cuts and ziti, prepared by Thomas
Cittadino, the village's commissioner of public works. Hours
earlier, Cittadino had put out a breakfast spread of eggs and
sausage, just as his late father, Vincent, had before him. A
picture of the two of them _ each Cittadino man smoking a cigar
over a pot of spaghetti with white clam sauce _ was pasted inside
one of the club's kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   There was less tradition and no midday buffet at the Democratic
headquarters nearby. But organizers had set up elaborate phone
banks that were calling across Long Island to get out the Schumer
vote. One sent out a taped message from President Clinton, urging a
vote for the Democratic team. Another was operated by
representatives of the teacher's union, who were only too pleased
to work against D'Amato, who has blamed their union for some of
America's educational ills.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold and Maxine Blaufarb got a phone call from the Democrats,
but they said they would have voted anyway, as they always do, at
School No. 5 in Cedarhurst. This year, however, they both
acknowledged that they felt their votes were particularly important
because of the closeness of the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   That is where all political agreements ended for the Blaufarbs,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blaufarb, 64, a veteran supporter of D'Amato, was ready for
a change after 18 years. Mr. Blaufarb, 65, who has never been a
D'Amato fan, decided he could not stand the negative tone of
Schumer's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reveal the secret of how the fragile institution of
marriage can handle such direct dissent, Mr. Blaufarb gave simple
advice: ``We never talk about politics.''

REPUBLICANS FACE SLEW OF DEMOCRATIC UPSETS IN CONGRESSIONAL,
GUBERNATORIAL CONTESTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans struggled to hold their own Tuesday as
they faced a slew of Democratic upsets in congressional and
gubernatorial contests. Voters signaled that the scandal swirling
around the White House is not playing outside of the nation's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign where no unifying national themes emerged and
negative advertising pierced the airwaves, Democrats benefited from
a humming economy and strong turnout among their core supporters,
particularly African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polls, Democrats were projected to possibly
gain seats in the House, where the GOP now holds a slim 22-seat
majority. If that happened, it would be the first time since 1934
that the party that controls the White House did not lose seats in
non-presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   In California, voters were on the verge of electing their first
Democratic governor in 16 years as Lt. Gov. Gray Davis headed for
victory over GOP contender Dan Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most bitterly fought contests in the nation, New
York Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer ousted longtime GOP incumbent
Sen. Al D'Amato, who headed the probe into the Clinton's Whitewater
land dealings.
</P>
<P>
   And in North Carolina, Democratic Senate challenger John
Edwards, a political novice and telegenic trial lawyer, defeated
incumbent Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth, who has been harshly
critical of the Clintons over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In the best news for Republicans, the two Bush brothers
continued the family's political dynasty with Jeb Bush declared the
victor in the governor's race in Florida and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, a possible presidential contender, cruising to re-election
victory.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the campaign season was dominated by news of the
Clinton scandal, exit polls showed that most voters did not view
the election as a referendum on the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have argued that if Republicans fail to gain many
seats or even lose some in the House that would not present a
strong mandate for a lengthy and aggressive investigation into the
president's conduct. A House committee is expected to commence
impeachment inquiry later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials were clearly pleased by the early results
trending their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't just do well, we did well against history and
against dollars,'' said Roy Romer, general chairman of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP launched a last minute $10 million ad blitz attacking
the president's integrity in attempt to galvanize their most
conservative voters. But it was unclear how well that strategy had
worked.
</P>
<P>
   And as the results poured into Republican headquarters, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, acknowledged that ``impeachment
was not a big issue in campaigns around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the outcomes were ``based on needs of individual
districts or personality of candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   During the campaigns Democrats stressed Social Security,
education and managed care restrictions while Republicans talked
about tax cuts and banning late-term abortion. But often local
issues and personalities dominated individual contests.
</P>
<P>
   While House Democrats appeared to stave off losses a few
incumbents including Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, were in tight
races. Republicans also hoped to pick up open seats in Indiana,
Wisconsin, and Colorado while Democrats were looking to Washington,
Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Mississippi and Idaho for gains.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, where 34 races were up for grabs, the GOP was not
expected to pick up enough seats to give them the 60-member,
filibuster-proof cushion they badly sought. The GOP now holds 55 of
the 100 Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republicans not only lost key races in New York and
North Carolina, but were locked in a number of tight contests
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin incumbent Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold, who
limited his campaign contributions, was waging a tough fight
against a better-funded GOP opponent, Rep. Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   But in Illinois, Democratic Sen. Carol Mosley-Braun, the only
African American in the Senate, was unable to fend off a challenge
by GOP businessman Peter Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   In California, incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer staved off
spirited challenge by Republican Matt Fong.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Democrats' ability to remain viable in the
increasingly Republican South, Democratic Sen. Fritz Hollings of
South Carolina managed to eke out a victory over GOP challenger Bob
Inglis.
</P>
<P>
   And in a major upset, South Carolina Republican governor David
Beasley was defeated by Democrat Jim Hodges, who campaigned on a
platform of creating a state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In another GOP southern stronghold, Alabama Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Donald Siegleman defeated incumbent
Republican Fob James, who has appealed to Christian conservatives
but alienated the business community.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six governorships were up for grabs and Republican
candidates were headed to wins in a number of states, including
Massachusetts, Illinois, New York, Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats appeared poised to capture the biggest prize,
California, where Davis, bolstered by strong showing among
Democrats and independent moderates, was gliding to victory over
the state's attorney general Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   The California win is particularly significant since the
governor will be instrumental in determining the shape of
congressional districts for the year 2000 in the nation's most
populous state.
</P>
<P>
   In another election of note, in Washington, D.C., voters chose a
replacement for controversial Mayor Marion Barry who has presided
over the federal district for almost two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Williams, a wonkish Ivy League graduate who was the city's
chief financial officer, appeared Barry's likely successor. Barry,
who made a comeback four years ago after being convicted of a drug
charge, decided not to run for another term.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions about the election has see-sawed throughout the
year. Earlier this year congressional Democrats had high hopes that
they could take back the House.
</P>
<P>
   But those hopes were dashed when the president admitted in
August that he had affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans boasted they would garner big gains after the
release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment report
detailing his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks pundits were forced to reassess that view as
polls showed Democrats increasingly upset about the House
investigation of Clinton and more likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, led by first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have barnstormed the country
trying to rally the party faithful, particularly African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, has remained largely on the
sidelines appearing only at restricted fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent Tuesday evening with the first lady at the White
House watching the returns of an election that could have an impact
on his future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite polls saying otherwise, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said that the election results will be interpreted as a
referendum on the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a president who faces an impeachment inquiry. How
is it possible to maintain that this is not at least in some
respect a referendum on him,'' said Lockhart. &QL;

CLINTON-BASHING BACKFIRES ON GOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happened Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment died; the Senate elected Tuesday night is not a
Senate that will impeach. Bill Clinton came back to political life.
Monica took a giant step back to private life. The voters reclaimed
the initiative from the media barons and the TV talky-squawky gang,
and showed their innate good sense by voting in greater numbers and
with greater independence than predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats did better than expected on the ground. The media
prognosticators did worse than expected in the air. The Republicans
were Starr-struck _ their expectations dashed in at least the early
going by unexpectedly broad Democratic gains.
</P>
<P>
   Where turnout was higher than the 38 percent consensus
projections, Democrats seemed to benefit. Last-minute anti-Clinton
ads said to be master-minded by Speaker Newt Gingrich for certain
House races apparently contributed to a broad and deep voter
revulsion against the GOP's impeachment kick.
</P>
<P>
   The ads ran in only 22 districts targetted by the Republican
high command. But the backlash to the Starr-driven strategy of
linking Democratic candidates to Clinton's pecadilloes suggested
the Gingrich scheme to nationalize the election was a colossal
flop.
</P>
<P>
   Following upon the Republican congressional leadership's
end-of-session surrender to Clinton's priorities on the federal
budget and the day-to-day conduct of the government, Tuesday
night's early results seemed to threaten the grip on power of both
Gingrich and Senator Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   For the tobacco lobby and the telecommunications interests, the
Senate majority leader has been Trent Thanks-a-Lott. Off the early
returns, where Democrats ran stronger in close Senate and
governor's races than anyone thought likely, there will be some
long and angry faces in the Republican cloakroom when the Senate
reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
   Having been out-manuevered by Bill Clinton for the second
election in a row, the Gingrich-Lott team will come in for heavy
criticism from Republicans and contributors who want more results
for their support and their money. Gingrich's uneasy perch atop the
greasy pole of the GOP's anti-government edifice is not much more
secure. Gingrich and Lott and their Sunbelt conservative philosophy
played offense against Clinton since Gingrich masterminded the
House takeover four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as though the Gingrich-Lott combine will be forced
to play defense. This overturns the virtually-unanimous media line
that Clinton was not only a lame duck but a dead duck, with
impeachment or a forced resignation his likeliest options. That's
all over. Clinton emerges from Tuesday night strengthened, if not
emboldened.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton and for Democratic victors in states with
substantial numbers of minority voters, the immediate savior
appeared to be a heavier-than-anticipated black turnout. Republican
Governor Fob James of Alabama got only four percent of black votes,
CNN estimated, while the man who beat him narrowly, Democratic
Lieutenant Governor Don Spiegelman, got 96 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's last-minute flurry of campaigning in the welcoming
arms of black churchgoers seemed to pay off big. ``Bill Clinton
even got some help this week from Thomas Jefferson,'' said a man
who follows black voting patterns in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news was bad for the GOP. Victories for governor by
the Brothers Bush in Texas and Florida reinforced a trend toward
centrist, more-moderate-than-rightwing governance as the path to
success for sons of a former president.
</P>
<P>
   Potential presidential candidates like Governor George W. Bush
of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona won handily and did
nothing to besmirch their credentials for a presidential cycle that
began at 12:01 a.m EST today.
</P>
<P>
   No one had a better night than Hillary Rodham Clinton. She
bathed in the glow of Senator Alfonse D'Amato's defeat in New York.
He led the Senate Whitewater inquiry, and fell to US Representative
Chuck Schumer, of whom it could be said that Hillary spent more
time with Chuck than with her husband these past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats winning at least three governor's races in the South
defied the notion that the Republicans would take solid control of
the Old Confederacy for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Across the map, there were outcomes that surprised or stunned,
making it hard to remember that most incumbents won, for Senate,
governor, and in the House races. The big winner, at the polls, as
at the fund-raising trough, is the Incumbent Party. That's our
politics, at the end of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody wins, somebody loses. The good news? Nobody gets shot.
Nobody gets buried in a slit trench in a Polish wood, a Cambodian
jungle, a Bosnian hillside, a Kosovo cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? Somebody loses. One side or the other, there are
people who are heartbroken this morning. They invested months out
of their working life, or more money than was prudent, or too much
of their emotional firepower, and got wiped out. ``Politics ain't
beanbag,'' is the hallowed phrase Jack Germond re-popularized. The
bullets are rhetorical, but the wounds still hurt. You still cry
when the sword is a computer printout whose numbers don't add up
for your side.

   BUFFALO _ The Bruins provided Dominik Hasek with a spirited
workout and even held the lead for several minutes Tuesday night.
But they failed to respond to some rough play by the Buffalo
Sabres, who took control of the game early in the second period and
skated to a 4-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres right wing Matthew Barnaby set the tone with a blatant
and gratuitous left elbow to the head of P.J. Axelsson, who
sustained his second concussion in a week. Miroslav Satan, alone in
front of the net, put the go-ahead goal into the top of the net at
2:27 of the second period, seconds after Axelsson departed.
</P>
<P>
   With Hasek appearing virtually unbeatable in the Buffalo net,
the Bruins had little chance after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit his pads and chest with point-blank shots, and it
doesn't matter who the goalie is, he is going to stop shots like
those,'' center Jason Allison said. ``We had our chances, but they
didn't want to go in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing is, we need goals now, and they are not going
in. You start to second-guess yourself _ `Where do I shoot this?
What do I do with this?' _ instead of just reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek contributed to that indecision with his customary
remarkable play. He was at his best in the opening minutes of the
third period, parrying an impressive Bruin assault with ease while
the Sabres held a 2-1 edge.
</P>
<P>
   First Hasek kicked out Chris Taylor's drive, then made a
remarkable recovery to stop Marquis Mathieu's rebound and, while
falling, controlled the puck to prevent another rebound.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Bruins' last realistic attempt to stay in
contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres took a 3-1 lead as Derek Plante held off Don Sweeney
with his left arm and centered for Curtis Brown to score at 5:00 of
the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe was not as spectacular as Hasek,
though he once held off the Sabres despite being shoved into the
net along with two other players in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe helped keep the Bruins alive, and they capitalized to cut
their deficit to 3-2. Hal Gill sent a shot from the right circle
off Hasek, and the puck trickled over the line as Hasek made a
futile reach for it at 9:02.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffalo clinched the victory three minutes later as Michal
Grosek one-timed a pass from Satan, leaving Dafoe with little
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were aggressive at the start. They took the lead as
Allison set up a power play with a foray into the heart of the
defense, leading Plante to interfere with Sergei Samsonov at 10:47.
Less than half a minute later, Steve Heinze scored from point-blank
range into the far side of the net after Joe Thornton centered from
behind the net following a faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's enthusiasm paid off there, though he had earlier
received a penalty for interfering with the goaltender while
following a Ray Bourque slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres tied the score as Michael Peca's slap shot from the
right went off Dafoe's pads, between two Bruins, and to Dixon Ward,
who converted at 17:23.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, Axelsson went down and remained on
his hands and knees for several seconds while Rob DiMaio confronted
Barnaby, by now on the opposite side of the ice. With the Bruins
distracted, Buffalo took a 2-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who next meet Toronto Thursday, continue to miss
holdouts Anson Carter and Kyle McLaren.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be the team we can be, we obviously are going to
need them,'' Bourque said. ``We have a couple of injuries, so we
are missing four guys who were regulars last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good chances but we didn't capitalize on them. We
are having trouble scoring goals and we're not playing very well
yet.''

EARLY PROJECTIONS COUNTER GOP'S FORECAST OF BIG GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The country Tuesday elected a new Congress that may look _ and
legislate _ much like the current class of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans earlier this fall were expecting big gains in
the House and perhaps a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority in the
Senate, early projections Tuesday night showed the GOP holding on
to a modest majority in the Senate retaining and a slim hold on the
House.
</P>
<P>
   That could give the GOP enough power to stymie some of President
Clinton's agenda on education, health care, and his other prized
issues. But Republicans would not have enough clout to achieve many
of their top initiatives, from cutting taxes to privatizing Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the apparent GOP failure to substantially strengthen
the party's grip on the House and Senate is expected to slow, if
not stall, momentum toward Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders said before the election that supporters of
Clinton's impeachment lacked the 67 votes they would need to remove
him from office. And the early projections Tuesday night indicated
that Republicans, who now control 55 Senate seats, may pick up no
more than one or two additional seats, fewer than party leaders had
hoped and too few to increase the pressure for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee poised to open impeachment
hearings this month, the lack of support in the Senate to remove
Clinton from office increases the chance the process will end in a
negotiated compromise between the White House and congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs of the GOP's apparent failure to post substantial
gains in the Senate were pivotal losses by such GOP incumbents as
Senators Alfonse D'Amato in New York and Lauch Faircloth in North
Carolina. The defeats were projected by several television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who was defeated by Representative Charles E. Schumer,
and Faircloth, who lost to trial lawyer John Edwards, ranked among
Clinton's leading nemeses in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the race to succeed another Clinton foe, retiring
Senator Dan Coats, also was won by a Democrat, former governor Evan
Bayh.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, who was
considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents, was
projected as the winner over Representative Bob Inglis, a
Republican who serves on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also successfully defended the seat of retiring
Senator Dale Bumpers in Arkansas, who will be succeeded by former
Representative Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a Democrat, according to
network projections.
</P>
<P>
   However, voters apparently were leaning toward sticking with a
Congress ruled predominantly by House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
other Southern conservatives, such as Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Whether rank-and-file Republican lawmakers will stick with
Gingrich and Lott is another question, though, as the GOP leaders
could come under fire for failing to substantially expand their
majorities while Clinton was weakened by his sex scandal involving
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich narrowly survived an attempted coup in 1997, and
conservatives assailed him last month for pushing a $500 billion
spending compromise that exceeded a balanced-budget cap by more
than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did pick up a former Democratic seat in Ohio, where
the GOP governor, George V. Voinovich, will succeed Senator John H.
Glenn Jr., the space hero and four-term Democratic stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also were running neck-and-neck with Democrats for
open seats in several other states, most notably Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Hotly contested House races across the country were too close to
call early Tuesday night. Among the incumbents facing tough
reelection races were two members of the Judiciary Committee:
Representatives Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican, and Mel Watt, a
North Carolina Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the House was expected to become slightly more
conservative, despite apparently minuscule Republican gains. Among
the reasons is the retirement of several longtime liberal
Democrats, who are expected to be replaced by more centrist,
pro-business Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The new class of Democrats is expected to include Charlie
Gonzalez, a retired state judge who is the son of retiring
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a leading liberal during his 38
years in the House.

DEFENDING THE DEFENDERS OF ABORTION RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Janet Benshoof, the lawyer who heads the Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy, did not know Dr. Barnett Slepian, the
Buffalo doctor who was murdered because he performed abortions. But
years ago, she represented his clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've represented most of the abortion providers,'' Ms.
Benshoof says, in her organization's Wall Street offices. ``At one
time or another nearly all our clients have been under death
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   A joke of the sort Ms. Benshoof's staff edits out when they can:
``I feel like I'm married to the mob,'' Ms. Benshoof says, dryly.
``Saturday night, after the doctor was shot, another client called
and talked for an hour. He was also in upstate New York. He said,
`Do you think I could just get police protection until the leaves
fall off?' He thought once the trees were bare and there was snow
on the ground, he'd be OK. It would be harder to find cover and not
to leave tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benshoof has been fighting for abortion rights a long time.
For 15 years she was director of the American Civil Liberties
Union's Reproductive Freedom Project. Six years ago, she founded
the Center for Reproductive Rights, a nonprofit organization that
today has a staff of 50 and a $5 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   The victories have been significant. Ms. Benshoof filed a
citizen's petition with the Food and Drug Administration in 1994
that resulted in the FDA's approval of the ``morning-after pill,''
and she has battled anti-abortion rulings in 40 states.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of the Buffalo murder, Ms. Benshoof, who is 51,
seems not so much tired as weary. She says she is sickened by
Slepian's murder, but not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been 1,700 acts of violence against health-care
providers since 1977, whether arson or battery or invasion,'' Ms.
Benshoof says. ``These are not empty threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Delineating the work of what she calls ``the theocratic right''
to ``recreate our political and legal structure,'' she seems
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the gravity of the subject, Ms. Benshoof, in a
three-hour conversation, is not without humor. Ask how she'd like
people to think of her, and her first response is ``as funny _
really funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing a case involving frozen embryos, there's a fact Ms.
Benshoof must include: ``The father was a refrigerator repairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benshoof is also known for nerve. When the governor of Guam,
years ago, signed a law that made even the discussion of abortion
illegal, Ms. Benshoof flew there, stood up at a news conference and
recited the address of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Hawaii. She
was arrested on the spot. Released, she took the government to
court and won.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she fear for her life. Ms. Benshoof's phone number has
always been listed, and she does not own a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very Buddhist on that,'' Ms. Benshoof says. ``If I'm
supposed to die, I'll die. I also sky-dive. And I scuba-dive. I
don't think I've ever been scared in my life.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ask Janet Benshoof what she wanted to do while growing up in the
small town of Detroit Lakes, Mich., the second child of a county
prosecutor and a teacher, and she'll answer with one deeply felt
word: ``Leave!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the world of books,'' Ms. Benshoof says. ``What I did
all the time _ what I still do all the time _ is read. If you give
me a choice between going to a party and reading, I'd rather
read.''
</P>
<P>
   A self-characterization that turns out to be frequent, in both
past and present: ``I guess I was weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Feminist role models were not plentiful. Ms. Benshoof's mother
(the teacher) gave up her career when her children were born. Ms.
Benshoof encountered a female lawyer only when she attended Harvard
Law School. It was also at Harvard that Ms. Benshoof met her
husband, Richard Klein, who is a professor at Touro College in
Huntington. They have twin sons, who are 20.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benshoof cannot explain why she wanted to be an advocate for
women, only that from the time she was in law school it was what
she wanted to do. She prefers not to say whether she has ever had
an abortion. Asked when she believes the life of an unborn child
begins, she gives a legal answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a fetus is not a person under the Constitution until
they're born,'' Ms. Benshoof says. ``I'm not trying to be evasive.
I do think it's a legal issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporter shares a confidence about occasionally questioning
her own work, wondering whether a subject's history, failings,
secrets, should remain secret. ``How I feel when I'm scuba-diving,
like I'm not sure I'm supposed to be down there,'' Ms. Benshoof
says, understanding the intrusiveness of journalists quickly _
maybe too quickly. ``Like maybe I'm disturbing their world.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Ms. Benshoof ever have doubts about her work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have any doubts about that,'' she says. ``Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   In her work, how would she most like to be remembered?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benshoof thinks about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'd want it to focus on one case,'' she says.
``I don't know how to say this, it sounds so hokey. I'd like people
to say, `She wanted to make the world a better place.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benshoof gestures outside, to the canyons of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are towers all around us, filled with lawyers, brokers.
I don't think most of them have a vision of changing the world. I'd
like people to think just `She had a bigger view.'''

NICOL WINS US OPEN SQUASH TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He started out slowly, dropping the first game to 1997
champion Jonathon Power, then watching a 9-5 lead in the second
game nearly evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   But when push literally came to shove in a very physical match
Tuesday night at the Harvard Club, Scotland's Peter Nicol, the
world's No. 1 squash player, pulled away late in the second game
and never looked back, taking the US Open title, 10-15, 15-12,
15-11, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best he's ever played against me,'' said Power, the
tournament's second seed and the world's third-ranked player.
``Peter really deserved this win.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-fought victory before a packed house of 400 in the
club's banquet hall was just about a carbon copy of Nicol's triumph
a month ago against the Toronto native in the finals of the
Commonwealth Games in Malaysia when Nicol dropped the first game
but won the title in five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when Jonathon wins the first game, he comes out in the
second game so confident,'' said Nicol. ``In the first game
tonight, I allowed him to win a lot of crosscourt drop shots, but
after that, I played tighter and changed the pace of my shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Power, who had beaten Nicol six consecutive times but has now
lost to him twice in the past month, made a great comeback in Game
2, rallying from that 9-5 deficit to close within 12-11. But on the
next point, he said, ``I got a little bit unlucky. I had him
running all over the place. I was really controlling the rally.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he lunged to make a get, Power lost the grip on his
racket and Nicol put away the easiest point of the night. Then, at
13-12, Power, vocal and animated with the referee throughout the
match, thought he had tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a winning shot, he just got it back, I played an
attacking shot along the wall, and I thought there was no way he
could get there, but he hit me with the racket and they gave him
the point,'' said Power, who lost the next point, the set, and as
it turned out, the early edge he had gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was crucial. That was the turning point,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nicol simply blew Power away in Game 4, racing out to a 7-3 lead
on a beautiful crosscourt drop, then to 11-3 on a diving return
from the deep right corner that had his opponent staring to the
heavens _ or, in this case, the silver chandelier that hangs in the
banquet hall.
</P>
<P>
   Three consecutive points later, Nicol had recaptured the title
he last won in Providence in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shot production hasn't been that good,'' he said, ``but my
length and discipline and mental strength has gotten me to No. 1.
I'm more consistent, and that's why I'm winning more tournaments
now.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATS SAY RESULTS MAY COOL IMPEACHMENT FEVER
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD and BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday
evening as Democrats scored election victories even as Republicans
in Congress prepared for the next phase of impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Television networks predicted, based on interviews with voters
leaving the polls, that Democrats would gain House seats rather
than losing up to a dozen as had been widely expected just days
ago. The GOP seemed likely to gain no more than two Senate seats,
fewer than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that the results, which even some GOP
analysts termed disappointing, would dampen the party's enthusiasm
for impeaching Clinton before the next Congress convenes in
January. The House Judiciary Committee plans hearings this month on
the president's sexual misconduct with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are very concerned about moral decline in
this country _ issues of ethics, standards and conduct,'' said
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   However, the exit polls Tuesday showed that 58 percent of
Americans want the Congress to drop its impeachment inquiry. Six in
10 of those polled disapproved of how congressional Republicans had
handled the issue since independent counsel Kenneth Starr submitted
his evidence to Congress in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''This doesn't mean that the House won't eventually vote to
impeach him,'' said University of Wisconsin political science
professor Charles Franklin, ``but even if they do, it's very hard
to see how they could convict him in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not talking about Bill Clinton's character,'' said
Edwards. For Democrats, he said, ''that in itself was no small
accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Although 60 percent of Americans told the pollsters their vote
was not influenced by the White House scandal, Republican
strategists acknowledged that the GOP's attempt in a last-minute
$10 million ad blitz to make the president's conduct an issue was a
mistake and may have contributed to unexpected Democratic strength
in key races.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just couldn't leave it alone,'' Marlin Fitzwater, White
House spokesman during the Bush administration, said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who watched the returns in the Family Theater of the
White House, has had more triumphant elections nights, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   But for the scandal-tainted standard-bearer of a party that just
weeks ago was fearing a midterm congressional debacle, Tuesday's
elections marked an astonishing political achievement _ the
apparent muting of the Lewinsky matter as a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interesting thing is the absence of impact of the
president's behavior,'' said George Edwards, director of the center
for presidential studies at Texas A&AMP;M University in College
Station, Texas. ''I would say at the moment that they've dodged a
bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   How did Clinton help shape this attitude?
</P>
<P>
   He supplicated himself before the nation, asking for forgiveness
and pledging to work to mend the rift in his family and his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   He then set himself to projecting the image of a president
working overtime to try to solve some of the world's most
intractable problems: ethnic conflict in the Balkans, global
economic contagion, war in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he used the bully pulpit to cast himself as
the able advocate of a populist agenda that resonated with a public
more concerned with kitchen-table issues than with the political
morality play.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his greatest coup was managing to turn the focus of a
year-long fight over a $1.7 trillion budget into a last-minute
squabble over a few billion dollars to hire thousands of new
teachers and upgrade classrooms _ a baby boomer issue if ever there
was one.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came to voters with issues they care about,'' said White
House adviser Paul Begala.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans outspent Democrats by nearly $100 million,
Begala said, and went into the elections with the historical
advantage usually associated with midterm elections, Democrats more
or less held their own.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to fight against the tide of history, it's hard to
face a tidal wave of money,'' Begala said. ''But ideas matter.
That's the lesson I've taken out of this.''

BUSH WINS LANDSLIDE VICTORY IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush won a landslide victory
Tuesday, becoming the first Texas governor in 25 years to win
re-election to consecutive terms of office and setting the stage
for a presidential bid in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's resounding victory says my compassionate,
conservative philosophy is making Texas a better place,'' Bush
said, with his wife, Laura, and daughter Jena at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today's election says something more. It says that a
leader who is compassionate and conservative can erase the gender
gap, can open the doors of the Republican Party to new faces and
new voices,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic challenger Garry Mauro congratulated Bush in a
telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him elections are partisan, but governing is bipartisan
and I was willing to do anything to help make Texas the proudest
place in the world,'' Mauro told supporters Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am particularly proud of the way he and I conducted our
campaigns. We differed on the issues, but we never got personal,
never,'' Mauro said. ``I'm proud we ran a campaign of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated that Bush's devastating defeat of
Democratic challenger Garry Mauro may trigger Republican victories
of statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rick Perry and Democrat John Sharp were in a
neck-and-neck race for lieutenant governor, while Republicans in
early returns were leading in the races for comptroller and for
seats on the state Supreme Court and Court of Criminal Appeals. But
all of those races were still too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans won races for attorney general, land commissioner,
agriculture commissioner and railroad commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP sweep this year on the heels of the Republican tidal wave
of 1996 would leave Democrats without a single statewide
officeholder by January. The Democrats would be shut out of the
highest levels of state government for the first time since
Reconstruction ended 120 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent size of Bush's victory likely will enhance his
position as a possible candidate for the GOP presidential
nomination in 2000. Bush said he will spend time with his family
over Christmas discussing whether to make such a bid and would give
a first signal by March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've told Texans during the campaign that I didn't know, and
I'd make up my mind when the election was over,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I intend to spend private time thinking about the
commitment and whether or not I want to make the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the eldest son of former President George Bush of
Houston. Bush's brother, Jeb, won election Tuesday as the governor
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say something to the newly elected governor of
Florida: Good going, brother!'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father carried Texas with 56 percent of the vote in 1988
on his road to the White House, and he carried Texas by 40.5
percent in his 1992 national re-election loss to Democrat Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When Mauro announced for governor last year, many considered his
campaign to be an impossible task, taking on a highly popular
incumbent governor. Nothing Mauro tried ever caught hold against
Bush, ranging from attacks on Bush's positions on health care,
education, crime _ even his possible presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush mentioned Mauro in passing in his acceptance speech but not
by name: ``I want to commend my opponent for fighting the good
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in early returns led Mauro on Tuesday in every region of
Texas, including the traditionally Democratic strongholds of East
Texas and South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wanted to win 40 percent of the Hispanic vote this year,
breaking the previous Republican record of 36 percent set by
attorney general candidate Roy Barrera in 1986. Bush said such a
vote would prove the Republican conservative message could appeal
to Hispanic voters so long as it was inclusive and compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned as a ``compassionate conservative'' who wanted
to bring more Hispanics voters into the Republican fold.
</P>
<P>
   `` `A mis amigos Hispanos, gracias por su appoyo' _ thank you
for your support,'' Bush said ``to his Hispanic friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by the major television networks and The
Associated Press showed Bush carried 46 percent of the Hispanic
vote, a major jump over the 28 percent he received in 1994 in his
successful effort to unseat Democratic Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns indicated Bush would fulfill a goal of carrying El
Paso County.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Mauro was running strong with liberals,
supporters of President Clinton and among African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the first Texas governor to win re-election to
consecutive four-year terms. Republican Gov. Bill Clements won
election to office in 1978 and then lost the 1982 election, coming
back to win office again in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Dolph Briscoe was the last governor to win
re-election to consecutive terms. Briscoe won in 1974 with 61
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. John Connally, who later became a Republican,
won re-election to a two-year term in 1964 with 84 percent of the
vote and then again in 1966 with 73 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The top Republican vote-getter in modern Texas was President
Richard Nixon, who received 66 percent of the vote in his 1972
re-election victory. President Reagan got 63.6 percent in 1984;
U.S. Sen. Kay Hutchison, 60.8 percent in 1994; and U.S. Sen. Phil
Gramm, 60 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senate nominee Hugh Parmer is the previous Democratic
low-vote getter in a modern election, receiving 37 percent against
Gramm in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigned for office arguing that he had fulfilled most of
is 1994 campaign promises. He also made a series of pledges for his
second term in office:
</P>
<P>
   A $2 billion public-school property tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Give $1.6 billion to public schools for classroom instruction,
reading programs, textbooks and facility construction.
</P>
<P>
   A $400 million sales tax cut, made by eliminating the tax on
over-the-counter medicines and diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the franchise tax for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Crack down on welfare cheats.
</P>
<P>
   End the automatic ``social promotion'' of elementary school
students who are not academically prepared to advance to the next
grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, in this defeat, ended 16 years of service as Texas' land
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters went wild when Mauro took the stage at the
Driskill Hotel in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, what would y'all have done if I got 40 percent. If I'd
gotten 50, y'all'd have torn the place apart,`` Mauro said, with
early returns showing him with less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro was helped in this campaign from President Clinton and
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mauro has known both of them
since they worked together on the 1972 Texas campaign of Democratic
presidential nominee George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons held fund-raisers for Mauro, which raised far less
than expected; both campaigned with Mauro in Texas, as did Vice
President Al Gore, who many expect to be the front-runner for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of a healthy state economy and Bush's $15
million campaign swamping Mauro's $5 million effort, Mauro was
never able to break through. &QL;

NEW YORK MAYOR'S CAMPAIGN-FINANCE PLAN APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (For related stories and graphics, see

(lb) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's referendum proposal to
revamp campaign financing for candidates for New York City offices
easily won approval Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With results counted from 3,051 of the city's 5,689 election
districts, the referendum drew 146,545 votes in favor and 96,869
opposed, or 60 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign-finance proposal was the only proposal that emerged
from a special commission set up by the mayor to decide whether the
City Charter should be revised.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said that the mayor set up the Charter Revision
Commission solely as a maneuver to pre-empt another referendum,
sponsored by the City Council, to consider whether to ban the use
of taxpayer funds for a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium referendum drew considerable public attention until
it was bumped from the ballot by the charter-revision issue.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign-finance proposal, by contrast, was a
low-profile issue.
</P>
<P>
   He argued for it in news conferences, and several major civic
groups opposed it, but there was never a highly organized campaign
from either side.
</P>
<P>
   The main feature of the proposal bars corporate donations to
candidates who agree to accept public funds that match
contributions from other sources on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
</P>
<P>
   That provision prompted unanimous opposition from civic groups
that have promoted campaign-finance controls in the past: the
Citizens Union, City Bar Association, City Club, City Project,
Common Cause, League of Women Voters, New York Public Interest
Research Group and Women's City Club.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the mayor's plan would jeopardize the new
campaign-financing system that the council had adopted just two
weeks ago in overriding a mayoral veto. Under those changes, which
the civic groups prefer, candidates are encouraged to forgo
corporate contributions with the incentive of a $4 match for every
$1 raised from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor contended that the council system would cost more
money, needlessly. But council members and civic groups say that
his plan is fatally flawed because without the incentive,
candidates are likely to continue relying on corporate donations.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was clouded when the Campaign Finance Board, the city
agency that administers the law, said that it would continue giving
the fourfold match even if the mayor's proposal passed, thus
eliminating the savings he promised for his system.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts questioned that interpretation and predicted there
would be a court test.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you know where your children are?
</P>
<P>
   If you're ``arguably the most dangerous lingerie manufacturer in
the world,'' then your 18-year-old son, Warren Straub, is about to
spend the night in the Vanderbilt suite at the Plaza. He has just
stolen $15,000 from your briefcase and is trying to make out with
Jessica Goldman, his pretty new girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jessica is available and eager, she and Warren inhabit
different psychic spaces. She is studying at the Fashion Institute
of Technology to become a designer. His only thought about clothes
is that they should be comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   She lives with her mother with whom she has ``an incredible
relationship,'' even if they have really huge fights from time to
time. He is a dope-smoking dropout, a slacker who also lives at
home (except when his father kicks him out) and hasn't a clue about
what he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   Warren's go-for-broke courtship of Jessica provides the wildly
fibrillating heart of ``This Is Our Youth,'' Kenneth Lonergan's
very funny Off Broadway comedy at Second Stage. By chance, the
theater is actually on Broadway, in the heart of the Upper West
Side that is the play's milieu.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one change in the three-actor cast, this is the same
production, directed by Mark Brokaw, that had a short run with the
New Group at the Intar Theater on Theater Row in 1996. I didn't see
it then, but it seems unlikely that ``This Is Our Youth'' will
again be allowed to disappear so quickly. Commercial comedies of
such brio and darkly satiric edge are rare these days.
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan has said in interviews that his play was inspired by
his own experiences growing up, like his characters, on the Upper
West Side in well-heeled circumstances. He knows the territory and,
to keep things accurate, he fixes the time of the play in 1982,
when he was just out of his teens and at loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   The single setting is the minimally furnished studio apartment
of the third character in the play, Dennis Ziegler, Warren's
slightly older role model and only friend. Theirs is a relationship
that began in the progressive Manhattan preparatory school ``where
they think it's gonna cripple you for life if they teach you how to
spell.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis is a wheeler-dealer and occasional drug-seller for whom
the slacker's life has started to lose its joys. He treats
everybody badly, but he saves his most vicious invective for his
offstage girlfriend, the clearly bewildered Valerie. One of the
writerly accomplishments of ``This Is Our Youth'' is the way
Lonergan surrounds Warren, Jessica and Dennis with equally vivid
characters who never appear.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Dennis' father, a successful painter who has always
been self-absorbed and is now dying of prostate cancer, which has
made him especially mean; Dennis' mother, a city administrator
involved in social service programs, whom Warren describes as ``a
bleeding heart dominatrix with like a hairdo''; Warren's bitter
father, who does business with criminals and mourns a daughter
murdered at age 19, and his divorced mother, now living with her
boyfriend in California, where she does ``volunteer work for some
kind of grape-picking civil liberties organization.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also ex-classmates, drug connections and former and
would-be girlfriends. The stage is teeming with bizarre but always
recognizable life.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, Jessica and Dennis aren't like their parents, who came
of age in the Kennedy era, when the Peace Corps and other good
causes were in fashion. In the early years of the Reagan
administration, these three arrested children have no obvious ways
of defining themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the times are good. Warren, Jessica and Dennis are lucky
enough to have been born into the overachieving upper middle class.
They can afford to indulge their unfocused discontent. Dennis notes
that his parents are so grateful he doesn't want to live with them
that they are more than happy to pay for his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Aimlessness and disaffection are not easily dramatized, unless
they are reflected in the glamorous decadence that Fellini so
enthusiastically sent up in ``La Dolce Vita.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, American movie makers blamed the waywardness of
youth on the evils of drinking, dancing, smoking and drugs in such
kitsch classics as ``Are These Our Children?'' and ``Reefer
Madness.'' Only later did they decide that the lack of parental
love and care was at fault, as in ``Rebel Without a Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonergan knows there aren't any easy answers: booze, drugs,
inconstant parents or even the royal tone of the Reagan presidency.
He is also aware that the slacker life can do serious damage. The
epicenter of ``This Is Our Youth'' is the extended, hilariously
written, beautifully acted scene in which Warren (Mark Ruffalo) and
Jessica (Missy Yager) get to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   Alone with Jessica in Dennis' studio, the twitchy Warren has
only one thing on his mind, as does Jessica, but she is
thinner-skinned, more quick to take offense and worried about her
reputation. They flirt without finesse, attempt to dance, though
neither is at ease in dancing that requires body contact.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about parents, about 1960s flower children who went on
to become establishment lawyers, about (in Jessica's phrase) ``the
last pathetic remnants of Upper West Side Jewish liberalism.'' With
a ferocity that fuels his passion, the sexy, mini-skirted Jessica
says she is convinced that ``evil has, like, triumphed in our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   They argue, often talking over each other, using the right words
but not always making sense. At one point, she predicts that
eventually he will be an entirely different personality. In 10
years, she tells him, he will be a plastic surgeon, reminiscing
about how wild he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, which Warren finds ludicrous, deeply depresses her.
Why? ``Because it just basically invalidates whoever you are right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren clearly thinks that much of what she says is nonsense,
but she is the first woman he has ever wanted to sleep with who
also made him think for more than a minute. Intoxicated by his
great good luck, he sweeps her off to a suite at the Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo and Ms. Yager are enchanting as the (probably)
short-term lovers. Her Jessica has the makings of a classic
passive-aggressive type, sweetly innocent one minute and, the next,
impatient that he doesn't follow through. For the moment, she is
still experimenting, still uncertain of her ground, not really
aware of just how sexually inviting she is.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo's performance is one of the delights of the season to
date. A lean, awkward, slobbish young man, his Warren can't remain
still for long. This is particularly true when he is with Dennis
(Mark Rosenthal), whose worldliness he certifies by playing the
idiot. If Warren seems to move jerkily, like a windup toy, it is
because each gesture is the result of a separate decision, made in
the nanosecond during which his busy mind has processed all the
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is someone seldom met on stage or screen: the kind of guy
who one day will astonish his old pals by revealing the substantial
character that always existed within the nerdy clown. It is
unlikely he will be a plastic surgeon, maybe a first-class writer.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal is also fine, but Dennis is a less arresting
character. Dennis rings true as long as he is playing slacker-guru
to a very small, devoted, rather feckless group of followers. Time
is passing by. He is like the handsome lifeguard on the brink of
losing his youth as well as the adoration of the girls on the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of ``This Is Our Youth,'' however, Lonergan has
burdened Dennis with a long, sudden confession _ a change of heart,
really _ whose emotional intensity seems bogus. It is sincerely
intended, but it seems less inevitable than obligatory: it gives
shape to a narrative that doesn't need it.
</P>
<P>
   A small reservation about an otherwise supercool entertainment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Theater Company is giving a handsome, carefully
thought-out production to ``Wolf Lullaby,'' Hilary Bell's brisk,
sad Australian play about a 9-year-old girl who murders a boy of
2{.
</P>
<P>
   In the author's note accompanying the published version of the
text, Ms. Bell says the play was suggested by newspaper accounts of
two such real-life murders. She was shocked, not so much by the
hatred that public officials and ordinary folk heaped on the guilty
children, but by ``the ease with which a society relieved itself of
any responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   She finds none of the usual explanations good enough: social
conditions, working parents, bad genes, the influence of
television, the lack of moral guidance at home and in the schools.
Never once, she writes, ``did we turn the mirror back on ourselves,
on a society in which banal acts of evil are committed every
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   That is pretty vague, too, which possibly explains the
unsatisfactory nature of ``Wolf Lullaby'' as anything more than a
poetic consideration of the unknowable. The play's point is not
immediately clear, though Ms. Bell appears to believe that a kinder
society might keep a psychotic personality from slipping into
psychotic behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The play, set in a small Tasmanian town, is about the profoundly
disturbed Lizzie who, at 9, has already been questioned by the
police for shoplifting and for strangling a schoolmate's pet
budgerigar.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie's mother, a barber, and father, a cabdriver, are
separated, but on good terms. They treat her lovingly in their own
ways, though never noticing that she is a desperately needy child,
as quick to lie as she is to confess her unworthiness of their
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes that attempt to recreate something of Lizzie's fantasy
life (she believes she is stalked by a wolf that sometimes swallows
her) punctuate the murder investigation and the falling out between
the guilt-ridden parents. Ms. Bell's dramatic method is chilly,
unemotional, an awkward blend of simulated reportage and basic
psychoanalysis.
</P>
<P>
   As efficiently staged by Neil Pepe, the Atlantic's artistic
director, the production has a clean, minimal look. The adult
actress Kate Blumberg gives a quite amazing performance as Lizzie,
delicately indicating the essential baby-ness of the child, while
revealing her utterly incomprehensible nature.
</P>
<P>
   Also excellent are Mary McCann and Jordan Lage as her parents,
and Larry Bryggman as the police sergeant who investigates the
case. The 75-minute performance is presented without an
intermission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The current offering at Primary Stages is ``The Old Settler,''
John Henry Redwood's gentle, sweet-natured comedy about life in
Harlem in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   It's a play that chooses to remember the good without the bad,
being about the relationship of two aging, church-going sisters,
Elizabeth (Leslie Uggams) and Quilly (Lynda Gravatt), and what
happens when a handsome young fellow, newly arrived from the Deep
South, rents a room in the apartment they share.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomer is Husband Witherspoon (Godfrey L. Simmons Jr.),
who has come to town to marry his childhood sweetheart.
Unfortunately, his sweetheart (Rosalyn Coleman) has not only
changed her name from Lou Bessie to Charmaine, but also her way of
life. She is in the fast lane now.
</P>
<P>
   On the rebound, Husband promptly falls in love with Elizabeth,
whom Lou Bessie ridicules as ``the old settler,'' an epithet for an
older woman who has never married.
</P>
<P>
   As long as it lasts, Husband's courtship of the surprised, still
beautiful Elizabeth is both very moving and most cheering, though
Quilly remains dour and skeptical and Lou Bessie scathingly
sarcastic. There is no surprise about the way things must turn out,
but the production, directed by Harold Scott, is very easy to take.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood can write funny lines, which are delivered with bite and
style by the members of the lively cast. Seeing Ms. Uggams in this
relatively down-home context is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its decent sentiments, ``The Old Settler'' avoids
sentimentality. It has the authenticity and lack of pretense of an
Early American sampler.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Rangers score 1.55 goals a
game whether they need to or not. While getting only one Tuesday,
they lost by 3-1 to the New Jersey Devils, ending their undefeated
streak at six.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a goal scorer; that's very obvious,'' said Coach John
Muckler. ``The organization is doing everything within their power.
I'm sure, somewhere down the line, something will shake loose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have 17 goals in 11 games, and they have not
defeated the Devils in their last 11 regular-season meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Rangers could use a player like Vancouver's Pavel
Bure, who refuses to report and might score 50 for someone,
somewhere. With the Islanders trying to pry him away, the Canucks'
general manager, Brian Burke, can use one New York team as leverage
against the other. He and Neil Smith, his Ranger counterpart,
attended a general managers' meeting in New York Tuesday and made
plans to talk further.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranger goal was scored by Kevin Stevens, set up by John
MacLean, tying the score midway through. MacLean, the former Devil
star, played brilliantly in his return to the Meadowlands. Along
with the assist, he had seven shots on goal. ``I was nervous, but
as the game went on I felt comfortable,'' said MacLean, who didn't
seemed bothered by a few boos. ``It was emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   One line that struggled was the threesome of Niklas Sundstrom,
Todd Harvey and Wayne Gretzky. Sundstrom seems to tighten up when
in scoring position. He had no shots on goal. Harvey, called the
``heartbeat of the team'' by Muckler, had his first average game.
He was matched against defenseman Scott Stevens, the Devils'
captain.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, with a chance to give his team the lead on a
first-period power play, hit the side of the net, just wide of the
right post, after Brian Leetch's pass set him up on the open side.
``I knew I had a lot of time, so I stopped it, and quite frankly I
just missed the whole, wide-open net,'' Gretzky said. ``I never
should have missed it.'' It won't count as a shot on goal, so he
remains at 29 shots with just 1 goal for the season.
</P>
<P>
   On the Devils' clinching goal, in the 58th minute, Gretzky came
back to help goalie Mike Richter, standing behind him between the
pipes. But the puck caromed off Richter and beat the Great One on
the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, who maintains a sense of humor most of the time,
quipped that he wanted to complain to the referee that the goal
should have been disallowed because men were in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were all our own guys,'' Richter said.

<P>
   Clinton administration officials expressed delight Tuesday night
as Democrats appeared poised to finish better than expected in many
tight races across the country, improving the political prospects
of President Clinton as he fights off a Republican-led effort to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far tonight has been a good night for America and a good
night for Democrats,'' said Vice President Al Gore. ``America had a
choice, and they chose progress over partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute push by Democratic Party officials, including
Clinton, to boost black voter turnout, seemed to have paid off as
Democrats knocked off the competition in close Senate races in New
York, North Carolina, South Carolina, California and Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   With the outcome likely to determine whether Republicans in
Congress have the momentum to impeach Clinton, White House
officials were buoyed by the prospect of denying the Republicans
the gains they were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from the election was that people in this country
want to know what you are for,'' said White House senior aide
Douglas Sosnik. ``If you are an elected official, they want to know
where you are going to lead the country,'' he said.``People are
sick of all the negative partisan attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton watched the returns come in from the office of his new
chief-of-staff, John Podesta, along with political director Craig
T. Smith. Clinton also made the first of several victory calls to
Democratic candidates _ Evan Bayh, who won the Senate race in
Indiana, Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and
Senator Charles Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been a tireless campaigner on
behalf of Democratic candidates, partly because of the impeachment
distraction for the president, holed up in the White House theater
watching the new movie, ``Beloved,'' starring Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were later expected to gather in theater with
friends, staff and members of the Cabinet to watch the returns,
said White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss Toby.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton told reporters before meeting with his economic
advisers that results of the election would ``depend upon who makes
the effort to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is a referendum on all the hopes of the
American people for the future, and their assessment of the present
condition, and how we get from here to a better tomorrow. I think
that's what it will be. That's what all elections are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart knocked down
suggestions that the president was responsible for any damage his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky may have caused Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is the leader of the Democratic Party. I think
he's done a fine job of articulating the agenda and the issues,
especially where we differ from the Republican Party,'' Lockhart
said. He and other aides noted that the president worked feverishly
to raise money for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But, because of the impeachment shadow, Clinton's help was
limited to fundraising at private functions. He did not stump for
candidates at massive rallies and was mere background noise in most
Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   White House strategists say they have come to learn that
presidential appearances do not translate into votes for candidates
and that they also are too costly for the candidate. Instead, they
had Clinton adopt a Rose Garden strategy of using the White House
as a perch for policy announcements that would highlight
differences between Republicans and Democrats on issues such as
Social Security, education, and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most frequent efforts were made on behalf of two
big-state Senate Democratic candidates. He aggressively raised
money for New York Representative Charles Schumer, who faced
Republican incumbent Alfonse M. D'Amato, and California incumbent
Senator Barbara Boxer, running against Republican Matt Fong.

CENTRAL AMERICA ATTEMPTS TO DIG OUT FROM BENEATH HURRICANE'S
DESTRUCTION 
 
By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ With a tropical sun occasionally piercing
the waning tail of a storm called Mitch, Central America on Tuesday
continued to dig out from beneath the rubble, recovered bodies of
its victims and struggled to aid those who survived.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch, which hovered off Honduras for much of last week and then
cut a deadly path across the impoverished waist of Central America
over the weekend, killed at least 7,000 people in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials say the storm claimed at least 5,000 lives in
that country alone, though the bodies of only a fraction of that
number have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, up to 2,400 people are feared dead, and 1,338
deaths have been confirmed. El Salvador has reported 222 deaths,
and Guatemala has confirmed 157. Mitch-related deaths also have
been reported in Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico and Jamaica. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; On Tuesday, after being downgraded to a tropical depression and
moving through Guatemala and southern Mexico, Mitch reignited into
a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico with sustained winds of 45
mph. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said it was moving
toward Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In a seemingly cruel twist of nature, the Cerro Negro volcano _
located about 22 miles from the site of a mudslide on Saturday that
killed up to 2,000 Nicaraguans _ began to erupt. No damage or
casualties were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Central America officials say they fear many of those reported
missing in the aftermath of Mitch _ some 11,000 people in Honduras
alone _ may, in fact, be dead. But Mitch's final human toll may
never be known.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims remain buried beneath tons of mud. Many have been
swept away by swollen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Entire sections of Central America remain cut off by flood
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that as much as 80 percent of Honduras' crops
_ which account for half the country's $4 billion annual economy _
have been destroyed. In Nicaragua, officials estimate that as much
as 30 percent of the country's income-generating coffee crop and a
huge proportion of its grain fields have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua on Tuesday, rescue teams burned many bodies where
they found them in an effort to prevent the spread of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Nicaraguan victims died Saturday, when the
rain-filled crater of a dormant volcano burst its seams, unleashing
a mudslide a few miles wide and many feet high that obliterated
four villages. Only a handful of the 4,500 people who lived in
those villages have been found alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have anywhere to run,'' a middle-aged man who
survived but lost his family to the mud told Nicaraguan television
from his hospital bed Tuesday. ``It was higher than our house. We
couldn't get anything out of the house. We couldn't save any of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Nicaraguan officials have suggested that the site of the
mudslide, near the northwestern agricultural center of Chinandega
on the Pacific coast, should be left untouched as a ``national
cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitch wreaked havoc on nearly every piece of Nicaragua _ one of
the poorest countries in the hemisphere, where the U.S. government
spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support a civil war
against the socialist Sandinista government throughout the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The population's situation is tragic,'' Alfonso Ortega Urbino,
Nicaragua's ambassador to the United Nations said at a New York
news conference broadcast on television here. He said his country
needs at least $50 million in immediate aid.
</P>
<P>
   At a telethon held Tuesday in the Nicaraguan capital of Managua
to collect money, food and clothing for storm victims, President
Ricardo Aleman announced that ``massive'' aid from the United
States and Latin American countries would begin arriving by plane
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguan Transportation Minister Jaime Bonilla said that
stormwaters had flooded 30 major highways across the country and
destroyed or damaged 42 bridges, making transportation in much of
the nation impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Roads leading to the city of Leon opened Tuesday. Bonilla said
roads to Chinandega, Matagalpa and other towns in the sodden north
would open Wednesday. ``We are doing everything possible,'' Bonilla
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastors of Prostestant churches along Nicaragua's isolated
Caribbean coast reported that the badly flooded Coco River, which
forms the border with Honduras, had cut off villages. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In one village, 1,200 people had been without food or water
since the weekend, one pastor announced at the Managua telethon. In
another, nearly 1,000 people had taken refuge from floodwaters in a
Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help these people,'' the minister implored, ``or their fate
will be on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help the flood victims, thousands of Managua
residents flocked to the gym of an elite Roman Catholic high
school, where Tuesday's telethon was held. People carried money,
medicine, bags of food, truckloads of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   During a long afternoon filled with countless pleas for help
from civic leaders, politicians and clergy, people donated more
than $500,000 in cash as well as tons of food and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguans _ often bitterly divided by social position,
religion and politics in the past _ came together for a common
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age children of Managua's wealthiest families worked
alongside residents of some of the city's grimmest slums, sorting
clothing and toting food and furniture to waiting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Women arrived in chauffeur-driven sports utility vehicles that
lined up behind cars on bald tires to drop off donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they needed volunteers, so we came,'' said Francisco
Javier Rojas, 17, one of a half dozen young men who came to the
telethon from a working-class neighborhood to help.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas and his friends, whose own neighborhood was flooded over
the weekend when Lake Managua surged over its banks, stayed busy
throughout the day loading heavy sacks of food onto trucks bound
for the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of uniformed boys from a Catholic prep school
carried the supplies to Rojas and the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, you wouldn't see guys like us anywhere near a place
like this,'' Marlon Velasquez, a friend of Rojas, said. ``And you
wouldn't see guys like those doing anything that would make them
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicaragua is a country that has suffered a lot with war and
weather and every sort of disaster,'' Velasquez said. ``But we're
still here. And we have to work together.'' &QL;

GOP KEEPS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL BUT SUFFERS EMBARRASSING LOSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: New grafs 7-9 with Boxer, Murray, Moseley-Braun results)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans apparently kept control of Congress in
the Tuesday elections but faced an embarrassing loss of House seats
and the failure to achieve larger gains in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats knocked off two incumbent senators, including a
breath-taking victory in New York where Rep. Charles E. Schumer
knocked out Republican Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato in a bitter,
expensive race that saw the candidates spend a total of about $32
million.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also scored a major upset in North Carolina where
challenger John Edwards defeated Sen. Lauch Faircloth, a first-term
Republican conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans currently hold a 55 to 45 majority
over Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Republicans have a 22 vote margin over the
Democrats, 228 to 206. CNN projected that Republicans were likely
to lose three seats, cutting their margin to 19. The anemic
Republican showing raised questions about House Speaker Newt
Gingrich's job security.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich told ABC News that he doesn't see any challengers for
his job and argued that his House Republican leadership team was
the only such team that has been reelected since the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The ranks of Democratic women remained constant in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer defeated Republican
challenger Matt Fong. In Washington state, self-proclaimed
``mom-in-tennis-shoes'' Sen. Patty Murray swatted away a challenge
by Republican Rep. Linda Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, who was also elected in the 1992 Year
of the Woman and has been caught up in scandals ever since, lost
her seat to state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald. In the gender category,
the loss of Moseley-Braun was offset by the addition of Democrat
Blanche Lincoln, a former House member who defeated former Capitol
Hill staffer Bill Alexander, for the open Senate seat created by
the retirement of Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   In a closely watched Senate race, Democratic Sen. Ernest M.
Hollings eked out victory for a sixth-term over Republican
challenger Rep. Bob Inglis, a three-term conservative House member.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana also nabbed the seat
vacated by retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coates.
</P>
<P>
   In a widely predicted victory for Republicans, GOP Gov. George
Voinovich claimed the open seat of retiring Democratic Sen. John
Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats actually gain House seats, it would be an historic
reversal. The party controlling the White House customarily faces
an uphill battle in mid-term elections. Since 1918, the party
holding the White House has suffered an average loss of 27 seats in
the House and six seats in the Senate in mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the president's party did not lose seats was in
1934, just as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, was
launching the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee had predicted a gain of 10 to 15 House
seats for the GOP. His Democratic counterpart, Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas, forecast that Democrats would pick up seats in the House,
but questioned whether they would get the 11 seats they need to get
back into the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer, the general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said the Democrats' strong showing was a message to
Republicans that they should quickly wrap up their impeachment
proceedings and ``get back to business'' because voters don't think
President Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky warrants his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., said the
strong showing by Democratic candidates in the House ``really means
people are saying let's get back to the kitchen-table issues
everybody cares about'' and finish up the impeachment business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tonight the people are saying to do it fairly but do
it quickly,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Pitney Jr., a political scientist at Claremont McKenna
College, said the election was not a referendum on the Lewinsky
scandal, but rather was indicative of other factors such as a
strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent stock market turmoil, the U.S. economy continues
to show surprising perkiness. The gross domestic product grew at a
stronger-than-expected 3.3 percent rate in the third quarter,
interest rates are low and unemployment hovers at a low 4.6
percent. Inflation has been almost invisible at less than 2
percent.

DEMOCRATS VICTORIOUS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR RACE

<P>
   Democrats captured the California governorship for the first
time in 16 years Tuesday in one of several pivotal victories that
signaled a partial Democratic reemergence in state capitals in the
face of years of overwhelming Republican rule.
</P>
<P>
   In what was widely regarded as the single most important race of
1998, California Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis defeated
Republican state Attorney General Dan Lungren to take control of
the most populous state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the California results only headlined several
other key victories from the East Coast to the west. Democratic
challengers defeated Republican incumbent governors in South
Carolina and Alabama, while winning an open race in Iowa to put
that state in the Democratic column for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not all good news for Democrats. Republican
incumbents maintained their hold on most of the largest states, and
George W. Bush and Jeb Bush, two sons of the former president,
coasted to victory in Texas and Florida, the country's second and
fourth most populous states.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman also
pushed a statewide lottery to fund education reforms in his
victorious campaign against Republican incumbent Governor Fob James
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In initial network projections, Republican incumbents won with
relative ease in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arkansas
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's victory in Texas could launch him toward a race
for the White House. In Florida, his brother, Jeb, was the
projected winner against Democratic Lieutenant Governor Buddy
MacKay. Not since 1971, when members of the Rockefeller dynasty
held the governorships of New York and Arkansas, have two brothers
served as governor at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, incumbent Republican governors had displayed
an activist flair on such issues as education reform and health
care, in contrast to their congressional counterparts, who had done
battle with Democratic reform proposals. With this activism, the
GOP was looking to keep a lock on most of the 10 largest states,
the notable exception being California, where they appeared
destined for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 36 governorships were decided Tuesday night, with
Democratic and Republican leaders each predicting they would gain
two or three seats. In state after state, especially Ohio, many of
the television advertisements were negative to the point of being
brutal. But President Clinton's political and legal troubles over
his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky barely surfaced as an issue in
any of the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Bushes, other luminaries were seeking
governorships. In Minnesota, Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III, son
of the former Democratic vice president, was locked in a difficult
race in which a former professional wrestler nicknamed ``The Body''
was siphoning crucial votes away from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And in Ohio, Republican Robert Taft, great grandson of President
William Howard Taft, was widely believed to hold an advantage
against Lee Fisher, the former Democratic attorney general. That
campaign had evolved into a particularly spiteful battle,
characterized by dueling advertising campaigns about each other's
ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   California remained the biggest prize, with Lieutenant Governor
Gray Davis in a strong position to bring the governorship into
Democratic hands. His opponent, state Attorney General Dan Lungren,
was criticized by fellow Republicans for his decision to wrap
himself in the Reagan legacy.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast, many of the gubernatorial candidates raised
record amounts of cash, often pouring their funds into hard-edged
advertising campaigns.

   NEW YORK _ Charles Schumer, a congressman from Brooklyn with a
tenacious political spirit and a huge campaign war chest, won
election to the U.S. Senate Tuesday night, toppling Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato and ending his reign as one of the most imposing figures
New York Republicans have produced in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat from Park Slope, adopted many of D'Amato's
own political techniques, from relentless fund raising to a
take-no-prisoners style of television advertising, to achieve a
goal that has eluded Democrats since 1980, when D'Amato slipped
into office in a race that was split three ways. In the process,
Schumer, 47, who has served nine terms in Congress, provided the
national Democratic Party with one of its biggest victories of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   With 64 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Schumer had
1,544,199 votes, or 54 percent. D'Amato had 1,270,791 votes, or 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other races, Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, won the kind
of easy re-election that would have seemed unthinkable when Pataki,
an unknown State Senator from Peekskill in northern Westchester
County, defeated Mario Cuomo four years ago. He easily defeated
Peter Vallone, a Democrat and the New York City Council speaker,
with B. Thomas Golisano, a wealthy businessman from Rochester
running as the Independence Party candidate, and Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, on the Liberal Party line, trailing far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dennis Vacco, was in a tight contest with Eliot
Spitzer, a Democrat and former state prosecutor in New York City.
And in a fourth statewide race, for comptroller, Carl McCall, a
Democrat and the first black statewide elected official in New York
history, defeated Bruce Blakeman, the majority leader of the Nassau
County Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the outcome of the Senate race that in a single
evening altered New York's political landscape, eclipsing one of
the country's most ferocious political personalities and ending an
era in Republican politics in the state. It was a rare moment of
good news for New York Democrats in what has been a barren decade,
and it immediately established Schumer as the party's presumptive
political leader.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato called Schumer at his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria to
concede at 10:45 p.m. Schumer, moving to the song ``Simply the
Best,'' by Tina Turner, declared victory at 11:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you, New York,'' Schumer said. ``You have
honored me with your trust. And I promise all New Yorkers that as
hard as I fought to win this election, I'll fight even harder for
everyone in this state, for the country that we love.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, referring to the bitter campaign, Schumer said,
``Campaigns more often than not must focus on the thing that
divides us. But government and public service must focus more on
the causes that unite us.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called Schumer with congratulations about 9:30
p.m., before Schumer had declared victory or D'Amato had conceded
defeat. Clinton's quick gesture clearly reflected White House
ebullience at the result in New York. Clinton campaigned twice in
the state with Schumer, and Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the
state four times to campaign against D'Amato, who ran the Senate
investigation into the Clintons' Whitewater business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer ran one of the most efficient and relentless campaigns
by a Democrat in New York in years, and certainly the most intense
challenge D'Amato faced during his 18 years in statewide politics.
Even D'Amato's friends came to view his campaign as a faltering and
uncertain effort that often seemed unable to adjust to a pugilistic
and nimble challenger and to a political climate that had changed
since D'Amato first came upon the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The formula that had served D'Amato so well for so many years _
a combination of heavy spending and an emphasis on his attention to
voters' local concerns _ apparently failed this time to erase
doubts about D'Amato's ideology and his integrity. His attempts to
discredit Schumer first as a liberal and a New York City partisan,
a strategy that brought D'Amato victory in 1986 and 1992, did not
work this time. A mid-campaign course correction in which D'Amato
began to attack Schumer for missing votes in Congress in order to
run for Senate failed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, interviews with voters leaving the polls throughout the
state suggested that it was Schumer who had set the tone of this
campaign, even as D'Amato outspent him nearly two to one, with
relentless emphasis on a single campaign attack: ``Too many lies
for too long.'' That was the tagline of a television advertisement
that went on the air within 48 hours of Schumer's victory in the
primary .
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of voters surveyed said that they did not
consider D'Amato honest or trustworthy. And about 60 percent said
they thought D'Amato had, after 18 years, been in office too long.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly striking finding in the exit poll, D'Amato
received the support of only one in four Jewish voters _ about half
as well as he did with the same group of voters in 1986 and 1992.
That figure strongly suggested that D'Amato had been hurt both by
his decision to enlist Holocaust survivors to attack Schumer's
record on Jewish issues, an effort that Schumer and other Jewish
leaders denounced as inappropriate. He may also have been damaged
by his later use of a Yiddish vulgarism to describe Schumer, who is
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   The fall-off in support explains why D'Amato spent so many hours
at the end of the campaign in conservative Jewish communities,
speaking to voters who presumably should have been solidly in his
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pataki did extremely well Tuesday, his success was
tempered by D'Amato's loss. It was D'Amato who paved the way for
Pataki's victory four years ago, and Pataki tried to repay the
favor this week, appearing constantly with D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of D'Amato, Pataki is now the dominant Republican
in New York, but there are clearly limits to his influence with
voters, and that might complicate any effort by Pataki's promoters
to present him as a figure of national potential in 2000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The twin events of Pataki's victory and D'Amato's loss presented
a difficult moment Tuesday night for the small group of Republicans
who ran both campaigns. Both men's supporters gathered at the same
midtown hotel Tuesday night, and so the same stage was the site
first of Pataki's victory speech and then of D'Amato's concession.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato did not appear with Pataki when he came down to declare
victory, but the Republican governor paid tribute to the Senator,
without making mention of what had befallen the man most
responsible for Pataki's rapid rise in state politics. ``He will
always be a great Senator for the people of New York State,''
Pataki said to applause from an emotionally conflicted crowd at the
Hilton Towers that had by then seen the television projections of
his loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican crowd was at once exhilarated and mournful, torn
between Pataki's victory and the loss of a man who had been a
fixture in Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we lost something _ part of the fabric of New York
_ to not be able to say, `Senator Al D'Amato,''' said Bernadette
Castro, the state Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Historic
Preservation, who was her party's candidate for Senate against
Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But even Castro suggested some concern about the way D'Amato had
run this campaign. ``I know what the Senator's done, his substance,
the breast cancer research,'' Castro said. ``As a Senator he
accomplished so much, and I wish he had talked more about all the
things he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Perlee, the director of the state Lottery Division,
expressed concern about what Schumer's victory might mean for
upstate New York, echoing what had been one of D'Amato's early
attacks on Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   A Schumer victory, he said before D'Amato conceded, ``would be
devastating for upstate. Al D'Amato has been the best thing that
happened to upstate this century. Schumer doesn't care about
anything north of the Tappan Zee bridge. A lot of people up there
are concerned that they would be disenfranchised.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schumer's headquarters was crackling throughout the
evening as the crowd followed the returns on television monitors,
waiting for Schumer to deliver his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   They burst into applause when Schumer and his family emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer did not take the stage until after he got a call from
D'Amato. In an unusual move, Schumer did not wait for D'Amato to
publicly concede before giving his 13-minute acceptance speech.
D'Amato's advisers offered no explanation for the Senator's delay
in offering a speech.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer spent most of the last year excoriating D'Amato as
untrustworthy and a political extremist, and when he first
mentioned D'Amato's name, the crowd responded with a low chorus of
boos.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer raised his hands to quiet his supporters. ``Senator
D'Amato and I have often held very different views,'' he said.
``But there is one area where I believe we can all agree on Senator
D'Amato's tenure in public life. He has always been a hard worker.
He has always fought hard for the causes he believes in. I respect
his tenacity, and his family should be proud of his service.''

DE LA HOYA'S POSTPONEMENT UPSETS QUARTEY CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The highly anticipated World Boxing Council welterweight
championship bout between Oscar De La Hoya and Ike Quartey,
scheduled for Nov. 21, was postponed Tuesday, three days after De
La Hoya cut the top of his left eyelid during sparring at his
training camp at Big Bear, Calif. The fight has been rescheduled
for Feb. 13 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing, because this sets his schedule
back,'' said Bob Arum, the president of Top Rank, De La Hoya's
promoter. ``But there's nothing you can do about it. I'm taking a
philosophical approach. Sometimes things happen for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this year, De La Hoya (29-0) has had a bout
postponed because of injury. An arm injury delayed his fight
against Patrick Charpentier, a bout that was scheduled for last
February but put off to June, when De La Hoya won by a knockout. De
La Hoya, 25, defeated Julio Cesar Chavez on Sept. 18 to set up his
match with Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Samuels, a spokesman for Top Rank, said De La Hoya was
sparring with Eric Holland of New Mexico last Saturday when Holland
threw an uppercut. The laces on Holland's glove clipped the top of
De La Hoya's left eye and lacerated his eyelid. De La Hoya went to
a plastic surgeon and had two dissolving stitches placed in his
eye. De La Hoya was cleared to train, but the doctor told him not
to spar for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a very deep cut,'' Arum said. ``On Saturday the
doctor gave us every indication that he would be OK to train, but
he couldn't spar.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya did not believe he could be prepared for the fight if
he did not spar for another three weeks, so the fight was
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, but the guy is a franchise fighter for us,
and you don't want to have him entering the ring with that type of
injury and not being 100 percent ready for what could be the
defining fight of his career,'' said Lou DiBella, senior vice
president of programming for HBO Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Dino Duva, the president of Main Events, the promoter for
Quartey, said he was angered by the postponement. ``I was told
about Oscar's cut several days ago, and when I approached Bob Arum
about it, he assured me that the cut would not be a problem,'' Duva
said. ``Now I receive a call from Bob that the cut is worse than
they thought. I'm very annoyed by the way this whole situation
unfolded.''
</P>
<P>
   The boxing calendar is so crowded that De La Hoya could not get
another date until Feb. 13. The Rolling Stones will play a concert
at the Thomas and Mack Arena in Las Vegas the day before the fight,
and it's on the President's Day holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This is another tough break for Quartey (34-0-1), who has not
been in the ring since he fought Jose Luis Lopez to a draw on Oct.
17, 1997. In the interim, Quartey, 28, has been stricken with
malaria and stripped of his World Boxing Association welterweight
title for not defending it in a timely fashion. He will not take a
tuneup fight while waiting for the date against De La Hoya, because
he does not want to put at risk his $4 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson Back in Training
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson headed to training camp Tuesday to prepare for his
first bout since regaining his license from Nevada last month. But
Shelly Finkel, his boxing adviser, said no opponent has been
selected, despite reports that Francois Botha has a contract to
fight Tyson on Jan. 16. Finkel said the Tyson camp is still looking
at possible opponents and that it is close to reaching an agreement
with Dan Goosen of America Presents as his promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been signed yet,'' Finkel said. ``We're still
working on things. Everything is still very preliminary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tyson bout will be broadcast on Showtime and will most
likely take place at the MGM Grand Casino or the Thomas and Mack
Arena in Las Vegas on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has not fought since he was disqualified for biting both
of Evander Holyfield's ears during a world championship bout on
June 28, 1997. The Nevada Commission revoked his license and fined
him $3 million. The commission gave Tyson his license back
following a hearing in Las Vegas on Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed Fight a TV Draw
</P>
<P>
   The Prince Naseem Hamed-Wayne McCullough featherweight
championship bout on HBO last Saturday night did a 12.8 rating and
a 24 share. That was the highest-rated bout for an HBO boxing card
this year. The entire boxing show did an 11 rating.
</P>
<P>
   This was the seventh consecutive boxing show on HBO that has
done a double-digit rating.

ANALYSIS: A COUNTRY HAPPY WITH ITS LOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for updating, to reflect election results, and for light
rewriting)   (mk) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr. c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The votes Americans cast in Tuesday's midterm elections will
inevitably have an impact on the impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton, and hence on the remaining months of his
presidency. But according to a survey of voters leaving the polls,
that was not what most people had on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will have an effect on Clinton's future,'' said
Ferrel Guillory of the University of North Carolina, one of the
swing states in the balloting. ``But that doesn't mean Clinton's
past had much effect on this election. Everything I've seen and
heard suggests the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats fared significantly better than they had
expected, at least in part, the polls suggested, because the public
disapproved of the way Republican leaders in Congress have handled
the Clinton investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ohio River Valley, Democrats won close House races in
three states. They turned out two incumbent Republican senators,
Alfonse D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina,
both of whom waged harsh, negative television campaigns that were
devised by Arthur Finkelstein, a prominent New York media
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ernest Hollings Jr., D-S.C., one of the last Democratic
survivors from the one-party South, won re-election in the face of
a stiff challenge, and Democrats defeated Republican governors in
Alabama and South Carolina. But Republicans apparently took
Democratic Senate seats in Illinois, as expected, and apparently in
Kentucky, where the race was tight.
</P>
<P>
   An unusual number of other Senate races seemed headed for photo
finishes, reflecting a close partisan division that also showed up
in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, nearly six voters in ten said their vote was
cast neither in support of nor in opposition to Clinton, but for
other reasons. About two in ten told interviewers for a consortium
of five television networks and The Associated Press that they were
expressing backing for the president, and about the same number
said they were expressing disapproval of him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, preliminary tallies suggested that the Democrats may have
succeeded in stimulating a sizeable black turnout with last-minute
efforts including a visit by Clinton to a black church in Baltimore
on Sunday and a television spot that concluded: ``Next Tuesday,
vote Democratic. And tell Congress we're ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   If the vote did not turn upon the president, it may have been
substantially affected by resentment of the tactics of Kenneth
Starr, the special prosecutor, and the Republicans on the House
Judiciary Committee. The weaker-than-expected Republican showing
will mean not only fewer anti-Clinton votes in the House and
Senate, but also less zealous pursuit of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Among those elected were all 435 of the representatives who will
be called upon next year, if the process unfolds as expected, to
vote ``yea'' or ``nay'' on articles of impeachment. Also chosen, in
an election in which fewer than four of ten eligible voters
bothered to participate, were a third of those who will sit as
jurors if the House sends the case to the Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, neither Republican efforts to demonize the president
for his relationship with Monica Lewinsky through a late flurry of
television ads in pivotal districts, nor the Democrats' efforts to
picture congressional Republicans as mindless partisans determined
to savage Clinton at all costs, succeeded in making the election a
referendum on the president.
</P>
<P>
   It was not, in fact, a referendum at all. Unlike the Republican
sweep of four years ago, this was a typical midterm election in the
sense that people tended to respond to the candidates themselves
and to issues that seemed important in their localities rather than
to national imperatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a Seinfeld election,'' said Curtis Gans, director of
the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, which
monitors voter turnout. ``He said his show wasn't about anything,
and neither was this election.''
</P>
<P>
   When people were pressed to say what issue mattered most to
their voting decisions, almost a quarter mentioned either the
Lewinsky affair or ``moral and ethical issues,'' which might be
taken to mean the same thing. But more than three-quarters
mentioned other issues like education or Social Security, jobs or
taxes, with education at the head of the list. Schools were
featured in television commercials, handbills and stump speeches in
a number of the hardest-fought contests this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of ways, the exit poll confirmed the findings of
dozens of surveys taken over the past six months. Voters expressed
approval of Clinton's performance as president _ two-thirds gave
him a favorable rating _ disapproval of his personal conduct and
disappointment at Congress' performance under Republican
leadership. Most said they would just as soon see the impeachment
matter dropped, although the electorate was divided, the exit poll
found, on whether Congress should censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed robust confidence in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the country is happy with its lot,'' a top Republican
strategist said last weekend. ``No winds of discontent, no tidal
waves of change.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors favoring the status quo. Only 34
members of the House of Representatives and only five senators, far
fewer than average, are retiring this year, and most seats change
party hands when they are open. Incumbents also had a strong
advantage in raising money this year.
</P>
<P>
   No president's party in this century has made a net gain in
House seats midway through a second presidential term, although the
Democrats still stood a chance late Tuesday night of breaking that
precedent. Clinton's travails led to widespread predictions a month
or so ago of at least modest gains by the Republicans, but that
view softened as Election Day approached.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In addition to the apparent backlash against the Republicans,
another factor in the improved Democratic showing may have been a
string of successes for Clinton, while wearing his governing and
not his campaigning hat.
</P>
<P>
   While Vice President Al Gore _ increasingly introduced to
audiences as ``the next president of the United States'' _
barnstormed through more than a dozen states, Clinton, by most
impartial accounts, bested the Republican leadership in the budget
deal; played midwife to a Middle East land-for-peace agreement,
worked within the G-7 group of industrialized nations to stabilize
the global economy, and grabbed a few rays of the limelight when
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, returned to space.
</P>
<P>
   One result must have given particular comfort to Gore, whose
political style is sometimes so wooden that he once compared
himself to an oak plank. Lt. Gov. Gray Davis of California, the
victor in the gubernatorial race in the nation's largest state, is
even less colorful than Gore, but that did not hurt him much in a
race against a strongly ideological rival, Dan Lundgren. Gore may
face a right-wing Republican in the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Or he may face Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a studiously
pragmatic politician who was re-elected by a sizable majority. Bush
and his younger brother Jeb, the victor in the Florida governor's
race, will be strongly placed in the early phases of the struggle
for the Republican presidential nomination as the governors of two
of the nation's four biggest states.
</P>
<P>
   It looked, in fact, like a good election for moderates, with
victories for Davis, the two Bushes, Republican Gov. George
Voinovich of Ohio in a Senate race and a number of other centrist
House and Senate candidates of both parties, as compared to the
avalanche of right-wing triumphs only four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This was particularly noticeable in the governors' races. As
more and more government power has moved from Washington to the
statehouses, voters have seemed eager to keep the blatant
partisanship that characterizes Washington these days out of
governments that live closer to where they live.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials expressed delight Tuesday night
as Democrats appeared poised to finish better than expected in many
tight races across the country, improving the political prospects
of President Clinton as he fights off a Republican-led effort to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far tonight has been a good night for America and a good
night for Democrats,'' said Vice President Al Gore. ``America had a
choice, and they chose progress over partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute push by Democratic Party officials, including
Clinton, to boost black voter turnout, seemed to have paid off as
Democrats knocked off the competition in close Senate races in New
York, North Carolina, South Carolina, California and Washington
state.
</P>
<P>
   With the outcome likely to determine whether Republicans in
Congress have the momentum to impeach Clinton, White House
officials were buoyed by the prospect of denying the Republicans
the gains they were expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from the election was that people in this country
want to know what you are for,'' said White House senior aide
Douglas Sosnik. ``If you are an elected official, they want to know
where you are going to lead the country,'' he said.``People are
sick of all the negative partisan attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton watched the returns come in from the office of his new
chief-of-staff, John Podesta, along with political director Craig
T. Smith. Clinton also made the first of several victory calls to
Democratic candidates _ Evan Bayh, who won the Senate race in
Indiana, Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota and
Senator Charles Robb of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been a tireless campaigner on
behalf of Democratic candidates, partly because of the impeachment
distraction for the president, holed up in the White House theater
watching the new movie, ``Beloved,'' starring Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were later expected to gather in theater with
friends, staff and members of the Cabinet to watch the returns,
said White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss Toby.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton told reporters before meeting with his economic
advisers that results of the election would ``depend upon who makes
the effort to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election is a referendum on all the hopes of the
American people for the future, and their assessment of the present
condition, and how we get from here to a better tomorrow. I think
that's what it will be. That's what all elections are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart knocked down
suggestions that the president was responsible for any damage his
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky may have caused Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is the leader of the Democratic Party. I think
he's done a fine job of articulating the agenda and the issues,
especially where we differ from the Republican Party,'' Lockhart
said. He and other aides noted that the president worked feverishly
to raise money for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But, because of the impeachment shadow, Clinton's help was
limited to fundraising at private functions. He did not stump for
candidates at massive rallies and was mere background noise in most
Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   White House strategists say they have come to learn that
presidential appearances do not translate into votes for candidates
and that they also are too costly for the candidate. Instead, they
had Clinton adopt a Rose Garden strategy of using the White House
as a perch for policy announcements that would highlight
differences between Republicans and Democrats on issues such as
Social Security, education, and health care.

   Clinton's most frequent efforts were made on behalf of two
big-state Senate Democratic candidates. He aggressively raised
money for New York Representative Charles Schumer, who faced
Republican incumbent Alfonse M. D'Amato, and California incumbent
Senator Barbara Boxer, running against Republican Matt Fong.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS RETAIN CONTROL, BUT FALL SHORT OF PREDICTED
GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Republicans in the House seemed to be falling short Tuesday
night of the gains they had predicted as one embattled Democrat
after another won re-election in the face of the year-long scandal
over President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The first returns from battleground states in the South and
Midwest suggested that the House election would amount to a virtual
endorsement of the status quo, a result that would leave
Republicans with little mandate to push ahead with the impeachment
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans were likely to retain control of the House,
Democrats considered it a victory that they were able to stave off
sharp losses and contain the Republican majority. Since World War
II, the average loss for the president's party in midterm elections
has been 27 House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break even or even pick up a seat, it would be a
historic reversal of what usually happens,'' said House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the chief Republican strategist who
just two weeks ago held out the possibility that House Republicans
could gain as many as 40 seats, told supporters in suburban Atlanta
that his party would keep the House. ``This will be the first time
in 70 years that Republicans will have kept control of the House
for a third time.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-evening, Rep. Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader from
Texas, said cautiously, ``It's too early to be disappointed.'' He
added, ``We knew all these races were going to be close.''
</P>
<P>
   Most House incumbents in both parties easily coasted to another
term in a year marked by voter content with the economy and no
overriding national issues.
</P>
<P>
   With so few members of Congress facing strong challenges,
control of the House came down to several dozen fiercely fought
contests scattered across the nation. By mid-evening, not one
incumbent had lost.
</P>
<P>
   More than any overriding national theme, local issues,
personalities and campaign financing helped decide many races. Only
a few House candidates raised the impeachment issue or Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky as a driving issue, although
Republicans in the last few days of the campaign ran television
spots invoking the scandal in several conservative districts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thirty-four House seats were left open by retirements.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, the two parties swapped control of two House seats
that became vacant when Reps. Jim Bunning, a Republican, and Scotty
Baesler, a Democrat, faced each other in the Senate race. Former
state Rep. Ernie Fletcher, a Republican, picked up Baesler's seat
while Ken Lucas, a Democrat, proved conservative enough to capture
Bunning's district.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anne Northup, a freshman close to the House Republican
leadership, won re-election. Her opponent, Chris Gorman, had been
one of the handful of Democrats who ran ads seeking to wield the
Republicans' handling of the impeachment inquiry against his
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, Rep. Julia Carson, a Democratic freshman who had
been considered endangered, defeated her Republican challenger Gary
Hofmeiser, despite a slow campaign start because of health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, three Democratic representatives that the
Republicans had hoped to topple held onto their seats _ Mel Watt,
David Price and Bob Etheridge. But Robin Hayes, a Republican,
defeated Democrat Mike Taylor for the open seat of retiring
Democratic Rep. Bill Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats that Republicans had considered vulnerable also
prevailed, among them Reps. Corrine Brown in Florida, John F.
Tierney in Massachusetts, John Spratt of South Carolina, Maurice
Hinchey of New York and Frank Pallone of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The results promise another two years of policy stalemate, with
Republicans, who have a fragile 11-seat majority, lacking the seats
to pursue a new conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties opened the year expecting a relatively placid
mid-term election with voters soothed by the good economy and
giving Congress its highest approval ratings in years.
</P>
<P>
   Leery of shaking the mood of content, House Republicans ran
largely on their accomplishments. They put forward no new agenda
like the Contract With America, which propelled them into the
majority in 1994 on a far-reaching conservative domestic policy
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats by contrast hoped to make inroads with an agenda of
issues blocked by the Republicans, ranging from anti-tobacco
legislation to regulation of health maintenance organizations, to
money for school construction, to overhaul of the campaign finance
system. But they found that they were all but drowned out by
Washington's preoccupation with Clinton's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Clinton told the nation in August after months of
denials that he had indeed had an ``inappropriate relationship''
with Ms. Lewinsky, Democrats feared that they would suffer a rout,
with Clinton-haters inspired to vote and disillusioned Democrats
staying home.
</P>
<P>
   But the political mood seemed to shift again after the
Republican-controlled House released reams of salacious testimony
that independent counsel Kenneth Starr had gathered about Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and voted to open a formal
impeachment inquiry into Clinton. Detecting signs of a backlash
against the Republicans, many political analysts said they had
overplayed their hand, just as they had when they shut down the
government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month the House Judiciary Committee moves to center
stage once again as it opens its formal impeachment inquiry into
Clinton. But the standoff in Tuesday's elections could revive talk
of censure and leave Republicans searching for a quick way to bring
the inquiry to an end.

DEMOCRATS VICTORIOUS IN CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR RACE

<P>
   Democrats captured the California governorship for the first
time in 16 years Tuesday in one of several pivotal victories that
signaled a partial Democratic reemergence in state capitals in the
face of years of overwhelming Republican rule.
</P>
<P>
   In what was widely regarded as the single most important race of
1998, California Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis defeated
Republican state Attorney General Dan Lungren to take control of
the most populous state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, the California results only headlined several
other key victories from the East Coast to the west. Democratic
challengers defeated Republican incumbent governors in South
Carolina and Alabama, while winning an open race in Iowa to put
that state in the Democratic column for the first time in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was not all good news for Democrats. Republican
incumbents maintained their hold on most of the largest states, and
George W. Bush and Jeb Bush, two sons of the former president,
coasted to victory in Texas and Florida, the country's second and
fourth most populous states.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman also
pushed a statewide lottery to fund education reforms in his
victorious campaign against Republican incumbent Governor Fob James
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In initial network projections, Republican incumbents won with
relative ease in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Arkansas
and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's victory in Texas could launch him toward a race
for the White House. In Florida, his brother, Jeb, was the
projected winner against Democratic Lieutenant Governor Buddy
MacKay. Not since 1971, when members of the Rockefeller dynasty
held the governorships of New York and Arkansas, have two brothers
served as governor at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, incumbent Republican governors had displayed
an activist flair on such issues as education reform and health
care, in contrast to their congressional counterparts, who had done
battle with Democratic reform proposals. With this activism, the
GOP was looking to keep a lock on most of the 10 largest states,
the notable exception being California, where they appeared
destined for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 36 governorships were decided Tuesday night, with
Democratic and Republican leaders each predicting they would gain
two or three seats. In state after state, especially Ohio, many of
the television advertisements were negative to the point of being
brutal. But President Clinton's political and legal troubles over
his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky barely surfaced as an issue in
any of the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Bushes, other luminaries were seeking
governorships. In Minnesota, Hubert H. ``Skip'' Humphrey III, son
of the former Democratic vice president, was locked in a difficult
race in which a former professional wrestler nicknamed ``The Body''
was siphoning crucial votes away from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And in Ohio, Republican Robert Taft, great grandson of President
William Howard Taft, was widely believed to hold an advantage
against Lee Fisher, the former Democratic attorney general. That
campaign had evolved into a particularly spiteful battle,
characterized by dueling advertising campaigns about each other's
ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   California remained the biggest prize, with Lieutenant Governor
Gray Davis in a strong position to bring the governorship into
Democratic hands. His opponent, state Attorney General Dan Lungren,
was criticized by fellow Republicans for his decision to wrap
himself in the Reagan legacy.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast, many of the gubernatorial candidates raised
record amounts of cash, often pouring their funds into hard-edged
advertising campaigns.

GOP HOLD ON HOUSE SLIPPING; THREAT TO GINGRICH SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE WRITETHRU-BOS  
 (Subs first 7 grafs; p and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Republicans were on the brink Tuesday night of losing seats in
the House, a stunning development that would fray the GOP's already
fragile majority and lay the seeds for a possible challenge to Newt
Gingrich's speakership.
</P>
<P>
   While GOP leaders earlier this fall were predicting major gains
in the House and perhaps a filibuster-proof 60-seat majority in the
Senate, national results and projections for late races Tuesday
night showed the GOP retaining a modest majority in the Senate, but
losing part of its 11-seat majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The results could politically imperil Gingrich, who barely
survived an attempted coup last year and was assailed by
conservatives last month for endorsing a $500 billion spending
compromise that broke a balanced-budget cap by more than $20
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats appear to have defied history, marking the first time
since 1934 that the party controlling the White House picked up
House seats the sixth year of a president's term.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans appear to have squandered a chance to exploit
President Clinton's weaknesses amid an impeachment inquiry stemming
from his sexual affair with the former White House intern, Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This almost certainly means there will be a challenger to
Speaker Gingrich within the Republican caucus,'' said
Representative Richard E. Neal, a Springfield Democrat who easily
won a sixth term Tuesday night. ``I can't imagine he can escape a
serious challenge now.''
</P>
<P>
   The slim GOP majority in Congress is likely to retain enough
power to stymie some of Clinton's agenda on education, health care,
and his other prized issues. But Republicans probably will lack
enough clout to achieve many of their top initiatives, from cutting
taxes to privatizing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the apparent GOP failure to substantially strengthen
the party's grip on the House and Senate is expected to slow, if
not stall, momentum toward Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders said before the election that supporters of
Clinton's impeachment lacked the 67 votes they would need to remove
him from office. And the early projections Tuesday night indicated
that Republicans, who now control 55 Senate seats, may pick up no
more than one or two additional seats, fewer than party leaders had
hoped and too few to increase the pressure for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With the House Judiciary Committee poised to open impeachment
hearings this month, the lack of support in the Senate to remove
Clinton from office increases the chance the process will end in a
negotiated compromise between the White House and congressional
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Early signs of the GOP's apparent failure to post substantial
gains in the Senate were pivotal losses by such GOP incumbents as
Senators Alfonse D'Amato in New York and Lauch Faircloth in North
Carolina. The defeats were projected by several television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who was defeated by Representative Charles E. Schumer,
and Faircloth, who lost to trial lawyer John Edwards, ranked among
Clinton's leading nemeses in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, the race to succeed another Clinton foe, retiring
Senator Dan Coats, also was won by a Democrat, former governor Evan
Bayh.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, who was
considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents, was
projected as the winner over Representative Bob Inglis, a
Republican who serves on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also successfully defended the seat of retiring
Senator Dale Bumpers in Arkansas, who will be succeeded by former
Representative Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a Democrat, according to
network projections.
</P>
<P>
   However, voters apparently were leaning toward sticking with a
Congress ruled predominantly by House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
other Southern conservatives, such as Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Whether rank-and-file Republican lawmakers will stick with
Gingrich and Lott is another question, though, as the GOP leaders
could come under fire for failing to substantially expand their
majorities while Clinton was weakened by his sex scandal involving
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich narrowly survived an attempted coup in 1997, and
conservatives assailed him last month for pushing a $500 billion
spending compromise that exceeded a balanced-budget cap by more
than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans did pick up a former Democratic seat in Ohio, where
the GOP governor, George V. Voinovich, will succeed Senator John H.
Glenn Jr., the space hero and four-term Democratic stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also were running neck-and-neck with Democrats for
open seats in several other states, most notably Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Hotly contested House races across the country were too close to
call early Tuesday night. Among the incumbents facing tough
reelection races were two members of the Judiciary Committee:
Representatives Steve Chabot, an Ohio Republican, and Mel Watt, a
North Carolina Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the House was expected to become slightly more
conservative, despite apparently minuscule Republican gains. Among
the reasons is the retirement of several longtime liberal
Democrats, who are expected to be replaced by more centrist,
pro-business Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The new class of Democrats is expected to include Charlie
Gonzalez, a retired state judge who is the son of retiring
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, a leading liberal during his 38
years in the House.

<P>
   Republicans retained solid control of the Senate on Tuesday
night, but struggled to pick up gains that would help advance their
legislative agenda or a possible impeachment trial of President
Clinton next year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans were fighting to a draw in races
around the country, defying expectations that low voter turnout
might doom Democratic prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, the Republican incumbent,
fell to a multimillionaire trial lawyer, John Edwards, and Barbara
Boxer of California, the Democratic incumbent, held off a strong
challenge from California's State Treasurer Matt Fong. In New York,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato was trailing Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Democratic incumbent Carol Moseley Braun was
trailing State Sen. Peter Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a status quo election,'' Sen. Trent Lott said on
CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' ``The old saying that all politics is
local is really true in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   But Faircloth was near tears in a concession speech to
supporters. ``I feel like I've let you down because we should have
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were jubilant as results streamed in from across the
nation, even as they conceded the possibility that Republicans
could pad their majority if cliffhanger races in the West and
Midwest went to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could still end up losing one or two seats, but the
practical result of the election, even if there are modest losses,
is the effort to remove President Clinton for all practical
purposes has ended,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey,
vice chairman of the Senate Democratic re-election committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic incumbents Russell Feingold and Harry Reid were still
fighting for their political lives in Wisconsin and Nevada. And the
race in Kentucky between two congressmen, Democrat Scotty Baesler
and Republican Jim Bunning, was still neck and neck. But one of the
lions of the old Democratic South, Sen. Ernest Hollings, held off a
spirited challenge from Rep. Bob Inglis.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate seats on the ballot, 18 are held by Democrats
and 16 by Republicans. But Democrats had far more vulnerable
senators.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, most incumbents, like Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., retained their seats, a sign of voter satisfaction with
the hardy economy and a paucity of well-financed, competitive
challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Democrats and two Republicans are retiring. Typically,
open seats are easier for an opposing party to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans swapped two of those open seats. In
Ohio, George Voinovich, the Republican governor, handily turned
back Mary Boyle, a former Cuyahoga County commissioner, to take the
seat of the retiring Sen. John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, Evan Bayh, the popular former Democratic Governor,
easily outpaced Paul Helmke, the mayor of Fort Wayne, to replace
Daniel Coats, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats retained the seat of retiring Sen. Dale Bumpers, as
former Rep. Blanche Lambert Lincoln defeated Republican State Sen.
Fay Boozman. In the fourth open seat, Republican Rep. Mike Crapo
easily won election to succeed Sen. Dirk Kempthorne, who stepped
down to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In a year where no overpowering national issue emerged, many
Democratic candidates spoke about preserving Social Security and
boosting education while many Republicans discussed tax cuts and
shifting power from Washington to local governments.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days of the campaign, Republicans launched a $10
million television advertising campaign that aimed to energize
their voter base by exploiting Clinton's sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats gleefully seized on the advertisements as a desperate
last-minute gamble that would backfire with voters, who in public
opinion polls have voiced disgust with the Republican-led
impeachment inquiry into Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have controlled both the House and Senate since the
landslide midterm elections of 1994. Republicans held sway in the
Senate from 1980 to 1986, briefly interrupting what had been
largely unbroken Democratic dominance of the upper chamber since
the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' 55 seats in the current Senate are the most the
party has held since the 56 of 1930 and 1931.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of historical precedent alone, Senate Democrats
were resigned this year to losing at least a few seats. Since World
War II, the president's party has gained seats in a midterm
election only three times.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign season, Republicans had held out hope of
reaching 60 votes, the magic number they needed to cut off
Democratic-led debates and force a vote on an issue. Sen. Thomas
Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, has repeatedly used
filibusters to stifle Republican initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   It would also bring the Republicans closer to the two-thirds
majority, or 67 votes, needed to override a presidential veto or to
approve a treaty. If the impeachment proceedings under way in the
House reached the Senate, 67 votes would be needed to convict
Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   But achieving even 60 votes has proved elusive for both parties
in the last two decades. Since 1975, only the Democrats have held
more than 60 seats, and that was for just one session, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader, had publicly all but ruled out reaching 60 votes, scaling
back projections to one to three seats. However, even modest gains
like those would help Republicans break legislative logjams over
issues that have lacked a solid conservative edge. For two years in
a row, Republicans have fallen three votes short of overriding
Clinton's veto of legislation that would have banned a
controversial procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion.
Any Republican gains in the Senate would fuel momentum for
conservatives to provide dependable anti-abortion votes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Senate Republicans twice this year fell one vote
short of cutting off a Democratic filibuster on a proposal to
require the government to push ahead with a national defense
against long-range missiles as soon as technologically feasible. If
armed with a wider majority next year, Republicans are certain to
offer the measure again, even though the military's Joint Chiefs of
Staff oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, though, even those modest gains, and what
extra advantage they bring with them, appeared in doubt.
