DISNEY WOWS WALL STREET

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The Mouse is beginning to roar.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. exceeded Wall Street's expectations for
third-quarter earnings Thursday on record operating results in its
broadcast division and theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide entertainment conglomerate reported diluted
earnings per share of 30 cents for the quarter ending June 30, 6
cents a share above the consensus of industry analysts polled by
First Call/Thomson Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That represented a 50 percent increase over the 20-cent earnings
per share reported in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street welcomed the report, sending Disney's stock up
nearly 6 percent _ up $2.38 to close in after-hours trading at
$42.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased to see the momentum continue to build at our
company,'' said Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief
executive officer. ``At the beginning of 2000 we indicated it would
be a year of transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner predicted last fall that profits wouldn't rebound at all
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter earnings flow from a 9 percent jump in
revenue, to $6 billion, and a 48 percent increase in net income to
$633 million, excluding loses at its struggling Internet site
GO.com. If the Web operations, since renamed the Walt Disney
Internet Group, are included, earnings per share dropped to 21
cents for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround was fueled by strong advertising at its ABC
television network and owned stations, coupled with higher overall
ratings led by the hit ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Media Networks posted record operating results for the
quarter, with revenue up 20 percent to $2.3 billion and operating
income up 36 percent to $662 million.
</P>
<P>
   Its Parks &AMP; Resorts division also reported record results for
the quarter, with revenue up 13 percent to $1.9 billion and
operating income up 14 percent to $565 million.
</P>
<P>
   The parks benefited from increased guest spending and record
theme park attendance at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. It also
reflected higher attendance at Disneyland driven by the 45th
anniversary celebration and the strength of the Annual Pass
program. Adding a second cruise ship to the fleet, the Disney
Wonder, also improved results in the cruise division.
</P>
<P>
   The company's struggling film studios and consumer products
division continued to post loses.
</P>
<P>
   Studio revenue was down for the quarter by 2 percent to $1.2
billion, largely because of decreases in domestic motion picture
distribution, which were offset by increases in network television
distribution, worldwide home video and stage plays.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer products revenue was down 11 percent to $511 million
for the quarter, driven by declines in worldwide merchandise
licensing and increased advertising and infrastructure costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've undertaken in recent months a number of efforts to try
to improve the picture,'' said Disney spokesman Ken Green.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes include cutting expenses, cutting back on motion
picture production and shifting strategies in home video and
consumer products _ moves the company hopes will help sustain the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate a continued strong performance in these areas in
the future,'' he said.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Former President Gerald R. Ford's doctors said
Thursday that they were ``very pleased'' with his medical progress
since he was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital on Wednesday
because of a stroke, and they expressed confidence that he would
make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's doing much better,'' Dr. Robert J.
Schwartzman, the hospital's chief neurologist, reported at a midday
briefing. ``He's walking, his balance is better, his left hand has
returned to normal. He's still having some problems with his tongue
and a little bit of slurred speech, but he's in good spirits and
doing much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was making such good progress that hospital officials
permitted Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to visit him for 20 minutes
shortly before noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked great, sounded good,'' Bush said as he left the
hospital to prepare for his speech on Thursday night accepting the
presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention. ``He
told me to practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, was in Philadelphia to attend the convention when he
became ill. He first went to Hahnemann Hospital around midnight on
Tuesday, shortly after receiving a warm reception from delegates in
the convention hall. After walking in on his own at the hospital,
he told doctors he was suffering acute facial pain. He was told he
probably had a bad sinus infection and was given some antibiotics
and released.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sleepless night, Ford returned to the hospital at
about 9 a.m. Wednesday, again walking in on his own. The symptoms
were worse, he told doctors, and besides pain included dizziness,
numbness and an inability to speak without slurring words.
</P>
<P>
   Tests indicated that he had suffered at least one mild stroke
since the weekend in the rear portion of the brain that controls
basic functions like balance, speech and swallowing. He was
admitted to the neurological intensive care unit and given a blood
thinner that breaks up the kinds of blockages that often form to
cause strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials insisted Thursday, as on Wednesday, that they
had made no serious medical error late Tuesday when they told Ford
that his facial pain had probably been caused by a sinus infection.
They said they saw nothing that indicated any cause other than
that, and they reported that Ford had said that all he needed was
pain medicine, not hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was treated appropriately and discharged as per his
wishes,'' said Dr. Wayne Satz, the head of Hahnemann's emergency
room.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's spokesman, Calvin McDowell, added what appeared to be
another important detail regarding Ford's initial visit. He said
that just before discharging Ford, hospital officials advised him
to undergo a head scan, but that he declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activities that evening were totally controlled by the
president,'' McDowell said, adding that the Ford family had no
complaints about the hospital's care of the former president and
considered it ``nothing but fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ford continues to make good progress, hospital officials said
late Thursday, he might be released in about five days.

EDITORIAL: THE MAN FROM MIDLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for rewriting throughout)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Aug. 4:
</P>
<P>
   It will be 96 days before Republicans know if Gov. George W.
Bush was right to bypass standard GOP ideological fare and center
this convention on the twin themes of inclusion and personal
testimony. But in his well-crafted, highly autobiographical
acceptance speech Thursday night, Bush sought to incite a public
appetite for change based on a claim of bringing a new style of
leadership to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With flashes of wit and biting ridicule, Bush derided Vice
President Al Gore as the risk-averse partner in an administration
that ``has coasted through prosperity.'' Ending his embargo on
direct attacks, he said: ``They had their chance. They have not
led. We will.'' The underlying invitation was for voters to take a
leap of faith on the promise that Bush will develop into a more
effective, resolute and likable leader and role model than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This presentation of an admittedly late-blooming candidate as a
work in progress carries certain risks. Not since Jimmy Carter in
1976 has there been a presidential candidate to whom the act of
introducing himself to the American people _ of making himself
known, trusted and familiar as well as simply famous _ was more
important. The speech marked the toughest test the new nominee will
face before the debates this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of Bush's situation right now is that, despite the
renowned father saluted in the speech, he is actually not very well
known even to many supporters. He characterized his six-year stint
as governor of Texas as one in which he learned to make tough
decisions and work with Democrats. But serving in Austin and having
many of his father's advisers around him now will probably have
less meaning to the voters than Bush's attempt to define himself as
a man from a different political culture than the one he said was
epitomized by Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In raising two previously unmentionable issues, he affirmed
opposition to abortion and support for enforcement of existing gun
laws. But in vowing fervently to ``tear down that wall'' that traps
the poor and minorities in prisons and failed schools, he fleshed
out more of what he has meant by ``compassionate conservatism,''
implying actual delivery on the ``kinder and gentler'' Republican
policies promised some years ago by his father.
</P>
<P>
   Running a campaign for change is complicated by the fact that
Americans are satisfied with the economy, and the polls show them
broadly supporting the Democrats' approach on budget issues, as
well as education, health care and Social Security. The oratorical
doorway for Bush has been to speak from, and about, his heart as a
way of suggesting a more expansive governance without really
altering the ideological straitjacket that his party requires its
nominees to wear.
</P>
<P>
   The glue that is supposed to hold all this together is his
promise of personality suited to the office, yet free of historical
baggage. In service of that theme, Bush invoked the values of
Midland and boasted that he would come to Washington without
inherited enemies and with ``no stake in the bitter arguments of
the last few years.'' He asserted that his would be an
administration guided by convictions and character rather than
polls and focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   A world of difference lies between Bush and Ronald Reagan, the
last GOP nominee to stir the kind of hope among Republicans that
could be heard Thursday night. But like Reagan, Bush promised that
if given a chance he would rise above expectations, and like
Reagan, he is attempting to create a market for change in the
summer convention and then cash in this fall. Also like Reagan, he
promised a regime of homespun values in place of the policy
sophistication or taste for legislative maneuvering of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, this down-home emphasis is sharply at odds with the
privileged educational and financial background of Bush and many of
the delegates here _ a condition that has led some to say this
ought to be known as the illusion convention instead of the
inclusion convention. But Democrats should make no mistake about
the themes laid down here or the stump performance of George W.
Bush and even that of his running mate, Dick Cheney. They represent
a considerable danger for Gore and his party this fall. &QL;

COMMENTARY: UNDER THE BIG TENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for rewriting)  
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ What can you say about a Republican Convention
that spends as much time talking about AIDS as abortion, and frets
more about urban blight than gun control? That it's a changed
party? A conflicted party? A sneakier party?
</P>
<P>
   ``The platform is solid,'' shrugged Gary Bauer, the former
pro-life presidential candidate. You will remember him as the guy
who fell off the stage during a pancake-flipping contest before the
New Hampshire primary. He added, ``Anybody who's pro-life on
Election Day will vote for us, and anybody who's pro-choice will
vote for the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong message. Under George W. Bush the Republican Party is one
big, huge, enormous, humongous tent. Bush is asking for the vote of
every single American who supports restoring dignity to the
presidency and not leaving a single child behind. Those yearning
for an undignified chief executive and a pile of children stranded
without transportation are just going to have to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to grips with the Bush candidacy is tricky, since a lot
goes unsaid in this campaign. Until Dick Cheney gave his red-meat
speech on Wednesday night, the Republican Convention had gone for
three days without ever mentioning Bill Clinton's name. We were in
Harry Potter land, and the president was Lord Voldemort, the
villain so villainous he can be referred to only as
``You-Know-Who.'' (Cheney was a hit with the delegates, who had
been languishing on topics like ``Prosperity With a Purpose:
Keeping America Prosperous.'' However, many people who saw him on
TV felt the new vice-presidential candidate had all the warmth and
charm of an armadillo.)
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Convention was full of delegates who had become
party activists so they could promote their social agenda, yet Bush
managed to drag them through this entire convention without one
televised peep about the right to bear arms, or even about prayer
in school. Every black Republican who's ever been elected to a
county road commission was given a speaking role, but Alan Keyes,
the black presidential candidate who's the darling of the
anti-abortion movement, was nowhere in sight. Until Bush devoted a
sentence to the unborn Thursday night, the only person I heard
bring up abortion was a Senate candidate from Nebraska who was
distinctly off prime time. Bush's own message _ that we can all
work together, and that partial birth abortion is bad _ sounded
stunningly moderate compared with the diatribes from conventions of
yore.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this isn't much different from what Bill Clinton did
in 1992, when he pulled his party to the center while placating its
left by muffling Robert Casey, the pro-life governor of
Pennsylvania. But at least the Democrats didn't keep their
positions secret. You'd have had to be living in a cave not to know
what Clinton intended to do about abortions and gun control. Bush
is less forthcoming. Watching the convention, all you might be able
to deduce is that whatever he plans, it's going to be accomplished
to the music of Motown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's easy enough to read his intentions. His surrogates
forcefully stripped the platform of all signs of immigrant-bashing,
and made an unsuccessful attempt to moderate the plank opposing
gays in the military. The convention's rainbow coalition of
speakers did at least send a message that Bush is going to have
blacks in his Cabinet and regards immigrants as a group worthy of a
well-placed pander. One of the very, very few middle-aged white men
who got on stage was the Republican Party's only openly gay
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no effort to mitigate the party's sweeping
declaration of war against all forms of abortion, and no hint Bush
ever intended to do battle with his core constituency on that
issue. ``He does not want to fight,'' said Tommy Thompson, the
long-suffering chairman of the platform committee, who kept
demanding credit for having allowed pro-choice Republicans to speak
at the hearings. ``The Republican Party is a pro-life party, but
it's never been so open,'' he said repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to abortion, George W. Bush's move to the center
consists solely of his willingness to accept the votes of people
who disagree with him. The tent is huge, but the ringmaster is only
listening to the folks who entered from the right.

BUSH ACCEPTS GOP NOMINATION; VOWS NEW LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The torch was passed to a new generation of
Bushes on Thursday night as Texas Gov. George W. Bush, son of a man
who was in the White House eight years ago, accepted the Republican
presidential nomination and promised to ``use these good times for
great goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the Clinton-Gore administration has ``coasted through
prosperity'' and ``squandered'' opportunity abroad with ``a steady
erosion of American power and an unsteady exercise of American
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a
generation,'' he declared. ``So many talents. So much charm. Such
great skill. But, in the end, to what end? So much promise, to no
great purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their chance. They have not led. We will,'' Bush
said, a phrase that evoked roars each of the three times he
repeated it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush presented an agenda dominated by four promises: Rebuilding
America's military strength; reforming Social Security by allowing
some payroll taxes to go for ``sound responsible investments'';
reducing income taxes ``for everyone, in every bracket,'' as well
as abolishing the inheritance tax; and holding educators
accountable by applying standards for schools that receive federal
dollars. If public schools don't perform, parents would be given
vouchers with which they could send children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant me a mandate, and I will use it!'' Bush declared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush drove home what has been an orchestrated theme of this
week's Republican National Convention, that a conservative party
often identified with wealth has become, in the GOP nominee's
words, ``the party of idealism and inclusion.'' Pennsylvania Gov.
Tom Ridge, in introducing Bush, went so far as to talk of a ``new
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly with its stress on education, the Bush agenda is
also designed to entice swing voters _ suburbanites,
upper-middle-class women and Hispanics in particular _ back into
the Republican fold after voting for Clinton in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is OUR issue,'' Texas state Sen. Florence Shapiro
declared Thursday at a luncheon honoring the nominee's wife. Laura
Bush pledged that early childhood education, preschool development
and family reading will be her top priority if she becomes first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the GOP nominee's program puts emphasis in
the wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can test kids all we want, but unless class sizes are
workable and the learning environment is safe, there will be no
gains to measure,'' Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Thursday
night. Murray is chief Senate sponsor of the Clinton
administration's plan to put 100,000 new teachers in America's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the upbeat Bush counterpunched against criticism already
coming from his foe. He heaped scorn on Vice President Al Gore's
``risky scheme'' rhetoric _ used to describe Bush's Social Security
plan _ without mentioning his opponent's name. He lampooned a Gore
blooper in which the vice president claimed to have invented the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my opponent had been there at the moon launch, it would
have been a `risky rocket scheme','' Bush said to rising audience
laughter. ``If he'd been there when Edison was testing the light
bulb, it would have been a `risky anti-candle scheme.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he'd been there when the Internet was invented, well .
. .'', Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   The hall rocked. At the relentlessly positive GOP convention,
only Bush and vice presidential nominee Dick Cheney were allowed to
unleash delegates' pent-up dislike of the Democrats in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``now leads the party of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but the
only thing he has to offer is fear itself,'' Bush added. ``That
outlook is typical of many in Washington _ always seeing the tunnel
at the end of the light.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Texas oilman, who experienced ups and downs in
business before his success in politics, traced his optimism back
to the dusty town in which he was raised and returned after an
education at his father's alma maters, Andover and Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Midland, Texas, where I grew up, the town motto was `the
sky is the limit' . . . and we believed it. There was a restless
energy, a basic conviction that, with hard work, anybody could
succeed, and everybody deserved a chance. ... Neighbors helped each
other. There were dry wells and sandstorms to keep you humble, and
lifelong friends to take your side, and churches to remind us that
every soul is equal in value and equal in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush concluded a four-day, feel-good convention at which the
conservatism of GOP faithful was muted by confidence that American
voters will restore Republican control of a White House that is
rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes showed that they have supplanted the Kennedys as
America's closest equivalent to a royal ruling family.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush and his wife Barbara sat in the galleries
surrounded by three generations. The elder Bush saluted his son.
Candidate Bush described his father as ``the last president of a
great generation'' and added: ``Dad, I am proud to be your son.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced the votes of the Sunshine State
GOP delegation for his brother's candidacy. And Jeb's son,
24-year-old George P. Bush, whose mother is Mexican American, spoke
to the convention in both Spanish and English.
</P>
<P>
   While talking about poor children and ``poverty schools'' to
show his compassion, Bush also used his acceptance speech to
underscore his strong conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered a carefully worded affirmation of Republicans'
opposition to abortion, emphasizing elements of the pro-life agenda
that win majority support in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will lead our nation toward a culture that values life _ the
life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young and the
life of the unborn,'' Bush proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know good people disagree on this issue, but surely we can
agree on ways to value life by promoting adoption and parental
notification, and when Congress sends me a bill againt
partial-birth abortion, I will sign it into law.''
</P>
<P>
   The promise was greeted by a 25-second ovation, the longest of
Bush's speech.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates also roared approval at Bush's promise to fulfill
a dream of Ronald Reagan's _ space defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the earliest possible date, my administration will deploy
missile defenses to guard against attack and blackmail,'' Bush
pledged.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that he is willing to scrap the 1972 U.S.-Soviet
anti-ballistic missile treaty. ``Now is the time not to defend
outdated treaties, but to defend the American people,'' Bush said.
Ex-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, an architect of the treaty,
applauded in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made some promises to low-income Americans. He promised to
lower the bottom income tax bracket from 15 percent to 10 percent,
and pledged to give low-income Americans tax credits to buy private
health insurance ``they need and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues got but a brief mention.
</P>
<P>
   The environment merited two sentences. Bush, who has taken fire
for air pollution in his home state of Texas, said corporations are
responsible ``to leave the air and waters clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a longtime champion of firearms owners' rights, pledged he
would ``protect our children'' by ``strictly enforcing our gun
laws.'' He pledged no new initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed to be saying that many of the nation's problems can
be solved by uplifting its spirit. ``An era of tarnished ideals is
giving way to a responsibility era,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans live on the sunrise side of the mountain. The night
is passing. And we are ready for the day to come.''

SHORELINE POLLUTION ON THE RISE IN L.A. COUNTY BEACHES &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIK NELSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite Los Angeles' $28 million effort to stop
beach pollution, a national environmental group has found that
county beach closures tripled last year, with the worst problems in
Santa Monica and Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural Resources Defense Council on Thursday singled out
the Regional Water Quality Control Board for violating the Clean
Water Act and has filed an administrative petition with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency to force the local agency to clean
up its act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clean Water Act's been on the books for 30 years, and we
still have hundreds of beach closures and advisories,'' said David
Beckman, a senior attorney with the environmental group, who
attributed the beach closures to stormwater runoff high in
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism accompanied the NRDC's release of ``Testing the
Waters: A Guide to Water Quality at Vacation Beaches.'' The
166-page report found that California had the largest number of
beach closures and health advisories in the nation, with 3,547 in
1999, up from 3,273 the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   During the same two years, Los Angeles County health officials
issued 460 advisories and closures, up from only 147 in 1998. Long
Beach had the most such incidents with 71, followed by Santa Monica
State Beach with 27 closures and advisories in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman said the additional closures and advisories have more to
do with increased monitoring under California's right-to-know law
than it does higher bacterial counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the more you look at it, the more you find
it,'' Beckman said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County didn't have the most closures in 1999. That
distinction went, for the second year in a row, to Santa Barbara
County, which had 1,392 closures and advisories.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Ventura County had 257 closures, up from 237 in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Beckman acknowledged that the city, county and water board are
spending millions of dollars to divert Los Angeles stormwater
runoff into sewers for treatment during dry months, but said such
measures were but a ``Band-Aid'' that doesn't address the causes of
urban runoff.
</P>
<P>
   That was evident in the health advisories and closure orders
issued by Los Angeles County health officials for beaches in Santa
Monica and Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't divert it during the winter because the sewage
treatment plants would be overwhelmed; they're already at
capacity,'' said Steve Fleischli, executive director of Santa
Monica Baykeeper, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the NRDC filed an administrative petition with the
U.S. EPA to compel the water board to enforce runoff rules. Beckman
said action on the petition, which is being considered by federal
officials, could take years.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Dickerson, the water board's executive officer, said
the agency has been short-staffed, but is now anticipating enough
state funding for 15 new inspectors to step up enforcement. The new
positions will come from a $5 million state fund started last month
to combat runoff pollution. Dickerson said he didn't know exactly
how much the Los Angeles water board will receive.
</P>
<P>
   The new inspectors will visit about 3,000 industrial sites in
the area, many of which do not have proper industrial stormwater
permits, and issue violations against them. The board is also
creating development regulations aimed at treating the initial
runoff from new construction, which Dickerson said carries more
pollutants than later runoff.
</P>
<P>
   And city Bureau of Sanitation Director Judith Wilson said her
agency collects $28 million a year from a special fee tacked onto
city property tax bills that is earmarked for stormwater programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those include sending inspectors to literally sniff out illicit
sewer lines that feed into stormwater pipes. In one case,
discovered about a year ago, builders of a shopping mall in South
Central Los Angeles missed a sewer hookup by 8 inches and tapped a
stormwater line instead. The illegal flow lasted for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures include using catch-basin inserts to screen or
filter pollutants, telling downtown business owners along Skid Row
not to hose vagrants' waste into storm drains and running ad
campaigns advising residents to pick up after their pets, lest more
bacteria wash into the Los Angeles River.

SALMON JOINS THE FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Darin Erstad and Troy Glaus went to the All-Star
game, Garret Anderson set his career-high for homers in a season,
Mo Vaughn was Mo Vaughn, hitting around .300 and hitting his share
of homers.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon was frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the Anaheim Angels cleanup hitter has joined the party.
Even if it's at a time when many of the others are coming back to
earth, Salmon is hitting the ball like he knew _ hoped _ he could.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon will take an 11-game hitting streak into tonight's game
against the Indians. During those 11 games, he's hitting .500 (22
for 44). In the just-concluded series against the Tigers, Salmon
went 10 for 12, including hits in his past six consecutive at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   His average is up to .290, higher than Vaughn's (.287) and
Glaus' (.273). Salmon's power numbers are rising too _ he has 23
homers and 66 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm seeing the ball well,'' Salmon explained. ''I'm not
over-swinging and I'm putting the ball in play. The last two weeks
I've been swinging the bat better, and hitting the ball where it's
pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon soon will become the Angels' all-time home run leader. He
has 219, three short of Brian Downing's mark of 222.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is expected to be back in the lineup tonight after
leaving Wednesday's game early with a sore biceps muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has slumped lately (3 for 31), and as a result is taking
extra batting practice. The extra swings in the cage may be the
cause for the muscle soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Kent Mercker will start a rehab assignment for Single-A
Lake Elsinore tonight at Rancho Cucamonga. Mercker, who has
recovered from a brain hemorrhage suffered May 11, will need two
more rehab starts before he'll be ready to rejoin the big league
club.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Close your eyes, and Gov. George W. Bush on
Thursday night could have been Bill Clinton without the punch _ or
Al Gore without the precision.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in his acceptance speech Thursday night, the Texas
governor and Republican presidential nominee sought to reorient his
party to the center with passages that were strikingly similar to
Clinton's speech at the 1992 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   The speech Thursday night capped a four-day political production
in which Bush deftly elbowed aside ardent conservatives in an
effort to convince America that his party was much like himself _
approachable and open _ and that he is a candidate who can be
trusted to safely lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ambitious attempt at reintroducing the Republican
Party, akin to Richard M. Nixon's drive in 1968 to transform the
once solid Democratic South into a Republican stronghold or Ronald
Reagan's ``Morning in America'' campaign for middle Americans in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   By stressing ``idealism and inclusion'' and the ``forgotten,''
Bush sought to give a gracious new twist to the Grand Old Party,
moving beyond the battles over impeachment, abortion and culture
that had given his party such a harsh face. Rather than invoke Newt
Gingrich, Bush spoke of ``a bipartisan approach to governing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enemies to fight,'' he declared. ``And I have no
stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to
change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats conceded that Bush had mounted an impressive
start in setting out a general election campaign that excises the
demons that have haunted Republicans by offering a nominee who
often sounds very much like his foes.
</P>
<P>
   And already, many Democrats expressed fear that the display in
Philadelphia will force Vice President Al Gore _ whose campaign is
entering a crucial phase with the selection of a running mate and
then his own convention in Los Angeles _ to aggressively fire back
and depict the convention as a four-day masquerade that obscured
the party's platform and rigidly rightward voting records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of jaws are dropping of Democratic members of
Congress around the country who are hearing of a Republican
commitment to their building of schools, hiring of teachers,
commitment to the environment and diversity of government,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? ``It has been skillfully done,'' Torricelli said.
``The Republicans have succeeded in projecting an image that is not
only at total variance with their record but in contradiction of
their own platform.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be exactly what the Bush campaign wants. The
calculation _ or at least the hope _ among Republicans is that they
will box Gore in: The more he tries to portray his opponents as
insincere the more the vice president risks appearing mean-spirited
and political. That is an important reason Gore foundered when he
tried to lambast Bush after the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   And that helps explain why a relentlessly upbeat Bush managed to
topple a popular _ and increasingly defensive _ Gov. Ann Richards
in 1994. ``The axis upon which a lot of this turns is Bush's
experience against Ann Richards,'' said Richard N. Bond, a former
chairman of the Republican Party. ``She got shriller and shriller
and shriller _ and less believable. That's the experience in which
Bush has based his strategy for this campaign and this
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing that strategy, Bush gave no heed Thursday night to
the vast gulf between himself and Gore on issues ranging from
cutting taxes and banning abortion. Rather than alienate the
suburban swing voters who will decide the election, Bush did not
trouble the public with details of policy.
</P>
<P>
   In this most formal moment for a determinedly informal man, Bush
allowed as to how he possessed the qualities to reach beyond his
own party and unite the nation. He tried to make this most
political of speeches appear decidedly apolitical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time,'' Bush said, ``for Republicans and Democrats
to end the politics of fear and save Social Security, together.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond echoing Clinton, Bush went so far as to laud the
president _ even as he was skewering him. ``Our current president
embodied the potential of a generation,'' he said. ``So many
talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But in the end, to what
end?''
</P>
<P>
   As did Clinton in his acceptance speech eight years ago, Bush
sounded themes of compassion and inclusion as he sought to appeal
well beyond the Republicans in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, for example, Bush said that when he was growing
up in Midland, Texas, ``our sense of community was just as strong
as that sense of promise.'' It was from the playbook of Clinton,
who said in 1992, ``We can restore our sense of unity and
community.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday night, Bush said, ``Each of us is responsible to
love and guide our children, and help a neighbor in need.'' It was
an echo of Clinton, who implored his audience eight years ago,
``take responsibility for your children.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that his opponent sounds like a Democrat, there are other
complications for Gore as he prepares to name his running mate in
the coming days and then make his own pitch at the Democratic
convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had the luxury of neglecting conservatives this week
because Republicans of all stripes have eagerly embraced his
candidacy. But beyond competing with Bush for the swing voters,
Gore at his convention will have to tend to restive Democrats who
are not altogether content with their candidate or his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said Gore faces a more perilous
balancing act than Bush. ``He's got a more difficult line to
walk,'' Breaux said. ``Our job is to make sure the base is
comfortable and secure _ but be very aggressive in speaking to the
moderate middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has to contend with the shadow of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on the eve of the convention, Bush went out of
his way to say that there was little need to demonize Clinton.
``The opponent is not President Clinton,'' he said. ``The opponent
is Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton has been a subtext here all week long. It started
when Bush's wife, Laura, voiced the need for people ``to respect
the president of the United States of America.'' And Thursday
night, Bush, by underscoring that ``times of plenty'' are ``tests
of American character,'' the governor left no doubt that he and his
campaign regard Clinton as a tantalizing villain _ and will truly,
albeit subtly, try to make him an issue in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, Gore also has an interest in
seeing Clinton hover over this campaign. While Bush's loyalists
will try to remind voters of Monica Lewinsky, Gore's will trot out
Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, who helped the
Clinton-Gore administration preside over the most sustained
economic recovery in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   While there was a dash of Clinton in Bush's address Thursday
night _ his attempt to reach out to the middle _ the Texas governor
also capitalized on his opportunity to reach the largest audience
that will likely hear him give a speech in this campaign to ply to
charm the public.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were confident that their thoroughly
unobjectionable, even warm-hearted, message was carried enough on
the news to penetrate beyond the delegates in the hall, even though
most of the proceedings were not even carried by the major
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's objective Thursday night was not entirely different from
that of Ronald Reagan, who at his convention in Detroit in 1980
sought to convince Americans that beyond his affability, he was up
to being commander-in-chief. Thursday night, Bush remembered
``Ronald Reagan's optimism'' and _ not to neglect Democrats _
``Harry Truman's integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking of Bush operatives is that if Bush, like Reagan,
puts to rest worries about his capacity to be president, and
reassures moderates that he feels their pain, he can gain the edge
by trumping Gore in the likability category.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about George Bush being, in essence, not a bad
person and a well-meaning person,'' said William Daley, Gore's
campaign chairman. ``Therefore he will do what's right and trust
me. There's got to be more to it than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux put it this way: ``This cannot be a popularity contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans do not see it that way. To them, it is all about
presenting a likable, inclusive candidate and a likable, inclusive
party.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should update Reagan's relentlessly gauzy _ and
wildly successful _ slogan from 1984, ``It's Morning Again in
America.'' Again.

PEARL JAM TAKES STAGE FOR FIRST TIME SINCE ROSKILDE

<P>
   VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. _ Pearl Jam, the Seattle rock band that has
faced multiple hurdles during the past nine years, cleared its
biggest obstacle Thursday night before 20,000 fans at the GTE
Virginia Beach Amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   It was 33 days ago that nine fans were crushed to death while
Pearl Jam performed at the Roskilde Rock Festival in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   The band cancelled the remaining two shows on its European tour,
and it wasn't clear until mid-July whether their booked and mostly
sold-out U.S. tour would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Pearl Jam began the first leg (Aug. 3 through
Sept. 5) of the U.S. tour with a renewed passion heightened by the
tragic events of this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Vocalist Eddie Vedder led the band in an inspirational set that
opened with ``Long Road,'' a heartbreaking ode to lost loved ones.
Vedder paid tribute early to those lost in Denmark, changing a line
in ``Long Road'' from ``for you'' to ``for them.''
</P>
<P>
   No long speeches eulogized the deceased; the music and lyrics
did the mourning. Each prophetic phrase was laced with agony and
irony. It became clear early on that the audience came to support
the band, especially Vedder.
</P>
<P>
   No extra security was evident, and none was needed. No one had
been seriously injured at a Pearl Jam show before June 30, and
Thursday night, the crowd seemed intent on celebration rather than
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came with my friend all the way from Detroit,'' said Chris
Langrill, 23. ``If they didn't think they could have played the
kind of show they're capable of playing, they would have cancelled
the tour. I think they love their fans so much, even in the face of
the tragedy, they wouldn't let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tragedy occurred in Denmark, Pearl Jam was forced to
cut short the song ``Daughter.'' Thursday night, they turned it
into a sing-along. Vedder asked the crowd to help the band ``start
anew'' by singing, ``It's OK, you got to run and hide away.'' His
tactic turned the song into a rousing uplifter.
</P>
<P>
   Vedder, the often-misunderstood icon, stayed in Spain all of
July, reportedly in secluded turmoil and letting a beard grow.
Thursday night, he appeared visibly shaken through the first six
songs; the crowd genuinely seemed to help him to shed that early
anguish.
</P>
<P>
   By the closing crowd pleaser, ``Yellow Ledbetter,'' the band
seemed to be finding relief in the performance and the reaction of
the devoted fans.
</P>
<P>
   Guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, bassist Jeff Ament
and drummer Matt Cameron, along with Vedder, are touring in support
of ``Binaural,'' the album the band released May 16.

A SPEECH AND A PRODUCTION, MADE FOR SOUND BITES
</HEADLINE>
 (SUBS for rewriting; SUBS headline)  
 By CARYN JAMES  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush had an on-screen audition Thursday night for the
role of president, commandeering a chunk of network time as
presidents do, to give an extended speech. In the surprise-free
zone of this convention, the only question lingering was How
convincing a performance would he give.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a frivolous question in a television-driven
campaign, when a candidate's ability to act like a president on
camera may go further than any number of issue-oriented appearances
on ``Meet the Press.'' In those terms, Bush resembled an actor who
had studied hard, learned his lines and was determined to give the
best reading he could under circumstances that did not play to his
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has always been and is still better in situations of casual
intimacy, chatting with Larry King. Thursday night his brow was
furrowed and he seemed to squint into the camera (blinding lights
or an effort to read the Teleprompter seemed like plausible
reasons), which made him look as if he were trying exceptionally
hard to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was what most commentators said he had to do.
As Bob Schieffer said on CBS in the minutes leading up to the
speech, ``The main message is: He's ready.'' And, as Peter Jennings
put it on ABC, ``It's a cliche for a reason: The most important
speech of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed stiffest in his delivery when reciting the lines that
had all too clearly been written to become the sound bites,
especially in the refrain, repeated three times: ``This
administration had its chance. They have not led. We will.'' He
seemed far more comfortable and convincing on screen when he spoke
emotionally, notably when acknowledging his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Speeches rarely make good television, but that can be overcome
if the candidate's delivery is dynamic enough to leap off the
screen. Bush's wasn't, but at times he showed the flicker of a
connection between him and the camera that suggested he was just
beginning to master this part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The networks and cable channels led up to the speech in
different and very telling ways. NBC and its cable channel MSNBC,
along with CNN and Fox News Channel, presented the treacly video
biography of Bush made by the Republican National Committee. In
this gushy video, his Mom and Dad say he's great. He is seen as
governor surrounded by schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and CBS put things in a far more intelligent context by
presenting their own, more balanced biographical features. They
gave Bush full credit for a quick rise to success, but also raised
the tougher questions about him.
</P>
<P>
   As the CBS report put it, ``Is George W. Bush prepared to lead
the most powerful nation on earth?'' Where the video showed him
extolling the virtues of freedom, the CBS and ABC reports included
tape of the pop quiz in which he failed to name world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After all the network complaining about what an infomercial this
convention was, a little reporting was the least a network could
do. Simply labeling the video as a Republican National Committee
production and letting it run only emphasized that television
producers seem to have thrown up their hands in surrender over the
whole affair.

FLORIDA CHAMP RALLIES, TRIPS TEXAS CHAMP FOR DIXIE MAJORS TITLE

<P>
   EULESS, Texas _ Hernando County, Fla., almost gave a Dixie
Majors World Series title away last night.
</P>
<P>
   But one of its star players, Chris Cole, made sure that didn't
happen. Two innings after the state champion from Florida committed
three errors in a four-run Lufkin inning, Cole, the team's catcher
and a Florida State signee, clinched the game with his third home
run of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Cole hit a two-run shot over the right-field fence in the sixth,
giving Hernando County a 7-6 victory against Lufkin at The Parks at
Texas Star. Hernando County reliever Patrick Ryan saved the victory
for starter Jason Dunn in the top of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a high fastball inside, and \RLufkin reliever Chris
Crain\S left it where I could handle it,'' said Cole, who hit over
.600 in the six-day tournament. ``After the first two innings I
thought it wasn't going to be a 7-6 game, but at least we didn't
have to bat in that last inning.''
</P>
<P>
   After drawing the bye into last night's championship game,
Hernando County took advantage of the rest by building a 5-2 lead
after the second inning. Lufkin was in its second game of the day,
after defeating Louisiana, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth inning, Lufkin scratched its way back into the
title game. Lufkin went up 6-5 when Justin Purvis hit a single down
the first base line that scored Brett McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   Hernando County committed four errors in the game, three in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get three sawed-off grounders and we let them back in it,''
said Florida coach Tim Sims, who was on the last team from Hernando
County to win a Dixie Majors title in 1983. ``We created momentum
for them. We had two pitchers that were going to throw strikes and
make them put it into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Crain kept Florida from scoring in the bottom half of the fourth
and the fifth. But in the sixth, Dee Brown led off with a single to
left before Cole hit the game-winning home run a few pitches later.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Leslie closed out the inning without giving up a run,
but the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the tired team, and they were the rested team ... that
was the advantage that they had,'' Lufkin coach W.A. Dempsey said.
``We jumped on them, they come back and we come back and have the
lead. We make one bad pitch and it goes out of the ballpark. That's
just baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   In eliminating Louisiana, Lufkin scored three runs in the bottom
of the seventh to win. Cody Deal hit the game-winning single off
Louisiana starter Allan Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Lufkin starter Wade Fitzgerald picked up the victory, after
giving up two runs on three hits in seven innings.

RELIEF FROM BOREDOM: CREATIVE DIVERSIONS HELP LIVEN BULLPENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Baseball, to put it politely, is a sport with
the occasional less-than-thrilling moment.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to work up much enthusiasm for batters stepping
out of the box, interminable throws to first base, visits to the
mound, and pitchers who don't throw strikes.
</P>
<P>
   OK, sometimes it's downright boring.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, if not impossible, to stay interested in every
pitch of every game.
</P>
<P>
   That holds true whether one is watching from the stands, the
living room, the press box _ or the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ennui can set in even among a team's relievers while
waiting for their turn to come into the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be focused on every out,'' Rangers left-hander Mike
Venafro said. ``You're a spectator for the first four innings or so
unless you're a long reliever. You cheer, and you have
conversations that normal fans would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, cheering and conversing are ways to pass the time.
But there are stories about other more interesting, more creative
ways to while away the innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those rumors may be true,'' Venafro said with a smile on his
face. ``I definitely can't divulge anything. I really don't know
what goes down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the zany things that used to go on in bullpens are well
documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always practical jokes,'' said Rangers pitcher
Kenny Rogers, who spent the first four seasons of his career as a
reliever. ``You'd light somebody with hot foots. If they'd nod off,
you'd cut their shoelaces up, tie them together if you could.''
</P>
<P>
   In old Arlington Stadium, where the pitchers were stuck in a
sunken bullpen down the first-base line, a hungry reliever with no
place to go might bribe a fan with a baseball in exchange for a hot
dog or nachos.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thing isn't as common today. In a modern facility
such as The Ballpark in Arlington, a reliever with the mid-game
munchies can easily go to the clubhouse without going across the
field.
</P>
<P>
   And the prevalence of television, with cameras frequently
pointing toward the relievers, makes it tougher to conduct
practical jokes and participate in zany stunts.
</P>
<P>
   Tougher, but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a couple of bullpens that have cameras in them, and
I've heard of certain relievers going as far as trying to dismantle
these cameras or rewire them,'' Venafro said.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro also has heard of, ahem, certain relievers doing other
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath a lot of stadiums, there's a lot of empty space,''
he said. ``It is rumored, that in the olden days, guys used to ride
behind golf carts and skate around on their spikes, doing slalom
work or working on their off-season skiing techniques. That's
rumored to have happened long ago. Golf carts are way too fast now;
that would be too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as it would be dangerous to explore in an unfamiliar
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a challenge to discover the workings of a
ballpark,'' Venafro said. ``You go to exciting parks like Anaheim,
which is Disney; very exciting. You've got all kinds of fountains
and things down there, and you always want to try to figure out how
they work. I've heard of guys probing around a little bit to see
how high the fountain can go. We really don't condone those sort of
things here with the Texas Rangers. I think when Doug Melvin puts
this bullpen together that he's really not attracted to guys like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Such adventures _ sorry, rumors _ are infrequent. But the
Rangers relievers have other methods to pass the time on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have little things that they do that, while having a good
time and keeping things loose, it keeps them involved in the
game,'' bullpen coach Larry Hardy said. ``The whole objective is to
pass the time while at the same time watch the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what those little things are is more closely guarded than
nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you,'' closer John
Wetteland said.
</P>
<P>
   An intrepid spy did dig out a little information, however.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland, the leader of the relief corps, has devised an
elaborate set of rules. Deviation results in swift punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody gets caught not acknowledging a hit or something
that has advanced the runner, they get head slaps,'' Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   Head slaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to keep you in the game,'' Doug Davis said. ``John
definitely holds you to that. He wants to make sure everybody is
into the game. He really doesn't slack off about it at all. He
never lets anything go.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland won't divulge specifics, but said the rules serve a
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they're fun, and funny, and seem at times
ridiculous _ and they are _ there is a whole underlying thing that
goes along with the rules and the punishments and everything
else,'' he said. ``That is to one, be attentive to what's going on
in the game; two, to think of others before you think of yourself;
and three, to be gentlemen. Those are the three things that all of
these rules stem from.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be always on to the game. But what most relievers
have found throughout the years, is if you get sucked into the
game, it's tiring. This is a way to be sucked into the game to make
it a fun thing rather than a chore.''

MONSANTO PLANS TO OFFER RIGHTS ON ALTERED RICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a bid to foster support for biotechnology and
save lives, Monsanto Corp. will make available patent rights to
genetically altered rice that could help stave off malnutrition in
poor nations, the company's president said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrik Verfaillie, the president and chief executive of the St.
Louis-based company, said Monsanto will forgo licensing fees for
its ``golden rice,'' a modified strain that is rich in beta
carotene, an essential source of Vitamin A.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of golden rice is to bring Vitamin A where people
suffer,'' Verfaillie said in a telephone interview. The development
of the rice, he added, ``clearly demonstrates that biotechnology
can help not only countries in the West, but in the developing
world as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, about 200 million children suffer from Vitamin A
deficiencies, and about 1 million children succumb to diseases
partly caused by a lack of adequate defenses. Hundreds of thousands
more go blind each year, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's unusual offer, which was first reported in Friday's
editions of The Washington Post, will cost the corporation
financially, Verfaillie acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   But it appeared aimed in part at countering a tide of negative
publicity over the proliferation of genetically altered crops.
Skepticism toward such products is especially acute in Western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The company's offer was applauded by the developer of golden
rice, Ingo Potrykus, a Swiss professor. In remarks to the press,
Potrykus said he would seek to persuade other companies to follow
Monsanto's lead and provide life-saving biotechnology to poor
nations free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   The rice, named golden for its yellowish hue, is rich in beta
carotene, the same substance that give carrots their color. The
body converts beta carotene into Vitamin A, which becomes an
essential nutrient that boosts the immune system and wards off
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, a large agricultural biotechnology firm that is a unit
of Pharmacia Corp., announced in April that it had decoded the
genes of rice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company and its competitors have come under criticism from
environmentalists and some science groups for their work on
genetically modified crops, which the critics say could damage the
environment and prove dangerous for consumption. Thursday's
announcement could help blunt some of the criticism if the move
lives up to its promise of saving the lives of otherwise
malnourished children around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups that have been critical of biotechnology companies
have questioned whether the widespread distribution of golden rice
is necessarily a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent statement quoted in The Post, the Rural Advancement
Foundation said that ``critics are concerned that the advent of
golden rice's `quick fix' for Vitamin-A deficiency oculd kneecap
other low-tech and more cost-effective initiatives _ among them, to
reintroduce the many vital-rich food plants that were once chap and
available.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation added, ``Rather than nurture a strategy that
encourages biodiversity, golden rice could promote monocultures and
genetic uniformity. This is the wrong stratHegy.''

AFTER TWO MONTHS OF REFINING, BUSH FINDS JUST THE WORDS TO MATCH
HIS STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 1st and 4th grafs removing reference to planned text; SUBS
3rd graf with speech taking longer than planned; SUBS 8th graf to
replace ``the advance test'' with ``it''; SUBS 12th graf with
Bush's performance; SUBS last graf   to update) 
By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If it had been up to his speechwriter, Gov.
George W. Bush would have opened his remarks Thursday night by
thanking the delegates here for ``the honor of this hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But that felt too lofty to the Texas governor, too fancy and
formal. And so, as he scribbled in margins, sounded out sentences
and ushered the most important address of his political career
through 17 drafts, Bush deleted the last three words of that
phrase, ending the sentence with ``honor.'' It was closer to the
way he normally spoke, and closer to the way he felt.
</P>
<P>
   He used the last few weeks before his big moment to nip, tuck
and condense the speech from about 4,300 words to about 3,900, even
though the former length was well within the range of convention
tradition. Bush believed that shorter was better, and truer to who
he was. He also exhibited a bit of prescience, because his
methodical delivery and the frequent applause extended his
appearance on stage beyond what he and his aides had originally
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the generally worded proposals and beneath the
emphatically stated priorities, Bush's speech Thursday night was in
many ways a glimpse into the way he thinks and feels. According to
the campaign's chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson, and other aides
who worked with Bush on the remarks, he tended to elect simple
statements over ornate locutions, the epigrammatic over the
elongated, words he felt comfortable saying over words that
challenged him, clarity over ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted images, he wanted things shorter, he wanted things
more concrete,'' said Gerson, who has been writing Bush's biggest
speeches for nearly a year and a half. The campaign did not, as is
sometimes the case, recruit outside help for this address. Like
most endeavors in Bush's political world, this process was kept
close to home, among the tried and trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not practice it in front of focus groups or strangers,
advisers said, although he did practice it often over the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He read it aloud in front of senior campaign officials, taking
pointers from Karen Hughes, his communications director, and Mark
McKinnon and Stuart Stevens, who make the commercials for the
campaign. He toted a teleprompter into the living room of a private
house in Cincinnati and then into the dining room of the
Pennsylvania governor's mansion in Harrisburg, subjecting friends
in both places to his trial runs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's speech may well be a hallmark of Bush's maturation as
a candidate, in that it reflects a degree of diligence and level of
preparation not always evident on the campaign trail over the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at the first draft two months ago, and ordered changes
and more changes until the end. He pestered aides well outside of
office hours with his latest thoughts. As Gerson spoke with a New
York Times reporter over breakfast early last week, his cell phone
rang, and it was the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen is just spelling errors and punctuation,'' Gerson
told Bush, explaining what had been corrected and amended since the
12th draft. ``We'll make sure that we get 14 ready for the
teleprompter.''
</P>
<P>
   After hanging up, Gerson said that Bush, who had called from his
Texas ranch, wanted the reporter to know that ``he's been thinking
so hard, the deer have started talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those animals were apparently urging concision, simplicity,
``making our eloquence more direct,'' as Gerson said. What Bush and
his campaign strategists wanted was something that balanced the
formality of the occasion with the informality of his personal
style, and the difficulty of that task was made apparent in Bush's
delivery Thursday night, which was not as natural as he undoubtedly
wanted it to be, and which tested the limits of his abilities as an
orator.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush was very much a part of the production.
</P>
<P>
   He pruned an array of phrases near the top. At the end of a
sentence that began ``together, we will,'' Gerson attached a
lengthy litany of goals. Bush distilled them into a single phrase,
``renew America's purpose'' that echoed existing slogans from his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gerson initially offered several paragraphs of examples of the
sacrifices of the World War II generation, which Bush had wanted to
honor. Bush was not content until the tribute had been boiled down
to a few sentences and a central sentiment: That these brave men
had ``stormed beaches, liberated concentration camps and delivered
us from evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerson, trying to make the case that good times are as crucial
as bad, wrote that ``a time of crisis is a test of strength, a time
of prosperity is a test of vision.'' But that was neither active
nor specific enough for Bush, who kept pressing and pressing until
Gerson came up with this: ``Prosperity can be a tool in our hand,
used to build and better our country, or it can be a drug in our
system, dulling our sense of urgency, of empathy, of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the theme that the baby boom generation had squandered
some of its opportunities and surrendered to irresponsible impulses
was present from the first draft, Bush wanted that notion turned
into a motif, with recurring allusions to a privileged generation's
unrealized obligation to give something back.
</P>
<P>
   Inasmuch as Bush can be said to have intellectual obsessions,
this had always been one, but there was another reason to hammer
home this argument. It represented an implicit indictment of
President Clinton, and an implicit pitch to start anew in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday night's speech was much more than a culling
and cobbling together of Bush's stump speeches to date, the
candidate did revert to familiar phrases.
</P>
<P>
   An early draft by Gerson included the sentiment that
``congregations are responsible not only to worship, but to
serve.'' Bush was not accustomed to using that first word, and one
of the first times he read a version of the speech aloud he
spontaneously changed it to ``churches, synagogues and mosques,''
words he had used in dozens of previous remarks. Aides duly
inserted the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be able to say the words in a comfortable way,''
said Hughes, who provided extensive help with the editing. Hughes,
who has worked with Bush since 1994, knew his voice as well as he
did, and often came to Gerson to single out the same passage the
governor had as something that did not sound like him.
</P>
<P>
   But as involved as the governor was, he did not let the gravity
of the task eclipse the levity to which he is perpetually inclined.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked onto the convention stage on Wednesday to check
out where he would be standing for his big moment, he made a widely
grinning, grandly gesticulating show of pointing to ushers, waving
to supporters and calling out familiar names, even as his
straight-faced entourage busily went about checking the lighting
and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday afternoon, when reporters asked about Bush's
latest thoughts on the speech, he said he had given a more
important speech ``when I asked my wife to marry me.'' Bush took a
nap in the afternoon, because the scheduled time for the beginning
of his remarks shortly after 10 p.m. was past his usual bedtime.

AMGEN RIVAL SUBMITS DRUG FOR APPROVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ A rival of biotechnology superpower
Amgen announced Thursday it is seeking regulatory approval of a
drug similar to Amgen's flagship product.
</P>
<P>
   TKT/Aventis hopes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products will
approve its anemia drug Dynepo within a year. The company's ability
to market the drug in the United States, however, is also dependent
on the outcome of a civil trial brought against the company by
Amgen, which claims TKT/Aventis is infringing on its patent for the
drug Epogen.
</P>
<P>
   TKT spokeswoman Justine Koenigsberg said the timing of the
submission of Dynepo has nothing to do with the course of the
lawsuit. The drug, known generically as erythropoietin, has simply
passed through all necessary testing stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our development is proceeding in parallel with the
litigation,'' she said. ``We've approached the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen spokesman David Kaye did not return messages Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are split on what approval of Dynepo would mean to
Amgen, where sales of Epogen bring in more than $1 billion
annually. If TKT and its parent Aventis win the court case, it
could begin selling Dynepo immediately after FDA approval is
granted.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Harp, a Deutsche Bank Alex.Brown analyst who covers
Amgen, said the Thousand Oaks company could already have a
second-generation anemia drug, NESP, on the market by that time.
The arrival of the new, improved drug could make FDA approval of
Dynepo almost moot, he said. But there might be enough demand for
the older drugs to make marketing Dynepo worthwhile for
TKT/Aventis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since (erythropoietin) is a multibillion-dollar product on a
worldwide basis, for Aventis to spend $5 (million) to $10 million
litigating makes good business sense on the off-chance they might
win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Dietz, a Pacific Growth Equities analyst covering
TKT/Aventis, believes NESP's reach will be limited, meaning Dynepo
could cut into Epogen's market share.
</P>
<P>
   ``NESP is a product that to me has very little market share gain
over Epogen,'' Dietz said.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Amgen contends that TKT/Aventis is infringing on
Epogen's patent in the way the drug is formulated. A decision will
not take place any sooner than next month.
</P>
<P>
   Though TKT could be barred from selling Dynepo in the United
States, the company could start selling it immediately in Europe
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   The submission for approval has substantial meaning for
Cambridge, Mass.-based TKT. Its parent Aventis will pay it $3.5
million for reaching the milestone. Harp and Dietz's estimates of
what TKT will get once Dynepo is approved vary with Harp
anticipating an $8 million payout and Dietz estimating between $10
million and $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Thursday, Amgen shares fell 13 cents a share to close
at $70.19, on volume of 5.8 million shares on the Nasdaq exchange.
TKT's shares rose to $30.25, up $1.13 on light volume of 110,000
shares on the Nasdaq exchange.

WEST TO STEP DOWN MONDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Call it retirement, semiretirement or a
sabbatical. Whatever it is, Jerry West will make it official next
week.
</P>
<P>
   West, the Los Angeles Lakers' head of basketball operations for
18 years _ and the embodiment of the franchise for four decades _
will step down as executive vice president at a Monday press
conference, a team source told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached with team owner Jerry Buss, West will
be retained as a consultant. But he has already cleaned out his
office at the team's El Segundo headquarters and is expected to
take at least a year off. He does not intend to work even part time
during that year.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Kupchak, West's understudy for the past 14 years, will be
elevated to the team's top basketball operations post but will
retain his current title as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   In a related move, the team will name Kurt Rambis as assistant
general manager. Rambis, a former Lakers forward and assistant
coach, has been working as a consultant to Buss for the past year.
He served as interim head coach for most of the lockout-shortened
1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   West and other Lakers officials were unavailable for immediate
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   What role West will play after his ``retirement'' is unclear. As
a consultant, he presumably will periodically advise on player-
personnel matters while trying to keep a safe distance from the
daily rigors of his former stressful job.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know him well say West will have difficulty
staying away and they would not be surprised if he wants to return
after a year or even sooner. Sources say Buss, out of loyalty, is
leaving the door open for West's return.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to step down comes as no surprise. The notoriously
overwrought West has been flirting with retirement each offseason
for several years and has often told confidantes that he was ready
to walk away. Each time, however, he's decided to stay on, and in
1998 that decision was made easier by a new, $3.5 million-a-year
contract from Buss.
</P>
<P>
   But the daily stresses of the job continue to gnaw at the
62-year- old Hall of Famer. He skipped most of the Lakers' playoff
games, didn't watch a single minute of the NBA Finals and was
absent in June when they held their first championship parade in 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   An irregular heartbeat, linked to stress, also has troubled West
and one friend recently described him as ``sick, mentally and
physically.'' He showed no outward joy when the Lakers won the
championship and said he took no particular satisfaction in the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to retire was made nearly two months ago, but West
has refused to confirm it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Although West won't be cutting ties entirely, his decision marks
the end of a long, storied era of Lakers history.
</P>
<P>
   He was a rookie guard for the Lakers in 1960 when they moved to
L.A. from Minneapolis and was a key member of the team's first
championship here, in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   West was a consultant when the Lakers won titles in 1980 and `82
and general manager of the ``Showtime'' teams that won
championships in 1985,`87 and `88.
</P>
<P>
   And he is the architect of the current defending champions,
having made a series of shrewd, risky moves in the summer of 1996
to acquire superstars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. They have
since become the best tandem in the league, and the centerpieces of
what could become a new dynasty.

LEADERS OF THE PAC? UW VOTED NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took Rick Neuheisel just two years to make the
University of Washington the top Dawgs in the Pac-10 _ at least in
the media's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Washington nipped USC by three votes as the media's choice to
win the 2000 Pac-10 crown in the annual preseason poll, while
Washington State was relegated to the 10th position for the second
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote tied the second-smallest margin between first and
second since the inaugural preseason poll in 1961. Washington (275
total points) received 16 first-place votes to 11 for USC (272).
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, picked third, received one first-place vote, while No. 5
Arizona State had two.
</P>
<P>
   The honor inspired ambivalence in Neuheisel, who led the Huskies
to a 7-5 record in his first season as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to say, hey, great, it's a positive for our
program that people believe Washington football is on the way
back,'' Neuheisel said. ``That said: I can't wait to go and tell my
team this doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point.
</P>
<P>
   The media has correctly picked the eventual champion in just 17
out of 39 polls, and only two times in the past seven years. Seven
different teams have won the Pac-10 title in the past eight years.
In four of the past seven years, the eventual conference champion
was picked to finish in the bottom half of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's champion, Stanford, which was picked eighth before
the 1999 season, was voted seventh this year, despite returning 15
starters from the team that played in the Rose Bowl. It was only
the second time since 1978 that the defending champs were predicted
to finish in the conference's bottom half the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really want my reaction?'' Stanford coach Tyrone
Willingham said with a grin. ``I think it's consistent with what
has gone on most years ... and I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal also had the widest range of votes, ranking as high
as second and as low as 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State has compiled a 1-15 conference record since
appearing in the Rose Bowl following the 1997 season. The Cougars
were picked 10th last year and finished 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only guy in the history of the program to turn it
around twice,'' Cougars coach Mike Price quipped. ``I'm going for
three this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington was picked sixth last year in the preseason and
finished tied for second with Oregon. The media predicted Arizona
would win the conference last season, but the Wildcats finished
tied for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Arizona fell to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listening to all these coaches, you'd think it's going to be a
10-way tie for first,'' Arizona coach Dick Tomey said. ``We've been
picked down before and won 10 games. I don't pay any attention to
where we are picked. It's just a best guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, the only conference team to win a bowl game in 1999,
welcomes back just 10 starters from last season's 9-3 squad.
Nonetheless, the Ducks were picked third, perhaps a sign of
newfound respect for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are starting to realize the caliber of team we
are,'' Oregon defensive end Saul Patu said. ``But we really don't
pay attention to (polls).''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was fourth in this year's poll, while Oregon State was
sixth, the school's highest position in the poll since the
conference expanded to 10 teams in 1978. Cal was ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The media last picked Washington to win the league in 1997, but
the Huskies ended up in fourth place. The Huskies' most recent
Pac-10 title came in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked ourselves into a position where they think we're
good,'' Neuheisel said. ``Now let's prove we're good.''

OLIVER: GOOD CATCH FOR M'S

   NEW YORK _ Joe Oliver's hitting .350.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver's laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver's hitting .250.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver's laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver's hitting .150.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Oliver's laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Watch some players go through the ups and downs of a long season
and you can read them like a barometer as they react to the streaks
and the slumps that are endemic to their trade. Weather's cloudy.
Weather's fine. Oops, rain today.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Oliver, though, and you can't get a read on him. It's a
stretch to say it doesn't bother him at all if he's not hitting.
It's just that he's been through it all in a 10-year career,
catching for World Series winners and catching for division
doormats.
</P>
<P>
   He's come to the conclusion that, to twist a line from The Bard,
the game's the thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day you play in the big leagues is great,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, Oliver was in the minor leagues, stuck
there by Tampa Bay after the Devil Rays brought him to spring
training with a promise that if he didn't make the team, they'd cut
him loose to make a deal of his own with another club if he could.
</P>
<P>
   The promise was verbal. The promise was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, now last year was not fun, except for the end,''
said Oliver, who did get back to the big leagues with Pittsburgh
late in the season. ``I was promised something and they reneged. I
was bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver came to the Mariners this year with the same promise. The
Mariners kept their word. Oliver started the season on the big
league roster, then went down to Tacoma when Tom Lampkin returned
from the disabled list. Then, as injuries to Dan Wilson and Lampkin
(again) cropped up, Oliver was back with the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that happy at Tacoma,'' Oliver said. ``But I felt
that my time would come.''
</P>
<P>
   It has, and Oliver is here to stay. He's catching about three
days out of seven, splitting time with Wilson now that Lampkin is
out for the season. The Mariners are winning and Oliver is loving
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day we play a game, and I can't wait for the next day,''
Oliver said. ``I almost want to have doubleheaders.''
</P>
<P>
   That will happen soon enough. The Mariners, who start an
eight-game, seven-day road trip Friday in Yankee Stadium, play a
doubleheader Tuesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates feel his enthusiasm. It radiates through the smile
that can almost always be seen peeking through his brown/red beard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a good guy, he's full of life,'' shortstop Alex
Rodriguez said. ``He's smart, he has playoff experience and he's
been tremendous to have as a teammate. We didn't know in spring
training if he'd help us in September or sooner. But he's come here
and helped us, big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell back in spring training what this meant to him.
He came in having lost some weight, and he was crushing the ball.
He was ready when we needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like things couldn't be better, though. There's the
small matter of Oliver not being quite at full strength. He hurt
his back running the bases on Tuesday. He's supposed to be able to
play Friday, but it may take a day or two extra.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the big matter of Oliver's post-season
aspirations. He wears blue, but the green-eyed monster lurks
beneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm jealous,'' Oliver said. ``I was in the World Series my
rookie year in the big leagues (with Cincinnati, where Lou Piniella
was his manager). I haven't been back since. I sit at home and
watch the playoffs on TV. It hurts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a pain inside that I want to stop. It gets so
that I can't watch a whole game. This year, I think there's a
chance I'll be able to watch the post-season behind the mask.''
</P>
<P>
   They will if Oliver's record holds up. Seattle is 16-7 in the 23
games Oliver has started behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what I hit, really,'' Oliver said. ``The win is
the thing for me. It always has been. Ask any catcher. If he
catches a win, it's a good day, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the success of the Mariners with Oliver behind the plate
is because he's been a major contributor offensively _ .274 with
six homers, including a big one during the first week of the season
to beat the Yankees' Andy Pettitte, the pitcher the Mariners face
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers here are blessed,'' pitching coach Brian Price said.
``Every pitcher loves throwing to Dan Wilson, and they have the
same kinds of feelings when Joe's out there. He calls a good game,
he's been around the game, he knows the hitters. He gives the
pitchers a feeling of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And that confidence exudes from Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going as far as the pitchers here carry us,'' Oliver
said. ``And we're one of the very few teams with the luxury of
having such good deep pitching. It's the reason we're winning.
We're in every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   You just have to look at Joe Oliver's grin to see that.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Introducing himself to a nation that barely knows
him, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas pledged Thursday night to
``confront the hard issues _ threats to our national security,
threats to our health and retirement security'' that he said the
Clinton administration had ducked.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a jubilant final session of the Republican National
Convention, he argued that ``times of plenty'' were times to solve
major problems, not to sit back and relax. With that, he sought to
cut the ground from beneath his Democratic rival, Vice President Al
Gore, whose strongest electoral argument is his association with
the prosperity of the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   With his parents and many other members of his large family in
the VIP seats, Bush offered this curt verdict on Bill Clinton's and
Al Gore's time in the White House: ``So much promise, to no great
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused the vice president of indulging in ``the politics
of the roadblock, the philosophy of the stop sign.'' He turned
Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous first inaugural address around and
aimed it at Gore, charging that ``the only thing he has to offer is
fear itself.''
</P>
<P>
   He mocked Gore by saying, ``I do not need to take your pulse
before I know my own mind. I do not reinvent myself at every turn.
I am not running in borrowed clothes.'' Yet he himself has been
successively moderate, conservative and moderate again, as the
nominating campaign progressed.
</P>
<P>
   In a further though more indirect thrust at the president he
hopes to succeed, the Republican nominee quoted the poet Robert
Frost, remembered by older Americans for his appearance at John F.
Kennedy's inaugural four decades ago, on the need to ``occupy the
land with character.'' Few if any of the thousands who filled the
First Union Center in south Philadelphia, and few of those watching
on television, could have missed the allusion to Clinton's sexual
involvement with an intern, which led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration had its chance,'' Bush asserted. ``They
have not led. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he had vowed, much of Bush's text was upbeat. ``Tonight
we vow to our nation: We will seize this moment of American
promise,'' he said. ``We will use these good times for great
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few gibes Thursday night and Wednesday night's more
hard-edged speech by Dick Cheney, his running mate, Bush and his
party have tried all week to avoid the kind of sniping, to say
nothing of the internal bickering, that they know the U.S. public
hates.
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded, but not without cost; lacking debate or drama,
the convention experienced considerable trouble in luring
television viewers. Many preferred Regis Philbin or ``Friends'' to
the GOP's voter-friendly show.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier sessions had had something of the tone of a sales
meeting, long on team spirit and short on specifics. But Thursday
night the governor spelled out, far more completely than other
speakers here, his agenda for action.
</P>
<P>
   Bush proposed major reforms in the public schools, in the Social
Security system and in the federal tax code. He promised to abolish
the inheritance tax and guaranteed that on his watch no one would
have to pay more than a third of their income to the government _
considerably less than the 39 percent-plus some now pay.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks on Social Security were unqualified; He said that
``President George W. Bush will keep the promise of Social Security
_ no changes, no reductions, no way.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounded eerily reminiscent of his father's pledge _ ``Read my
lips, no new taxes'' _ which plunged then-President Bush into
political trouble when he agreed to a tax hike.
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged to modernize Medicare, and to add prescription
benefits ``for every senior who needs them,'' stressing the last
item more than he had before. He vowed to rebuild the nation's
military strength. He said the moment had come ``to make Head Start
an early learning program, teach all of our children to read and
renew the promise of America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In a striking passage, he told the strongly conservative
Republican gathering, hostile to most new government initiatives,
that he intended ``to extend the promise of prosperity to every
corner of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that far too many in the United States felt left out
and left behind, and he described that as a challenge ``to the very
heart of America.'' Speaking in much the same vein as retired Gen.
Colin Powell on the convention's opening night, and implicitly
reminding his audience of his own doctrine of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' he declared, ``We are their country, too, and each
of us must share in its promise or that promise is diminished for
us all.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``When these problems aren't confronted, it builds
a wall within our nation. On one side are wealth and technology,
education and ambition. On the other side of the wall are poverty
and prison, addiction and despair. And, my fellow Americans, we
must tear down that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The point was underlined in a lengthy video that depicted Bush
as a longtime friend of Hispanics and African-Americans in his home
state.
</P>
<P>
   At 54 years of age, Bush has already succeeded where many have
failed. He is only the second son of a former president ever
nominated for president by a major party; the other was John Quincy
Adams in 1824. Since then Robert Todd Lincoln fell short twice and
Robert Taft did so three times.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's speech was a crucial moment for Bush, more so
than for most nominees. It was the speech of a lifetime for a
politician whose time in elective office has been confined to a
bare six years as governor of Texas. Not since Dwight D.
Eisenhower, war hero and political neophyte, has a presidential
nominee offered so sketchy a political resume.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dealt candidly with that problem, as well as Gore's
extensive experience on Capitol Hill and in the White House, and
sought to turn his inexperience into an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may lack the polish of Washington,'' he said. ``Then again,
I don't have a lot of things that come with Washington experience.
I don't have enemies to fight, and I have no stake in the bitter
arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of
Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strong signal that he intends to run as an outsider _ a
U.S. political tactic dating back to Andrew Jackson, but one
surprising in a man whose father was president and whose
grandfather was a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's was shorter and leaner than many past acceptance speeches
_ 52 munites long. It had a touch of humor or two _ he took the
blame for his mother's white hair _ and a few emotional appeals,
like a tribute to his father and other members of the World War II
generation.
</P>
<P>
   But the nominee's delivery was mostly deadpan, with his lips
compressed, with only a few smiles and almost no gestures.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates, Republican loyalists all, loved what they heard,
and they stood and cheered for much of the evening, enveloped in
the now-obligatory falling balloons. Most were in no mood to make
dispassionate judgments of Bush as a rhetoritician or, indeed, as a
party standard-bearer. Nights like this are for brassy bands and
funny hats, whistles and silly signs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the impact of the speech on independents and other swing
voters, on whom the outcome in November will probably depend, that
remains to be seen _ not only whether they give him the customary
``bump'' in the polls but whether it lasts once Gore gets his four
days in the convention sun in Los Angeles later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush, who would never claim to be in the same league as
an orator with Clinton or with Ronald Reagan, gave a credible
account of himself and made a start at the process of convincing
the country that his legs are long enough to reach the stirrups of
leadership at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Andrew H. Card Jr., the convention's major-domo, said before
Thursday night's session began that it, like the last three days,
would ``be about the future, not about the past.''
</P>
<P>
   One manifestation of that was the marginalization or the
outright absence of many of the important figures in the Republican
party's recent past, including former Vice President Dan Quayle,
former House speaker Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Lamar Alexander,
Steve Forbes and, of course, Pat Buchanan, who is now contending
for the Reform Party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   There was no place for any of them on Thursday night's four-hour
program, which included a number of not-quite-hip singers, a former
Miss America, four videos, a number of little-known politicians and
non-politicians, Bo Derek, several friends of the nominee and his
24-year-old nephew, George P. Bush, who gave part of his speech in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush described his uncle as a man who would ensure
that all Americans of all origins ``can share in the promise and
the prosperity of el sueno Americano _ the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to George W. Bush, the only prominent politicians to
speak were Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee and Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania, both of whom Bush briefly considered as possible vice
presidential nominees. But a non-politician was called upon to lend
weight to one of the Bush's campaign's main arguments on behalf of
their man: that he has shown a talent for working both sides of the
aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bullock, the widow of Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock of Texas, talked
of her husband's cooperation with Bush in Austin. Bullock, a
Democrat, got along so well with Bush that he endorsed him for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:41 p.m., Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas proclaimed an end to
the roll call, which had been spread over several nights, saying,
``The chair proudly announces the unanimous choice for president of
United States: George W. Bush of Texas.'' Delegates who by this
point were not already standing _ a very small number indeed _ rose
to their feet as the band broke into its rendition of ``Rock This
House.'' Many of those on the floor turned to watch former
President George Bush, in the house for a fourth night in a row, as
he enjoyed his son's moment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most in the crowd, the former president stayed seated
when his son stated his opposition to abortion, a section of the
speech that may have drawn more applause than any other. And unlike
others in the Bush and Cheney families, he stayed off the crowded
stage at the evening's close.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee came onstage at 10:04 p.m., composed and unsmiling,
in a dark blue suit. The delegates started clapping and shouting
and waving their big red foam-rubber batons, but he ended the
demonstration after two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Right at the start, George W. Bush described the year 2000 as
``a remarkable moment in the history of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Prosperity can be a tool in our hands, used to build
and better our country. Or it can be a drug in our system, dulling
our sense of urgency, of empathy, of duty. Our opportunities are
too great, our lives too short, to waste this moment.'' Praising
Reagan and his father for having helped to end the Cold War, he
accused ``the Clinton/Gore administration,'' as he called it, of
having squandered the momentum generated by the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen a steady erosion of American power and an
unsteady exercise of American influence,'' he said. But at the very
end of his speech, he had reassuring words for the Republican
faithful and for others listening to him: ``The night is passing,
and we are ready for the day to come.''

ANALYSIS: CONVENTION WRAPS UP AS GOP COUNTS ITS SUCCESSES FOR
WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY and STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It had no suspense, a record-low TV audience and
nothing resembling a robust debate on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans couldn't be happier with their national
convention that ended Thursday. After all, conventions no longer
are about picking candidates as much as they are about catapulting
them to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a wildly successful convention,'' said John
Hancock, executive director of the Missouri Republican Party. ``We
got even more bounce than the campaign expected.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush leaves Philadelphia today with a double-digit
lead in the polls and a party brimming with confidence that he is
just three months away from being elected the 43rd president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is as unified as we've been since Ronald Reagan's
re-election in 1984,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, a Kansas
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans achieved unity by virtually banning dissension in a
party that's been out of the White House since early 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers heard hardly a word about abortion and little about the
moral bankruptcy of the Clinton era until vice presidential nominee
Dick Cheney took the president to task Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And they saw no tributes to the House managers who worked so
diligently to impeach the intensely disliked Democratic Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-edged partisanship was out. A GOP with a smiling face was
in, allowing the party to move to the center in an all-out bid to
win in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find anyone in the hall willing to utter an unkind
word,'' said University of Texas political scientist Bruce
Buchanan. ``I call that impressive discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans especially wanted to avoid the flame-throwing
rhetoric that Pat Buchanan voiced at the 1992 convention.
Buchanan's call for a cultural war drove legions of voters away
from the GOP and opened the door for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush himself requested a convention with a less strident tone.
In his acceptance speech Thursday night, he promoted his bipartisan
approach to governing that has seen him working hand in hand with
Democrats in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enemies to fight,'' Bush said. ``And I have no
stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to
change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats were impressed with the convention _ to a
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it remarkable to watch how nicely the Republicans have
organized around the message they wanted to deliver,'' said Mike
McCurry, President Clinton's former press secretary who is now a
communications consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But McCurry said that eliminating any debate on the issues or
candidates doesn't necessarily generate voter enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was kind of an antiseptic quality to the convention,''
McCurry said. ``You need a little more depth.''
</P>
<P>
   But various polls show Bush has opened a lead of more than 10
points over Gore during convention week. A bipartisan poll by
Voter.com released Thursday gave him a 48 percent to 34 percent
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In that poll, Bush surged 18 points ahead of Gore among
independent voters and six points ahead among women. A
preconvention poll by the same group had the two candidates
virtually tied among those two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Republicans' week,'' conceded Jim Slattery, a
former Democratic congressman from Kansas. ``They are going to get
a nice bounce out of this convention. I don't think there's any
question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slattery and others, however, chided Republicans for showcasing
speakers and entertainers from groups traditionally thought of as
Democrats, including African-Americans, Hispanics and gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best Democratic convention Republicans have put on
for a long time,'' Slattery said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the unified front of the GOP stems from the choice of
Cheney, observers said. Cheney appeased conservatives who may have
thought of Bush as too moderate. His selection set a harmonious
tone for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the uptick comes after a convention,'' said Richard
L. Berkley, a former Kansas City mayor who was at a GOP convention
for the ninth time. ``This time I think it came before it
started.''
</P>
<P>
   The boost for Bush occurred despite an apparent lack of public
interest in the convention.
</P>
<P>
   A Nielsen Media Research Poll published in The New York Times
showed that only 8.8 percent of homes with televisions were tuned
into the convention Tuesday, down from a high of 31.5 in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to politics, people are tuning out and turning
off,'' said Robert Denton, a political communications professor at
Virginia Tech University.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of suspense about who will be nominated was considered
a key to the low ratings. But Republicans don't seem to mind, given
the alternative. Suspense implies division, and division translates
to lost elections.
</P>
<P>
   Look no further, Republicans argue, than the bitter 1976 primary
race between Reagan and President Gerald Ford or the equally heated
1980 Democratic bout between President Jimmy Carter and Ted
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question we would rather have people going home
feeling good about our presidential candidate than have the
infighting we've had at past conventions,'' said Catherine Hanaway,
executive director of the Bush campaign in Missouri and an
alternate delegate at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of rancor on the floor has been matched by a pattern of
scripted, kindly worded speeches from the speaker's podium. Not
until Cheney's speech Wednesday night where he lashed out at
Clinton and Gore did any major speaker go on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more like an incumbent president's convention,'' Denton
said. ``The unity, the tone, the not being attack-oriented. It's a
different kind of convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Gueary III, president of the Olathe branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a registered
Republican, said although he had watched every minute of the
convention, it had not kept him from leaning toward Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anything inspiring,'' Gueary said. ``It's a lot
of fanfare but it didn't have any real meaning or purpose.''

HOW ABOUT A DREAM TEAM FOR BASEBALL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. Sullivan 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember, you read it here first.
</P>
<P>
   Here is your United States Olympic Baseball Team, which will
compete in the Summer Olympics next month in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers: Rick Helling, Mike Mussina, Brad Radke, Dustin
Hermanson, Kris Benson, Todd Jones, Trevor Hoffman, John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   Catchers: Brad Ausmus, Jason Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   First basemen: Rafael Palmeiro, Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Second basemen: Delino DeShields, Jeff Frye.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstops: Royce Clayton, Desi Relaford.
</P>
<P>
   Third basemen: Jeff Cirillo, Scott Rolen
</P>
<P>
   Outfielders: Rusty Greer, Johnny Damon, Rondell White, Richie
Sexson, Jermaine Dye, Greg Vaughn, Brady Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitters: Todd Helton, Dean Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty good, huh? Even with the loss of second baseman Craig
Biggio to injury, the Cubans don't have a chance. The gold medal is
in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell Rangers manager Johnny Oates we're taking half
his team away for the final three weeks of the season. He'll go
ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   But he'll have to live with it. American pride is at stake, and
this is] the only way to ensure the gold medal will be brought back
to the United States. The plan is simple but ingenious (and totally
hypothetical), part of my ongoing effort to help Bud Selig run
baseball:
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, any major-league player on a team with a losing
record is free to call it a season and go play for the United
States in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ```Hmmm, that would be pretty neat,'' Palmeiro admitted. ``I'd
consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't? What major-league player wouldn't want the honor
of crushing the rest of the world in Sydney?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not at the top of my list of priorities,'' Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   What?
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes away from baseball,'' Greer said. ``No matter if
you're on a losing team or not, you still have a chance to be a
spoiler on teams ahead of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Greer is out. Gabe Kapler is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like it,'' Kapler said. ``I'd like to represent my
country for two weeks, although my first obligation is to my
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, check with Rangers general manager Doug Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Melvin said. ``They'd have to play Canada. Being
Canadian, I don't want the U.S. to have a stacked team.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, the Canadians get Larry Walker, Jeff Zimmerman and
Ryan Dempster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a player wanted to go, I wouldn't stand in his way,''
Melvin said seriously. ``I think it would be great for someone like
\Rthe Orioles'\S Cal Ripken. I shouldn't speak for him, but they're
rebuilding anyway. If you're a player who has accomplished a lot,
it might be something to go for. Same with Tony Gwynn.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer is right about one thing. Taking these players away would
have a significant impact on the pennant race. The Rangers finish
the season with three games against the Oakland Athletics, and
playoff] contenders like Cleveland, Toronto and Seattle expect
Helling, Palmeiro, Clayton and Kapler to play that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Olympic team will consist mainly of
minor-leaguers. But this is still a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
as Melvin found out when three members of the Pan American Games
team _ manager Buddy Bell, pitching coach Marcel Lachemann and
pitcher John Patterson _ addressed baseball general managers at
their annual off-season meeting last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about what those games meant,'' Melvin said. ``How
after they lost the first game their pride kicked in. It was a
do-or-die situation. Professional baseball was the farthest thing
from their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave you a sense that we need to do our best to put the
best team out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's settled. The plan is hereby adopted. Sept. 7 is the cutoff
date. The only one thing that we need between now and then is a
long losing streak by the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Eat your heart out, Fidel Castro.

CARBONNEAU RETURNING HOME TO HELP CANADIENS REBUILD
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Guy Carbonneau is returning home to Montreal, where hockey is
king and the former Canadiens captain is regarded as a prince.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau turned down the Stars' offer to remain in Dallas and
accepted a position yesterday in the Canadiens' front office. A fan
favorite while he played the final five seasons of his illustrious
career with the Stars, Carbonneau joins a rebuilding Canadiens
franchise as supervisor of prospect development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Montreal has always been home,'' Carbonneau said last night
from Montreal. ``The last five years in Dallas ... I wish I could
have stayed in Dallas, but I think the opportunity in Montreal is a
little better. It's more of a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The newest challenge for Carbonneau, who announced his
retirement earlier this summer, is developing draft picks into
productive NHL players in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's NHL, you have to within three or four years of
drafting a kid, get him ready for the NHL,'' Carbonneau said.
``That is my main job.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars general manager Bob Gainey offered Carbonneau a position
similar to one former Stars player Craig Ludwig had after his
retirement. It offered the opportunity to sample different areas
and functions of the organization. However, Gainey said he could
not guarantee Carbonneau a long-term position in his desired role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a choice very good for him and the organization he
is going to become associated with,'' Gainey said. ``We did speak
about certain possibilities with our organization in Dallas. I
think the Canadiens had a place and need for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau, who played 12 seasons for the Canadiens, is the
latest addition to a restructured Montreal management team. This
off-season, the Canadiens lost consultant Jacques Lemaire to the
head coaching job of the expansion Minnesota Wild, pro scout Mario
Tremblay, European scout Dave King and assistant to the general
manager Phil Scheuer.
</P>
<P>
   Canadiens general manager Rejean Houle, a longtime teammate of
Gainey's with the Canadiens, added veteran scout Martin Madden from
the New York Rangers, Andre Savard took over as director of player
personnel, and now Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal ``is the most successful hockey franchise in the
world,'' Carbonneau said. ``Seeing them not playing as well was
hard for everyone that has played there. To come back and have a
chance to try to change that philosophy and change the team to a
winning team, in the end, Montreal was the better opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau will permanently move back to Montreal with wife Line
and daughter Kristina. Daughter Anne-Marie, who dates Stars forward
Brenden Morrow, will remain in Dallas. She will be a freshman at
SMU in the fall. \Nsubheds:Briefly Bob Gainey, in Toronto this
week, continues to prepare for the upcoming arbitration cases of
forwards Jere Lehtinen (Thursday and Blake Sloan (Aug. 12). Gainey
also remains in contact with several unrestricted free agents, but
he said he might wait until after the arbitration hearings before
adding players to the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said he wants to add one forward and one defenseman,
which still could be Dave Manson. The Stars remain in contention
for unrestricted free-agent forwards Ted Donato and Claude Lemieux.

DEVICE MIGHT HELP PREVENT SERIOUS HEAD AND NECK INJURIES IN AUTO
RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ NASCAR Winston Cup regular Brett Bodine plans to
compete in tomorrow's Brickyard 400 wearing a device he says might
have prevented the deaths of Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. in
separate crashes this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine wore stock-car racing's version of the HANS Device, an
evolving head-and-neck restraint system, for the first time during
the Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway last month, after trying it
on for size during Ford Motor Co.'s Brickyard test at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a wonderful device,'' said Bodine, one of three
brothers racing in NASCAR. ``Ran it every lap at Pocono with no
negative about it. It does not restrict your side vision or your
mobility. It made me feel more secure in the car. I felt like I had
another piece of safety device that really was going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   HANS is the acronym for ``head and neck support.'' Developed in
the mid-1990s, it features a yoke that fits around the driver's
neck and over his shoulders, and straps that attach to the back of
the helmet. It is designed to keep a driver's head and neck from
violently snapping forward and backward during an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Indy Racing League regular Eddie Cheever Jr., who said he plans
to test the HANS later this month, said his understanding of the
device is that it spreads G-force loading under rapid deceleration.
Therefore, the shock of an impact is not concentrated on three or
four vertebrae in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, 19, was killed when he crashed while practicing his
NASCAR Busch Grand National car at New Hampshire International
Speedway on May 12. He suffered massive head injuries. Irwin, 30,
was killed when he crashed while practicing his Cup car on July 7
at NHIS, not far from where Petty suffered his fatal injuries in
Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking throttles have been suspected in both incidents,
although NASCAR has not been able to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to those tragedies, NASCAR officials announced
Tuesday that beginning with tomorrow's race, Cup cars must be
equipped with a stop on the primary and secondary throttle shafts
and an on/off switch on the steering wheel to cut power to the
ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Bodine believes the HANS Device is the next logical safety step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it would have increased the chances of them \RPetty and
Irwin\S surviving those crashes. That's why I'm using the device,''
said Bodine, whose older brother, Geoffrey, survived a fiery,
parts-spewing crash in a NASCAR Craftsman Truck race at the Daytona
International Speedway in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of time, money and effort on making these race
cars go faster,'' said Bodine, driver of the No. 11 Ralphs
Supermarkets Ford Taurus. ``We should spend the same amount of time
and money and effort on making them safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The HANS Device has become the hot-ticket item in open-wheel
racing this summer. Michael Andretti and Christian Fittipaldi,
teammates at Newman-Haas Racing in the Championship Auto Racing
Teams series, wore the device during the Michigan 500 at the
Michigan Speedway last month. Formula One drivers will be required
to wear the device beginning in 2001, and CART officials are
considering making the HANS mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett, the reigning Winston Cup champion and Brickyard
400 winner, said he also is preparing to test a version of the
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the process of getting a new helmet done, and \RI want
to\S at least try it and see what adjustments we need to make,''
said Jarrett, driver of the No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit
Taurus. ``The problem that I have, maybe as a taller driver, is I
sit all the way back against the rollcage as it is. And I know to
make that device work, you have to bend the headrest part of the
seat back some more. With that, I'm going to be right against the
rollbar, and I don't know that we have room. But I'm looking for
anything that can make it safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson, Winston Cup Series director, said NASCAR is keenly
interested in Bodine's continued feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``His comments were positive after the \RPocono\S race,'' Nelson
said in Gasoline Alley. ``But we still want to look at it and
discuss it with the whole garage before we make those kind of
decisions. We're looking at it. There's a lot of things that guys
can do \Rto enhance safety\S. The HANS Device is one of them.''

`WEALTH EFFECT' THEORY MAY NOT HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As stock prices continue to sag and show no sign of recapturing
their upward dynamism of recent years, conventional wisdom holds
that a diminished ``wealth effect'' will undermine personal
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   The good news would be that a falloff in consumer activity would
probably lead the Federal Reserve to call a halt to its
money-tightening regimen of the past year. The bad news would be
that if consumers became too cautious, it could eventually lead to
recession, because personal consumption fuels two-thirds of U.S.
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the question of whether what economists call the
wealth effect correlates as closely with personal consumption as is
generally believed. The wealth-effect theory assumes that as the
value of investments rises, so does investor propensity to spend.
Spending increases in tandem with the feeling of being wealthier.
This sense of being better off prevails even when the gains are
still in the form of paper profit because investors haven't
converted their newfound wealth to actual income.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher J. Neely of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
recently took a close look at the relationship between stock prices
and consumption and found traditional assumptions open to question.
Writing in the July issue of the bank's MonetaryTrends, Neely said
his research showed ``only a tenuous relationship between
consumption growth and asset prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely reviewed the period 1889-1999, comparing stock values to
consumption growth of services and nondurable goods, and failed to
find any ``strong pattern'' to support the wealth-effect theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there are sound theoretical reasons to believe that
the rise in stock market wealth has fueled recent consumption
growth and that consumption is related to wealth in the long run,''
Neely observed, ``neither asset prices nor other variables have
proven especially useful in predicting future consumption growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely's findings bring to mind J.M. Keynes' observation that we
are often slaves to defunct economists.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Neely is concerned, the theoretical weakness revealed
by his study makes it difficult to say how much stock market gains
of recent years have fueled consumption, ``or to predict the likely
consequences of a sharp drop in stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Neely's research interesting at this particular time
is the surprisingly strong economic growth recently indicated by
the second-quarter gross domestic product. The initial GDP estimate
was an annual growth pace of 5.2 percent, when most economists had
been forecasting a rate in the 3.5 percent neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   While business investment gave growth a strong boost, consumer
activity held up despite a stock market that has in many instances
provided the opposite of a wealth effect since March.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of ways to read recent events in the context
of Neely's findings. One is that a slumping market won't
necessarily threaten a recession, which is encouraging. Another is
that if Fed researchers in Washington are coming to the same
conclusion they are in St. Louis, a sluggish market won't be seen
as a reason to stop raising interest rates in the face of strong
economic growth.

INTERSTATE BAKERIES DOESN'T GET STAY OF PUNITIVE-DAMAGES AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Interstate Bakeries Corp. on Thursday failed to keep a jury
award of $120 million in punitive damages from being entered into
the court record. The award is the second largest in U.S. legal
history involving a private company accused of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City, Mo., company said Thursday that it would
definitely appeal the damage award, which involves its San
Francisco bakery. A lawyer representing several of the black
plaintiffs said it was time for Interstate to acknowledge its
problems in dealing with black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where arrogance gets you,'' said Angela Alioto, a San
Francisco lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate had said late Wednesday that it expected to receive a
stay of the award after talking to the judge. But in a conference
call to attorneys of both sides, the judge said Interstate's
attorneys had misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Dirkes, vice president of marketing at Interstate, said the
company had policies in place to deal with discrimination
complaints and took them seriously. But employees must bring any
problems to the company's attention, and that wasn't done by the
workers involved in the suit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a perfect world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco lawsuit isn't the only one the company has
faced. Interstate confirmed that it was involved in a
discrimination suit in New York and another in Florida. A suit in
Indiana was decided in the company's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The California case involved 21 black workers at Interstate's
Wonder Bread plant in San Francisco. The jury on Monday awarded $11
million in compensatory damages and on Wednesday awarded $120
million in punitive damages for discrimination against the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate previously had said discriminatory practices alleged
in the case went back as far as 30 years, when other companies
owned the plant. Interstate bought the bakery in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   About $5 million of the compensatory damages was for
discrimination before mid-1997, and the judge has indicated he will
set that portion of the award aside. But the punitive award was
strictly for discriminatory practices since mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   The total award _ about $126 million _ is the second largest for
a private company in a discrimination suit. Texaco settled a
discrimination case in 1996 for $176 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Griesemer, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said
the award was large for a company of Interstate's size but not
enough to put it under. However, the award could trigger more suits
and more costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big worry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate's stock closed Thursday at $18 a share, down 94
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Waukeen McCoy, a San Francisco lawyer representing some of the
plaintiffs in the California case, said there were several
inquiries from other Interstate employees around the country
wanting to join the suit. They were refused because they didn't
live in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nationwide problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said he had failed to get much response from civil rights
groups, including the NAACP in Oakland, regarding the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the NAACP in Oakland and Kansas City and to its
national headquarters in Baltimore, as well as the Black Chamber of
Commerce of Greater Kansas City, seeking comment about the lawsuit
were not returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Black workers who filed the California suit said they failed to
get their share of promotions and often worked in a hostile working
environment that included racial slurs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wright, who worked at the plant after it was bought by
Interstate, said he did get a foreman position, but it proved to be
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   His job was on the loading dock, which turned out to be
understaffed, he said. He asked for another worker, but his request
was denied. Wright, a black man, said he had to skip lunch breaks
to relieve other workers to keep from falling behind. The extra
work gave him a shoulder injury that put him off the job.
</P>
<P>
   His replacement was a white man who was given the extra employee
that Wright was denied, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In another incident, he asked for a personal day off for Martin
Luther King Jr. Day. He was denied even though he made the request
two months in advance, and other white workers often took personal
days to go to baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had different rules for the white guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dirkes said that about 10 percent of the employees in the San
Francisco plant are black and that a proportionate amount are in
supervisory positions.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company offered diversity training at its plants.
The training had been given at the San Francisco plant, Dirkes
said, although he was unsure whether it was before or after the
lawsuit was filed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to equal opportunity and diversity, and
therefore we cannot and will not tolerate discrimination,'' he
said.

CHENEY'S LESBIAN DAUGHTER A THORN IN GOP'S SIDE  &HT;     BY CARLA MARINUCCI
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ There's something about Mary.
</P>
<P>
   And it's something the Republicans just don't want to talk
about.
</P>
<P>
   Mary is Mary Cheney, the 31-year-old daughter of GOP vice
presidential nominee Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   She is a lesbian, and she hasn't kept it a secret _ either to
her friends or to her employer, Coors Brewing Co., where she is the
gay and lesbian corporate relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   And Mary has been at the Republican convention, sitting next to
mom Lynne Cheney in Philadelphia's First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as the GOP is concerned, the message has been clear.
</P>
<P>
   No, we don't talk about Mary, and more important, we don't talk
 &UR; to  &LR; Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Mary has been given different treatment from that accorded
George P. Bush, the nephew of presidential nominee George W. Bush.
The GOP touts the sexy Latino appeal of ``P'' and revels in his
nomination by People magazine as one of America's hottest
bachelors. He's giving more interviews than Ricky Martin these
days.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mary Cheney told Time magazine in some of her few public
words to date on the subject, ``I love my father. I don't want to
be a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   That the GOP is determined she won't became clear when Lynne
Cheney was asked about her daughter being openly gay by ABC
newswoman Cokie Roberts on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cheney said her daughter is ``bright'' and ``hard-working''
and ``decent,'' and yes, she loves her. But, she said acidly, ``My
daughter has never declared such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from the religious right on this issue already has
surfaced. Jerry Falwell, in a newsletter issued before the
convention, used the word ``errant'' to describe Mary Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign's transformation of Mary Cheney into a
nonperson has so incensed gay activists that they held a news
conference Thursday, comparing Republicans' treatment of Mary to
Ross Perot's ``crazy aunt in the attic.'' Trot her out to the
window, so folks will know she's alive. But don't let them know
what is really going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are curious to get to know her. But it seems to be that
that has been shut down by the Bush campaign,'' said Elizabeth
Birch of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and
lesbian advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said Americans often are willing to accept ``this notion
of gay Americans working hard, being driven, being dynamic.'' But
they draw the line when they ``bring their partner to the company
picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All his daughter's presence does is shine a light'' on such
contradictions, said Birch.
</P>
<P>
   She said she knows and deeply respects Mary Cheney and has
worked with her in her role at Coors.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's someone any campaign would be proud of,'' she said.
``Mary was very open with me about her sexual orientation.'' But
she notes it is not Mary Cheney's obligation to talk about that in
public.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem, Birch said, is Bush and Dick Cheney, the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This highlights the fact that the American public does not
know with a great deal of precision what their positions are on gay
issues,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cheney is now officially a no-winner. She'll be criticized
by some gay activists as an Uncle Tom if she doesn't speak out.
She'll be lambasted by the Christian right if she does.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the tug-of-war has started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very strange, this state of denial,'' said Bob
Mulholland, campaign coordinator for the California Democratic
Party. ``It's like she's Charlie Manson ... and I feel terrible for
the daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Log Cabin Republicans member Frank Ricchiazzi, boasting how
far his gay and lesbian conservative group has come since the
``vicious'' 1992 GOP convention in Houston: ``Eight years later, we
have a Republican vice presidential nominee who has a gay
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something, indeed, about Mary.
</P>
<P>
   And that is: In election 2000, both sides will want a piece of
her.

PACIFIC-10 POLL HAS USC SECOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ USC finished second in Thursday's Pacific-10
Conference preseason poll, but the Trojans were talking about much
loftier goals regarding the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Rose Bowl is not our priority. Our focus is on a national-
championship bowl,'' linebacker Zeke Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to have a solid year and compete for the
championship,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``I'm very excited
about this team and I haven't said that about our other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Trojans live up to those statements, it's
clear they are an ornery group, after finishing 6-6 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an anger, but it's an anger we brought upon ourselves
because we weren't performing,'' Moreno said. ``Because we were the
problem, we are now the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans officially begin practicing Monday at UC Irvine,
although the freshmen reported to USC on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One change is that training camp will include many more wind
sprints than last summer, when strength coach Matt Schiotz decided
to have the Trojans run less because the team was in good shape.
Hackett is concerned about the humidity in New Jersey for the
Trojans' season-opener against Penn State, and wants to run more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have as difficult a training camp as we've
had,'' Hackett said. ``We'll run a lot. This is a very physical
Penn State team. Our camp will be designed to play for the Penn
State game.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting depth-chart questions addressed by
Hackett on Thursday was the third wide-receiver position. Sophomore
Steve Stevenson seemed the likely No. 3 receiver, but Hackett said
the position is wide open, with freshman Keary Colbert and senior
Matt Nickels also in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he had a great spring practice,'' Hackett said
of Stevenson. ``I think he did OK. I think he's a little
overwhelmed. He hasn't developed like (Kareem) Kelly and (Marcell)
Allmond. I may be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The tailback position will not be as crowded as expected, at
least initially. Incoming freshman tailback Chris Howard will not
participate in more than one practice a day at the outset, because
he is recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have (the knee) checked out,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard did practice with the other freshmen Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was impressed Thursday morning with freshman kicker John
Wall of Birmingham High in Van Nuys, and said the kicking position
will be wide open.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Among the walk-ons who arrived Thursday was freshman
punter Tommy Huff, a transfer from Michigan who will redshirt this
season. He is originally from Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Kareem Kelly, offensive lineman Zach Wilson and
linebacker Anthony Daye will all miss Monday's opening practice to
complete summer school. They are expected to be available Tuesday,
assuming they pass their classes.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman defensive tackle Sagan Atuatasi concludes his summer
work today, but his status will probably not be known until next
week.!dlim! &QL;

Give Rockets credit, as well as an arena
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   After six suspenseful months of negotiations, the Rockets and
the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority have reached an
agreement on a new arena, proving that, yes, we can all get along
if the price is right, or close to it. If we can keep religion out
of politics, and politics out of sports, and sports out of both,
what a wonderful world this would be.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is up to you, the fan, the taxpayer, the thoughtful
citizen, the good American, to have the final say on whether the
Rockets will move into their $175 million court of last resort. The
lease also provides for a possible future major-league hockey team,
owner unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Checking the city's temperature, we find there is clearly wider
support for the arena than existed in 1999, when a referendum was
voted down by a sobering margin of 10 percent. At least, there is
less organized opposition, although the wild card in this deck is
the expected large turnout in November for a presidential election,
with a ballot led by the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom _ no pun intended _ is suburban voters,
also known as Republicans, are less likely to vote for a sports
cathedral to be erected in downtown Houston. They will question the
cost, the effective use, the need, the long-term benefits and how
long the driving time is to get home.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, a lot of questions remain about the virtues of the
deal, and the critics do not consider ``it's none of your
business'' a responsive answer. This is not to single out
Republicans, but there is a reason the Rockets and their allies
have been romancing County Judge Bob Eckels, county tax boss Paul
Bettencourt and county Republican Party chairman Gary Polland.
Eckels was neutral during the last campaign; Paul and Gary _ may we
call you Paul and Gary? _ were prominent among the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   You hate to see the issue become a political football, partly
because no one wants to be accused of mixing a metaphor. But face
it, when was the last time you heard of anyone taking a Democrat to
lunch?
</P>
<P>
   The outcome might be decided by political loyalties or
obligations. By now, the arguments have been repeated enough that
there seems no need to restate them here.
</P>
<P>
   Is this agreement a better deal for the city than the last one?
From most accounts, it can't help but pass that test. Is it a
terrific deal for owner Leslie Alexander? But, of course. The
Rockets keep all the revenue from the luxury boxes and personal
seat licenses, and most of the revenue from concessions, signage,
advertising and naming rights. So do most teams.
</P>
<P>
   We can discard the threat of the Rockets moving to Louisville or
Las Vegas as a way of winning over the undecided voters. There is
always a chance the Rockets might get a deal they can't refuse from
an offshore island, but Louisville never had any interest in
building an arena with public money, and the NBA needs Las Vegas
like it needs another paternity suit.
</P>
<P>
   But there is what we consider a valid and even compelling reason
to provide the Rockets with a state-of-the-art facility. We did it
for the Astros and are building one for an NFL team that exists for
the moment in our imaginations. If Houston is going to play Sports
Stadium Bingo, how can we in good conscience deny equal footing for
the Rockets, who have weathered a lot of storms in 30 years and
gave us two NBA championships?
</P>
<P>
   Students of the process might find this a thin case to sway a
jury, but it happens to be the truest one. A new arena might
provide more momentum for the downtown renewal, and might attract
more concerts and ice shows and circuses, events better suited to
18,000 seats.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is all teams in all sports crave the new revenue
streams from luxury suites and VIP boxes and control of the master
lease. The vintage train that runs on an irregular schedule at
Enron Field is a gravy train, and the new football stadium is going
to be bigger, richer and smarter. The Rockets want theirs. We can't
spell it out any more clearly than this, and the only question left
isn't about economics or saving the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Do we give the Rockets the same advantages as
other members of the Planet Jock? I think so, and I am not one of
those protesters worried sick that we will run out of stadiums in a
few years. In the interest of full disclosure, I will remind those
who need reminding that I owned stock in the Rockets when they
moved from San Diego and played their first season in six
locations, including New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   That was a challenge, not a hardship, but the Rockets deserve
some credit for still being here.

BUSH SPEECH MAKES HIS CASE FOR CHANGE IN SPITE OF PROSPERITY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  PHILADELPHIA _ Bill Clinton campaigned for change in 1992 when
the economy was stagnant. Ronald Reagan called for change in 1980
when 52 Americans were being held hostage in Iran.
<P>
   Thursday night George W. Bush declared himself an agent of
change at a time when the economy is booming and the nation is at
peace.
</P>
<P>
   In an address that served as the nation's best introduction to
former President Bush's son, the Texas governor tried hard to keep
his boyish smirk in check as he offered his most detailed case yet
as to why eight years of Democratic control of the White House
should come to an end:
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of decency. It's a matter of vision. It's a matter
of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Bush hardly mentioned his opponent, Vice President Al Gore, by
name. And he never specifically referred to President Clinton's
draft avoidance, his extra-marital affairs, or his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But he made it clear that his candidacy would offer a sharp
break from what many view as the excesses of a pair of spoiled baby
boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred years from now, this must not be remembered as an
age rich in possession and poor in ideals,'' Bush said. ``Our
generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values. To show
we have grown up before we grow old.''
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans leave Philadelphia, ahead in the polls and
confident of victory, the shape of their upcoming campaign is
coming into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to saddle Democrats with a failed economy or a foreign
policy crisis, they will try to present themselves as a refreshing
alternative to the political swamp of attack dog politics, negative
campaigning, and poll-driven policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not need to take your pulse before I know my own mind. I
do not reinvent myself at every turn. I am not running in borrowed
clothes,'' Bush declared.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Clinton and Gore at the hip, Bush suggested that the
pair squandered this ``unique moment of history'' because of their
self-centered obsession with advancing their political careers.
</P>
<P>
   `` For me, gaining this office is not the ambition of a
lifetime, but it  &UR; is  &LR; the opportunity of a lifetime,'' Bush said.
``And I will make the most of it. I believe great decisions are
made with care, made with conviction, not made with polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton's impeachment and Gore's difficulties with
campaign-finance scandals went unmentioned, the issue of character
was implicit throughout Bush's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put my hand on the Bible,'' he said, reviving the most
popular line from his campaign stump speech, ``I will swear to not
only uphold the laws of our land, I will swear to uphold the honor
and the dignity of the office to which I have been elected, so help
me God.''
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental issues divide the Republicans from the Democrats _
tax cuts, social security, gun control, abortion, to name a few.
Bush touched on all of them last night, but spent little time
trying to convince Americans that gun control is unconstitutional
or that abortion is murder.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican faithful packed in the convention center would
have loved nothing better. But Bush geared his remarks to moderate
swing voters, who may have been watching at home.
</P>
<P>
   His message, reinforced on each of the convention's four nights,
is that Republicans care about minorities, immigrants, the poor,
the disadvantaged. This is no longer your Daddy's Republican Party.
Delegates danced to the music of the Delfonics, Harold Melvin &AMP; the
Blue Notes, and thrust their fists in the air when Mick Jagger
yowled ``Start Me Up'' on the arena's PA system after Bush's
address concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year and half after Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich,
Tom Delay, Dick Armey and other unabashed conservatives, impeached
President Clinton, Bush seemed to make certain that the party's
more strident wing was kept out of view.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked about his good friend Bob Bullock, a powerful force
in Texas politics for decades, and a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with Republicans and Democrats to get things done,''
Bush said before appealing to Longhorn pride in another jab at Gore
for his style of attack style politics. ``He worked by my side,
endorsed my re-election, and I know he is with me in spirit to
those who would malign our state for political gain. Don't mess
with Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, who seem to trust Bush's convictions as well as
his political instincts, showed no signs of rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This convention is designed for a party whose base is very,
very happy,'' Armey said. ``We can afford the luxury of reaching
out to middle land _ where Ronald Reagan did so well.''
</P>
<P>
   If they didn't get the forceful policy speech they were looking
for, the red meat crowd adored his attacks on the Clinton-Gore
political style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their war room is up and running,'' Bush said as he concluded
his remarks. ``Their attacks will be relentless. But they will be
answered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing something familiar,'' he asserted. ``But they
are facing something new.''

EX-WAVES PITCHER IMPRESSES ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There's no mistaking Matt Wise in the Anaheim
Angels clubhouse. He's the guy with the biggest smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   For good reason. the 25-year-old right-handed pitcher took his
first step into a bright future, making his major-league debut for
the Angels Wednesday. It was a debut that Wise, a native of La
Verne, Calif., and graduate of Bonita High School, will long
remember.
</P>
<P>
   In two innings of relief for Anaheim starter Ken Hill, Wise
threw 31 pitches. He struck out one, gave up one hit and walked no
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really have time to think about what I was doing out
there,'' Wise said after the game. ``I just wanted to throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise was brought up to the Angels from their Triple-A club in
Edmonton, Alberta. There, he compiled a 9-6 record with a 3.69 ERA
and two complete games in 19 starts for the Trappers.
</P>
<P>
   For now he will fill the roster spot left vacant when right-
hander Al Levine was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to
inflammation of the right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Wise said he got the callup from the Angels just as he was
preparing to take mound Tuesday. By 6:30 a.m. he was on a plane
home and arrived at the stadium around noon for the 1 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long day,'' Wise said. ``I'm so tired that all of
this hasn't really sunk in yet. I'm sure it will soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Wednesday wasn't Wise's first time on the mound for
the Angels. He took several trips to the hill for the club in
spring training. Manager Mike Scioscia had nothing but praise for
his young pitcher, who attended Pepperdine and Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   His performance certainly made it apparent that he's recovered
well from reconstructive elbow surgery and is ready to contribute.
If anything, his time in the minor leagues has only sharpened his
skills, Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt was everything that we saw in the spring,'' Scioscia
said. ``He made some adjustments which look like he's ready for the
challenge of the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   One the big assets Wise brings to the game is mastery of a
repertoire of pitches, Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed real good location with his fastball,'' Scioscia
said. ``He's got a nice, tight breaking ball and he mixed some good
changeups in there too. So I think he's got a good combo.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's not going to break any speed records, Wise's fastball
is decent. He was clocked at 91, 93 and 90 on successive pitches
during Wednesday's game. All three were faster than Hill's best,
which crossed the plate at 89.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to throw hard, while mixing up his pitch selection
to confuse batters, will help Wise earn a more-permanent spot on
the team's roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a guy who can mix up his pitches, it's going to
be exciting to see how he contributes,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   How long his current stay with the Angels will last is anyone's
guess. Wise is happy to be able to spend some time with his wife,
Amy. High school sweethearts, the two were married six months ago
and Wise has been on the road ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be nice to spend a day or two at home,'' Wise said.
``That's one thing I'm really looking forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Scioscia, he said that no matter what happens to Wise
this season, for now he's and Angel _ and a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep an eye on him,'' Scioscia said. ``Not only
now while he's up here _ but in the future, 'cause this guy is
certainly one of our young pitchers who we're looking to have in
the mix.''

 BUSH ISSUES CALL TO RID THE POLITICAL SLATE OF CLINTON AND GORE  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Portraying himself as a healer, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush issued a rousing call to clean the political slate Thursday
night, saying, ``We will seize this moment of American promise ...
we will use these good times for great goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, we can begin again,'' Bush told wildly
cheering delegates as he formally accepted the Republican party's
presidential nomination. ``This administration had their moment.
They have not led. We will.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 52-minute address that served as the defining moment of his
presidential bid, Bush argued his case as a Washington outsider
with character and conviction prepared to preside over a new era,
while dismissing the Clinton-Gore administration as a tired,
cynical vestige of old-style politics.
</P>
<P>
   Climaxing the four-day Republican National Convention, Bush's
tough talk fired up a GOP audience, starved for a winning
presidential candidate, and provoked a deafening ovation as
delegates in the First Union Center cheered, beat drums, blew
whistles and tossed their hats in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who had decried what he called the politics of
negativity from Vice President Al Gore _ and who had promised a
positive and upbeat campaign _ took off the gloves. He fired off a
battery of charges and insults at the current administration,
describing it as one of ``so much promise, to no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For eight years, the Clinton/Gore administration has coasted
through prosperity,'' he said to cheers. ``And the path of least
resistence is always downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear signal that the presidential campaign will be as much
about Clinton as Gore, Bush made the president a particular target
of his barbs. He had ``so many talents, so much charm, such great
skill,'' Bush said. ``But to what end?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of seizing the moment, the Clinton/Gore administration
has squandered it. We have seen a steady erosion of American power
and an unsteady exercise of American influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Without ever mentioning Gore's name, Bush belittled his
Democratic opponent as a narrow-minded thinker lacking political
vision, with ``the philosophy of the stop sign.''
</P>
<P>
   In a riff that brought the house down, Bush said, ``If my
opponent had been there at the moon launch, it would have been `a
risky rocket scheme.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he'd been there when the Internet was invented, well,''
he said, ``I understand he was actually there for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush then stapled Gore to Clinton, charging both with being
poll-watching politicians driven by ambition and lacking in
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not need to take your pulse before I know my own mind,''
Bush told the delegates. ``I do not reinvent myself at every turn.
I am not running on borrowed clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that he ``may lack the polish of Washington,''
but suggested that was not necessarily bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enemies to fight. And I have no stake in the
bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a chief executive who sets an agenda, sets big
goals, and rallies people to believe and achieve them,'' he said.
``Give me the opportunity to lead this nation and I will lead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also used the moment to address a central challenge of
his campaign _ why Americans should support a change of leadership
in strong economic times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times of plenty, like times of crisis, are tests of American
character,'' he said. ``Prosperity can be a tool in our hands ...
or it can be a drug in our system, dulling our sense of urgency, of
empathy, of duty,'' he said. ``Our opportunities are too great, our
lives too short, to waste this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The speech was very different from Bush's campaign stump speech,
which has changed little and served to outline his promise of
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Thursday night's effort laid out a broad political
philosophy and vision.
</P>
<P>
   Bush underscored his themes of inclusion and the need to expand
the GOP's big tent to include non-traditional constituencies,
saying his party must reach Americans who feel left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are their country, too,'' he said. ``And each of us must
share in its promise or that promise is diminished for all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now the party of ideas and innovation. ... The party of
idealism and inclusion. ... The party of a simple and powerful
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also addressed bread-and-butter issues of his campaign,
portraying himself as an agent of change who will reach across
party lines to seek reforms in areas such as Social Security and
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for Republicans and Democrats to end the
politics of fear and save Social Security, together,`` he said.
``Now is the time to make Head Start an early learning program,
teach all of our children to read, and renew the promise of
America's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He decried Americans schools that have relied on ``the soft
bigotry of low expectations,'' and argued that ``one size does not
fit all when it comes to education.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also called for tax relief, saying to cheers, ``the surplus
is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor pledged to provide the military with ``a means to
keep the peace ... and a commander-in-chief who respects our men
and women in uniform.'' He also made it clear that he would dump
the ``outmoded'' anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia and
build an anti-missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who unlike Gore did not serve in Vietnam, said ``a
generation shaped by Vietnam must remember the lessons of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also explored themes which, until recently, were
not often touched on by Republican leaders calling for fewer
government programs.
</P>
<P>
   He promised low-income Americans tax credits ``to buy the
private health insurance they need and deserve,'' and a ``next bold
step of welfare reform'' which would ``support the heroic work of
homeless shelters and hospices, foot pantries and pregnancy crisis
centers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in one of the more poignant moments of his speech, Bush
told delegates that America is endangered by the growing division
between the rich and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one side are wealth and technology, education and ambition.
On the other side of the wall are poverty and prison, addiction and
despair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fellow Americans, we must tear down that wall,'' Bush said,
pointedly echoing President Reagan's famous call about the Berlin
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also dealt directly with one of the potentially sensitive
issues of his campaign, abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will lead our nation toward a culture that values life _ the
life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young, and the
life of the unborn,'' he said to one of the night's biggest bursts
of applause. ``Good people can disagree on this issue ... (but)
when Congress sends me a bill against partial birth abortion, I
will sign it into law.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening was punctuated by touching, and skillful, video
presentations aimed at introducing voters to the man behind the
nomination. The videos showed him at home, usually in warm,
humorous situations _ even including commercial outtakes _ touching
on his childhood, his courtship of his wife, Laura, his down-home
Texas roots and his closeness to family.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took the stage, thanking his father, former President Bush,
his mother, Barbara, and his wife and family.
</P>
<P>
   But he also had kind words for Sen. John McCain, whom he said
provided ``a touching tribute to America.''

   KY-SCHOOL-RAMPAGE (West Paducah, Ky.) _ After their lives were
changed by a 14-year-old killer, the parents of three girls who
were gunned down in a school shooting here sued more than 50 people
they said shared responsibility for the deaths. They sued the
killer and his parents, teachers, school officials, other
teen-agers, neighbors, and the makers of violent videogames, Web
sites and movies. But, after a string of recent legal defeats in
which two judges have dismissed virtually all of the claims, there
will be just one defendant remaining: the killer himself, Michael
Carneal. He is the only one the courts have said can be held liable
for the deaths. The story of the lawsuits shows how difficult it is
to assign blame to the many people who, in retrospect, might have
been able to prevent rampage killings, and it shows how hard it is
to unravel what really happened in cases that are, by definition,
unfathomable. By William Glaberson.

   NY-SCHOOLS-RACE (Undated) _ The town of Nyack, N.Y., has

achievement by race. But its experience provides a cautionary tale.
The release of the numbers divided what had been seen as a diverse
and tolerant community in a way most people thought nothing ever
could. Some black parents decried how schools were segregating and
shortchanging their kids while white parents defended the schools,
pointing the finger at what they called neglect in black families.
Many affluent black parents decried the statistics themselves for

   MOVIE-SOUNDTRACKS (Undated) _ New movies come in on waves of
hype and anticipation, followed, if they're lucky, by swelling word
of mouth. When the waves recede, they leave behind something
tangible: soundtrack albums. If summer is a prime time for movie
releases, it's also a good time to look back over recent albums,
some of which are better than the movies themselves. By Jon
Pareles.
</P>
<P>
   NY-DANCING (New York) _ It is summer in New York, this year a
season that jumps from muggy heat to damp chill without warning.
There is relatively little dance in pleasantly climate-controlled
theaters. So what do those mad creatures called dancers do? Forget
about vacations or more trips to the office-temp center. Dancers
dance. So they are taking to the city's parks, rooftops, gardens
and empty buildings over the next four weeks in a surge of activity
that truly offers something for just about everyone. By Jennifer
Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE-RENAISSANCE (Undated) _ The presence of what might be
called the eternal modern can be felt in certain great examples of
African, Egyptian and early Greek art and different kinds of Asian
art. Right now this presence hovers like a beautiful mist over
``The Arts of Hon'ami Koetsu, Japanese Renaissance Master'' at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, which pays homage to a late
16th-century artist who has become known as ``the Leonardo da Vinci
of Japanese art.'' By Roberta Smith.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA received an oral commitment late Tuesday
night from Collin Barker, considered one of the best of a bumper
crop of Texas offensive linemen in the class of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8, 305-pound Barker, from Wortham, Texas, made an
unofficial visit to UCLA last week and also took unofficial trips
to Notre Dame and Michigan. He also considered Ohio State, Georgia
and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Barker is the eighth player to commit to UCLA and the third
linemen, joining 6-foot-7, 275-pound Bob Cleary of Temescal Canyon
and 6-foot-8, 320-pound Ed Blanton of Napa.

 INSTANT APPLAUSE METER ON THE WEB  &HT;     By VLAE KERSHNER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time George W. Bush finished taking his applause last
night, the political community already knew how his speech played
with Web watchers _ pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   The instantaneous feedback came from  &UR; www.speakout.com  &LR; in
cooperation with MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The SpeakOut Web page displays a dial with a scale of 1 to 100,
initially set at a neutral level of 50. Users move the dial to the
right to register a higher number when they agree with the speaker
and move it to the left when they disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The scores are not a scientific sample of all voters, but they
are adjusted so that the gender and party affiliation of the users
match those of the voting public.
</P>
<P>
   Bush scored a 55. That's favorable, but not up with the
highest-ranked speech of the convention, John McCain's 62. Dick
Cheney's score was unavailable _ there was a network failure
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got particularly high scores when he talked about restoring
character to the White House and fostering an era of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The scores also went up when he talked about education and when
he said welfare reform should include support for homeless shelters
and food pantries.
</P>
<P>
   His lowest scores came when he attacked the Clinton-Gore
administration, mostly because Democrats didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, there was no gender gap _ women may not have
voted for Bush's father in 1992, but they liked the son's speech
exactly as well as men did.
</P>
<P>
   I spent the first half of the speech with MSNBC, then logged on
to  &UR; www.voter.com,  &LR; which has, theoretically, a great format.
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com allows users to watch a speech, see how it is rated by
selected groups of voters and delegates, and participate in a chat,
all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush vowed to support the rights of the unborn, that was
red meat to the delegates. But his ranking with voters went down,
although there was no way of telling how far, because the scale
wasn't lined up properly with the bars on the chart.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DISABILITY COVERAGE: &LR;  One good thing about the Web is that it
allows targeted coverage to specific groups. At this year's
conventions,  &UR; www.wemedia.com  &LR; is offering news for the disabled.
Among the articles: a story about Heather Whitestone McCallum, the
first hearing-impaired Miss America, who introduced the Laura Bush
video tribute last night; and interviews with both Hillary Rodham
Clinton and her opponent in the U.S. Senate race in New York, Rick
Lazio, both of whom have a strong interest in disability issues.

 FORMER PRIEST FINDS JAIL IS HELL  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ He is charged with being a serial child molester
and an embezzler supreme, but he is uncomfortable in jail and wants
you to help spring him.
<P>
   Brother, can you spare a house?
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Shea, the former Catholic monsignor, 16 years at two
parishes in San Francisco, is being held in isolation at the County
Jail on $5 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with 224 counts of child molestation.
</P>
<P>
   It might be six more months before he goes to trial, and O'Shea
finds jail, you know, confining. Especially when compared to the
vacation house he bought with, according to a lawsuit, $250,000 in
church funds he ripped off over the years.
</P>
<P>
   That's not counting the $2.5 mil that he and some other priests
cost the church in a '96 settlement with 15 molestation victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assure you that no one knows what prison is like until one
experiences it,'' O'Shea says in an appeal letter to some old
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The former priest blames his high bail on the D.A.'s political
shenanigans. O'Shea asks that friends put up their house(s) as
collateral to help him make bail. He wouldn't ask ``unless I felt
it so important to my sanity that I get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder how much cash ``friends'' could raise by pawning the
world's smallest violin?
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU'RE GOIN' to San Francisco, be sure to put some padlocks
on your flowers. (Apologies to Scott McKenzie.)
</P>
<P>
   In a series of daring predawn raids, thieves are digging up and
carting off flowers from Cayuga Park and other city parks.
Apparently, the flowers are then sold at the Flower Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrangeas have a street value of $3 per stem.
</P>
<P>
   Cops and park officials are on the case. So if you stop to smell
the roses, you'd better not be carrying a shovel.
</P>
<P>
   STEVE YOUNG, Republican.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bitter pill for many Bay Area liberals who held out
hope for Young, who had never really announced before. He dressed
casual, lived cheap, showed a lot of outwardly liberal-leaning
signs.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe Steve really is a Democrat and is at the Republican
convention only because he's a compassionate liberal and figures
the GOP needs his prayers.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a bit sad down the road, though, when Steve runs for
president and can't carry 49er country.
</P>
<P>
   THE AVERAGE Los Angeles driver burns 390 gallons of gas per
year, according to one study. The average San Francisco driver goes
through 520 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 49-square-mile patch of paradise is more fuel-intensive
than the sprawl that calls itself L.A.?'' asks Gar Smith. ``How
could this be? My only theory is that S.F. drivers spend more time
endlessly circling the blocks looking for parking spots.''
</P>
<P>
   NO PROBLEM, says the Hearst Corp., nobody will lose jobs over
the merger with The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fangs, new owners of the Ex, have said they intend to
service only San Francisco and maybe San Mateo County. So out in
the 'burbs and the countryside, hundreds of independent Examiner
dealers and carriers quietly sweat it out.
</P>
<P>
   WONDER BREAD builds mayoral war chests millions of ways.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco jury has called for a huge judgment against the
maker of Wonder Bread, on behalf of plaintiffs who charged
systematic racial discrimination in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney fees, when collected, will be huge. The attorney is
Angela Alioto, who has been hinting she plans to run for San
Francisco mayor next time around  &UR; if  &LR; she can raise enough of her
own money that she doesn't have to sell her soul to campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The Wonder Bread dough should vault Alioto into the race.
</P>
<P>
   She'll campaign as the Anti-Machine mayoral candidate, and her
star looks even brighter when you consider that she's winning huge
court judgments against corporate America, on behalf of the
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   KIDS CAN'T sing in booze joints, at least not in California.
</P>
<P>
   So several scheduled concerts of 14-year-old country music
phenom Kristen McNamara have been canceled, at places like
Sweetwater in Mill Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' Kristen told her people. ``Let's just raise some
money for charity.''
</P>
<P>
   So she's planning at least one benefit concert at the Palace of
Fine Arts, sometime in late September. Proceeds to the Little Jim
Club of California Pacific Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   They help babies. Now a babe helps them.
</P>
<P>
   HOOKERS and their advocates want San Francisco to decriminalize
prostitution, saying that would decrease violence against sex
workers.
</P>
<P>
   They claim that under decriminalization, cops would be more
sympathetic to hookers who are beaten and raped.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning seems faulty. If cops are ignoring real and
violent crimes, against hookers or anyone, the problem isn't the
legal status of the profession, it's the cops.
</P>
<P>
   And what's with this ``sex workers'' stuff? Is that kind of
sugar-coating appropriate here? It's like calling drug dealers
``pharmaceutical marketers.''
</P>
<P>
   If the hookers can't get help from the Board of Supervisors,
maybe they can call on OSHA.
</P>
<P>
   MAILBAG: ``What you gotta do is keep an eye out for a deal like
the Fangs got! I'll even go partners with you.'' (Signed, R.B.)
(Note: The Fang family bought the Examiner for $100 and will be
given as much as $66 million in subsidies.)
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, R.B., my tax attorneys say I can't afford to receive that
much free money. Besides, Willie doesn't fancy my horse.

KONA GOLD SPRINTS TO MILLIONAIRE STATUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Bruce Headley has been associated with the fastest of the fast
since his beginnings in the racing business.
</P>
<P>
   There were the quarterhorses Headley, then a teenager, rode in
dashes at Devonshire Downs (where the Cal State Northridge football
stadium stands now). There was Berseem, the national-champion
thoroughbred sprinter of 1955, whom Headley exercised for trainer
Reggie Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems there has scarcely been a major sprint in Southern
California in the past decade in which Headley didn't saddle a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is always exciting, whether in horses, in people, or in
pill form,'' Headley said on the phone from Del Mar. He added with
an almost audible grin: ``You can quote me on that. It'll spice up
the article.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful the 66-year-old trainer has ever been around a
sprinter as speedy and effective as Kona Gold.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old gelding produced the highlight of Del Mar's
opening week when he and jockey Alex Solis won the Bing Crosby
Handicap on Saturday by three-quarters of a length over Love That
Red.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was significant for three reasons: It kept him
undefeated in four starts at Del Mar, where he'll likely start next
in the Aug. 20 Pat O'Brien. It raised his earnings to seven figures
at $1,103,684, quite an accomplishment for a horse who never goes
in longer, richer races. And it confirmed that he is the nation's
top-ranked sprinter and _ at this early date _ California's best
hope for winning a Breeders' Cup race Nov. 4 at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold has been closing in on a Breeders' Cup Sprint victory
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 he finished third in the Breeders' Cup Sprint at
Churchill, two lengths behind winner Reraise. In 1999 he suffered a
frustrating loss in the Sprint at Gulfstream Park after having only
a single prep race following a spring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold was slow out of the starting gate in the last
Breeders' Cup because the soil broke out from beneath his hind
feet. Four lengths behind the leader one-quarter mile into the
three-quarter-mile race, he made up all but half a length and
finished second to Artax.
</P>
<P>
   Artax earned some Horse of the Year votes from those who
overlooked the fact Kona Gold might have been better in the biggest
sprint of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very gratifying to run second, even if there was some
bad luck,'' Headley said.
</P>
<P>
   Headley points out that as a one-third partner in the horse's
ownership with Irwin and Andrew Molasky, he enjoyed a healthy taste
of the $200,000 second-place purse for the 1999 Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   But Headley has more than a typical trainer's and owner's
connection with Kona Gold. He paid $30,000 for the son of Java Gold
after picking him out of a Keeneland auction. He developed him
nearly from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked very fast. This horse just looked good as a
sprinter, so I had to buy him,'' Headley said. ``Some of them slip
through the cracks. All of these (richer owners) are looking for
distance horses, for Kentucky Derby horses. I'm looking for the
ones the big boys overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Java Gold has had another (good) horse. This is
a freak of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold is both brilliant and consistent.
</P>
<P>
   The 119 Beyer speed figure he earned with his 1:08 2/5 clocking
in the Bing Crosby, on top of the 118 he received for winning Santa
Anita's Potrero Grande in 1:14 3/5 for 6 furlongs in April, give
him two of the four highest ratings in North America this year.
</P>
<P>
   He has won 7 of 15 starts, finished 1-2-3 in all but one, and
hasn't been worse than second since that first Breeders' Cup try,
nine races and 22 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold doesn't race often. That and a low-key personality
have kept the gelding going, Headley believes.
</P>
<P>
   Headley, born in Baldwin Park, first went to the track because
an uncle was a Santa Anita security guard. He broke in as a rider
at Suzy Q Ranch in La Puente in 1949. Bill Shoemaker was starting
out at the same place at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Headley took out his trainer's license a decade later and won
major races with Variety Road and Bertrando before Kona Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one, from the beginning, is an extraordinary
experience,'' he said. ``But I think it keeps getting better. When
you pick 'em out, break them and train them, that's the hard thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Never mind: Gary Stevens told reporters he has decided not to
attempt a comeback, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame jockey, who retired at age 37 last Dec. 26
because of arthritis in his right knee, had been testing the leg by
working horses in recent weeks. On July 26 Stevens sounded
optimistic about a return to riding. But this week he said he
hadn't assured himself the knee would hold up.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: The San Diego Handicap, Del Mar's major prep for
the Aug. 26 Pacific Classic, is expected to match River Keen, Hal's
Pal, Prime Timber, National Saint and Skimming against Florida
shipper Forty One Carats.

   L.A.-area harness racing fans got bad news when the California
Horse Racing Board approved a 2001 schedule under which Los
Alamitos will conduct a virtually year-round quarterhorse meet.
Harness racing will be confined to Cal Expo in Sacramento. The
change is the fallout of a dispute over simulcast fees between the
California Harness Horsemen's Association and Los Al owner Ed
Allred. . . .

   Alex Hassinger resigned as trainer for Saudi Prince Ahmed
Salman's Thoroughbred Corp. after the ownership group moved some
horses to other barns. The new trainers include John Shirreffs, who
trained for 505 Farms until the death of owner Marshall Naify
prompted a dispersal of those horses. Shirreffs, though, will keep
some of his old horses under their new owners, including David
Copperfield and Cliquot, both purchased by a Salman group.
Hassinger, 37, recorded only seven wins from 69 starters in 2000. .

MARINERS FACING CRUCIAL ROAD TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the things about being the two American League
teams farthest to the west and north is that Oakland and Seattle
frequently get paired together.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago at this time, the Mariners played the Rangers and
Angels while the A's played the Angels and Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is happening this week, although the stakes are
getting higher.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle plays the AL East-leading New York Yankees on the road
for four consecutive games starting Friday, while the A's are
playing at the AL Central-leading Chicago White Sox three times.
</P>
<P>
   Then, starting Tuesday, the Mariners head to Chicago and the A's
head to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is in first place in the West. Oakland, riding a
five-game winning streak, is two games back. The A's would be the
wild-card entrant from the AL if the current standings hold.
</P>
<P>
   That makes this next week huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a key part of the schedule,'' Mariners manager Lou
Piniella said. ``We'll be trading off teams. We're both going to
parks where it's going to be tough to win. It's going to be
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland manager Art Howe shares those sentiments. His team has
been able to make up one game in the standings on the Mariners
since the All-Star break. A's play just six games on this trip,
while the Mariners _ thanks to the makeup of a rained-out April
game in Chicago _ play eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big trip,'' Howe said. ``We're playing two
first-place clubs. In a way, we'll see how we measure up. But
either way, I feel good about our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to be playing this well at this point. That's
what's most important. We know we can play with anybody. We just
have to go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, do the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was the team's first day off after having played 21
games in 21 days after the All-Star break. It wasn't much of a day
off, given that storms in the New York area forced the Mariners'
charter to divert to Pittsburgh for four hours. It wasn't much of a
day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Mariners have four against the Yankees, four against
the White Sox and a total of 14 games in the next 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little tired, that's no secret,'' shortstop Alex
Rodriguez said Wednesday. ``The day off is important. But the games
just keep getting bigger for us. New York is always a tough place
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are just 2-9 in Yankee Stadium over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked playing there,'' said designated hitter
Edgar Martinez, who was born in New York, although he grew in
Puerto Rico. ``The fans are always into it; they know what's going
on. It's been a tough place for us to play, but it's a good-hitting
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to play the Yankees there.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning would be more fun still.

``I'm the only coach in the history of the school to turn the
program around !ital!twice. I turned it around the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which goes to show that gallows humor takes many forms,
and sometimes it's actually humorous.
</P>
<P>
   The head coaches who appeared for Pacific-10 Football Media Day
at a Los Angeles airport hotel might as well have been handed
blindfolds and cigarettes along with the microphone Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely have so many Pac-10 coaches begun preseason practice with
their jobs on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Tyrone Willingham is safe, meaning he could survive a
losing season, after coaching the Cardinal to the conference
championship in 1999. Oregon's Mike Bellotti should be all right,
having put up five consecutive winning records. Washington's Rick
Neuheisel and Oregon State's Dennis Erickson have the cushion of
big-time reputations, although each has a penchant for controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo might be a year away from the hard questions.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else _ half the Pac _ is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Price is in trouble with Washington State's new president and
athletic director if he can't improve on back-to-back 10th-place
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Holmoe is in trouble if he drops a fourth straight losing
season on the Cal faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Tomey is in trouble at Arizona if he can't improve on
``probably the worst job of coaching I've done since I've been
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder is in trouble at Arizona State if he can't bridge
the gap between what he calls ``the top teams and the . . .
not-the-top teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is in trouble if USC doesn't improve _ by a lot _ on the
sixth-place finish that marked its worst in the Pac-10 since Larry
Smith sank to eighth in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   To ease his mind, or weigh on it, USC has been picked a close
second in the Pac-10 behind Washington in a media poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure? I didn't come back to USC to sit back in Manhattan
Beach and look at the sunset,'' said Hackett, whose season will
kick off early when USC faces Penn State on Aug. 27 in the Kickoff
Classic in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   At least this season he has company in other Pac-10 coaches. And
rightfully so after the conference's performance in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Pac-10 lost 18 nonconference games to equal the most
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Pac-10 didn't have a team ranked higher than No. 19
(Oregon) in the final Associated Press poll for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Pac-10 didn't place a player in the top 10 of Heisman
Trophy voting for the first time since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As strangely quiet as the offseason has been, without a Pac-10
coaching change for the first time since 1993, this season could be
a bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me the secret to withstanding the pressure is
adopting the proper attitude. You can be a defiant one like
Hackett, sticking your chin out at your critics. You can be an
optimist like Price, still smiling after a last-place finish, or a
pessimist like Willingham, on edge after a Rose Bowl trip.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you a good story,'' he said. ``My first year at
Weber State, the school was coming off a 3-8 season and had a new
president, and we opened against Long Beach State, back when they
had a football program. We took a bus all the way from Ogden, Utah,
to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played terrible. The new president wasn't pleased with the
performance and he mentioned that to some of the assistant coaches
during the game. Our coaches were doing their resume writing in the
back of the bus going home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proceded to win our next 10 games. The athletic director
quit and they gave me an extended contract and made me athletic
director as well as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's always darkest before the dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   A check of the record shows Weber State went 7-4 in 1981,
Price's first season as head coach. But if Price remembers going
10-1, well, that's the power of positive thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, here's Willingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``My principle is that my job is on the line every day,'' he
said. ``When is a coach's job !ital!not on the line?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, the Hackett attitude is the manliest, and the
Price approach sounds nicest. But Willingham's is the most
practical. If you're always paranoid, you're always prepared.
</P>

   (Undated) - Polygamist church leaders in Colorado City have
ordered their nearly 8,000 followers to cut all ties with the
town's public schools and to teach their children at home, leaving
the Arizona-Utah border community's school year in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Deloy Bateman, a high school science teacher, said Thursday that
a majority of his fellow teachers already have resigned following
the pronouncement by Warren Jeffs, head of the Fundamentalist
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. School is scheduled to
begin Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 students attend public school in Colorado City, and
an additional 300 attend another public school in neighboring
Hildale, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced late last month, was the latest by church
leaders to further isolate the remote, secretive community, where
some men have up to 15 wives. At various times in recent years,
church members have been ordered to rid themselves of televisions
and other possessions and prepare for the end times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still deciding whether to continue teaching,'' said
Bateman, who left the church three years ago and has taught at the
high school for 17 years. ``Even if the school stays open, the
religious leadership will likely turn up the psychological pressure
on all others to leave town.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mohave County officials in Kingman are trying to sort
out the implications of having a town where the majority of
students are schooled at home.
</P>
<P>
   County Superintendent Mike File said he was told by school
officials in Colorado City that at least 500 students will not be
enrolling for the upcoming semester and that the elementary and
middle schools will be consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   File said the school district would lose about $3million in
funding if 500 students left. That, plus the difficulty in
attracting teachers to the polygamist community, would threaten the
viability of the remaining schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to provide public schooling if there is one child or
1,000,'' File said. ``This is a tough thing to accept because it's
one thing if it's the people's choice but quite another if they are
being told to do it (for religious acceptance).''
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado City Mayor Dan Barlow said the public schools will
continue and that he doesn't anticipate problems in hiring
competent teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly isn't a rash or unsought move,'' Barlow said.
``This school system has been losing students every year to home
schools because of the confidence which has been lost in the public
school system.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlow said that six private schools have begun operation in the
Colorado City area during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   But File said that he knew of only one private school of 30
students in the area and that it's located in a nearby breakaway
community of polygamists who are bitter rivals of the sect headed
by Jeffs.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman, the science teacher, said the private schools Barlow
referred to are basically home schools with church ties and a
curriculum decided by Jeffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will home-school them at least through grade school. But
the high school kids will just be out on their own,'' Bateman said.
``Half of them didn't even finish when they went to the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Bateman also said the church's decision to forgo public
education was just the latest chapter in the antipathy between the
polygamist sects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of problems between the kids from the rival
church camps during the last school year,'' he said. ``It wasn't
like inner-city gang problems with violence, but it was enough to
make the group in Colorado City go its own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bistline, a longtime Colorado City resident and former
member of the church, said he was puzzled why Jeffs would abandon a
public school system that already was under his followers' control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been talking around here for two years about this date
or that date being the time when the true believers would be swept
up into heaven,'' Bistline said. ``I guess they figure now that
they have to get rid of all the apostates before they can cleanse
themselves to go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado City, formerly known as Short Creek, was settled by
polygamists who broke away from the Mormon Church after the church
banned the practice of multiple marriages when Utah became a state.
Polygamy is against the law in both Arizona and Utah.

 &HT;    Here's how to make 'Survivor' a show that's really worth
watching
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I watched ``Survivor'' the other night and when it was over I
danced around the den waving my arms, yelling, ``We're gonna be
rich! I just won a million dollars!''
</P>
<P>
   That's when my wife coolly informed me that you don't win the
money for just surviving watching the TV show. You have to be on
the island.
</P>
<P>
   What? You call that difficult? Heck, that looks like some fun.
Lie around on the beach all day, play a couple of games, go
fishing, soak in some rays, build a sandcastle....
</P>
<P>
   But watching the show is another matter. There are no telling
how many of my brain cells took a dive while I was watching that
mindless drivel. I figure they just simply surrendered. When I
experimented with ``Three's Company'' and the ``Dukes of Hazzard''
back in my wild days I rendered some of my gray matter useless, but
it was nothing like an hour spent with ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this show is popular beyond all belief. Popular and, yet, so
completely fake. These people might not be eating quite like they
want but otherwise, they are in no danger of anything but boredom
and sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   I say if you're going to do it, make it a real test. Let's
release a two or three dozen grizzly bears on that island, then
we'll see some fun, by golly. I'd settle for a pride of lions or
even 50 hungry wolves for that matter. Maybe a hundred or so cobras
would do the trick. Better yet, just stick them all on there. At
least that would justify the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   It would also justify the winning of $1 million. As it turns
out, teat honor or achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they ought to do something that proves those staying
are better at something that matters than those getting kicked off.
Have a fishing tournament, or make them build the best hut, or
manufacture anti-venom for all those darn cobras.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a good reason ``Survivor'' isn't very tough.
All the people who are responsible for producing the show have to
live out there also. The contestants don't have to worrying about
contending with a few million killer bees or a sudden influx of
man-eating alligators because these Hollywood types aren't about to
get that ``real.''
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, though this is called ``reality'' television, I
didn't see much of anything that was real. Fortunately, they didn't
show the nut who decided to walk around nude on his birthday (where
did they get these losers?).
</P>
<P>
   If real is what you are looking for, but surviving is still your
game, try putting these folks, say, in a public housing project in
one of those big cities for three months. There's no need to find
some island in the South Pacific, just give them a rental car and
let them drive around Miami. For that matter, there are places in
East Texas where these people would have trouble surviving just
because of their northern accents.
</P>
<P>
   Want to try survival? Put them in high school two-a-days next
week. Oh, yeah. Now there's something that would be worth watching.

 &HT;    A double scoop of news
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In all the years I toiled in the newspaper business I
never won a Pulitzer Prize, or any of the other big honors awarded
for outstanding journalistic feats.
</P>
<P>
   I don't argue with that, but in all modesty I had a couple of
``scoops'' I think deserved honorable mention. For anyone who
doesn't know, a ``scoop'' is when a reporter digs up a significant
story before anyone else. For example, if Chelsea Clinton decided
to marry one of the Bush grandsons and I found out about it and was
the first to get the story into print, I'd have myself a scoop.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, most scoops, along with two-headed crocodiles and
such, show up in newspapers sold at grocery counters. I'm not sure
why a scoop is called a scoop. Perhaps it has to do with small
shovels little old ladies carry when they walk their poodles.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters get most of their scoops from tips passed on by
friendly sources. Both of mine came that way. About 40 years ago, I
was visiting with Tom Nugent, the head football coach at the
University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tip you off to the best quarterback in America,'' Tom
said. ``He's a kid from Beaver Falls, Pa. We recruited him for
Maryland but he failed his entrance exams, much to our
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Reid, a former UGA player and one of Nugent's assistants,
telephoned Johnny Griffith, the head coach at Georgia. Bernie told
Johnny that judging from UGA journalism graduates of his
acquaintance, the young man should be able to enroll in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith agreed. He asked UGA's president, O.C. Aderhold, for
permission. Dr. Aderhold said no. ``If he can't qualify at
Maryland, we'd look pretty bad admitting him at Georgia,'' was his
sensible academic answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he's just enrolled with Bear Bryant at Alabama,'' Nugent
said. ``You watch. He's going to be the best quarterback in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you be so sure?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Beaver Falls to sign him to a scholarship,'' Nugent
answered. ``I took him out to dinner. High school signees being
entertained by their future coach normally order milk, iced tea or
a large Coke to go with the steak. When the waitress asked this kid
what he would like to drink, he ordered a double bourbon.''
</P>
<P>
   When I wrote that story it was the first time, as far as I know,
that anyone outside of Beaver Falls, Pa., had heard of Joe Namath.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to speculate how the history of UGA and
Southern football might read if Dr. Aderhold had said yes.
</P>
<P>
   The tip that led to my other scoop was passed along by Dr.
George Patton, then practicing veterinary medicine in College Park,
Ga., later famous as a master gardener and a county commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   George told me about a fish dog. I had heard of bird dogs, sheep
dogs and rabbit dogs, but I had never heard of a fish dog. George
explained that Hokey Jackson, a former UGA baseball player then
coaching in South Georgia, had a dog that rode in front of a boat,
pointing bream, both beds and singles, just like bird dogs locate
quail in piney woods.
</P>
<P>
   Being acquainted with Hokey, I was wary. But after making
telephone calls to sources in his part of the state, I was pretty
well convinced that he really did have a fish dog.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote the story. The newspaper artist did a drawing of Hokey
casting from the back of a boat with the fish dog in the bow,
frozen on a classic point: tail high, left foot lifted off the
deck. As far as I know, that was the first nnted bream. She sent
pictures. Being as she was the wife of one of the doctors who
treated the ``Three Faces of Eve'' patient at University Hospital,
I figured I was off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   I don't question Dr. Patton's latest dog story. I had noticed
the absence of usual summer gifts from his garden. I attributed the
missing care packages to the drought, until his neighbor, Phyllis
Webb, passed on the real answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Patton's dog is eating his tomatoes and corn, even digging
up carrots and eating them,'' she confided. George confirmed that
Japanese beetles, deer and raccoons have receded into minor
problems now that his golden retriever with an appetite for fresh
vegetables is ravaging the crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake is especially fond of corn on the cob,'' he said. ``I'm
trying to train him to just eat the nubbins and leave the best ears
for us.'' Good luck, George. For the gardening classes, if it's not
one thing it's another.

 &HT;    Lone Star politics 101
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Non-Texans need to understand the importance of
Jan Bullock's introduction of George W. Bush at Thursday night's
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the people in Kansas and Arkansas felt the same way
about the 1996 convention coverage when Bob Dole and Bill Clinton
accepted their party's nominations. I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparent, however, that a lot of this year's national
coverage of the GOP convention in Philadelphia has failed to
understand Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly
gay Republican member of the House, spoke about international
trade, the television networks kept showing clips of several
members of the Texas delegation bowing their heads in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of this, according to the TV commentators, was that
Bush's message of inclusiveness was phony since his own delegates
were showing their aversion to Kolbe's sexual orientation, or at
least to his prominence on the program.
</P>
<P>
   I have no doubt that those delegates were demonstrating their
dislike of both Kolbe's sexual orientation and the fact that Bush
included him as one of the convention's presenters.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING HEADS DON'T KNOW TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   What non-Texans don't understand, which includes the television
producers and talking heads who kept showing this clip, is that
Bush and his mainstream Republican supporters have been engaged in
a prolonged battle with a well-organized group of doctrinaire
religious fundamentalists who have attempted to run state
government and the state GOP party according to their narrow
dictates.
</P>
<P>
   This Texas group is not unlike a group of Republicans in Kansas
that gained a majority on the Kansas Board of Education. The Kansas
group embarrassed the Republican governor and most Kansans by
removing evolution from the state's science standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his supporters have had similar battles in Texas with
religious-right Republicans attempting to impose their beliefs on
public education.
</P>
<P>
   More than just education, these Republicans have attempted to
gain control of the GOP's reins of power by organizing on the
precinct level and backing stealth candidates who play down their
religious agenda. Bush is the enemy to this branch of Lone Star
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't even bother attending the Texas Republican
convention this year. He wants to stick with his message of
reaching out and inclusiveness. Fighting with a group of people who
want to make the party more exclusive would not be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt these ``Bush delegates'' didn't like Jan Bullock, the
widow of Texas Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, introducing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a life-long Republican, and Bullock, a life- long
Democrat, forged a partnership where they put aside their party
differences when they were conducting state business. Bullock's
power was such that he could have killed any legislation Bush
supported. Instead, the two men decided to do what was best for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock even supported Bush for his second term as governor. He
said Bush was better for Texas than his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won 70 percent of the vote in his second run for governor.
He picked up votes from independents and Democrats. He also nearly
doubled Hispanic and African American votes compared to his first
race. He carried all 254 Texas counties except 14. All top
statewide elected offices were filled by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats ruled Texas, that party's main- stream constantly
feuded with a group of liberal Democrats who kept trying to take
power. Now mainstream Texas Republicans feud with their group of
nettlesome insiders.

   MINTER-COLUMN _ FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ ATLANTA _ In all the years
I toiled in the newspaper business I never won a Pulitzer Prize, or
any of the other big honors awarded for outstanding journalistic
feats. I don't argue with that, but in all modesty I had a couple
of ``scoops'' I think deserved honorable mention. For anyone who
doesn't know, a ``scoop'' is when a reporter digs up a significant
story before anyone else. For example, if Chelsea Clinton decided
to marry one of the Bush grandsons and I found out about it and was
the first to get the story into print, I'd have myself a scoop.(Jim

place where the world had gone to war. He gave four years because
he was asked, and because it was his way to honor obligation. She
waited four years because he was handsome and kind and funny.
Theirs is the story of a generation. It is as familiar as the dust
mice that live under the refrigerator at home, and as remarkable as
buried treasure. And now it has become the marketing tool of a

 &HT;    New book opens world of doormaking
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Building a door _ a front entry door, not a cabinet
door _ is something I've thought about, but never even got close to
doing.
</P>
<P>
   However, the arrival of a new book from Sterling, ``Doormaking:
A Do-It-Yourself Guide,'' by John Birchard, may get me going again.
This $20 softbound book is written by a California doormaker, so
most of the designs are inventive and informal, but the main value
of the book is the general information on building a door that will
last.
</P>
<P>
   There is a detailed discussion of how to work the design around
conditions, such as the amount of exposure the door has to the
elements and the direction in which it faces, and the best ways of
installing doors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful parts of the book is the discussion of
finishing and maintenance. The finishing of wood exposed to sun and
weather has always been a problem for me, and Birchard makes it
abundantly clear that it's a problem for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does define the options and their consequences, and
provides the best solutions.
</P>
<P>
   SOUND ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   In response to recent discussions of quality woodworking tools,
I received an e-mail that I think is worth passing on. The
gentleman writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent a distributor of woodworking power tools and find
myself faced with the same questions, day-in and day-out, relating
to the purchase of inexpensive equipment that will perform to the
high expectations of the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a daily basis we have customers come into our store wanting
to purchase a new fence for their 'cost efficient' table saw they
bought elsewhere. They are immediately faced with one or two
problems. Chances are the better grade fence will not fit on their
saw and if it does the cost is far greater than they anticipated.
They also find that other accessories (i.e. good tenoning jigs,
etc.) do not fit their saws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company does not pay commissions to our sales personnel.
We stress selling the right tool for the needs of the customer. We
will not attempt to sell an arbor saw to someone needing a
contractor's saw. I mention this because when we determine needs of
a customer we also attempt to get them to foresee what they will be
doing in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently I had a customer who owned a contractor saw that was
manufactured by one of the companies you recommended. He wanted to
add a table board and a larger fence. I figured the cost of
upgrading and then figured what he could sell his contractor saw
for and subtracted it from the cost of a Jet 52-inch arbor saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, the gentleman reports, was that it would cost a lot
more to upgrade than to sell and buy, and in the case of upgrading
the customer would still have had a 1 1/2 HP saw instead of a 3 HP.
I'm passing this man's advice on to you because he had the amazing
good taste and class not to mention the name of his store.

 &HT;    New book opens world of doormaking
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Building a door _ a front entry door, not a cabinet
door _ is something I've thought about, but never even got close to
doing.
</P>
<P>
   However, the arrival of a new book from Sterling, ``Doormaking:
A Do-It-Yourself Guide,'' by John Birchard, may get me going again.
This $20 softbound book is written by a California doormaker, so
most of the designs are inventive and informal, but the main value
of the book is the general information on building a door that will
last.
</P>
<P>
   There is a detailed discussion of how to work the design around
conditions, such as the amount of exposure the door has to the
elements and the direction in which it faces, and the best ways of
installing doors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful parts of the book is the discussion of
finishing and maintenance. The finishing of wood exposed to sun and
weather has always been a problem for me, and Birchard makes it
abundantly clear that it's a problem for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does define the options and their consequences, and
provides the best solutions.
</P>
<P>
   SOUND ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   In response to recent discussions of quality woodworking tools,
I received an e-mail that I think is worth passing on. The
gentleman writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I represent a distributor of woodworking power tools and find
myself faced with the same questions, day-in and day-out, relating
to the purchase of inexpensive equipment that will perform to the
high expectations of the purchaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a daily basis we have customers come into our store wanting
to purchase a new fence for their 'cost efficient' table saw they
bought elsewhere. They are immediately faced with one or two
problems. Chances are the better grade fence will not fit on their
saw and if it does the cost is far greater than they anticipated.
They also find that other accessories (i.e. good tenoning jigs,
etc.) do not fit their saws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company does not pay commissions to our sales personnel.
We stress selling the right tool for the needs of the customer. We
will not attempt to sell an arbor saw to someone needing a
contractor's saw. I mention this because when we determine needs of
a customer we also attempt to get them to foresee what they will be
doing in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently I had a customer who owned a contractor saw that was
manufactured by one of the companies you recommended. He wanted to
add a table board and a larger fence. I figured the cost of
upgrading and then figured what he could sell his contractor saw
for and subtracted it from the cost of a Jet 52-inch arbor saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, the gentleman reports, was that it would cost a lot
more to upgrade than to sell and buy, and in the case of upgrading
the customer would still have had a 1 1/2 HP saw instead of a 3 HP.
I'm passing this man's advice on to you because he had the amazing
good taste and class not to mention the name of his store.

 c.2000 Harvard Business School Publishing  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Many companies are moving away from bare-bones marketing sites
and are throwing millions of dollars at their Web sites _ more
graphics, more video and sound, more everything.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Although the sites are usually impressive, often
they fail to do such simple things as differentiate between product
X and product Y or clearly explain whom to contact for customer
service.
</P>
<P>
   One business manifesto holds that all commerce is about
conversations _ conversations between companies and employees,
between employees and customers, and among customers. The World
Wide Web facilitates these conversations in a way that hasn't been
possible since the days of the village market.
</P>
<P>
   Web-site design experts say the best business sites focus on
creating such conversations with their customers. Here are some
other pointers on improving an organization's site:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. DEFINE THE SITE'S VALUE. &LR;  ``Most companies don't bother to
sit down before they design their Web site and say, `Why will
customers come here? What do I want them to do? Why would they come
back?''' says Adam Hartung, senior e-business partner at consulting
firm CSC in Chicago. ``If that customer doesn't get value out of
that Web site, you are going to have a bad design no matter how
many graphic artists you hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Theo Fels, vice president and creative director of the Internet
services firm Circle.com, adds, ``You have to go through a
discovery process of really understanding what your audience wants
from you and what is the best way to deliver it. You don't want
them poking around your site, trying to discover something and
getting very frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. FOCUS ON BEHAVIORAL _ NOT DEMOGRAPHIC _ SEGMENTATION. &LR;  On
the Internet, demographic segmentation is pretty worthless, Hartung
says. ``When somebody comes to your Web site, you have no way of
knowing who they are. But there's a behavior that brought them
there. If you appeal to that behavior, you'll capture them and
you'll do well.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a site selling groceries could be visited by
someone in a hurry to get something for that evening's dinner, or
by someone with 60 items on his or her grocery list. These are
vastly different behaviors. Consider multiple interfaces, using a
pull-down menu or other selection method, to discover why each
person is visiting the site. An individual's selection takes her
promptly to the interface she needs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. DESIGN FOR EFFORTLESS NAVIGATION. &LR;  Content is king, but
users need to be able to find that content easily and in a way
that's visually pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't throw your customers into the role of researcher when
they're trying to find out information about you and your
products,'' says Roger Black, chief creative officer for
Circle.com. ``Try to have your brand and your voice at every level.
If you're trying to be a friendly, customer-oriented company, then
your Web site needs to be that way, too. You can't say you care
about customers and then have a Web site that looks like a tax
form.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ways to do this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the navigation consistent. Every page on the site should
have the same navigation bars and icons, so users can always see
how to get around and how to get back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remember the audience. Once users can easily find their way
through the site, they want to read copy that is relevant to them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make it legible. The type on most sites is set at level two of
the five HTML levels. Instead, try using level three or four. Or
try setting at least the first paragraph in larger type to give
readers an easier way into the content.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. CONSIDER THE SITE COMPLEMENTARY TO _ NOT INDEPENDENT OF _
THE EXISTING OFFLINE CHANNELS. &LR;  Most companies with a presence on
the Web have other, more established channels. Even so-called
pure-plays have at least an offline marketing presence. Therefore,
one must consider how the company's Web site interacts in a world
that includes other channels, Hartung says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Web site has a relationship to your sales force. To your
distributors. To your bricks-and-mortar retailers,'' he says. ``A
good design takes into account who the other channel players are.''
</P>
<P>
   Visually, that means reassuring the customers that they're going
to have the same satisfactory experience they've had with the
company offline by carrying over the visual branding or identity to
make them more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   You can pay a lot of money to consultants to provide what's
called information architecture, but ``nothing that they give you
falls outside the realm of common sense,'' Black says. ``If you
have concerns about your site, just ask your wife or husband or
your boyfriend or girlfriend to look at it and see what they say.
And typically they'll say, `I'm confused.' So you know something is
wrong.''

   When the long knives come out in the workplace, the attacker
must be confronted. For many people, the backstabber is usually a
familiar face: a colleague or an employee who acts like a friend in
public but badmouths co-workers in private.
</P>
<P>
   A backstabber may see a co-worker as a competitor for favor or
promotion. In organizations undergoing big changes, backstabbing
may be one way people fight to hold onto their jobs or get needed
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Here, three experts in interpersonal communications and
executive coaching offer tips on how to keep from becoming a
victim:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THINK BEFORE SPEAKING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A company wants its employees to cooperate with each other _ not
open their hearts to others on the floor. Keep in mind that
anything said ``in confidence'' by the watercooler could be passed
on to others.
</P>
<P>
   Backstabbers look for information to use against people they see
as threats to their career aspirations or power base, notes Mildred
Saunders, president of Milsaun &AMP; Co., a N.Y.-based firm that
coaches executives. The schemer, she adds, will try to get his or
her ``target'' to share personal secrets or professional opinions
that could undermine that person's position.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WATCH FOR SIGNS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to be paranoid. But if a colleague's smile seems a
little forced, or if he or she acts excessively chummy, be careful.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the study of animal behavior have found that similar
behavior in chimpanzees reflects a highly agitated state. The
animal is preparing to defend its territory and is making a hostile
gesture to establish its dominance, says Andrew DuBrin, author of
``Winning Office Politics'' (Prentice Hall, 1990). So, too, a
too-big smile in humans often hides aggressive thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Another clue: People who have backstabbed before are likely to
do it again, so learn from past victims' experience.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KNOW THAT BACKSTABBERS LINE THE CORPORATE LADDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Namie, author of ``The Bully at Work: What You Can Do
to Stop the Hurt and Reclaim Your Dignity on the Job''
(Sourcebooks, 2000) and leader, with his wife Ruth, of the Campaign
Against Workplace Bullying, has studied backstabbers, which he
refers to as ``two-headed snakes.'' He points out that supervisors
backstab just as frequently as colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kiss up the ladder and attack down below,'' he says.
``They tell you that you're wonderful while telling their boss that
you are incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even customers can be backstabbers, playing Dr. Jekyll with,
say, a salesperson, and Mr. Hyde with his boss when discussing the
employee's efforts on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders believes it's best to keep such people as far away as
possible while still maintaining a professional demeanor.
Backstabbers use emotional proximity as a means to hurt others.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's wise to stay alert to alliances that potential
backstabbers may be forming. Savvy employees don't completely
distance themselves from their colleagues, but rather keep their
ears open for rumors that even distant backstabbers may start.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when stories circulate about someone in an
organization, the subject is often the only person who hasn't heard
them. One way to stop a schemer's actions is to know what's being
said, which means being part of the grapevine. Not only will this
increase the likelihood of hearing the stories, it may even
discourage some potential backstabbers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONFRONTING THE GUILTY PARTY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; STEP 1: ENLIST SUPPORTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the only way to stop the backstabbing is to confront
the perpetrator. Preparing in advance for a confrontation is
essential. Namie advises that those who are uncomfortable
confronting a person alone should check to see if others have had
similar problems with that individual.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STEP 2: PLAN THE APPROACH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to get the backstabber to admit the truth. Start by
saying:
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ``If you have a problem with something I've done, we
should talk about it and try to resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ``We need to work together. Here's what we can do to
ensure no repetition of this situation ...''
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) ``There's a way you and I can improve our work
relationship. Are you interested in hearing about it?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STEP 3: DOING IT PUBLICLY VS. PRIVATELY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DuBrin advises handling the confrontation privately, or even
bringing in a third party if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Namie disagrees: Better to do it in public, he says, and bring
the backstabber's actions into the light. ``Snakes are obsessed
with appearances,'' he says. Confront them in public. If the victim
remains emotionally in control, the culprit will feel embarrassed
enough to stop spreading lies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STEP 4: KEEP THE BOSS INFORMED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A person who has learned that a colleague has badmouthed him to
the boss should request a private meeting with that supervisor. The
victim should never make it a personal issue between the
backstabber and him. Rather, he should organize his defense and
present it calmly, rationally and with the evidence in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Namie isn't optimistic about the support one can expect from
management. If the company's executives see backstabbers as sources
of valuable information or value them for their performance, he
says, they may ignore dirty politicking. That's why Namie believes
it's up to the individual to take action.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the backstabber is the boss? Namie suggests that the
employee demand clarification regarding the specific procedures or
results that his boss is after, and put on record the performance
standards by which he will be evaluated. Clarity usually puts an
end to the confusion _ and also to the backstabbing.

IT'S NOT ALL FLUFFY FILLING AT CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By BILL THOMPSON 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somebody asked me the other day why I didn't go to the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. How in the world,
this aficionado of politics wanted to know, could I pass up an
opportunity to spend four days and nights rubbing elbows with
thousands of political fanatics wearing funny hats and throngs of
media news hounds tripping over each other in search of a story?
</P>
<P>
   Is that a question that requires an answer?
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside, these quadrennial pep rallies can be fun if
not fascinating _ or vice versa _ but in one respect they sort of
remind me of Miss America pageants: When you've seen one, you've
seen 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Miss America competition has something going for it
that the political conventions do not: In Atlantic City, you have
to wait until the end to find out who wins.
</P>
<P>
   The media constantly grumbled this week about how boring the
convention was, how scripted it was, how utterly fake and
meaningless it was. Having watched the festivities in the comfort
of my Texas living room, I'm probably in no position to argue with
those who were on the scene; if I'd been there, maybe I'd be
whining about the oversupply of staging and the undersupply of
substance just like the other opinionizers.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of seeming like a sap, however, I must admit that I
found the whole deal fairly entertaining and even enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   For example: I attended the Republican convention in San Diego
four years ago, and I vaguely remember hearing Colin Powell speak
there, but I had no idea until I watched him on television this
week what an amazingly dynamic speaker he is.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I didn't even know that actress Bo Derek was a Republican
until the TV cameras zoomed in on her while panning the VIP
section. If I'd been there in person, the convention security army
wouldn't have let me anywhere near the VIP seats.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget the best reason of all to watch the
convention on television instead of in the convention hall: remote
control.
</P>
<P>
   Any time I felt myself about to lapse into unconsciousness
during a speech or one of those weird musical interludes, I was
just a click away from a refreshing change of pace. When you're in
the hall, the speakers won't shut up no matter how many times you
click your clicker.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the downside. Some of the speeches can leave a totally
different impression on an at-home listener than they leave on the
in-person audience.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates on the convention floor went wild when vice
presidential nominee Dick Cheney spoke Wednesday night _ and the
on-site media analysts couldn't stop talking about what a rousing
attack Cheney had launched against the Democrats. From where I was
sitting, though, Cheney's speech was about as exciting as Lee
Greenwood's 10 billionth rendering of ``God Bless the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. It was a fine speech, and the would-be veep
made some excellent points. But Cheney is so reasonable, and his
speaking style is so low-key, that he couldn't have come off as a
hatchet man if he'd actually been wielding a hatchet.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe that's me, as comic-turned-football-commentator Dennis
Miller likes to say.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the delegates were so hungry for some fightin' words
after three days of sweetness and light that they looked at Cheney
and saw a fire-breathing attack dog, while I, on the other hand,
saw a painstakingly civil and distinguished statesman making a
straightforward case for the Republicans' 2000 ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe the media and the Democrats were so hungry to blast a
GOP convention that had been unwaveringly positive and upbeat that
they listened to Cheney and heard a savage, partisan attack, while
I heard George W. Bush's running mate offering up some common-sense
criticism of the officeholders whom Bush and Cheney hope to
replace.
</P>
<P>
   I know a savage, partisan attack when I hear one, and I don't
think Cheney's speech qualified. If it's savage, partisan attacks
you crave, you'll have to wait for the Democratic convention.

`THERE ARE NO SHEKELS WITHOUT THE SHACKLES'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Use the word ``religion'' in connection with anything
governmental, and a gaggle of ACLU lawyers will be on you like a
cat on a cricket, railing about the need for separation of church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   Let a popular Republican governor running for president use the
term ``faith-based,'' however, for the kinds of organizations that
should receive money to help America's struggling and, voila!,
everyone thinks this is a peachy idea for addressing some of the
social ills plaguing the nation. So peachy, in fact, that a
slightly less popular (according to people who answer polls)
Democratic vice president has co-opted the concept as part of his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith-based agency'' may be a catch phrase for the new
millennium when it comes to who should provide services to
Americans in need, but it also serves as code to disguise where
those public dollars are going _ to organizations aligned with
religious institutions and specific religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Folks, the line between church and faith-based is so thin as to
be imperceptible in all too many cases.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Jobs Partnership of Washington County.
Sounds like your typical bureaucratic agency working to help people
find jobs. Except that this Texas job training program uses
evangelical Christianity to help people get off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Which in and of itself isn't a problem _ as long as program
organizers don't use public dollars to do it. In a lawsuit filed by
two civil rights groups, the Jobs Partnership is accused of using
state money to buy Bibles and to tell people that they can find
jobs through a relationship with Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bowen vs. Kendrick that
public dollars can fund a religiously affiliated agency but not a
pervasively religious agency. The Jobs Partnership may have crossed
that line when it used biblical references to teach subjects such
as relations, authority, attitude, integrity, money and others.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of church-affiliated social services taking public
dollars should bother not just strict constitutional
constructionists and civil rights lawyers, but also church folk _
because no public dollar was ever expended that didn't come
attached to a bureaucrat with a rule book. As Melissa Rogers,
general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs,
said during a recent conference of the First Amendment Institute:
``There are no shekels without the shackles.''
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the notion of ``charitable choice'' _ allowing
religious organizations to qualify as nongovernmental providers of
services _ looks like a reasonable idea. If the government is
supposed to be neutral when it comes to handing out the
dough-re-me, why shouldn't a church-affiliated service provider be
given the same opportunity as an independent agency?
</P>
<P>
   ``When one witnesses the good work that houses of worship are
doing, it is absolutely natural to want to extend a helping hand.
But churches and other pervasively sectarian ministries should not
administer tax money in an effort to help the needy _ it is the
wrong way to do right,'' Rogers wrote to argue against Sen. John
Ashcroft's Charitable Choice Expansion Act.
</P>
<P>
   She warned that ``houses of worship that provide government
benefits and services may come to be viewed as arms of the
government. People need to know that their church is not Big
Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``faith-based'' organizations take on the societal
significance of another bureaucratic agency, we're all in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of church-based programs' receiving government money
argue that churches and parochial schools should be treated like
everything else when it comes to being able to compete for
government contracts _ even if there is some red tape attached.
</P>
<P>
   But religion, as Rogers says, isn't like everything else.
Churches, throughout this nation's history, have fought hard to
make sure that they aren't considered the same in order to protect
citizens' rights to worship as they please.
</P>
<P>
   ``So at times there are special limitations on religion _ a
church cannot receive government grants as its secular counterparts
can _ and at times religion is granted special accommodation _ a
church may prefer people of the same religion in hiring as its
secular counterparts cannot,'' Rogers said. ``This is not
discrimination against religion. It is giving religion the
breathing room it requires.''
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucrats don't need to be fiddling with church-state
relations in order to address the social problems facing America.
</P>
<P>
   People of faith do the right thing because it's the right thing
to do, not because there is a government contract in the deal.

 &HT;    LONG DELAYS KEEP NEW TECHNOLOGIES OFF ELDERLY MARKET
 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR USE MONDAY, AUG. 7, 2000
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of elderly and disabled Medicare patients
are potentially denied the latest in medical technology because of
bureaucratic delays and inadequate payments, according to a report
being released today. ((Monday))
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared for the Advanced Medical Technology
Association, which represents medical manufacturers, by the Lewin
Group, an independent analytical firm that specializes in health
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings, the report said:
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) The time between a new device's approval for medical
use and its acceptance by Medicare can range from 15 months to five
years. Patients rarely receive the new technology during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of Medicare coverage for a new device or procedure
restricts patient access,'' the report said. ``Although
beneficiaries may pay out-of-pocket for devices that are not
adequately covered under Medicare, they are rarely in a position to
do so in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) Because some devices must be approved by Medicare on a
region-by-region basis, the same technology may not be available
nationwide. Medicare is considering a policy to grant nationwide
approval of new devices. A hearing is likely to be held on that
proposal later this month in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) New Medicare rules will make it tougher for new devices
to be approved for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration, which operates
Medicare, did not have a reaction to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received a draft copy of this report and we're
reviewing it,'' a HCFA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare often pays the same amount for a new device as for
other devices used in a similar manner, even if the new device is
more costly.
</P>
<P>
   That may result in hospitals ``limiting performance of
procedures, eliminating provision of certain services and using
older and less expensive technologies,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, cochlear implants, which stimulate the ear's
cochlea and help restore hearing in some severely deaf individuals,
were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1984 and by
Medicare two years later. But Medicare has never adjusted its
payment level even though the implants have been refined over the
past 14 years and are now more costly.
</P>
<P>
   The report said hospitals lose about $9,000 for every cochlear
implant performed on an in-patient basis and $5,500 for outpatient
procedures, resulting in some facilities limiting their
availability. The UCLA Audiology Clinic recently closed its
cochlear implant program, citing the high cost and low
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all patients eligible for cochlear implants
are on Medicare, but only about 15 percent of the implants are
performed on Medicare patients, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Approval delays and low reimbursement levels impose substantial
risks on the companies that develop and manufacture medical
devices, with the result that efforts to improve research and
development may be stifled, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high cost and long timelines that may be required to
secure Medicare payment can delay or even prevent new devices with
demonstrated clinical value from reaching the market,'' the report
said.

BRITAIN CELEBRATES 100TH BIRTHDAY OF QUEEN MOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Surrounded by three generations of the royal family,
Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, celebrated her 100th birthday
Friday, waving to cheering well-wishers from the Buckingham Palace
balcony where she helped lead national rejoicing at the end of
World War II and on other notable occasions.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 40,000 people thronged the Mall as she rode by in a
horse-drawn open-top carriage garlanded with flowers in her
stable's gold-and-blue colors. Her grandson, Charles, the prince of
Wales, sat by her side as the coach entered the palace grounds to
the sound of a 41-gun salute and the strains of the national anthem
``God Save the Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   As the band of The Coldstream Guards struck up ``Happy Birthday
to You,'' she emerged from the darkness of a curtained doorway onto
the sunny balcony with her daughters, Queen Elizabeth II, 74, and
Princess Margaret, 69, and 25 other immediate family members
including her two great-grandsons, Princes William, 18, and Harry,
15.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother's day began with the arrival of a royal postman
at her Clarence House residence, just off the Mall, bearing a
ceremonial card that the queen daily sends to her subjects who are
turning 100. One of 12 such cards delivered Friday, hers was the
only one to carry a personal greeting and to be signed not with the
formal ``Elizabeth R'' but with ``Lilibet,'' the queen's family
name since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities Friday capped weeks of commemorations that have
included full dress parades, Royal Air Force flyovers,
pageant-filled church services and ``God Bless You Ma'am'' tabloid
headlines in what could be the last full-throated hurrah for the
monarchy. Editorials have credited her with having saved the
monarchy from perils ranging from the abdication of her
brother-in-law Edward VIII in 1936 to the bombing of Buckingham
Palace by the Germans to the dysfunctional family behavior of
modern-day Windsors.
</P>
<P>
   Her first duty as queen was taming the stammering rages of her
husband, the newly crowned King George VI, by holding his wrist and
counting down his heart beats, and it set the tone for her job ever
since _ steadying the pulse of the crisis-prone British royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   George VI died of lung cancer in 1952 at the age of 56, and
Elizabeth, then 51, had to adjust to becoming the mother of a
monarch rather than the wife of one. A steely traditionalist, she
forcefully moved to end the love affair between Princess Margaret
and Group Capt. Peter Townsend, a palace equerry who was in the
process of divorce. More recently she sided with Prince Charles in
his marital dispute with Princess Diana. Diana retaliated by
telling a biographer that the Queen Mother was ``the chief leper in
the leper colony.''
</P>
<P>
   She is generally regarded as the most popular royal, though, and
it is difficult to imagine the image makers who have been hard at
work combating the declining popularity of the other members of the
family spinning any better presentation of her than the one she
herself created unaided over 75 years in the public eye.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is no more endearing sight to tradition-minded Britons
than her tilted head, upcurled hat brim, ready smile and girlish
waves. The Queen Mother is seen as a favorite grandmother,
surrounded by her pet corgis, open and approachable, with a love of
the blustery British outdoors, an eye for the daily racing form and
a famous fancy for gin and mischievous dinner party chatter.
</P>
<P>
   While she never gave interviews or otherwise let the outside
world into her life, she became a figure whom the public embraced,
particularly during the wartime blitz, when she visited London's
East End to observe the damage for herself and try to lift the
spirits of besieged Londoners. Today the Queen Mother remains a
living link to a legendary time in British history.
</P>
<P>
   Her instinct in trying to associate the royal family with the
common British family laid the foundation for the effort to make
the monarchy less remote and more personable. She was the first
royal to stroll up to crowd barriers and greet the public in what
has now become the common practice of a ``walkabout.''
</P>
<P>
   As at so many occasions involving British royalty, many of the
most enthusiastic celebrators were Americans. One of them, Connie
Missinger, 47, a librarian from St. Louis, Mo., said: ``I came here
especially for the birthday. I came here last year and had such a
wonderful time that I thought I would love to come again. She is a
very special person and has seen everything.''

NO TRUE SUBSTITUTE FOR LIFE'S SWEETER PLEASURES 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Demi Moore's favorite snack, it is reported, is a glass of
water. Soon much of America may be saying their favorite snack,
too, is a glass of water, because much of America is under the
mistaken impression that the less you eat the more you'll look like
a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it has come to, I guess. The great American love
affair with food has collided with the great American guilt about
eating and decided that water is a snack.
</P>
<P>
   Water's fine. We need at least eight glasses a day. But it's no
snack. A snack is a treat, a gustatory gift to yourself, a reason
to lick your lips and close your eyes and smile.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream is a snack, one of the original comfort foods, the
thing you wanted when you had your tonsils out, broke up with your
lover, had a root canal, but never found on fad diets.
</P>
<P>
   I spotted a woman eating ice cream the other day in the driver's
seat of her car. She was parked in the grocery store lot with the
car idling and probably the air conditioner going and she was
spooning ice cream out of a carton.
</P>
<P>
   I commiserated. I'm not good at waiting either and know about
driving while fishing through bags of groceries _ usually for a
Good and Plenty fix _ but this woman had planned ahead enough to
bring a spoon with her.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she was indulging on the sly. Even if she wasn't, she was
probably humming to herself as she ate, it being almost impossible
to consume ice cream and feel miserable.
</P>
<P>
   I like those towns in places like Mexico and Spain where on hot
nights people of all ages dress up to stroll around the square and
eat ice cream cones, twirling the creamy cold on their tongues,
looking like little kids in grown-up clothes.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, the exercise probably balances off some
of the calories, making ice cream practically a health food.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be as American as apple pie, but now like pie, ice
cream comes in non-fat, non-sweet basically inedible
what's-the-point variations. You appreciate seeing someone pleasure
themselves with the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   My pal Miriam recently turned 80 in relative good health and
delightful spirits. What water is to Demi, ice cream is to Miriam.
It's her favorite snack. Pralines and cream, first; vanilla,
second.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam said she expects to one day read in her newspaper that
ice cream has been found to have surprising restorative and healing
powers _ good for the brain or maybe simply a stress reducer _ and
should be consumed a little bit each day, like a glass of red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam's been around long enough to see such things as butter,
bacon, red meat and eggs go in and out of fashion and chuckles over
new reports that chocolate is good for the heart. She believes her
favorite snack is also due for a blessing by some health guru.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are signs that her body runs well on ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Right before her birthday, she took a bone density test and
passed with flying colors. No signs of osteoporosis said her amazed
doctor. Equally amazed are her younger friends who are hoping that
gulping calcium pills and Vitamin D at middle age will keep their
bones from crumbling like egg shells. After being so wary about
dairy, now we're starting to think more kindly about those half
gallons of temptation Miriam keeps in her freezer.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea of the status of Demi's bones, but I believe
anyone who spends their life snacking only on water will at age 80
be about as tall as Miriam's knee.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam also is a happy person, seldom blue, and I think that
might have something to do with how she relishes the sweet parts of
life, ice cream and otherwise.

SOUTHERN REPUBLICANS LOOK TO VICTORY IN NOVEMBER  

</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)  
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans emerged from their big tent here
energized about their prospects across the South, firmly convinced
that Texas Gov. George W. Bush has a strong grip on the region.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Bush's conservative philosophy play directly to
the sympathies of a dominant bloc of Southern voters, but he has
special advantages: brother Jeb is the governor of Florida, W.
himself is a neighbor over in Texas and his energy background plays
well along the Gulf oil and gas belt.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie delegates were downright giddy about bringing home the
bacon in November, giving Gore about as much chance as a homecoming
opponent at a Southeast Conference football game.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour, the Mississippian who used to head the Republican
National Committee, agreed that the trend line is moving up on the
GOP ticket. He said the party is in its best position since the
re-election campaign of President Reagan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But he offered a word of caution to the faithful lest they get
too cocky and drop their guard. ``Don't kid yourself,'' Barbour
told a group of Alabamans during convention week, ``this is going
to be a close election.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the South, Barbour predicted that North Carolina,
Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas will be competitive, though he
noted Vice President Gore has taken positions on tobacco and coal
that saddle him with baggage in those states. Barbour also believes
Florida will be a fight.
</P>
<P>
   But his chief warning to the GOP shock troops that came together
in Philly was to brace for steady assaults on Bush, running mate
Dick Cheney and their records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get ready for a tough campaign,'' he said. ``They
will attack Bush every day, every way, on every subject.''
</P>
<P>
   POWELL POWER
</P>
<P>
   Southern Republicans revere Gen. Colin Powell, considering him a
certified military hero and irrefutable evidence that there is room
in the GOP for African Americans. But Powell's convention speech
and remarks elsewhere illustrated some policy positions that put
him directly at odds with Southern conservative orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Powell reaffirmed his support for affirmative action programs
for minorities both in his formal address and in several news
interviews that followed, saying he thought it was wrong for the
party to try to make a political issue out of preferences.
</P>
<P>
   In a CNN interview, he contrasted affirmative action with
federal sugar price supports, asking why it was fine for sugar
growers to get government help but was somehow unconstitutional for
minority students to get a leg up.
</P>
<P>
   The retired military leader also took on those who would try to
win Southern elections using tactics aimed at dividing blacks and
whites on civil rights issues, calling that approach the ``old,
dead, Southern strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   FAIRCLOTH RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   Former North Carolina Sen. Lauch Faircloth has kept a low
profile since his election loss to Democrat John Edwards in 1998,
returning to his personal business and agricultural interests.
</P>
<P>
   But the dedicated Republican has been very active in the Bush
presidential campaign, chairing the North Carolina effort and
making the rounds at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   As he strolled down Market Street to yet another event,
Faircloth was asked if he would return to the nation's capital
should there be another President Bush occupying the White House.
``We'll have to see,'' said Faircloth, who would qualify for a top
administration appointment. Agriculture secretary, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he could also seek his old Senate seat if Edwards is
tapped by Vice President Al Gore as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   A NO VOTE ON THE ROLL CALL
</P>
<P>
   Republicans adopted a new version of the trademark convention
roll call this year, spreading the state tally out over four nights
rather than devoting a couple of hours at the climax of the
convention. The rationale was that the primaries made the outcome
preordained.
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few delegates said they preferred the old system and
that the new approach robbed the proceedings of a bit of convention
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pryor, the Alabama attorney general, said he still vividly
recalls staying up to watch the count during the close 1976 fight
between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm a political junkie, but I like watching one big
night,'' he said.

&HT;     BORDER RECRUITERS LOOKING TO FILL 1,600 PATROL JOBS

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ As the federal government aims to complete
Congress' five-year goal of hiring 5,000 new agents by October
2001, U.S. Border Patrol recruiters are hitting the airwaves,
theaters and shopping malls to bolster one of the nation's most
storied and controversial law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience the thrill of intense action, suspense and danger
as you maneuver through deserts, canyons, gulf waters and the
sky,'' a San Antonio radio spot blares. ``Your mission is to
protect the boundaries of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol is pitching the excitement of roaming the
2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border and drawing a federal paycheck as
leading reasons to choose ``a career with borders, but no
boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in a patrol job fair swept the spectrum of
20-somethings this week as potential recruits turned out in
military-issue fatigues, hospital scrubs, sneakers and sandals.
</P>
<P>
   Rocio Romero, 24, who works in a bank, said she was drawn by
``the challenge of being a female in a man's world.''
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, Joseph Medina, 21, who works in a medical office,
said he was inspired by the stability of a federal job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to branch out,'' Medina said after filling out an
application at the Omni Hotel. ``We are willing to relocate.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   The patrol expects to hire 1,600 recruits this year, about 500
more than the approximately 1,100 recruits hired last year, said
Nicole Chulick, a Border Patrol spokeswoman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going continue the hiring blitz,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With about 8,600 agents _ the most ever _ the patrol is short of
the federal hiring goal and struggling to fill the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The agency needs to hire at least 2,000 agents a year to meet
the goal and replace agents who quit, retire or transfer to other
law enforcement agencies, Chulick said.
</P>
<P>
   To hire, train and deploy 2,000 new agents, the patrol will have
to pull in at least 70,000 applications nationwide, said Luis
Gonzalez, recruiting coordinator for the patrol's Laredo Sector,
which includes San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Selzer, a spokesman for Proyecto Libertad, a Rio Grande
Valley-based immigration rights group, said Congress is asking the
patrol to grow too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are that desperate for recruits, to what extent are
they really going to look into who they are hiring,'' Selzer said.
``We demand the Border Patrol do thorough background and
psychological checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruits face a four-hour written exam, a criminal background
check and an interview. Candidates must be U.S. citizens, hold a
valid driver's license and be younger than 37 years old.
</P>
<P>
   A misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence or any felony
automatically disqualifies a recruit.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, said the hiring goal is
not unreasonable and should be expanded to bring in 1,000 agents
per year for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very well thought-out and measured number of agents to
hire,'' said Reyes, who was a Border Patrol agent for 26 years
before being elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A recruiting video Wednesday featured punchy music and agents
repelling from a helicopter, riding horses and shooting targets in
the desert.

AS CONVENTION ENDS, BUSH BEGINS A WHISTLE-STOP CAMPAIGN TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated by 9 p.m. EDT with a story
by Frank Bruni.) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The morning after accepting the Republican
presidential nomination and pledging to use the nation's prosperity
to solve difficult problems and fix politics, Gov. George W. Bush
promised to bring a new civility to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the delegates from the Republican National Convention
packed their bags and left Philadelphia Friday morning. Hundreds of
Republicans gathered at the airport to see off their nominee as he
left for Pittsburgh, where he was to begin a whistle-stop train
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave this city of brotherly love energized and united and
focused on victory,'' Bush said at the rally. ``Our job is to
restore confidence to America, to lift this nation's spirit, to
call upon the best of our citizenry.''
</P>
<P>
   The train trip, which the Republicans are calling the ``Change
the Tone Tour,'' will take Bush through Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan and Illinois. Karen P. Hughes, the campaign spokeswoman,
said Bush hoped to use the tour to emphasize the call for civility
he made during his acceptance speech and to highlight examples of
his bipartisanship in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign by train is set to end on Sunday, when he will
return home to Austin, Texas. But he is likely to travel to
California next week, just days before the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles. Vice President Al Gore, the presumed
Democratic candidate, has a strong lead in California, but Hughes
said that the Bush campaign was eager to show that it would not
concede the state.
</P>
<P>
   At a prayer breakfast Friday morning, Bush suggested that he
could unite Americans to help improve the lives of those who have
been left behind or left out in this time of economic strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job as leaders, Republicans, Democrats and the
non-affiliates is to rally that compassion of America,'' Bush said.
``Our mission, regardless of political party, is to work together
to make sure no child is left behind as we go into the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the size of the television audience Thursday night was
smaller than for past conventions, Bush's speech was still seen by
millions, and, for many of them, it represented their introduction
to the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In his address on Thursday, Bush said the Clinton-Gore
administration had squandered the opportunity to use the strong
economic health of the country to expand Medicare, reform Social
Security and strengthen the military.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not offer many policy changes that differed radically
from the moderate agenda of the current administration. But the
convention was peppered with tough criticisms of Gore and Clinton
to suggest that Bush could offer a different style of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a
generation,'' Bush said Thursday night. ``So many talents. So much
charm. Such great skill. But in the end, to what end? So much
promise, to no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush accused Gore of playing up the fears of Americans, blocking
reforms but not advancing solutions. He said that rather than
transforming himself or polling before staking a position, he would
lead based on his principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not led, we will,'' Bush said repeatedly in his
remarks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A disciplined campaigner, Bush hopes to control the debate with
his opponent by focusing on only a handful of issues, which he
outlined Thursday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush also signaled this week that he wants to try to change how
Republicans talk about their agenda and portray their party. Like
previous Republican candidates, Bush has promised tax cuts, but he
did it cloaked in words traditionally associated with the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those in the greatest need should receive the greatest help,''
Bush said. ``So we will lower the bottom rate from 15 percent to 10
percent and double the child tax credit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush also promised something to the wealthiest Americans. He
said no one should pay more than 33 percent of their income to the
government, a proposal that would give the wealthiest taxpayers at
least a 6 percent cut.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day convention here generally avoided discussing
divisive issues like abortion. Still, the biggest reaction from the
crowd on Thursday came when Bush mentioned that he would press to
outlaw the procedure opponents call ``partial-birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Those comments made a minority of the delegates in the audience
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry he mentioned the life of the unborn,'' said Dee
Beaubien, 58, a Republican from Barrington, Ill., who supports
abortion rights. ``I know it was politically the right thing to do.
But I am sorry about that part of the speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Republican Party rank and file at the convention
reacted warmly to the speech Thursday, arguing that it showed
Bush's leadership and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was exactly what I was looking for,'' said Ray Hoffman, 56,
a delegate from Sioux City, Iowa. ``It was a message people need to
hear, it is a message we want to hear.''

Remember that first shiny 10-speed you rode as a kid? It would be a
museum piece now. Kind of like your first computer _ a product made
obsolete by improved technology.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe ``obsolete'' is too strong a word. If you rode it
today, that steady Schwinn still might take you where you want to
go, and as fast as your legs are able to pedal it. However, you
would likely find yourself being left in the dust by bikers with
greatly advanced equipment. And the person riding that new
equipment _ whether he was sitting hunched over a custom-built road
bike or slouched, armchair-like, in a high-tech recumbent _
wouldn't necessarily be some Tour de France champion Lance
Armstrong wanna-be. With today's bikes, she wouldn't need to be.
</P>
<P>
   From stem to their multispoked sterns, today's bicycles are
lighter, more compact and a heck of a lot more comfortable than
their ancestors, say bike shop owners, sport advocates and longtime
riders. Chalk up the improvements to better technology, but also to
manufacturers responding to a competitive marketplace. As with a
computer, your money simply buys more now, whether you're shopping
for a new ride or upgrading your existing one.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, people are going into bike shops and asking to be
fitted for a ``comfort bike,'' a genre that grew out of the road
and mountain bike hybrid. On a comfort bike, the seats are softer,
the tires will be wider, you'll probably get a newfangled
suspension system (front and back), and the handlebars will be
positioned for minimum backache potential.
</P>
<P>
   Sound kind of like your favorite armchair? All the better to
accommodate the scads of exercise seekers who are trading in their
running shoes for plastic helmets and garish clothes (which are
also getting more comfortable.) Data compiled by the League of
American Bicyclists, an advocacy group and membership organization,
indicates a surge in the number of riders over age 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall participation in cycling declined slightly last
year from the year before, but we seem to be finding a lot more
older people, above age 50, getting into cycling,'' says Patrick
McCormick, the league's communications director. ``A lot of people
who have been physically active for much of their lives are finding
that running is a little too hard, that they're getting knee or
back problems. So they're switching and getting into cycling.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not necessarily a trend noticed by Valley biking
enthusiasts, although most agree the bikes themselves have come a
long way. Better bikes will mean more riders of every age, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of custom building. You're getting a lot more
for your money. The technology is more affordable, and it's being
mass produced. You can buy a very good bike for a lot less than
what you would have had to pay five to 10 years ago,'' says Norm
Avraham, owner of Cycology in Sherman Oaks. ``I just think bikes
are getting interesting and very sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of older people are taking up biking; younger people
too,'' said Maria Lewis, membership vice president of the nearly
400-member San Fernando Valley Bicycle Club, which has seen its
membership increase by nearly a third in the past year. ``Biking is
easier on the body for people who can't go out running or play
tennis. Bicycling is really easy on the legs and the rest of the
body.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not the entire body. As anyone who has pedaled a few
miles will know, human beings possess a certain lower region which
_ despite a cushion of built-in padding _ will get sore after
continuous riding. Of course, just as designers have tinkered with
every other part of the basic bike, they've revamped the seat.
Gel-filled cushions and cutout wedged saddles _ like the one
manufactured by Body Geometry _ are designed to ease numbness in
both the rear end and the genital areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer like sitting on a two-by-four,'' says Bob
Winning, secretary of the SFVBC and author of ``Short Bike Rides _
Los Angeles.'' ``Of course, when you go out and come back from a
75-mile ride, your butt's going to hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Softer seats are perhaps the most notable improvement, but
they're only the beginning. Improved suspension systems, with the
addition of carbon fiber parts, are giving mountain bike
enthusiasts reason to spend more time bouncing along even rougher
terrain. You can improve your cushion capability in the bike's
front fork and in the seat post, both of which now have
accordion-like shock absorbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest technology jump for mountain bikes in the
past 10 years,'' says Erik Wochna, who works at Cycle World in
Reseda, Calif. ``The early forks had very little travel and spring
rate. Now you're getting more travel as the weight has come down.''
</P>
<P>
   The new material means that an advanced suspension system won't
add a lot of excess weight to your bike. If not quite as light as
the sleekest road bike, mountain bikes are certainly less weighty
than they were in the past. In fact, the only addition likely to
make a bicycle more cumbersome is also designed to make riding
easier for the cyclist who balks at hills _ a rechargeable electric
motor.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see too many motorized bikes in the bike
club ranks. Most riders would rather go for the comfort of a light
and compact bike than be loaded down with equipment they won't use.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weigh as much as five to six bicycles,'' Wochna says of
the motorized bikes. ``It's a big compromise, especially if you
have to pedal it.''
</P>
<P>
   The construction and positioning of handlebars has also been a
much- welcomed modification in the past 10 years. Gone are the bars
wrapped with electrical tape, replaced by cushioned bars with cork
lining. Strap on a pair of gel-like gloves and your hands won't
tingle or get numb. And with wrist-flick gears placed on the
handlebars, you no longer have to take your hands off the bars to
switch gears. According to Winning, road bikes will have the
comfort advantage over mountain bikes in the hand arena since they
have multiple positions for the hands while mountains bikes have
only one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been an overnight thing,'' says Winning. ``Carbon
fiber bikes were introduced, gradually progressed to gel gloves, to
better padding for the shorts, jersey fabric and padding on the
handlebars. The mountain bike suspension has literally been
perfected in the past year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Woody Beck, co-owner of the Bike Wrench in Canoga Park,
Calif., &UR;  &LR; says the next innovations may come with the electric
bicycles. The manufacturers have a whole new set of designs on the
drawing board, from three-wheeled bicycles, to bikes that can be
fold-ups, to bikes that are almost automobile-like, coming soon to
a roadway near you.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are interested in those,'' says Beck. ``It's
great, actually.'' &QL;

<P>
   It doesn't necessarily take a life-altering experience to get
someone to make some changes. Sometimes simply picking up the paper
will do it.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Heilbrun of Valencia was plugging along in a comfortable
and occasionally high-pressure job as an insurance agent at the
Automobile Club of Southern California. He's a husband and father
of 5-year-old Paige and 7-year-old Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   A self-labeled ``couch potato,'' Heilbrun scrupulously avoided
the Nordic Track that has been collecting dust at the foot of his
bed despite steady reminders from his wife, Lori, that he needed to
exercise more.
</P>
<P>
   Then in March he saw a newspaper ad for marathon training to
benefit AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   Great idea, thought Heilbrun, but not the cause that will get me
into running shoes. A search of the Internet brought up several
non-profit organizations that would help people run a marathon to
benefit their particular causes. But now that he was on the lookout
for marathon matters, Heilbrun spotted the brochure for the
Arthritis Foundation's Joints in Motion program in his dry
cleaners. The Joints in Motion program is a five-month regimen that
promises to get participants in marathon-running shape and pay for
their travel and accommodations, in exchange for a $3,100
fund-raising commitment. His destination race: the Honolulu
Marathon, Dec. 10, 2000. Next year, he might opt to raise funds to
benefit the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe I'll cross the finish line (in Honolulu) and say,
`I'll never do this again in my life,''' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The training regimen, which includes weekly Saturday morning
group runs at Griffith Park, appealed to Heilbrun, who turned 42 in
June. But it was the organization itself that hooked him.
Heilbrun's mother, Shirley, died in 1985 at the age of 65 from side
effects of treatment from rheumatoid arthritis. He'll be running
the race in her memory.
</P>
<P>
   Raising $3,100 is no picnic, but as people from the Joints in
Motion program and any non-profit organization will tell you,
there's no stronger inspiration to train for and complete a 26-mile
grind than if the disease or condition you're raising money to
fight has touched you personally.
</P>
<P>
   And it has. Until his mother began to battle the disease,
Heilbrun said he simply considered arthritis to be among the
regular aches and pains that come with old age. Shirley Heilbrun's
condition made it difficult for her to walk up steps. The side
effects from her treatment included anemia and other blood
complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no viable treatment,'' says Heilbrun, who organized
co-workers to donate blood platelets for his mother's treatment.
``If she was younger, a bone marrow transplant is what they would
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is not, Heilbrun has since learned, simply an old
person's disease. Among the 100 forms of arthritis are such
conditions as juvenile arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia, ankylosing
spondylitis, osteoarthritis and gout.
</P>
<P>
   Once he decided to compete, Heilbrun wasn't simply hooked; he
was positively consumed. He signed up for the Joints in Motion
program early and began running with the Joints in Motion team
preparing for the Dublin Marathon on Oct. 30. He started
frequenting the well-known running store Phidippides Sports Center
in Encino and bought an issue of Runner's World magazine that
promised to guide first-timers, step by step, to their first 5K.
</P>
<P>
   That got Heilbrun walking, then slow running, then finally
participating in a couple of 5K races. He has lost 10 pounds since
March and hopes to lose at least 10 more by December to get down to
a running weight of 145.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man, who, his wife acknowledges, enjoys his leisure
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I first knew him _ and we met in college _
people would say, `Isn't he the guy who's always sleeping on the
couch,''' said Lori Heilbrun. ``One time we were listening to a
band, and he fell asleep on a bar stool. His favorite thing to do
is relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband has started exercise regimens in the past, says
Lori, but they haven't stuck. But this marathon may turn out to be
the wake-up call he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Heilbrun's father suffered a heart attack and a stroke and
diabetes. Even at 42, it's hardly too early for him to be thinking
about staying healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric just knows he's kind of like a walking time bomb unless
he does something,'' says Lori. ``We're very dependent on each
other, and I know I'd just be lost without him. I want my girls to
have a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   A slightly achy right knee notwithstanding, Heilbrun is a couch
potato no longer, although after observing his early marathon
gusto, his Joints in Motion coaches and administrators wonder if he
ever was really slothful to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to slow him down a little bit. He was going a bit too
fast,'' says his coach Stan Kirschner. ``He's amazed me. For being
a couch potato, he runs pretty good. And he's got the enthusiasm.
If they don't have that, they're not going to make it through the
program.'' &QL;

PATRIOT UNIT MAY NOT NEED ANY DEFENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Veteran safety Lawyer Milloy was a happy
camper Monday night. For one, he had had a chance to tour the Pro
Football Hall of Fame, shake hands and talk with Ronnie Lott, the
mold for all modern safeties, and then go out on the field and play
for a most cohesive defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be predictable on defense,'' said Milloy,
the Patriots' strong safety. ``Other teams ought to know we're
going to be attacking them week to week. As long as we stay
healthy, I think we can be one of the best defenses in the
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one exhibition game has been played and while it is often
difficult to predict how good a pro football team will be based on
its exhibition play, it is much easier to predict which teams will
be bad.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots clearly showed cohesion in their win over the
49ers, and that cohesion and discipline will be closely watched in
Friday night's second game against the Detroit Lions in the Pontiac
Silverdome. Is it the real deal or not?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, though, Patriot after Patriot has spoken
in the last few days about how well the team has been prepared.
Clearly, Bill Belichick has passed the initial hurdle of a new
coach, winning the confidence of his veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, from being in camp, the extensive approach that he
has taken, his demands and his defensive philosophy, what we did in
that game (against the 49ers) was really elementary compared to
what we've been doing in camp,'' said Milloy. ``To go out and do
things that were elementary and still dominate means a lot to us
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran linebacker Chris Slade also felt the same confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belichick is a more detail-oriented guy, very specific in what
he wants,'' said Slade. ``And the guys have been able to respond to
that so far.''
</P>
<P>
   As Slade sees it, the faith of the veterans in their coaches
leads to two-way reinforcement. If the veterans believe in what the
coaches have laid out, the veterans will then show the younger
players _ who have not been exposed yet to the vast differences in
coaching in the NFL _ how to go about their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veteran guys have shown some quality leaderswhip and the
rookie guys have stepped up so far,'' said Slade. ``It's good to
get off on the right foot like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Football fans can debate whether instilling faith in the players
is more important than X's and O's and making the right personnel
decisions. And of the many decisions to be made on defense, perhaps
few will be more important than who starts at free safety. Last
year's starter, Chris Carter, was relegated to third string Monday
and Tebucky Jones was given a chance to win the job.
</P>
<P>
   The free safety position is a interesting mix of physical
aggressiveness, ability to cover, and mental sharpness. Jones seems
to have the first two qualities, an aggressive player who
frequently was flagged for being over-aggressive the last two years
during Pete Carroll's quest to make him a cornerback. And being
forced the last two years to cover wide receivers _ often in
man-to-man defenses _ has sharpened Jones's coverage skills.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the third quality, being able to recognize offensive
formations and make the right calls, that remains to be seen.
Another factor in whether Jones stays at safety is whether
Belichick is confident either Kato Serwanga or Antonio Langham can
play the opposite corner from Ty Law.
</P>
<P>
   So far, anyway, Jones seems comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see (the play) in front of me,'' said Jones. ``The only
difference is you've got to know more. Being the safety, you've got
to make the calls. Being a corner, you don't have to make any
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the 49ers, ``both of us were making the calls,'' said
Jones of him and his partner at strong safety, Lawyer Milloy. Jones
thought his calling of defenses ``went pretty good. Everything was
on key.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the veterans are now playing for their fourth
offensive coordinator and fourth offense. And even if Belichick and
offensive coordinator Charlie Weis were with the team four years
ago when Bill Parcells was the coach, the Patriots' offense of 2000
is much different from the offense that coordinator Ray Perkins ran
under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one's a lot more wide open,'' said Brisby. ``There's a
lot more of guys getting down the field; some of the things are
similar but it's more spread out.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, at least, there seems to be the same faith by the
offense in their coaches and schemes, a faith that waned under
Ernie Zampese. The Patriot veteran offensive players also seem to
believe thay are entering the regular-season wars with a weapon or
two.
</P>
<P>
   `The coaches really put a big burden on us during the camps,''
explained Brisby of the cohesion the Patriots displayed Monday.
``They threw the whole offense at us in camps and offensively now,
I think we're ready to open up.''
</P>
<P>
   No football team shows much of its offense or defense during
exhibition games, particularly the first one or two, ``and what you
saw the other night is just a little bit of what we're going to
do,'' said Brisby. ``We showed very little of what we're going to
do. It was fairly basic and we kept a lot of guys in for (pass)
protection and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the offense still performed with cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different situation (with a new coaching staff),''
explained Brisby. ``Guys are a lot more attentive now than we were
back when, what with different coaches and all. Guys are more on
the upbeat. (Coaches) are hollering at us to pay attention to
what's going on, even if we're not in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro football players often reach their potential out of fear or
respect or their coaches, or fear of the consequences if mistakes
are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little bit of both,'' said Brisby. ``I think
it's more the preparation than anything. Guys were prepared. We
went into the game looking for an opportunity to play. We just
wanted to go out there and show people what we can do.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Non-profits are always looking for people willing to stretch
their wallets. Now some are seeking volunteers willing to stretch
their legs as well for a game of ``Who Wants to Pant and Sweat for
Charity?'' If you're willing to run a marathon, the folks at the
Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society, the Arthritis Foundation and the
American Diabetes Association _ to name just a few _ promise to get
you in shape to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Sound interesting? OK, here's where the carrot-and-stick
principle comes into play.
</P>
<P>
   First the incentives: if you sign up, you will get the sense of
accomplishment that you've completed a marathon, a feat which
easily makes many people's ``to do at some point in my lifetime''
list.
</P>
<P>
   While completing this marathon, you will also earn the
satisfaction of knowing that you're running _ or walking, as the
case may be _ to raise money for a worthy cause. In some cases,
you're actually running in honor of a specific individual, or in
that individual's memory.
</P>
<P>
   And if these factors aren't enticing enough, maybe the final
boost will come from knowing your marathon will take place in a
particularly scenic area like Hawaii or Dublin, Ireland. Raise
enough money for the cause, and the organization you're running for
will take care your plane ticket and your hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes your responsibility: discipline and donations. You
have to bring in enough money for the selected charity _ anywhere
from $3,000 to $4,000 _ to qualify for the program. And you'll have
to get yourself in marathon-completing shape. A couple of the
non-profit organizations have training programs in place designed
to provide you with the training and, in many cases, with
fund-raising savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our participants are first-time marathoners,'' says
Maura Krah, director of the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in
Motion. ``You would think runners would be our target audience, but
it's the fund-raising component that gives it more meaning to
people. Fund raising is not something that gets hardcore
marathoners fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a purpose and a reason to go out there and take
49,000 steps and run 26 miles,'' adds Pat Connelly, running coach
for the L.A. Roadrunners and the man who developed the training
program for the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in Motion program.
``One is the satisfaction of using your body, mind and
constitutional strength to go the distance. And you're doing it for
people who are less fortunate, many of whom can't even walk.''
</P>
<P>
   William Cameron found his own incentive. Completing a marathon
was on his wish list even before he became a gunshot victim more
than 10 years ago. Now 56 and gearing up for the Honolulu Marathon
on Dec. 10, Cameron is using the Team in Training program to
complete his first marathon. He has one lung and estimates that he
is 10 years older than his next oldest team member, but he still
plans to finish the 26-mile trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause is worthwhile, and I owe it to myself to get back
into shape,'' says Cameron, a television producer who is raising
money for the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society. ``When people who have
had leukemia go into remission, and they've beaten it and they go
out and take on a marathon, it's a real inspiration to those of us
who don't have to fight that particular life-threatening
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most programs require runners to exercise five days a week, with
a long group run on Saturday mornings. During their training
programs, runners gradually build the time and distance they are
able to cover. Along the way, they meet with running coaches,
physical therapists and nutritionists. Many will participate in
half marathons or 10K runs as a warm-up exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody will say it's easy. With five months of training,
participants will drop out of programs for reasons ranging from
exercise-thwarting injuries (hello, sprained ankle!) to an
inability to generate the necessary money.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Athletes in Action, which raises money for
physically challenged athletes, tries to relax the pressure by
providing periodic rewards so people who come up short can still be
involved. Raise $300 and you get five T-shirts; for $1,200, the
organization will pay your entry fee. But you'll need to come up
with $3,200 for the entire registration/plane fare/hotel
accommodations package.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the challenging requirements, program directors say
their ranks are growing. Both the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society and
the Arthritis Foundation have added chapters throughout California
and out of state as the number of participants has grown. With 57
chapters throughout the United States, the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma's
Team in Training program boasts 75 percent of the people who sign
up for the training program make it to the race. Those who make it
to the starting gate _ whether they run or walk _ finish the
marathon 100 percent of the time, says Lisa Mattasits, campaign
director for the Greater L.A. chapter of the Team in Training
program.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent participant in the train-and-run-for-charity
business, the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in Motion program, is
also thriving, increasing from three training sites in Southern
California raising $400,000 for arthritis research during the first
year of participation to nine sites and a projected $1.2 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of us,'' says Krah. ``It's the people. The more they
learn about the organization, that it truly is a critical
organization in the community, the more attached they become.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal connection is also a key factor with Team Diabetes, the
American Diabetes Association's training program now in its second
year of training and sending runners to destinations around the
world. At the recently concluded Kona Marathon, 1,000 of the 1,200
participants were Team Diabetes runners, said ADA spokeswoman Marcy
Woodhull.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Marathon brings in more than $1 million for 50
charities each year, says Marie Patrick, executive vice president,
who adds that a surge in participation in the past five years is
largely a result of a wave of charity runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very supportive of these programs and the people they
train,'' says Patrick. ``From the staging of a marathon
perspective, you have a lot more people running at slower times
because these aren't world-class runners. These are average
citizens running for whatever their cause is. How can you not
support them?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not there is a link between running a marathon and
philanthropy, the number of people participating in marathons is
also growing. In 1980, 120,000 people completed marathons in the
United States. That number increased to 250,000 in 1989 and
ballooned to 435,000 in 1999, according to Ryan Lamppa, a
researcher for the USA Track &AMP; Field's Road Running Information
Center in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Running and charity is a natural marriage, says Lamppa. These
non-profits simply found intriguing ways to bring the two together.
</P>
<P>
   ``As marathons started showing signs of a second boom, training
programs started developing across the country,'' Lamppa said.
``Someone with Team in Training saw this growth and said, `What if
we put together a training program and went out and pitched it?' It
was a good idea, and it worked really well.''
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of non profits fighting for limited number of
donation dollars, program directors acknowledge that _ worthiness
of a cause notwithstanding _ the various programs are competitors.
Where one program will boast greater access to hands-on training,
another will tout a low expense ratio. From the participant's
perspective, an extra day of touring abroad may appeal to some,
while others will prefer the bare bones, more-money-for-the-cause
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leukemia and AIDS _ they're all very similar to ours and
they're all great causes,'' says running coach Connelly. ``With the
individual attention we give, we just try to give (participants) a
little more.'' &QL;

BROWN'S HERE, BUT A BIGGER POINT IS MISSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a lot of talk about leadership Thursday during the
Celtics' unveiling of new free agent Randy Brown. There also were
three seats set aside at the table for the announcement. One of
them went unoccupied. The one for the real leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino was said to have had other plans Thursday. General
manager Chris Wallace said he had a prior engagement. Whatever it
was, it was pressing enough to prevent him from being there when
his new signee was introduced to the media. Maybe this was his way
of allowing the veteran Brown to showcase his acknowledged
leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   Brown represents the last link to the NBA champion Bulls. He won
three rings there and then stayed around for the last two seasons
after the Diaspora. His team won 17 games last season, and,
according to his agent, ``It would have been worse had Randy not
been there. He held it all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership can be a tricky thing. You can be presented as a
leader, but people have to listen to what you have to say. Brown
isn't the first person to be brought into Boston to talk to some of
the young Celtic knuckleheads. He's merely the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, driving around in Philadelphia, Doug Overton said he
had heard about the Brown signing that very morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's it for me,'' he said. It is. He wasn't coming
back anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Overton, too, had been signed because he was a veteran who could
back up Kenny Anderson and give the team some experience. He rarely
got the opportunity. He did stand up to Antoine Walker during that
memorable, Jerry Springer-like bench performance last spring in
Orlando. Pitino promised mass fines and suspensions and then gave
everyone a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the NBA these days,'' Overton said. ``You get young
players who are still young and don't know what it's all about.
They think they do, but they don't. I hope they get it turned it
around up there. I really do. But it's a process. I spent two years
in Philly with Allen (Iverson) and he's still learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they have to understand this,'' Overton said. ``No one guy
can do it alone. Everyone, as individuals, has to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics need someone to give them some perspective about
what life in the NBA is all about. Brown has seen both sides in
just the last three years. But all his words will go for naught if
no one heeds his advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't bark at anyone. I'm not a barker,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to come in here and act as if I invented the game. I'm still
a student. I'm still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics filled more than a few needs with Brown, or as many
needs as you can fill with a player who will average 15 minutes a
game, max. He is a veteran; at 32, only Dana Barros (who now is the
No. 3 point guard) is older. Brown has played in 47 playoff games.
The rest of his Celtic teammates this season have played in 46.
(We're excluding Greg Minor.)
</P>
<P>
   And, Brown does defend. As they liked to say in the old,
``What's My Line?'' show, he does provide a service. He gets in his
opponent's face. He's tough. He likes to play baseline to baseline.
In short, he does what Pitino would like Anderson to do.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Celtics presented him, of course, made you wonder
what stopped Orlando from pursuing him instead of Tracy McGrady.
But that's the nature of these things. The other option was Bimbo
Coles, who also is a veteran, is 32 and can defend. Neither player
will likely produce a rush in ticket orders.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the Celtics were fishing in the same pond as most
everyone else and the pickings were slim. Have you noticed who has
been signed out of the $2.25 million slot: Brown, Tony Delk,
Chauncey Billups, Derek Anderson (for only one year), John Starks,
Sam Perkins, Bobby Jackson. Any of those names excite you?
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were left to pick from the scraps because they
decided to give out long-term deals to Walter McCarty, Tony Battie,
Walker and Vitaly Potapenko as well as take on long-termers in Eric
Williams and Anderson. Those decisions hemmed them in and will
continue to hem them in for the next couple years.
</P>
<P>
   The same person made all those decisions, as well as the one to
bring in Brown. He was the one who wasn't there.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Non-profits are always looking for people willing to stretch
their wallets. Now some are seeking volunteers willing to stretch
their legs as well for a game of ``Who Wants to Pant and Sweat for
Charity?'' If you're willing to run a marathon, the folks at the
Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society, the Arthritis Foundation and the
American Diabetes Association _ to name just a few _ promise to get
you in shape to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Sound interesting? OK, here's where the carrot-and-stick
principle comes into play.
</P>
<P>
   First the incentives: if you sign up, you will get the sense of
accomplishment that you've completed a marathon, a feat which
easily makes many people's ``to do at some point in my lifetime''
list.
</P>
<P>
   While completing this marathon, you will also earn the
satisfaction of knowing that you're running _ or walking, as the
case may be _ to raise money for a worthy cause. In some cases,
you're actually running in honor of a specific individual, or in
that individual's memory.
</P>
<P>
   And if these factors aren't enticing enough, maybe the final
boost will come from knowing your marathon will take place in a
particularly scenic area like Hawaii or Dublin, Ireland. Raise
enough money for the cause, and the organization you're running for
will take care your plane ticket and your hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes your responsibility: discipline and donations. You
have to bring in enough money for the selected charity _ anywhere
from $3,000 to $4,000 _ to qualify for the program. And you'll have
to get yourself in marathon-completing shape. A couple of the
non-profit organizations have training programs in place designed
to provide you with the training and, in many cases, with
fund-raising savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our participants are first-time marathoners,'' says
Maura Krah, director of the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in
Motion. ``You would think runners would be our target audience, but
it's the fund-raising component that gives it more meaning to
people. Fund raising is not something that gets hardcore
marathoners fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a purpose and a reason to go out there and take
49,000 steps and run 26 miles,'' adds Pat Connelly, running coach
for the L.A. Roadrunners and the man who developed the training
program for the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in Motion program.
``One is the satisfaction of using your body, mind and
constitutional strength to go the distance. And you're doing it for
people who are less fortunate, many of whom can't even walk.''
</P>
<P>
   William Cameron found his own incentive. Completing a marathon
was on his wish list even before he became a gunshot victim more
than 10 years ago. Now 56 and gearing up for the Honolulu Marathon
on Dec. 10, Cameron is using the Team in Training program to
complete his first marathon. He has one lung and estimates that he
is 10 years older than his next oldest team member, but he still
plans to finish the 26-mile trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause is worthwhile, and I owe it to myself to get back
into shape,'' says Cameron, a television producer who is raising
money for the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society. ``When people who have
had leukemia go into remission, and they've beaten it and they go
out and take on a marathon, it's a real inspiration to those of us
who don't have to fight that particular life-threatening
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most programs require runners to exercise five days a week, with
a long group run on Saturday mornings. During their training
programs, runners gradually build the time and distance they are
able to cover. Along the way, they meet with running coaches,
physical therapists and nutritionists. Many will participate in
half marathons or 10K runs as a warm-up exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody will say it's easy. With five months of training,
participants will drop out of programs for reasons ranging from
exercise-thwarting injuries (hello, sprained ankle!) to an
inability to generate the necessary money.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Athletes in Action, which raises money for
physically challenged athletes, tries to relax the pressure by
providing periodic rewards so people who come up short can still be
involved. Raise $300 and you get five T-shirts; for $1,200, the
organization will pay your entry fee. But you'll need to come up
with $3,200 for the entire registration/plane fare/hotel
accommodations package.
</P>
<P>

to the starting gate _ whether they run or walk _ finish the
marathon 100 percent of the time, says Lisa Mattasits, campaign
director for the Greater L.A. chapter of the Team in Training
program.

   ``I'm proud of us,'' says Krah. ``It's the people. The more they
learn about the organization, that it truly is a critical
organization in the community, the more attached they become.''

<P>
   It doesn't necessarily take a life-altering experience to get
someone to make some changes. Sometimes simply picking up the paper
will do it.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Heilbrun of Valencia was plugging along in a comfortable
and occasionally high-pressure job as an insurance agent at the
Automobile Club of Southern California. He's a husband and father
of 5-year-old Paige and 7-year-old Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   A self-labeled ``couch potato,'' Heilbrun scrupulously avoided
the Nordic Track that has been collecting dust at the foot of his
bed despite steady reminders from his wife, Lori, that he needed to
exercise more.
</P>
<P>
   Then in March he saw a newspaper ad for marathon training to
benefit AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   Great idea, thought Heilbrun, but not the cause that will get me
into running shoes. A search of the Internet brought up several
non-profit organizations that would help people run a marathon to
benefit their particular causes. But now that he was on the lookout
for marathon matters, Heilbrun spotted the brochure for the
Arthritis Foundation's Joints in Motion program in his dry
cleaners. The Joints in Motion program is a five-month regimen that
promises to get participants in marathon-running shape and pay for
their travel and accommodations, in exchange for a $3,100
fund-raising commitment. His destination race: the Honolulu
Marathon, Dec. 10, 2000. Next year, he might opt to raise funds to
benefit the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or maybe I'll cross the finish line (in Honolulu) and say,
`I'll never do this again in my life,''' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The training regimen, which includes weekly Saturday morning
group runs at Griffith Park, appealed to Heilbrun, who turned 42 in
June. But it was the organization itself that hooked him.
Heilbrun's mother, Shirley, died in 1985 at the age of 65 from side
effects of treatment from rheumatoid arthritis. He'll be running
the race in her memory.
</P>
<P>
   Raising $3,100 is no picnic, but as people from the Joints in
Motion program and any non-profit organization will tell you,
there's no stronger inspiration to train for and complete a 26-mile
grind than if the disease or condition you're raising money to
fight has touched you personally.
</P>
<P>
   And it has. Until his mother began to battle the disease,
Heilbrun said he simply considered arthritis to be among the
regular aches and pains that come with old age. Shirley Heilbrun's
condition made it difficult for her to walk up steps. The side
effects from her treatment included anemia and other blood
complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no viable treatment,'' says Heilbrun, who organized
co-workers to donate blood platelets for his mother's treatment.
``If she was younger, a bone marrow transplant is what they would
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is not, Heilbrun has since learned, simply an old
person's disease. Among the 100 forms of arthritis are such
conditions as juvenile arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia, ankylosing
spondylitis, osteoarthritis and gout.
</P>
<P>
   Once he decided to compete, Heilbrun wasn't simply hooked; he
was positively consumed. He signed up for the Joints in Motion
program early and began running with the Joints in Motion team
preparing for the Dublin Marathon on Oct. 30. He started
frequenting the well-known running store Phidippides Sports Center
in Encino and bought an issue of Runner's World magazine that
promised to guide first-timers, step by step, to their first 5K.
</P>
<P>
   That got Heilbrun walking, then slow running, then finally
participating in a couple of 5K races. He has lost 10 pounds since
March and hopes to lose at least 10 more by December to get down to
a running weight of 145.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man, who, his wife acknowledges, enjoys his leisure
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I first knew him _ and we met in college _
people would say, `Isn't he the guy who's always sleeping on the
couch,''' said Lori Heilbrun. ``One time we were listening to a
band, and he fell asleep on a bar stool. His favorite thing to do
is relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband has started exercise regimens in the past, says
Lori, but they haven't stuck. But this marathon may turn out to be
the wake-up call he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Heilbrun's father suffered a heart attack and a stroke and
diabetes. Even at 42, it's hardly too early for him to be thinking
about staying healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric just knows he's kind of like a walking time bomb unless
he does something,'' says Lori. ``We're very dependent on each
other, and I know I'd just be lost without him. I want my girls to
have a dad.''
</P>
<P>
   A slightly achy right knee notwithstanding, Heilbrun is a couch
potato no longer, although after observing his early marathon
gusto, his Joints in Motion coaches and administrators wonder if he
ever was really slothful to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had to slow him down a little bit. He was going a bit too
fast,'' says his coach Stan Kirschner. ``He's amazed me. For being
a couch potato, he runs pretty good. And he's got the enthusiasm.
If they don't have that, they're not going to make it through the
program.'' &QL;

<P>
   SOUTHWEST HARBOR, Maine _ Like a good barn, a Down East lobster
boat looks better the longer you eyeball it.
</P>
<P>
   The thing does not take your breath away like a Friendship sloop
or a Concordia yawl. It simply is part of the seascape with the
fish and the gulls. That's the point.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, discriminating folk have bought lobster boats as
pleasure craft for their seaworthiness and spare lines. They
appreciate the marriage of form with function and prize the economy
of design.
</P>
<P>
   There is a rich vein of reverse snobbery at work here. By and
large, this has been a sailing crowd who race with skill and cruise
with intimacy off the coast they adore. Their disdain for
``stinkpots'' runs deep. Eventually, though, they ease off sail for
the comfort of motor. But it had better look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not banana-shaped, futuristic-looking things,'' Bruce
Cunningham, owner of Padebco Custom Boats in Round Pond, says about
lobster boats. ``They're a real boat that looks like a real boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to the vagaries of vogue and the torrents of new money, the
secret of the lobster boat is out among the greater public. The
``lobster yacht'' market is booming in boatyards up and down the
Maine coast that sell to clients from the Pacific Northwest to the
Great Lakes and down to Florida. Their boats pop up in Italy and
the Galapagos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has just exploded with the fiberglass hulls,'' says
Lee Wilbur, a veteran builder in Southwest Harbor. ``The demand for
Maine lobster yachts seems to increase every year.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their traditional owners, the boats have
attracted freshly minted millionaires who don't know much except
that they should have one _ often subtly sumptuous affairs that
sell for half a million dollars or more. Ranging from about 20 to
more than 40 feet, they are superb for island-hopping, martinis at
sunset, or fishing offshore in a rolling sea.
</P>
<P>
   Purists bemoan the use of fiberglass in hulls and amenities such
as air conditioning and microwave ovens, but builders just beam and
scour the area for skilled workers to meet the demand. A
prospective buyer can wait a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Just what accounts for this hot market?
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a Land Rover special?'' answers Donnie Ellis, a
second-generation builder in Southwest Harbor. ``You use it for
years in deserts and jungles. You beat the hell out of it and can't
kill it. Same thing with these boats. Commercial fishermen have to
go out in them or they starve.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the Down East hull puts a lot of boat under
the waterline. This does wonders for stability. Glenn Holland, a
builder out of Belfast, estimates that the waterline length of his
38-footer, Spare Parts, is about 37 feet. This is a far cry from
the Ray Hunt-designed deep-V hulls in most power boats, which leave
less of the boat in the water for speed.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a summer lobster boat racing circuit in Maine.
These are torrid affairs, drag races on water where boats top 50
knots for a flat-out run of about a mile. Yachts, these are not.
We're talking working boats stripped for speed, some of which pack
engines upwards of 1,000 horsepower that drink racing fuel and make
so much noise that crew members don headphones to keep their
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise you'd be deaf as a flounder,'' observes Holland,
whose 32-foot Red Baron has been the scourge of the unlimited
gasoline class this year.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of speed extends beyond the racing circuit and
permeates the entire lobster yacht market. The engines are bigger
than ever, producing top speeds close to 30 knots. Where 200
horsepower was once the norm, today lobster yachts routinely top
400 and can cruise at more than 20 knots.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lynch, who is on his fourth Wilbur boat, has an
800-horsepower engine on his 38-footer. ``I'll admit to 900,''
Holland says.
</P>
<P>
   Constellations of lobster yacht builders dot the Maine coast.
You've got the Beal clan all over Beals Island and Jonesport. One
of the biggest hubs is Southwest Harbor, where Chester Clement
began building lobster boats in the 1930s, followed by the
memorable team of Raymond Bunker and Ralph Ellis, and then Ralph
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ellis's son, Donnie, continues the family tradition,
albeit in fiberglass, down the road from Wilbur. They are joined by
a handful of other builders in the area. Stanley is still building
in wood. At 71, he is the dean of the wooden boat builders in the
area and has been honored by the National Endowment for the Arts
for his skills.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tight breed. Donnie Ellis's mother was a Beal. His father
designed a hull for Wilbur, and his brother was in business with
Wilbur for a while. So if a prospective client chooses Wilbur over
him, Ellis can live with it. ``It's still part of the family,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Such largesse does not extend to Hinckley Co., the giant
boatyard a quarter-mile from the Ellis yard. Hinckley has
revolutionized _ some say adulterated _ the lobster yacht market
with its wildly popular Picnic Boat (a Hinckley trademark name that
Wilbur says he and others used informally for years).
</P>
<P>
   The Picnic is a 36-foot confection of Kevlar, fiberglass, and
carbon _ usually powered by a 420-horsepower jet engine _ that
maneuvers like a quarterhorse. It has a mere 18-inch draft. The jet
allows it to skim over lobster pots that are snagged in the
propellers of traditional lobster boats.
</P>
<P>
   A bowthruster, a small propeller located in the bow to ease the
embarrassment of docking for the neophyte, is standard. (They are
increasingly popular in other lobster yachts as well.) Like the
boats of Ellis and Wilbur, they are studies in teak, mahogany, and
cherry.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Bennett, Hinckley's director of sales and marketing,
likens the lobster yacht craze to the mushrooming sport utility
vehicle market: ``SUVs are trucks with creature comforts.'' Lobster
yachts, in turn, are commercial boats with stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Lobster yacht chic, he says, is a result of evaporating leisure
time in the United States. ``Someone promised us more free time and
paper-free offices. It didn't happen,'' he says. ``With less time,
people want to get out on the water faster. This is simpler than
sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists concede the Picnic is easy on the eye, but they
maintain its light weight _ 11,000 pounds _ and relatively narrow
beam provide for an unamusing experience when the wind blows hard.
And they howl at the gall of Hinckley to call it a lobster yacht in
the first place. Its bloodlines, they say, lie elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a lobster boat model,'' Stanley says. Adds Wilbur:
``It is absolutely different. It has more relevance to the old Gar
Wood, Chris-Craft-type bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   And it attracts a different kind of buyer, often a first-time
owner with little water experience.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Hinckley, whose high-performance sailboats are
recognized throughout the world, could care less. The company makes
about 40 Picnic Boats a year at $400,000 a pop, and people get in
line to buy one. It has sold 178 since the model first appeared in
1994. A new 44-foot model, the Talaria, boasts double jet engines,
a top speed of 32 knots, and myriad amenities for about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley defends the performance of its Picnic in heavy weather
by arguing that width alone does not determine stability. ``People
say you need a wide hull to be stable,'' Bennett says. ``But if you
have a low center of gravity, you get the same effect.'' Bennett
adds that the Picnic engine is mounted very low, creating
stability.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the complaint against Hinckley's lobster yachts is
less about seaworthiness than the damage done to the ethos of
custom boat building in Maine, the soul of small yards. ``They've
practically got them on the shelf,'' Stanley says.
</P>
<P>
   But the range of lobster boats being built these days is
striking. Indeed, it is an aesthetic stretch from Stanley's spare
wooden confections to the fuller fiberglass boats of Ellis and
Wilbur and on to the glitz and technology of Hinckley. There has
been enough business for all concerned, but Ellis, for one, worries
about a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a false economy,'' he says. ``I lost $750,000 with the
drop in the Nasdaq last spring. I had two guys who wrote out checks
and then had to call up and ask for them back.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Hinckley assembly line in high gear, Stanley remains a
magnificent dinosaur across the harbor. He disdains what he
considers the bloated look of the newer lobster yachts and despises
fiberglass. ``The pleasure boats are out of balance. There's too
much stuff in them,'' he says. ``That's why they've made them so
wide. But they don't handle well.''
</P>
<P>
   And he minces no words about fiberglass: ``I don't like the
smell of it. I don't like the itch of it. And you build the same
damned thing over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley doesn't even like the term ``lobster yacht.'' ``It's
either a yacht or a boat,'' he snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, lobster boats continue to seduce with their long,
lean looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enthralled by them,'' says Tom Ewens, a philosophy
professor at the Rhode Island School of Design who fell in love
with a 36-foot Harold Gower boat and bought it two years ago. It
needed a lot of work and has eaten a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not perfectly rational decisions,'' he concedes.

By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Non-profits are always looking for people willing to stretch
their wallets. Now some are seeking volunteers willing to stretch
their legs as well for a game of ``Who Wants to Pant and Sweat for
Charity?'' If you're willing to run a marathon, the folks at the
Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society, the Arthritis Foundation and the
American Diabetes Association _ to name just a few _ promise to get
you in shape to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Sound interesting? OK, here's where the carrot-and-stick
principle comes into play.
</P>
<P>
   First the incentives: if you sign up, you will get the sense of
accomplishment that you've completed a marathon, a feat which
easily makes many people's ``to do at some point in my lifetime''
list.
</P>
<P>
   While completing this marathon, you will also earn the
satisfaction of knowing that you're running _ or walking, as the
case may be _ to raise money for a worthy cause. In some cases,
you're actually running in honor of a specific individual, or in
that individual's memory.
</P>
<P>
   And if these factors aren't enticing enough, maybe the final
boost will come from knowing your marathon will take place in a
particularly scenic area like Hawaii or Dublin, Ireland. Raise
enough money for the cause, and the organization you're running for
will take care your plane ticket and your hotel accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes your responsibility: discipline and donations. You
have to bring in enough money for the selected charity _ anywhere
from $3,000 to $4,000 _ to qualify for the program. And you'll have
to get yourself in marathon-completing shape. A couple of the
non-profit organizations have training programs in place designed
to provide you with the training and, in many cases, with
fund-raising savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our participants are first-time marathoners,'' says
Maura Krah, director of the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in
Motion. ``You would think runners would be our target audience, but
it's the fund-raising component that gives it more meaning to
people. Fund raising is not something that gets hardcore
marathoners fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a purpose and a reason to go out there and take
49,000 steps and run 26 miles,'' adds Pat Connelly, running coach
for the L.A. Roadrunners and the man who developed the training
program for the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in Motion program.
``One is the satisfaction of using your body, mind and
constitutional strength to go the distance. And you're doing it for
people who are less fortunate, many of whom can't even walk.''
</P>
<P>
   William Cameron found his own incentive. Completing a marathon
was on his wish list even before he became a gunshot victim more
than 10 years ago. Now 56 and gearing up for the Honolulu Marathon
on Dec. 10, Cameron is using the Team in Training program to
complete his first marathon. He has one lung and estimates that he
is 10 years older than his next oldest team member, but he still
plans to finish the 26-mile trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cause is worthwhile, and I owe it to myself to get back
into shape,'' says Cameron, a television producer who is raising
money for the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society. ``When people who have
had leukemia go into remission, and they've beaten it and they go
out and take on a marathon, it's a real inspiration to those of us
who don't have to fight that particular life-threatening
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most programs require runners to exercise five days a week, with
a long group run on Saturday mornings. During their training
programs, runners gradually build the time and distance they are
able to cover. Along the way, they meet with running coaches,
physical therapists and nutritionists. Many will participate in
half marathons or 10K runs as a warm-up exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody will say it's easy. With five months of training,
participants will drop out of programs for reasons ranging from
exercise-thwarting injuries (hello, sprained ankle!) to an
inability to generate the necessary money.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Athletes in Action, which raises money for
physically challenged athletes, tries to relax the pressure by
providing periodic rewards so people who come up short can still be
involved. Raise $300 and you get five T-shirts; for $1,200, the
organization will pay your entry fee. But you'll need to come up
with $3,200 for the entire registration/plane fare/hotel
accommodations package.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the challenging requirements, program directors say
their ranks are growing. Both the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society and
the Arthritis Foundation have added chapters throughout California
and out of state as the number of participants has grown. With 57
chapters throughout the United States, the Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma's
Team in Training program boasts 75 percent of the people who sign
up for the training program make it to the race. Those who make it
to the starting gate _ whether they run or walk _ finish the
marathon 100 percent of the time, says Lisa Mattasits, campaign
director for the Greater L.A. chapter of the Team in Training
program.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent participant in the train-and-run-for-charity
business, the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in Motion program, is
also thriving, increasing from three training sites in Southern
California raising $400,000 for arthritis research during the first
year of participation to nine sites and a projected $1.2 million
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of us,'' says Krah. ``It's the people. The more they
learn about the organization, that it truly is a critical
organization in the community, the more attached they become.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal connection is also a key factor with Team Diabetes, the
American Diabetes Association's training program now in its second
year of training and sending runners to destinations around the
world. At the recently concluded Kona Marathon, 1,000 of the 1,200
participants were Team Diabetes runners, said ADA spokeswoman Marcy
Woodhull.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Marathon brings in more than $1 million for 50
charities each year, says Marie Patrick, executive vice president,
who adds that a surge in participation in the past five years is
largely a result of a wave of charity runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very supportive of these programs and the people they
train,'' says Patrick. ``From the staging of a marathon
perspective, you have a lot more people running at slower times
because these aren't world-class runners. These are average
citizens running for whatever their cause is. How can you not
support them?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not there is a link between running a marathon and
philanthropy, the number of people participating in marathons is
also growing. In 1980, 120,000 people completed marathons in the
United States. That number increased to 250,000 in 1989 and
ballooned to 435,000 in 1999, according to Ryan Lamppa, a
researcher for the USA Track &AMP; Field's Road Running Information
Center in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Running and charity is a natural marriage, says Lamppa. These
non-profits simply found intriguing ways to bring the two together.
</P>
<P>
   ``As marathons started showing signs of a second boom, training
programs started developing across the country,'' Lamppa said.
``Someone with Team in Training saw this growth and said, `What if
we put together a training program and went out and pitched it?' It
was a good idea, and it worked really well.''
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of non profits fighting for limited number of
donation dollars, program directors acknowledge that _ worthiness
of a cause notwithstanding _ the various programs are competitors.
Where one program will boast greater access to hands-on training,
another will tout a low expense ratio. From the participant's
perspective, an extra day of touring abroad may appeal to some,
while others will prefer the bare bones, more-money-for-the-cause
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leukemia and AIDS _ they're all very similar to ours and
they're all great causes,'' says running coach Connelly. ``With the
individual attention we give, we just try to give (participants) a
little more.'' &QL;

TAMMY FAYE, BEHIND THE MAKEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
EYES OF TAMMY FAYE 
Documentary directed by: Randy Barbato &AMP; Fenton Bailey 
Narrated by: RuPaul Charles 
Running time: 79 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some sexual content) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At one point toward the end of ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'' the
title-roleist shoos away a Los Angeles makeup man engaged in giving
her a new look and says, ``I get so sick of this Hollywood crap! I
like real!'' Then, a moment later, she adds, with a little
self-deprecating laugh, ``That's why I wear all these wigs.''
There'll always be room in America for a rogue who has the good
sense to laugh publicly at his or her own roguishness. If Randy
Barbato and Fenton Bailey began their documentary by regarding
Tammy Faye Bakker Messner as the campy essence of ambulatory
American kitsch, they quickly were won over by her survivor's
toughness. ``The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' is a lively and affectionate
cross between an infomercial and a genuflection.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are those mascara-laden eyes, with their huge
cowcatcher lashes that became a trademark when Tammy Faye sang and
banged the tambourine while her televangelist husband, Jim Bakker,
exhorted the faithful to keep the money flowing. No small part of
this film involves payback for Tammy Faye, who may or may not have
known about the shady side of her husband's PTL televangelism
empire, which at one time included a theme park and resort and was
eating up a million a week. Eventually, it all came crashing down.
Bakker was sent to prison for fraud following his bankruptcy,
divorce, and tabloid-fueled scandal tied to a $265,000 hush money
payment to Jessica Hahn. Tammy Faye entered the Betty Ford clinic
for prescription drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a dozen years later, she's seen repairing her relationship
with her grown daughter and son, recalling teary-eyed how Bakker's
big-bucks fever left her and the children in the dirt, and making
it clear that she has weathered adversity before and will weather
it again. First of eight children born into modest circumstances in
Minnesota, she married Bakker when she was 17. They clicked on Pat
Robertson's TV channel, only to be ousted by the presumably jealous
Robertson. Undeterred, the Bakkers founded the Trinity Broadcasting
Network, only to be bumped from it, too, by greedy partners. Third
time lucky. They founded the PTL Network and it took off. Old video
clips indicate that Tammy Faye played no small role in its success.
While Bakker provided the slickness and drive, Tammy Faye softened
the huckstering with her singing and open emotionalism. Between
them, they made Elmer Gantry look like Tiny Tim.
</P>
<P>
   After Bakker's downfall, the PTL was ripe for the picking, and,
according to Tammy Faye, Jerry Falwell came along, shut it down and
got its board of directors to bounce the Bakkers. Falwell was
careful to declare that he was, in effect, putting a successful
commercial rival out of business from only the most Christian of
motives. Tammy Faye, who married PTL board member Roe Messner,
himself shortly thereafter jailed for financial misdeeds, learned
from Falwell. When she cites his misdeeds to a congregeation in
Oklahoma, she ends her litany by piously concluding that it would
do no good to hate him.
</P>
<P>
   One comes away from the film convinced that serving as Jesus'
self-appointed middleman on TV is a lucrative but cutthroat
business and that Tammy Faye is a lot hardier than she first seemed
when the Bakkers' troubles first came to light in the '80s. Jim
Bakker, interviewed after his release from prison, still seems a
snake-oil salesman. Tammy Faye, who firmly believes that you don't
have to look dowdy to be a Christian, is much more ingratiating
because she convinces people she's connecting with them on an
empathetic emotional level. She's persuasive in her
self-salesmanship and image rehabbing because she obviously isn't
putting on an act, but has internalized her litany of suffering and
forbearance and tells her story with real conviction. You can't not
admire her tenacity and spirit, even as you note her convenient
myopia on several issues. Tammy Faye clearly believes in Tammy
Faye, even when nobody else does.

WILL COUNTRY SURVIVE GARTH BROOKS?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the curtain came up on the 35th annual Academy of Country
Music awards last May at the Universal Amphitheatre, country icons
George Strait and Alan Jackson tore into ``Murder on Music Row,''
the controversial song that bemoans the fact that ``someone killed
country music, cut out its heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Academy members stood and applauded when the song ended. And
then they gave their top prizes that evening to Shania Twain, Faith
Hill, Tim McGraw and Lonestar, acts that are about as country as a
four-course meal with Donald Trump in a French restaurant. The
message to traditionalists like Strait and Jackson was loud and
clear: Nice song, passe sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   But in its headstrong rush to move units and gain mass
acceptance, Nashville may well be alienating the core group of fans
who are most loyal to the music. Southland country radio certainly
has lost its luster. One station, Orange County-based KIK-FM
(94.3), recently switched formats because of anemic ratings, and
another, KZLA (93.9), may soon be following suit. That would leave
Riverside's KFRG (95.1) as the area's only country station.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous slump all over the country,'' says
Bill Mack, whose ``Country Crossroads'' syndicated radio show is
heard on more than 800 stations. ``The problem is that the radio
stations play the same songs, and all the songs sound pretty much
the same. The product is hurting, and the music companies and radio
stations are doing a pretty good job of destroying it even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds journalist Stacy Harris, whose ``Stacy's Music Row Report''
Internet newsletter is Nashville's equivalent of ``The Drudge
Report,'' ``Country music has always been cyclical. Where the focus
was once attaining respectability, the goal is now to find and
maintain an audience that is much larger and much younger than is
realistic for the format to sustain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The result,'' Harris continues, ``is that the young audience
continues to be fickle _ and therefore unpredictable _ while the
older, loyal audience is turning away as it can no longer identify
with either the new artists or their music.''
</P>
<P>
   Country's last boom/bust period came in the wake of ``Urban
Cowboy,'' mechanical bulls and J.R. Ewing. Bland,
middle-of-the-road ballads and rock-tinged anthems ruled the day
until new traditionalists like Randy Travis, Dwight Yoakam and
Strait came along in the mid- to late-'80s and reworked the genre's
classic sound into new and fresh music that was still pure country.
</P>
<P>
   Then Garth Brooks hit it big and country music never has quite
recovered. Brooks' blend of pop, folk, rock and honky-tonk made him
Nashville's biggest superstar, becoming the first country artist to
debut a record at the top of the charts (``Ropin' the Wind,''
1992).
</P>
<P>
   But Brooks' mass appeal came with a price _ namely, the music.
The more albums Brooks sold, the more he became obsessed with chart
positions and gimmick marketing. Essentially, he has become the
McDonald's of modern music, his laser focus trained not on the
songs, but on the number of units sold as he edges closer and
closer to the Beatles' all-time record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth Brooks might have been the best and worst thing to
happen to country music in its history,'' says John Malone, program
director for Nashville's legendary country radio station WSM-AM,
originator of the Grand Ole Opry. ``Record companies became so
dazzled by his success that they're now focusing on developing acts
that are marketable to the masses instead of looking at what's
special about country music. In the process, the music has lost a
lot of its identity and become so much cookie-cutter product.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more evident than the tightly formatted
playlists of country radio, which seems to repeat the same 40 songs
by pop-oriented acts like Twain, Hill and a dozen other
interchangeable acts on a continuous loop throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the artists sound so much alike, I don't know who's
singing half the time _ and I'm a disc jockey,'' Mack says
ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder on Music Row,'' written by songwriting great and
bluegrass artist Larry Cordle along with Larry Shell, submits that
``old Hank (Williams) wouldn't have a chance on today's radio'' and
that, likewise, living legends Merle Haggard and George Jones would
be told to ``pack up and go back home.''
</P>
<P>
   The song hardly exaggerates the case since none of these artists
_ even Jones, who just took home a Grammy for his most recent album
_ can find any airplay on country hit radio stations like KZLA. The
situation is so comically dire that after Johnny Cash's
``Unchained'' won the Grammy in 1998 for best country album, his
record company took out a full-page advertisement in Billboard
``thanking'' country radio for its support. The photo with the ad
(taken during Cash's legendary San Quentin concert) showed Cash
defiantly giving the camera his middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through research, we just don't see enough of a call to play
the older songs,'' says KZLA program director R.J. Curtis. ``That's
not to say we don't like that music. But somebody like Johnny Cash
would sound too extreme next to most of the music we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas radio personality Mark Edwards, who hosts the syndicated
``Country Coast To Coast'' program, concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not driving 1957 automobiles are we?'' Edwards asks.
``Music changes.''
</P>
<P>
   But for programmers like Mack and Malone, juxtaposing a singer
like Cash with modern artists who stay true to country's traditions
(the Dixie Chicks, Brooks and Dunn, Montgomery Gentry) has proved
to be a winning formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also expose listeners to a lot of great new music not
getting airplay on country hit radio,'' WSM's Malone says, citing
Dolly Parton's bluegrass album and Loretta Lynn's new single,
``Country In My Genes'' as a couple of examples.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Mack: ``We get a tremendous response to the older songs and
it's not limited to the older audience. College students call all
the time to request Hank Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ratings for both WSM and Mack's program show strong
support from 25- to 54-year-old listeners, radio's most desirable
demographic. The reason behind the healthy listenership isn't hard
to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great songs, great singers,'' journalist Harris says.
</P>
<P>
   Just how timeless the music is can be heard in Columbia Legacy's
marvelous American Milestones reissue series. The label recently
remastered a second batch of classic country albums, including
Willie Nelson's wistful concept collection ``Red Headed Stranger,''
Jones' 1980 landmark ``I Am What I Am'' and the complete version of
Cash's classic San Quentin concert. This is enduring music, as
vital today as when it was made decades ago. But you'll have to buy
the albums to hear the songs; country hit radio won't play them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't seem to get it,'' says Londoner Alfred
Kennedy, whose first exposure to country music came courtesy of Los
Angeles' once-great country station, KLAC (570-AM). ``In London, we
have one country station, and it's not constrained by playlists,
just listeners' tastes, which is as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent millennial vote, listeners of this London country
station (Ritz Country 1035-AM) named Jones' ``She Stopped Loving Me
Today,'' a classic tale of heartbreak found on ``I Am What I Am,''
as the song of the century. But KZLA's Curtis says that the
20-year-old song has no place on his station's playlist, despite
its enduring appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this marketplace, you need songs that attract a mass
audience,''Curtis says. ``You want the traditional country sound,
but listeners don't want a format dominated by songs that are too
twangy, particularly here in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the twang, KZLA's ratings aren't particularly
stellar. The station came in 20th in the most recent Arbitron
report, and its new owner, Emmis Communications, is rumored to be
mulling a format change to a mix of Spanish and English pop music.
</P>
<P>
   Harris says the decline of local country radio isn't surprising;
the situation is occurring throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two audiences, the core country fans and then the
people who couldn't name an artist until Garth Brooks came along,''
Harris says. ``The record companies and radio stations are chasing
the latter audience, and the real fans are being left out in the
cold. And they're not happy about it, which is reflected in low
ratings and poor record sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Will stations be able to hold on until country's next boom?
KZLA's Curtis, who has been with the station on and off since 1980,
believes his signal will stay country; Nashville's Malone thinks
new artists like Brad Paisley will rejuvenate the genre's
traditional sound.
</P>
<P>
   Mack's optimism, though, is guarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always taken that traditional country sound to bring the
music back,'' Mack says. ``But right now, nobody wants to take a
chance and play the music people are asking for. A DJ at one of the
FM stations in Dallas was telling me that on the weekends they play
Hank Williams and Hank Snow because the station doesn't take the
ratings seriously on the weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``'We get to play the music people want to hear,' this guy tells
me. I told him to think about that statement, because it's that
kind of backward thinking that has got us in the fix that we're
in.''!end! &QL;

THE OLD MEN AND THE SKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SPACE COWBOYS 
Directed by: Clint Eastwood 
Screenplay by: Ken Kaufman &AMP; Howard Klausner 
Starring: Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, James
Garner, Marcia Gay Harden, William Devane, Loren Dean, Courtney B.
Vance, James Cromwell 
Running time: 123 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When obsolete technology needs fixing, who ya gonna call? The
over-the-hill gang, that's who. That's the launching pad for
``Space Cowboys,'' Clint Eastwood's new movie about geezer heroics
in space. How they refrained from calling it ``The Ripe Stuff''
we'll never know. One reason it works as well as it does is that
while many stars try to deny advancing age, Eastwood, ever the
pragmatist, uses it. When he's reluctantly called back to NASA to
fix a crippled Russian space station whose guidance system is so
old that only he can remember it, James Cromwell's summoning
bureaucrat can't resist needling him. ``How many years has it been
since you retired? Five?'' ``Four,'' Eastwood's retired astronaut
replies, underplaying what clearly is his annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space Cowboys'' isn't the John Glenn story in quadruplicate,
even after Eastwood gathers his former and in some cases
cantankerous old team consisting of Tommy Lee Jones's hot-rodding
test pilot, whose throttle-jockeying got them all grounded; Donald
Sutherland's ladies' man of a systems designer, whose
aviator-rimmed glasses can't conceal the thickness of their lenses;
and James Garner's navigator turned preacher, the only one of the
four remotely content with his newfound lot in life. The film
begins with a black and white flashback to 1958, to the tune of
``Fly Me to the Moon.'' Scarcely have they left Earth's atmosphere,
however, than they're ingloriously replaced by jump-suited,
space-helmeted chimps.
</P>
<P>
   One of the film's jokes is that the ex-astronauts' old feuds are
livelier than they now are. These involve Eastwood's with Jones and
everybody's with Cromwell _ the paper-shuffler they all feel knifed
them in the back. The film takes rather too long setting the stage
for the long-postponed space shot they regard as unfinished
business. It lingers too lovingly on the comedy of decrepitude as
they huff and puff their way into shape and slog through their
training courses. En route, there's a romance between Jones's
ornery widower and Marcia Gay Harden's scientist. She's on the
old-timers' side, as opposed to Cromwell, who'd like to see them
flunk out so he can use a pair of young hotshots he feels he can
control once Eastwood's loose-cannon veteran has told them what to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Matters become more pulse-quickening when the film turns away
from character sketching and becomes much more conventional and
generic, namely in space. There it quickly becomes apparent that
the repairs prove much more fraught with complication than anyone
supposed, except perhaps Rade Serebija's taciturn Russian general,
there as an observer with a piece of bad news he had hoped he
wouldn't have to reveal. ``Space Cowboys'' has a meandering first
half with savory moments, and a much less original, but more
suspenseful second half. As usual, Eastwood's economy of gesture
both behind and in front of the camera is a pleasure in itself.
``Space Cowboys'' does achieve liftoff, even if just barely.

HOW YOU GONNA KEEP 'EM DOWN ON THE FARM?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Jimmy and Doug's Farmclub.com seemed to some like an Internet
vanity project when it kicked off Jan. 31, observers could be
forgiven their assumptions. Despite the down-home name, the people
behind the company were anything but just plain folks.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy is Jimmy Iovine, who heads Interscope-Geffen-A&AMP;M Records.
Doug is Doug Morris, Iovine's boss and head of Universal Music
Group, the biggest record company on the planet (though the
AOL/Time-Warner-Turner/EMI aggregation may win that title).
</P>
<P>
   And of course, though the Farmclub was a quasi-independent, kind
of low-key operation designed to help unknown bands percolate up
into the cultural consciousness, it was backed by two media giants
that are very much above ground _ Universal and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to jump between old and new media, with the deep
pockets of big boys but not the procedural and organizational
limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, at www.farmclub.com, specializes in letting
no-name bands build audiences. There's a weekly music show,
``Farmclub.com,'' on the USA Network showcasing those no-names in
and among big-time acts like Dr. Dre, Bare Naked Ladies and 98
Degrees. And there's a record label that signs the best of the
up-and-comers (though controversy broke out when Farmclub's new
deals didn't look much better for bands than those of older record
labels).
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, how's the ''vanity project'' going?
</P>
<P>
   Probably well enough to swell anyone's ego, according to
Farmclub president Andy Schuon, at least within the narrow
demographic areas the company has initially targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Most months, the Web site ranks somewhere among the top five
music-oriented Net destinations, said Schuon, a top programming
veteran of MTV and Los Angeles radio power KROQ-FM. Farmclub.com in
June received about 1.1 million unique visitors (the industry
measurement for the number of different individuals logging on to a
site), according to one ratings service, though Farmclub people say
their own numbers are significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The TV show, which runs Monday nights after USA's wrestling
programming, trails only wrestling shows in attracting male cable
viewers 12 to 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
   And the record label has signed four acts already, with the
first one, Sonique, about to go gold (that's 500,000 records sold).
</P>
<P>
   The label benefits from the show and Web site immensely, as
demonstrated by recent comments from Dynamite Hack, a band that
signed with Farmclub because, as one member said on the syndicated
radio show ``Loveline'' recently, ``We had a choice (of labels) and
decided to go with the one that had the TV show.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Dynamite Hack's album was released, Farmclub.com ran a
10-part series of short pieces to help site users get an idea of
the band, said Schuon. That sort of online spade work helps fans
connect to a band even before they've heard much of its music.
</P>
<P>
   During a Farmclub taping last weekend at the Universal lot,
Schuon showed off the newest gimmick, five specially rigged and
painted VW Beetles whose two-person driving teams will be
criss-crossing the country the next 2 1/2 months, meeting with
bands while talking with Farmclubbers all over, both directly and
through the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Farmclub.com visitors can track the cars' locations online
through GPS receivers and connect to them through a variety of
wireless and satellite links. Built-in computers, microphones and
video cameras will keep the cars in contact with the Web site
pretty much all the time. There are even TV sets in the trunk
playing show episodes that are stored on the computers.
</P>
<P>
   The TV show has concentrated on music that runs from ``more
active rock, harder-edged pop, hip-hop, alternative rock, r&AMP;b,''
Schuon said. ``We thought we would go where we could get an
audience fairly quickly and grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's offerings are much broader, dipping into an array of
quieter genres that would never play for the testosterone-addled
crowd jamming to the vigorous raps of Busta Rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, Farmclub.com is one of the first legitimate
cross-media success stories, which is good news for Net users who'd
like to (ITAL)see(END ITAL) a success or two. The bad news, of
course, is that it took two behemoths _ Universal and AOL _ and a
boost from two old-media standbys, a record company and TV show, to
start reeling in the Web audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But after all the dot-com madness settles out in the next year
or two, I suspect this kind of almost-underground, intermedia
operation will be much more common, and often with the old-line
names behind what eventually surfaces. Farmclub, which appears
ready for the big leagues already, is likely to interest
competitors and copycats soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do feel it's working,'' Schuon said. ``The traffic numbers
are up, the ad revenues, the (TV) ratings, etc., are all ahead of
our projections. We're extremely thrilled.'' &QL;

SHOWTIME CAN REALLY KILL AN EVENING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sun., Aug. 6) 
Our rating: 1 1/2 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``One Kill'' is one of those legal dramas where little slivers
of information trickle out in a dramatically convenient but
logically baffling manner _ even though the facts seem to easily
exonerate the accused, she's so stupid she withholds them until
they blow up in her defense attorney's face.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Heche plays a Marine captain accused of murdering a
superior (Sam Shepard). Her defense attorney (Eric Stolz) can only
watch with befuddlement as he slowly discovers that she got some
ammunition the day of the murder _ and, oh, yeah, that she had had
an affair with the victim (he woos her, music swelling, with a box
of Kentucky Fried Chicken). Oh, and that he was violently unhinged.
Forgot to mention that part.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, ``One Kill'' _ ``based,'' God knows how loosely, on
a ``true story'' _ wants to be a sort of paranoid persecution
fantasy about how much tougher it is for women than for men in the
Marine Corps. True, particularly when they murder well-liked,
good-old-boy colonels and refuse, for reasons of some ill-defined
principle, to mount a defense for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The cast in general _ but Stolz in particular _ walk through
their parts as if on an afternoon stroll. This lack of commitment
and tension suggests the title refers to what you've done to your
evening should you watch this snoozer. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``One Kill.'' &QL; 
What: Docudrama about a female military officer's legal ordeal
after killing an attacker in self-defense. &QL; 
The stars: Anne Heche, Eric Stolz, Sam Shepard. &QL;

MILLEN GETS THE CALL TO MAKE THE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the day, networks used two, maybe three cameras to cover
NFL games. Nowadays, networks use as many as 10 to cover
regular-season games and about 30 for playoff and Super Bowl
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Every angle has been covered, with one exception: the officials.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Yessiree. Blame it on the Internet. Blame it on network
executives' burning desire to give viewers value-added coverage and
a you-were-there feeling. Whatever it is, game officials now are
being equipped with cameras, and, to be honest, it's not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the referee cam's shaky debut on ABC's ``Monday Night
Football.'' Rest assured that those transmission bugs will be
worked out. The potential for these cameras is enormous. The images
shot from the camera afixed to the referee's cap captured the speed
of the game unlike anything seen before on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The referee cam soon will be right up there with the yellow
on-screen stripe ESPN has been using to help viewers keep tabs on
how much yardage is needed for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will use the referee cam this exhibition season as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports will take it a step further in a couple of weeks.
Color analyst Matt Millen will work as a game official during the
third quarter of the Patriots-Tampa Bay exhibition Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Millen has been in training for the last two months, including a
stint at the NFL's annual Officials Clinic in Dallas and several
days at the training camps of the Oakland Raiders, San Francisco
49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, and Washington Redskins. ``I didn't
know what to expect from Matt when he first arrived,'' said Jerry
Seeman, the league's senior director of officiating. ``But he
really worked hard and may have developed another career for
himself if he ever decides to leave the booth.''
</P>
<P>
   For Millen, the training was amazing. ``The hand signals,
convening with the other officials _ it's an aspect of the game I
thought I fully understood. Nope. I now have a completely different
perspective on football,'' he said. ``I wish I knew what I know now
when I was a young player, because I would have been able to get
away with a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Fox analyst John Madden wonders whether Millen will have
a flashback to his playing days once he steps on the field. ``Matt
was such a competitive player,'' said Madden, ``I hope he remembers
that he's not allowed to tackle anyone out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Millen does still have aggressive tendencies, even seeing the
game from a different angle. ``These guys (linemen and running
backs) are doing stuff today that I used to take guys out for,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. Millen has been amazingly restrained, even
acknowledging, ``Last week I was run over by 49ers receiver Terrell
Owens.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Terry Glenn can do the same Aug. 20 _ and the camera can
capture it.

THE ULTIMATE HOW-TO MANUAL
</HEADLINE>
  Teaching the reader to kill 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below. `Tonight' refers to Sun., Aug. 6) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can words kill and, if so, can those behind the words be found
liable for their actions? We've seen two sleazy jabberfests in the
past few years provoke _ no matter how peripherally _ murders.
``The Jenny Jones Show'' was ordered to pay a huge settlement to
the family of a victim it set up to unwittingly humiliate a guest;
just last week, one of ``Jerry Springer's'' usual family squabbles
turned lethal when two guests murdered another mere hours after a
taping.
</P>
<P>
   There also exist a couple of spurious lawsuits against
filmmakers, namely those behind ``Natural Born Killers'' and ``The
Basketball Diaries,'' suggesting that some already unhinged viewers
saw these movies and elected to ape them in real life, with real
death.
</P>
<P>
   But those cases were just examples of amoral hosts or
exploitative movies ratcheting up the tension bubbling inside human
pressure cookers, not specifically suggesting that problems can
really be resolved with a humble little homicide or two. In the
'90s, a seedy little publisher called Paladin Enterprises published
a how-to manual on murder, which demonstrated, step by step, not
only the most efficient way to kill someone but also listed every
safeguard to prevent authorities from tying prospective assassins
to their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit Man: A Technical Manual for Independent Contractors,'' in
fact, did show the way for one two-bit punk, who iced a family at
the behest of its estranged father. While a violent movie could be
said, on the vaguest level imaginable, to inspire some idiot to
take up arms, it also shows the bad guys getting caught, which, in
the eyes of most, would take the glamour out of committing such
acts. Paladin incited violence by insisting !ital!you could get
away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliberate Intent'' _ the first film from cable's FX _ is a
surprisingly thought-provoking drama by TV standards, exploring a
highly controversial and compelling issue that pushes at the
boundaries of the First Amendment. Timothy Hutton stars as Rod
Smolla, a top First Amendment attorney who, after reading ``Hit
Man'' and hearing the particulars of the murders, decides to argue
seemingly against the very thing he has built his career and
reputation eloquently protecting.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Rifkin co-stars as Howard Siegel, the unctuously
self-righteous attorney who drags Smolla into his ethical dilemma.
``NYPD Blue's'' James McDaniel walks on the other side of the law
with his performance as L.T. Horn, the man who contracts the hit on
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Briskly and efficiently, with crisply delivered dialogue,
``Deliberate Intent'' bounces around chronologically and covers a
lot of ground _ the police investigation that led to the arrest of
Horn and his hired gun (Clark Johnson), the passages in the book
that led the killer to his prey, the First Amendment arguments that
initially suggested to the court that even speech as repugnant as
``Hit Man'' was nonetheless protected, and the appellate process.
It's grim and riveting stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And, ironically, given that more people will see this tonight
than had ever probably even heard of Paladin Press and ``Hit Man,''
with its paragraph-by-paragraph re-creation of key passages from
the book, ``Deliberate Intent'' is potentially more dangerous than
the publishing slimeballs ever were. Of course, should it actually
inspire someone to commit murder, I'm sure the filmmakers will
stand behind their First Amendment rights. &QL; 
_____ &QL; 
The show: ``Deliberate Intent.'' &QL;

released a how-to manual on murder. &QL;

women are rarely mentioned in these Good Ol' Days rants.)
</P>
<P>
   You can count on hearing from these grumpy folks at this time
each summer. It's inevitable. Baseball and football usually have
their Hall of Fame induction ceremonies a couple of weekends apart.
Understandably, this is a time for celebration, nostalgia, and
contributing to oral tradition by spinning old stories. But the
problems arise when former athletes and current fans get Hall of
Fame Hangover, which leads to a foolish cliched bashing of all
things 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So now we hear from NFL Hall of Famer Deacon Jones that he
couldn't play today, even for a billion dollars. He would be fined,
he said, because he couldn't play by the soft rules. Nor could he
deal with players dancing in the end zone. We hear from NFL Hall of
Famer Chuck Bednarik that players are ``pussyfoots'' because so
many of them are specialists, unlike rugged two-way star Bednarik.
</P>
<P>
   Blah.
</P>
<P>
   Blah.
</P>
<P>
   Blah.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, fellas. Ever hear of evolution?
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Bednarik aren't the only ones guilty of promoting one
sports era while attacking, rather than debating, the merits of
another. It happens in all sports. Maybe you have a friend who does
the same thing. You rave about airborne Vince Carter, rising from
the court as if he were a plane leaving the tarmac. Your friend
replies that the NBA is weak and that Carter would have never
dunked on Wilt. You salute the physical New Jersey Devils; your
friend replies they are overrated and wouldn't have won anything if
they had to deal with the Big Bad Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, listening to these harangues is harmless. You nod your
head to the monologue and then move on. But here's why I can't
listen for the rest of the year: distraction. That is, I might be
distracted from watching and enjoying one of the most significant
and poetic sports years ever. If the Grumpy Ones weren't so
occupied with their zoot suits, Edsels, and 8-track tape players,
they would know that I'm talking about 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year when two tennis-playing sisters from Compton,
Calif., met in the Wimbledon semifinals. One of the sisters, Venus
Williams, won the tournament. No one would have guessed that was
possible 10 years ago, when the late comedian Robin Harris cracked,
``Don't you know that Compton-to-Hell is a local call?''
</P>
<P>
   This is the year of Pedro Martinez, who may wind up with a
season we've never seen before in major league history. You might
be aware that Bob Gibson had a 1.12 ERA for the St. Louis Cardinals
in 1968. Gibson's gems included eight runs allowed in his first 110
innings; 13 shutouts; and a remarkable, three-runs-in-101-innings
stretch. As amazing as these numbers are, they came during a time
when the National League ERA was 2.99. Only four league players hit
30 or more home runs the entire season. Sandy Koufax may have been
even more dominant, but he retired two years earlier at the age of
30. In 1966, his last season, Koufax was 27-9 with a 1.73 ERA and
won his third Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pitches in a softball-like American League, in which
the average ERA hovers around 5. In this circus atmosphere, he
allows 1.42 runs per game. Twenty-three men have scored on him all
season. Toronto's Shannon Stewart and Tony Batista, the only
players to cross the plate on him twice, should receive ``I Scored
On Pedro'' bumper stickers. In two months _ May and July _ Martinez
gave up a total of four runs. In other words, twice he pitched for
a month and still allowed one fewer run than the average pitcher
gives up in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Will you see that again? Sure. It just may take another 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year of Pete Sampras and Tiger Woods, winning more
often and more convincingly than anyone in history. In 1966, fans
were surprised when 26-year-old Jack Nicklaus won $5,000 at the
British Open. In 2000, the 24-year-old Woods played the Open course
at St. Andrews as if he designed it. He took home more than
$700,000.
</P>
<P>
   No golfer has played with such power and accuracy. No golfer has
made so much money so quickly. No golfer has been able to change
the way the sport is perceived.
</P>
<P>
   Will you see that again? Of course. It just may take 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being 16 years old now. One of the Grumpies might tell
you about watching players such as Johnny Unitas and Deacon Jones.
You could say that you saw John Elway and Jerry Rice. You could say
that you saw Michael Jordan pass his championship baton to the
likes of Tim Duncan and Shaquille O'Neal. You could say that you
saw a great athlete named Lance Armstrong overcome testicular
cancer to win the Tour de France. In your youth, you saw, for the
first time, professional basketball players on national television
_ women pro basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared. Some 2000 haters will continue to tell you that pro
sports are not what they used to be. They will continue to talk
about this era obscenely. But an obscenity will occur only if you
listen rather than watch.

AFTER 2 STRONG YEARS, CHIP EQUIPMENT MAKERS' STOCK FALTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the party over?
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make expensive equipment used by semiconductor
chip manufacturers have enjoyed a roaring business for the last two
years, but suddenly investors are selling stocks as if the
notoriously cyclical industry might be heading south.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is hardly conclusive and many analysts believe
demand for chips used in everything from personal computers to
cellular telephones will remain strong for at least another year.
Continued demand for chips means the same thing for companies that
sell the equipment needed to make them.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry's boom and bust cycles that can last two or
three years each are accompanied with similarly severe stock
swings, so no one wants to be the last to realize fortunes are
taking a turn for the worse. Huge advances in semiconductor
equipment stocks over the last few years only add to the jitters of
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have made a lot of money in these stocks,''
said analyst Neil Wagner, who covers semiconductors and equipment
makers at MFS Investment Management. ``You have people trying to
lock in gains at any sign of weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   This is bad news for practically everyone holding shares of a
herd of local companies serving some slice of the semiconductor
market because the stocks typically all rise or fall with the
tides.
</P>
<P>
   Among Bay State companies, Teradyne Inc. of Boston, fell about
10 percent Thursday. LTX Corp. of Westwood sank more than 20
percent and Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates Inc. of
Gloucester slipped 13 percent. Cognex Corp. of Natick fell about 10
percent and MKS Instruments Inc. of Andover lost about 18 percent.
Only PRI Automation Inc. of Billerica escaped with a modest decline
on the day, though its stock was steeply lower through much of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the day: One leading equipment maker, Kulicke &AMP;
Soffa Industries Inc., said delayed orders could hurt profits
throughout the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   No one catches cold alone in this crowd. So right away, analyst
Min Pang of SG Cowen Securities Corp. cut his rating on Teradyne
from a ``strong buy'' to a ``buy'' Thursday, noting the two
companies had similar market exposures, particularly among Asian
subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   As sudden as the stock selling was Thursday, threads of doubt
and potentially negative news have been collected for several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, analyst Jonathan Joseph of Salomon Smith Barney said
chip shipments would slow and prices would decline, forecasting
tapered demand within six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of semiconductor equipment have reported slowing
growth in demand for two straight months. A leading trade
organization said its book-to-bill ratio had slipped from 1.36 to
1.26 between April and June.
</P>
<P>
   The ratio measures the rate of new customer orders compared with
the amount of equipment being shipped, so any figure above 1.0
suggests a growing market. In this case, the market was growing but
not at as fast a pace as it had been previously.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Teradyne reported its second-quarter orders actually
declined compared to the previous three months, after two straight
quarters of growth exceeding 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, leading cellular phone makers Nokia Corp.,
Ericsson AB and Motorola Inc. have issued varying shades of
pessimism about business in the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phone demand is closely watched by the semiconductor
world because its growth has been so spectacular. But those devices
still only account for about 8 percent of semicondcutor sales while
personal computers still account for about one-third of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The cycles of the semiconductor business are so severe, in part,
because it costs so much to build manufacturing facilities. Big
fabrication plants might cost $1.5 billion, so suppliers build when
demand is pent up and pump as many chips as possible through the
facility to make it pay off.
</P>
<P>
   So supply and demand is tracked in detail, but getting a handle
on the market as it turns is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we've probably reached the midpoint where supply
is catching up with demand, at least for awhile,'' said Lauriann
Kloppenburg, director of equity research at Loomis Sayles &AMP; Co. in
Boston. ``In this business people are always on the edge of their
chairs. Fear plays as a large factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts can argue about how much business might slow or
semiconductor equipment stocks could slide, but there is no
arguement about the industry's spectacular success over the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The value of Teradyne shares has been halved since their spring
peak, but are still up 590 percent between Sept. 30, 1998 and the
end of last month. Those share had been up about 1,100 percent as
of April.
</P>
<P>
   LTX shares are up 1,000 percent and PRI Automation has advanced
265 percent since the same point in the fall of 1998, though their
appreciation was twice as high as of April.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do now? Don't expect a definitive answer from any
anlayst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry should be healthy for at least the next year and
perhaps longer than that,'' said Wagner at MFS. ``The question is
the stock, whether that's enough to satisfy investors or not.''

RECREATIONAL STUDIES WIDEN THEIR PLACE IN ACADEMICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neither the oxymoron in the name of her major nor its lack of
academic gravitas ever really bothered Jill Henneke.
</P>
<P>
   While other students needled her for majoring in ``leisure
studies'' _ watching her go ice climbing or sailing while they
pored over hefty textbooks in more sterile settings _ the
26-year-old recent graduate was happy to earn a degree by learning
the intricacies of recreational activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people stereotype adventure recreation,'' said
Henneke, referring to her specialty at Green Mountain College in
Poultney, Vt. ``But it's not just sitting around a campfire and
telling ghost stories.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of its rocks-for-jocks reputation, leisure studies has
carved out a significant and growing niche in academia. Leisure
studies professors train their students in everything from the
finer points of wilderness living to marketing sports programs as
``therapeutic recreation. ''
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 350 US colleges offer leisure studies programs,
according to the National Recreation and Parks Association, a
college accrediting group. And, with the boom in outdoor recreation
from skiing to whitewater rafting, many students are landing
lucrative careers in recreation management.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever students and professors go, no matter how serious
the discipline, the joshing jostles them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granted, there's an image problem with the name,'' said Cary
McDonald, acting chairman of the leisure studies department at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, one of the country's
first programs. ``It's amazing how many times our faculty has sat
around talking about our name. Yeah, we're not physics or science,
and we're kind of at the bottom end of the social science
environment. But we shouldn't have to fight a battle for
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives such programs a bad reputation, academics in the
field say, are those schools that focus more on the practice of
recreation than the study or business of recreation.
</P>
<P>
   One potentially prickly example is Green Mountain College's
recently announced partnership with the Killington ski resort.
While students in the leisure studies department will learn about
the administrative side of running a multimillion-dollar mountain,
school officials say, they'll also spend a good chunk of their time
on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really ironic because the public recognizes the value of
leisure,'' said Bob Riley, chairman of the recreation and leisure
studies department at Green Mountain. ``Yet when push comes to
shove, we have to put up with comments about all you do is play all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The credibility problem forced a shake out in the field about 10
years ago, as high-profile programs at schools such as the
University of Maryland and the University of Oregon closed their
leisure studies departments. But today, with the economy soaring,
more people taking vacations, and tourism expanding throughout the
country, the number of leisure studies programs and students
entering the field are rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't any recent surveys that document the upsurge,
according to officials at the National Recreation and Parks
Association. But leading professors in the field say the growth is
especially evident in the demand for professors. Unlike most
academic departments, where jobs are scarce, leisure studies
departments across the country are trying to cater to more
undergraduates and fill open positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really hurting for PhDs in our field,'' McDonald said.
``We need more faculty. There were a hundred faculty jobs open
nationwide (this year), and there's no way to fill them right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Leisure studies is the outgrowth of college parks and recreation
departments, which began cropping up in academia after World War II
when the combination of prosperity and baby-boom families increased
the demand for organized recreation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, with the rise of sociology and new fields in
social sciences ranging from ethnic studies to gender studies, many
of the parks and recreation departments began changing their name
to leisure studies.
</P>
<P>
   The discipline then shifted from its initial mission of training
future park rangers or city parks and recreation planners to
delving into the sociological underpinnings of leisure, professors
say. Today, there's even something called the Academy of Leisure
Studies, which has a Web site featuring ``white papers'' on
subjects including ``The Problem of Free Time: It's Not What You
Think,'' ``Leisure's Relationship to Health,'' and ``Leisure
Apartheid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jokes over the arguably light subject matter started shortly
after many of the college departments adopted the new academic
title, professors say. And the jeering hasn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   While professors in the field acknowledge leisure studies, like
underwater basket weaving or physics for poets, has long attracted
athletes or others interested in easy classes, they say spotty
academic curricula have given way over the years to more rigorous
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of those curricula were created too quickly, were
subpar intellectually, and were built around recreation,'' said
Geoffrey Godbey, a leisure studies professor at Pennsylvania State
University and author of ``Time for Life: The Surprising Ways
Americans Use Their Time.'' ``But a lot of those programs have
disappeared, and unlike years ago, I don't find people twitching to
ask me if I have a Ping-Pong table in my office.''
</P>
<P>
   Though snide comments are still part of life for an academic in
leisure studies, it's now more likely professors find people
interested in their work, Godby and others say.
</P>
<P>
   One source of such interest increasingly comes from officials in
China and Korea, where prosperity increasingly affords people more
free time and more cash to spend. Godby and others say they
frequently get calls for their work to be translated into foreign
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Although there may be new opportunities and widening acceptance
of the field, leisure studies professors' earnings haven't kept up
with those in other academic disciplines. According to a 1999
survey by the College and University Personnel Association, leisure
studies is one of the lowest-paying disciplines, not paying much
more than the average $33,912 earned by those teaching secretarial
services in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But as tourism continues to grow and people have more free time
_ a 1997 study by Godby and a leisure studies colleague at the
University of Maryland found Americans have an average of 40 hours
of free time each week, five more hours than in 1965 _ money and
jobs will burgeon the field.
</P>
<P>
   If Jill Henneke's experience is any measure, the future looks
bright for leisure studies majors.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take her long after graduating from Green Mountain
College this spring to land a fulfilling job. Little more than a
month after graduation, she moved to West Virginia to oversee a
program that takes troubled kids into the wilderness to teach them
about more than starting fires and setting up camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to do some good for the kids, to teach them
lessons about life,'' she said. ``It's exactly what I wanted out of
a job. And I don't know if I could have done it without studying
what I did.''

COCO MONTOYA: BORN TO PLAY THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 48 years on the planet, Coco Montoya has been lucky, good,
and tortured to the brink of death, three of the many reasons to
think he was born to play the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky: Barely 21 and a drummer in a California bar band, Montoya
left his kit at the club one night after a gig. The next day, blues
guitar legend Albert Collins came to play a matinee, and the club
manager let him use the drums. When Montoya came by later and saw
that someone had been playing in his seat, he let the manager know
he didn't like it. Word got to Collins, who called to apologize,
and a deep lifelong friendship was born.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Collins called to ask if Montoya would join
him on the road, and the first phase of his musical career had
begun. Montoya had fiddled with guitars for years, but in hotel
rooms, between shows, Collins imparted a lifetime of wisdom and
wizardry. They toured steadily through 1975, but it wasn't really
paying, and Montoya decided to give it up. He worked as a
bartender, and in shipping and receiving in an electronics plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just go at night and play in jam sessions, have fun,
because I figured the career was over,'' said Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   Good: It was like that for years, until one night in 1983 when
fate came calling again. He was jamming at the Central Club in LA
when John Mayall came in. The Brit bluesman left so impressed that
a couple of months later he asked Montoya to be one of his
Bluesbreakers, one of the most significant blues bands ever.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a chance to follow in the footsteps of some of the
best, including Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac) and Mick
Taylor (who played later with Dylan and the Stones). But it would
also be a chance to follow in the footsteps of Eric Clapton, the
very best, at least in Montoya's estimation. Years before, his
first hearing of Clapton, with Mayall, had set him on a musical
path.
</P>
<P>
   To the brink of death: He took the job and really started
learning about the blues. The pressure to perform, and impress,
came from every direction, and practically every night, the
antidote was drugs and drinking. Montoya said that Mayall, perhaps
not intentionally, would pit him against the band's other guitar
player, Walter Trout, and a harsh rivalry developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both too drugged out and drunk and our egos were
obviously riding high on our shoulders, like a chip. . . . It got
psychotic there for a minute, it really did.''
</P>
<P>
   There was pressure, bordering on hatred, from fans, too:
``Especially in the beginning, there were some cruel people out
there. I remember when I replaced Mick Taylor, some Italian guy
took a swing at me because he was so upset that I wasn't Mick
Taylor!''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his 10-year run with the band, more than just band
dynamics were weighing him down. His relationship with fellow blues
guitarist Debbie Davies had ended, he learned that Collins was
dying of cancer, and he sensed that it was time to leave the
Bluesbreakers behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drinking a lot. I was binge eating until i threw up. . .
. I was just out of control in so many ways.'' He reached 320
pounds before he finally realized he had to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone hits their personal bottom. I guess the
ultimate thing you come to is, `Do you love yourself enough to fix
it (or do you) take the chicken . . . way out? Shoot yourself.
Something. And I realized, `Well, I don't want to do that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He entered a clinic to lose the weight, and part of the bargain
was that he give up alcohol; in November, he said proudly, it will
be seven years since his last drink. At first he feared that
without the booze, he wouldn't be able to perform. ``You find that
you can. And you find that you're actually hearing music, real
music, again for the first time. You kind of go, `Wow, I don't have
to be wasted, and I'm enjoying all this!'''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya's first solo album, ``Gotta Mind to Travel,'' came out
in the United States in 1995, earning him good notices and the W.
C. Handy Award as the year's best new blues artist; ``new'' must be
a relative term. Three albums have followed, including his most
recent, ``Suspicion,'' his first for the Alligator Records label.
</P>
<P>
   He tours extensively, playing 150 to 175 dates a year.
``Sometimes you get lonely out there. Sometimes it's kind of empty
coming home to nothing but your bills. But I kind of like where I'm
at. It's kind of like my last drug. I'm a road rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Like anyone, he's had plenty of wants in his up-and-down life.
But in the best tradition of the blues, his millions of miles on
the road have taught him what he needs: ``It's coming to grips with
the fact that you just want to be human, you just want to play and
enjoy yourself. Everybody goes through that bit, `Oh yeah, I want
to be a star. Oh, I want to be idolized.' Then you find out what
it's like kind of to be in that position, and you realize, `You
know what? I sure would rather just like my music.' ''

   You might think that a guy who has presided over a big company
for five years, during which that company's share price doubled,
might want to bring that up if he were running for public office.
Not Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight years ago,'' he said in his speech at the Republican
convention Wednesday night, ``when I completed my years as
secretary of defense, I loaded a U-Haul truck and drove home to
Wyoming. ... Lynne and I settled into a new private life. There was
time for fishing and grandchildren, and we were content.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. In addition, there was time to build a personal net worth
in the tens of millions of dollars, which is probably another
source of contentment. I was disappointed that Cheney's summation
of his qualifications for the office of vice president omitted any
mention of or even allusion to Halliburton, the oilfield services
company where he has served as chief executive officer for half a
decade.

   ``Home'' is now Texas, by the way, but presumably Dallas-based
Halliburton took care of the move from Wyoming, so he didn't have
to hassle with a U-Haul again. Say, what was Cheney doing loading
that U-Haul, anyway? A man with his health history ought to leave
the heavy lifting to someone else, no?
</P>
<P>
   I was disappointed because I've had a hard time figuring out
from press accounts just what kind of CEO Cheney was. ``He's done a
very good job,'' one analyst commented to CBS Marketwatch.com, the
day before Cheney's selection was announced. ``Probably to his
credit, he has had Dave Lesar'' _ the company's president and chief
operating officer, who has since been annointed Cheney's successor
_ ``basically managing the day-to-day operations of Halliburton. If
Mr. Cheney were to leave, Lesar could step in and replace him and
there would be no negative to Halliburton.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what does that mean? Maybe the company should have made me
the new CEO of Halliburton, because to my credit, I would have
continued to let Dave Lesar basically manage the day-to-day
operations. I'd have been willing to do it for, oh, half of the
$1.9 million salary Cheney earned last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney started at the top at Halliburton _ a company that
provides big oil companies with equipment for exploration and for
the actual pumping of oil out of the ground _ in 1995. He managed
get the job with hardly any business experience, apparently by
impressing the firm's prior CEO during a fly-fishing trip.
</P>
<P>
   An upbeat assessment of Cheney's Halliburton stint in the Times
recently described his subsequent role as ``Halliburton's outside
man, a globe-trotting rainmaker.'' Another stock analyst explained
to the Associated Press, ``What Dick does at that company is
personally make high-level strategic decisions, sets broad policies
and provides access to national oil companies who have an impact on
contracting of oilfield services.''
</P>
<P>
   He ends up sounding like more of an ambassador than a CEO, but
apparently he was quite good at it: In addition to his cash salary,
he has piled up Halliburton shares worth somewhere north of $51
million. A report in Forbes.com also figures that his directorships
at Procter &AMP; Gamble, EDS and Union Pacific have brought him at
least another $1 million in fees and stock.
</P>
<P>
   And his tenure hasn't been bad for shareholders so far. The
company's stock was at $21 a share when he arrived and at about $41
when he announced his pending departure (that's a bit off a 52-week
high of $52 and, as it happens, slightly lags the S &AMP;P 500 index
over the same five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the same analyst who praised Cheney's
``high-level strategic decisions'' adds that it will take another
couple of years to gauge Cheney's legacy. Shortly after Cheney's
announcement, the company made public its second-quarter numbers,
which showed a decline in profits from $83 million to $75 million
compared with same quarter in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was slightly better than analysts had figured.
</P>
<P>
   So apparently the conventional wisdom is that we can draw two
conclusions from the Cheney era at Halliburton. First, he did a
great job. And second, he won't be missed. Obviously it's going to
be tough to believe both of those things indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps our old friend the market offers a clue: Since news of
Cheney's resignation, HAL shares are up about 15.

SLASH, WITHOUT COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one told aggressive rockers Guns N' Roses what to do, so it
figures that no one is going to tell the band's former guitarist
Slash what to do, either. Anyone who calls himself Slash is not to
be messed with _ and nothing has changed as he slams onward in his
solo career.
</P>
<P>
   He made a new album with his band, Slash's Snakepit, but held on
to it until just the right record-label deal came along. Slash
wasn't about to compromise with the corporate suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially insane if you're not trying to jump on the
heels of whatever is going on that is considered popular music
right now,'' says Slash, whose group will open for AC/DC in Boston
Tuesday. ``I never did that before and I won't do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't even try to negotiate with Slash when he
gets worked up. ``It's one of those things where you walk in and
you go, `Wait a second, whatever you were thinking we were going to
do or whatever you think is a standard of the industry right now,
that's not us. Let me force that down your throat real quick before
we start talking.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Slash finally found another label, Koch Records, which will
release the next Snakepit disc, ``Ain't Life Grand'' (featuring new
singer Rod Jackson), in October. It's a hard-hitting, old-school
metal-rock album filled with Slash's in-your-face riffs and
wanderlust lyrics like ``gonna be comin' home, but maybe not
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's done, he's not soliciting ``feedback'' from the
label. ``The only real interaction that you have with the powers
that be at the record company is like, `OK, here's the tape, this
is what we did.' Then I don't necessarily want to hear anything
after that. I don't want to hear too much opinionated sort of
record-company brouhaha going around the office. You know, as to
what is selling, what is popular right this second, and everything
that goes with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Slash's cocksure attitude has helped influence a new generation
of hard-rock musicians for whom Guns was the prototype. But while
Slash takes a tough stance with record companies, he can't always
relate to the anger he hears in some of the younger bands today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you actually listen to Guns play, or Snakepit play, it's
like really loud and in your face, but as a person, I'm sort of
like, `Well, I don't have any real issues, man, so let's not dwell
on anything. Let's not take things too seriously. We're not pissed
off at the world compared to what's currently going on these
days.''
</P>
<P>
   As for some of the angry new bands, Slash says, ``They're not
old enough to have that hard of a life. They need to hang out with
Keith Richards a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Slash has done just that (Guns N' Roses had played some shows
with the Rolling Stones), but sadly, one person he's not hanging
out with anymore is Guns singer Axel Rose. Hence, Guns as we knew
them are no more. Slash has talked to other Guns members such as
Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan, but Axel is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't talked to Axel. I think the split-up between
(us) was a little more bitter. But it wasn't so much personal as it
was a disassociation from what I thought he was doing and
consequently what it was that I wanted to do. So we just parted
ways and I haven't talked to him since.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as the Guns records themselves, I can't exaggerate
enough how proud I am of the fact that I was a part of Guns and of
all the material we released,'' says Slash. That explains why, when
a live Guns N' Roses record (made years ago) came out not long ago,
Slash still helped in the mixing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I wasn't in the band anymore, I was there for the
mixing, just to make sure it was as honest a representation of GNR
live as I thought it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't dwell too long on Guns questions, however, or you might
get the same treatment as one of those overzealous record
executives who tell him what to do. ``It's like, `Don't talk
(badly) about Guns or about Axel or about any of that stuff,
because that's where I come from,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   OK, fair enough, so let's talk about the new Snakepit, formed
after Slash auditioned _ can you believe? _ nearly 200 singers. He
finally found new singer Jackson after bassist Johnny Blackout
heard him playing at the Roxy in Los Angeles with a little-known
band called Shady Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to Johnny, `Have him come down and we'll jam.' And we
just instantly clicked when he did. And it's funny because we have
similar Hollywood backgrounds. We had hung out in the same places
and lived in the same places. So I was like, `How come I haven't
met you before?' We have mutual friends and all kinds of stuff. And
we've been together ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to go out and start these shows, because
(Jackson) is a real dynamic character in person, and especially
onstage. He has that great live quality where, as soon as you get
into a room where there's a couple of people in it, he goes up one
notch higher. His whole singing approach gets more enthusiastic,
which is one of the great things about a live rock 'n' roll band in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the upcoming tour with AC/DC, Slash says, ``I'm a huge
fan, though I had never met them. But they're one of the all-time
greatest guitar-rock bands, so I'm really proud to be on the tour.
It's very cool, though I think we're all a little bit nervous about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slash nervous? Just don't tell that to a record executive,
because he probably won't believe you.

LITTLE FEAT BOUNCES BACK WITH NEW ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a little help from friends Phil Lesh, Jimmy Buffett, Phish,
and String Cheese Incident, the pioneering Little Feat has a new
lease on life, proving that the jam-band community takes care of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a band that was headed downhill fast, we've turned things
around,'' says Little Feat pianist Bill Payne. ``I didn't think
we'd get out of the tailspin, but we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Feat has a snappy new CD, ``Chinese Work Songs.'' The
title is meant as a playful swipe at the many styles the group has
covered through more than two decades together, first as a vehicle
for the legendary Lowell George (author of ``Dixie Chicken'' and
``Willin','' among other rock classics), and, throughout, as a
thinking man's party band.
</P>
<P>
   The new album contains a cover of Phish's ``Sample in a Jar,''
meant as a tribute to that Vermont-based band. ``We've influenced
Phish and String Cheese Incident, but the influences go both
ways,'' says Payne. ``So what better way to demonstrate that by
cutting some songs by people we admire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't yet played with Phish, but we did sit in with
String Cheese Incident,'' he adds. ``It was at the Gorge in
Washington State. We played `Pocky Way,' the old Neville Brothers
song. And we agreed to hook up with String Cheese at the festival
in Boulder, Colo., that they do every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Feat has also loosened up considerably since Payne and
Feat singer/guitarist Paul Barrere were tapped by former Grateful
Dead bassist Phil Lesh to be in his revolving jam band, Phil Lesh &AMP;
Friends, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By opening the door to the Grateful Dead audience and their
allegiances, we've been able to let people know we're still
around,'' says Payne. ``I loved working with Phil. He's a very
smart man, among other talents, and has such a knowledge of how to
put things together. The impact he's had on Paul and me over the
last six months is hard to calculate. It opened our eyes in many
ways. When we went back to Little Feat, it helped us shake up our
shows and run different songs into each other. We were getting to
where our shows were too predictable, so it was a godsend to work
with Phil and have his influence rub off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Buffett, he suggested that Little Feat should be on his
Internet station at radiomargaritaville.com. They agreed and now
have ``The Little Feat Radio Hour'' (hosted by David Moss) running
three times on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The revitalized Little Feat is performing a bunch of tunes from
``Chinese Work Songs,'' an album that includes original tracks
spanning rock, funk, and Tex-Mex styles, along with covers of The
Band's ``Rag Mama Rag,'' Bob Dylan's ``It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It
Takes a Train To Cry,'' and the aforementioned Phish tune.
</P>
<P>
   The album was recorded in Barrere's house, with all the band
members in the same room no more than 10 feet from one another.
``On previous albums, we'd only have two or three in the room, and
the rest would be overdubs,'' says Payne, commenting on the
intimacy at the heart of the new CD.
</P>
<P>
   They also came to another conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that, as Little Feat, we really have a platform
after all these years,'' says Payne, who has also played with Bob
Seger, Bonnie Raitt, James Taylor, and many others. ``And that
platform allows us to play in any manner. It gives us the freedom
to stand tall or fall flat _ and I like that. We get into trouble
sometimes on the business side of things because of that freedom,
but it's what Little Feat is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AC/DC on the way: ``I'm going back out there to try to scream
again,'' AC/DC singer Brian Johnson says of the band's new tour.
It's a season overloaded with classic rock, but AC/DC is at the top
of any enthusiast's wish list.
</P>
<P>
   The band has been revived by a new album, ``Stiff Upper Lip,''
and by being featured in a recent VH1 ``Behind the Music'' episode,
though Johnson says the group hated the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it. It was terribly done _ bloody awful,'' says
Johnson, who felt the show was sensationalized. As examples, he
cited how the producers spent a half-hour on the overdose death of
former AC/DC singer Bon Scott and dwelled on a serial killer who
was a fan and on a tragic accident at an AC/DC concert in Salt Lake
City when three fans were crushed in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, bad things have happened, but it's 99.9 percent
good things in this band _ and they weren't shown,'' says Johnson.
``It was an embarrassingly amateurish production. We have
complained about it to VH1 and they're redoing the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Much closer to Johnson's heart is a discussion of the group's
new album, which reuinited the band with George Young, who produced
their famed ``Powerage'' and ``Let There Be Rock'' discs. ``George
is great. He's like a cool uncle. He gets nothing but the highest
respect from me,'' says Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   As for the recording, Johnson adds, ``I did the whole album in
the control room with an old Shure microphone. I just belted it out
and it worked. But it was in a small room. I was knocking all the
furniture around when I was singing. I was like a pregnant hippo.''

DAWN OF MAN 
A four-part miniseries 
Executive producers: Phillip Martin and Alexandra Middendorf 
Narrated by: Richard Dreyfuss  
On: TLC 
Time: Sunday and Monday, 9-11 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The labors of paleontologists, anthropologists, and other
scientists exploring the origins of man are not the stuff of breezy
television entertainment. Digging for artifacts in the field or
subjecting old bones to lab analysis are painstakingly incremental
tasks. Although this often tedious work has resulted in stunning
revelations about our prehistoric ancestors _ about their ability
to kill other animals or to speak, for examples _ how do you
dramatize the scientific busywork?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dawn of Man'' series on TLC, debuting Sunday night at 9
and concluding Monday, does it with jazzy cinematography and
rapid-fire editing. Thus you might see an archeologically important
skull filmed from several angles with a variety of colored filters.
Add to this an eerie, reverberating musical score and brief,
shadowy reenactments of bits of prehistoric behavior, and I think
you're supposed to have a kind of nonfiction ``X-Files''
experience.
</P>
<P>
   While the four-part miniseries demands tolerance for this
obviously contrived style, close attention pays some dividends. The
series _ coproduced by the BBC and TLC _ offers an overview of the
emergence and spread of what were to become, over 5 million years,
modern human beings. Clear, if theatrical, narration voiced by
Richard Dreyfuss and often solid interviews tell fascinating
stories about man's evolution and how dedicated scientists pieced
them together.
</P>
<P>
   For only one example, take the segment in Sunday's second hour,
``Body Human,'' involving shards of flint associated with Altamura
Man, so-called because a complete skeleton was discovered in
Altamura, Italy, in 1993. Elsewhere, scientists unearthed flint
fragments that they then almost miraculously reassembled into the
large stone from which the slivers were chipped, only to discover a
central missing piece. A cast of the shape of the missing piece
revealed what a contemporary of Altamura Man, approximately a
half-million years old but almost as brainy as we are today, had
fashioned _ an efficient hand ax. Fossil evidence strongly suggests
it was used to butcher and clean extinct rhinos, elephants, and
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient humans moving slowly north into Europe from Africa had
changed from scavengers into hunters apparently capable of
reflective thought, teamwork, and, one scientist hypothesizes,
family love.
</P>
<P>
   To judge from the first two hours of the miniseries, accounts of
discoveries like this abound in ``Dawn of Man.'' Individually, they
are well chronicled, despite the distracting atmospherics. But
important connections between them are often missing or murky,
making the larger evolutionary narrative difficult if not sometimes
impossible to follow. Most problematic is the uncritical approach
to the work of the articulate and generally passionate scientists
involved. Rarely is the viewer told the difference between what is
established fact, hypothesis, serious speculation, or just fanciful
conjecture _ so, in the end, it's not entirely clear how much we
really know.

CHARMING CHARACTERS SAVE `GRACE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
SAVING GRACE 
Directed by: Nigel Cole 
Screenplay by: Craig Ferguson 
Starring: Brenda Blethyn, Craig Ferguson, Martin Clunes, Tcheky
Karyo, Jamie Forman, Bill Bailey, Valeria Edmond, Tristan Sturrock 
Running time: 94 minutes 
Rated: R (drug content and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saving Grace'' is what a friend of mine calls a village
comedy, one in which an entire village quaintly conspires. It's the
latest in a long, droll line of comedies from ``Tight Little
Island'' to ``Local Hero'' to ``Waking Ned Devine.'' It can't quite
go the distance. It runs out of ideas, eccentricity and local color
before collapsing in a forced ending. But it's funny and charming
most of the time, thanks to Brenda Blethyn as a widow who turns out
to be more worldly and less cocooned than everyone thinks. The
point is that everyone feels involved, even if only in the most
loosely communal way, because everyone in the small Cornish seaside
village likes upbeat, matronly Grace Trevethan, whose ne'er-do-well
husband not only has left her widowed, but heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
   So their natural reaction is to turn the other way when she
stumbles into a get-rich-quick plan that would save her homey
cottage from creditors by utilizing her gardening skills in
hitherto unforeseen ways. When she sorrowfully informs her Scottish
gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson, who also co-wrote the film),
that reduced circumstances will force her to lay him off, he
responds with a proposal. Until now content to raise a few
marijuana plants on the sly in a secluded piece of woodland, he
suggests that they escalate the project in Grace's greenhouse.
Thanks to Grace's green thumb, the plants all but start spilling
out of what becomes their marijuana plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Belthyn's Grace, looking both gentle and sleek, never falls into
the trap of stereotypical twittering as the kindly housewife who
never once thinks of herself as a victim as she becomes ever more
adept at dodging the man from the bank in London, calling about the
mortgage payments. Ferguson, a skilled farceur, similarly mutes the
Scotsman's growing anxiety and certainty that he's getting in over
his head, which of course makes him that much funnier. Valerie
Edmond, as his girlfriend whose pregnancy motivates him to amass a
pile of money, is a gust of fresh air as she introduces skepticism
to the mix. She's convinced that Grace will wind up in jail and
that it'll be Matthew's fault despite the fact that the whole place
is rooting for Grace and trying not to blab too much to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps the film going is Grace's way of matter-of-factly
revealing surprising depths of resiliency. These involve
confronting her late husband's mistress in London and later facing
a French drug dealer, to whom the veteran Tcheky Karyo imparts a
few surprising facets. ``Saving Grace'' _ who, by the way, seems
quite capable of saving herself _ edges into genre cliche in its
portrayals of the villagers _ a pair of old woman shopkeepers who
get titteringly high when the weed slips into the food chain, a
vicar addicted to Hammer horror movies on the late show, and a
bumbling local cop whose ability to turn a blind eye to victimless
crimes by the locals who are his friends approaches the breaking
point. ``Saving Grace'' goes down easily, if implausibly, enough.
But it's more agreeable than it is original.

`HOLLOW MAN' OFFERS LITTLE SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
HOLLOW MAN 
Directed by: Paul Verhoeven 
Screenplay by: Andrew W. Marlowe 
Starring: Elisabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens,
Greg Grunberg, Joey Slotnick, Mary Randle, William Devane 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: R 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hollow Man'' is an invisible man movie that should have been
an inaudible man movie. Every time the characters open their
mouths, they hammer it deeper into the ground. Taken from dull to
ludicrous by a script with a death grip on the obvious, ``Hollow
Man'' is the kind of film in which one character says, ``He'll be
OK,'' about a guy who's gushing blood and obviously has only
seconds to live. That's followed by Elisabeth Shue glancing at her
wounded lover and saying, as she reaches for a handy roll of duct
tape, ``He didn't hit any organs _ I'll find something to close the
wound.'' These are people who are supposed to be scientists,
including Kevin Bacon, who day after day climbed into a skin-tight
latex costume to play the genius who grows aggressive and
power-crazed once he realizes he doesn't have to look at himself in
the mirror the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the film runs amok much more problematically than
the scientist does. Like so many sci-fi movies, it's reactionary to
its core. Its message is don't do research, you'll discover
something that will offend the gods. In other words, don't mess
with nature, or else. But science is precisely about messing with
nature. Without science, we'd still be living in caves, without
appendectomies, penicillin or the World Wrestling Federation. It
can at least be said that ``Hollow Man'' begins with some neat
special effects, in which an ape turns invisible by degrees, first
shedding its skin, then its muscle and sinew, then its blood
vessels, and finally its skeleton. When the invisibility is
reversed, the primate reappears in reverse order.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bacon's megalomanical scientist tries it on himself, he
gets stuck in invisibility. His irritability and aggressiveness
escalate, steered into sadistic misogyny, a Verhoeven trademark
ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in ``Total Recall''
emptied a gun into his wife's midriff and said, ``Consider this a
divorce.'' In the film, Bacon's scientist had been thrown over by
Shue's researcher, so part of his power-tripping is of the
psychosexual variety, first exercised when he sneaks up, invisible,
on a couple of other women and turns them into unwilling sexual
playthings. Suffice to say that the longer the scientist is stuck
in the invisibility mode, the worse his crimes become, and that he
never bothers with stuff like world domination. For him, rape will
do.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins to crumble the moment we see the invisibility
serum, which has the bad luck to be the exact bright red color of
Eddie Murphy's truth serum in ``Nutty Professor II.'' It's as if
Hollywood science, a dicey proposition at the best of times, has
succumbed to a lazy serum-of-the-month mentality. Not that this is
the best of times for science at the movies. These days, scientists
just punch up what they want on computer screens. Slick but
mundane, not as campy or juicy as, say, Bela Lugosi peering into a
bubbling beaker in ``Bride of the Monster'' or Colin Clive waiting
for a bolt of lightning to jump-start his tableful of sewn-together
body parts in ``Frankenstein.'' Or, for that matter, Claude Rains
surpassing the new film in every way in the antiquated but still
effective 1933 original ``Invisible Man.'' If not for cable and
video, ``Hollow Man'' would become an invisible film. Sherman Klump
is going to have to carry the ball for science singlehandedly this
summer at the movies.

BE CAREFUL ADDING LAYERS TO FLOOR

<P>
   Q. The 12-inch-square vinyl tiles on my kitchen floor are 40
years old. Ten or 15 years go, a man put down thin plywood, then
sheet vinyl. Now I'd like to put down another layer of sheet vinyl.
Can I put down thin plywood on top of the old sheet vinyl and put
on new?
</P>
<P>
   D.M.D., Hyde Park, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it is possible, but adding the plywood and new sheet
vinyl will add half inch to the floor, and this might become a
problem at doorways, where the raised floor may interfere with
doors opening and closing. Or, the raised floor may be higher than
the floors of adjacent rooms, most noticeable at doorways, where
someone could trip over the lip.
</P>
<P>
   These problems can be solved. Door bottoms can be trimmed so
they will clear the raised floor. Thresholds can be applied to the
openings to ease the differences of each floor.
</P>
<P>
   If there are no other problems, anticipated or real, then you
can add another layer of plywood and new sheet vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   Taking off the top sheet vinyl can be risky, if it contains
asbestos. The backing of sheet vinyl installed 15 to 20 years ago
may contain asbestos, and if so, it must be removed professionally.
To determine this, break off a small chip, seal it in a plastic
bag, and take it to an asbestos abatement company. They are in the
Yellow Pages under Asbestos Abatement. If the sheet vinyl does
contain asbestos, you can cover it with more plywood or have it
removed professionally. If it doesn't, you can do anything with it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My bathroom has a clawfoot tub under a sloped ceiling, so I
can't install a wrap-around shower curtain around it. My friends
seem to be exuberant bathers, and a lot of water spilled on the
floor, which leaked, and ruined the kitchen ceiling below. Can I
make the floor waterproof? It has sheet vinyl on it, in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   V.G., Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Instead of waterproofing the floor, how about
exuberant-proofing your friends? I assume you have tried every
which way to put in a wrap-around curtain. Could you move the tub
under a higher ceiling to accommodate the curtain?
</P>
<P>
   OK, try this: Lift the round metal or plastic bells that wrap
around water pipes and drains coming up through the floor. Caulk
around the pipes and put the bells back. If necessary, caulk all
edges of the room.
</P>
<P>
   Then give your exuberant friends a big mop so they can mop up
all that water.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am not overun by silverfish, but I do see one on the floor
occasionally. How can I get rid of them and keep rid of them?
</P>
<P>
   A.C., Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. One critter occasionally? Certainly not an infestation. Sweep
it up and throw it away. If you get a lot more, you could sprinkle
boric acid along baseboards and in the cellar and attic where you
think they might be proliferating. If you can see the boric acid,
you have used too much. That means that very little is needed to be
effective. Remember too that it is toxic and must be kept away from
humans, babies, kids, and pets. Sweeping and throwing away is still
your best bet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house needs to be painted, but it has asbestos-cement
shingles. The paint is not peeling but has streaks. Can I cover the
shingles with new siding?
</P>
<P>
   J.K., Rockland, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You cannot put anything on top of the shingles, because
anything new must be nailed or screwed on, and this would damage
the asbestos and release fibers. Your choice is to paint;
professional removal is very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The streaks are probably mold. Remove it with a bleach solution
and rinse with a hose. You can't sand the finish or pressure-wash
it, but you can wash it with a strong detergent solution, then hose
off. Apply two thin coats of a latex house paint or two thin coats
of a solid color latex stain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am applying shingles to the walls of a shed. I am doubling
the first course, to create a flared drip edge. How far should I
drop the first course below the sheathing? I am weaving the
shingles at corners. Should I caulk them where they meet?
</P>
<P>
   JAN HUBBELL, Franklin, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Drop the shingles 1/2 to 3/4 inch. If the sheathing boards
are flush with the concrete or other part of the foundation, butt
the undercourse shingles flush with the sheathing. Overlap the
starter course by 1/2 to 3/4 inch.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving shingles means alternating the overlap of each course
where the shingles meet at a corner. Do not caulk that joint; the
shingles will move and open up, which is normal, and will look
worse if they are caulked.
</P>
<P>
   To solve this, you can put in corner boards, two boards nailed
together to form an ``L'' shape; this ``L'' is applied to the
corner. Shingles will butt up against the boards instead of being
weaved.
</P>

&HT;     ACHIEVER IS `FIRST AMONG EQUALS' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PEGGY FIKAC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ She's the ``first among equals'' on Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential campaign team of foreign policy
advisers, this 45-year-old woman striding briskly through the halls
at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   She was director of Soviet and East European Affairs for the
National Security Council when Bush's father was president, and
served as his special assistant for national security affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at age 38, she became the youngest, first black and first
female provost at Stanford University in California, where she had
begun teaching political science 12 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   She left the provost's post last year, is on a leave of absence
from the university, and has become a close adviser to Bush,
leading to speculation that she may get a Cabinet post if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   Condoleezza Rice, who Tuesday helped sketch Bush's foreign
policy thinking in a featured convention speech, turns aside the
speculation with, ``Oh, we're not going to start staffing the
presidency until he wins the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing in the convention bustle for an interview, she answers
another question in a way that seems at odds with her high-powered
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how a super-achiever interacts with a man who _ though now
possibly destined for the White House _ acknowledges he only found
his path in life when he turned 40, she said: ``As a matter of
fact, I think I found my path later, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to be a concert pianist. And I had no intention of
doing anything with politics or foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``later'' for her still was sooner than for most people.
</P>
<P>
   According to her biography, Rice entered the University of
Denver at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   She switched her major from piano performance to political
science when she realized she wouldn't be a great pianist,
according to ``Contemporary Black Biography.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science when
she was 19. She received a master's degree from the University of
Notre Dame and a doctorate from the University of Denver's Graduate
School of International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a very driven person, I don't think,'' she said this
week. ``I like doing well, but I really like to keep balance in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said she and the governor probably share that sense of
balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of family. The importance of church. The
importance of ... sports,'' she said. ``And I don't think of myself
as somebody who's been single-minded throughout my life. It just
isn't who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her most intense policy sessions with Bush occurred while
they were hiking on Bush's ranch ``and hiking `Balkan Hill' _ we've
now named it, because we were having an intense discussion about
Balkan history,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   They made it to the top of the hill ``and never stopped
talking,'' demonstrating that the two fitness enthusiasts are in
good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is an avid runner. She also runs, but restricts the
activity because of ``not-so-great knees,'' a lingering reminder of
a time when she figure-skated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't run with him. There's no way,'' Rice said. ``I
could lift with him, though. I lift weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., works out with the
Stanford football strength coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Bush) likes that as much as he likes anything
about me ... that I'm physically fit and able to walk Balkan Hill
with him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ray Sullivan said the governor and Rice
got to know each other in 1995 when she visited Austin.
</P>
<P>
   They became friends in 1998 when both were in Kennebunkport,
Maine, where the Bush family has a home, and began to talk about
foreign affairs and military issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could call her the first among equals when it comes to
Bush's foreign policy experts,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's speech was a one-two punch for Bush's presidential
campaign, encompassing foreign affairs and the high-profile
campaign post held by an African-American woman.
</P>
<P>
   Rice helped give a national audience some insight into the
foreign-policy thinking of a man who, early in his campaign,
slipped at times on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In one spur-of-the-moment television interview, for example,
Bush couldn't remember the names of leaders of several world hot
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows a great deal about foreign policy,'' she said. ``My
job has really been to bring together people around him who can
give him good policy options as he develops an agenda for foreign
policy, to have him think about how he wants to communicate that
agenda to the American people and to deal with some of those
tougher challenges that he would have to cope with if he became
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said Bush ``has long cared about and studied and been
interested in Mexico and Latin America, and that's an area of the
world that has often been neglected in American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   As a woman and African-American, Rice also is part of a
high-profile group that Republicans hope will show their desire for
including different faces in their party.
</P>
<P>
   Rice was a Democrat until 1980, when she voted for Ronald Reagan
because she didn't like the course of American foreign policy under
Jimmy Carter, for whom she also had voted.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped her speech Tuesday would contribute to the
message of inclusion pushed by Bush, with its focus not only on
Republican principles of operating in the world but on ``who we are
as a people, and why it's important for the American president to
understand what it is that motivates and inspires the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have sought to paint Bush and the Republican Party as
unfriendly to women and minorities, calling the message of
inclusion only a veneer.
</P>
<P>
   Among many issues, Democrats cite the Republican platform's
opposition to allowing women to choose abortion and the small
percentage of minority delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an illusion of inclusion,'' Democratic National
Committee spokesman Rick Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rice also said that the GOP can understand and respond to
the idea that there are experiences and concerns related to gender
or race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in emphasizing education, has put the focus on an issue
that has been ``the North Star for African-Americans since the end
of slavery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be the first to admit that sometimes the party has had a
tone that hasn't always been very welcoming,'' she said, ``but I
think that Gov. Bush is trying to send a message of inclusion.''

FROM PAGANS TO PAUL, HUMANITYS' SEARCH FOR GOD DEFTLY TOLD

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
A WORLD FULL OF GODS:  THE STRANGE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY 
Keith Hopkins, The Free Press, 416 pp., $26.00 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ancient religions did much of their business with stories,''
historian Keith Hopkins writes. ``Poets, priests, and temple
attendants used stories to help confirm faith among the faithful,
to explain the origin and future of the world, and to describe the
complex relationship between Gods and humans . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But modern religions need narrative, too. The New Testament has
its Gospels, which tell and retell the events of Jesus's life.
Judaism has a rich history of midrash, or stories, that interpret
biblical passages. Pagans, modern or ancient, have their thundering
tales of gods and goddesses. Hopkins, a professor of ancient
history at King's College in Cambridge, England, spins legends and
stories of his own in ``A World Full of Gods,'' an exploration of
the roots of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Like Karen Armstrong in ``A History of God,'' Hopkins tries to
comprehend the religious impulse by reviewing history and context.
And, like Armstrong, he doesn't hesitate to examine the interplay
of the human spirit with the divine. He gives full brief to the
strange, the bawdy, and the just plain wrong. History may be
written by the victors, but it's the losers who add the footnotes,
and the spice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloss it as you will,'' Hopkins writes, ``the worship of a
crucified criminal as the Son of God, the divine exaltation of a
humble human, the crucifixion of God, and the ethical message of
achieving individual salvation through faith, virtue, and
repentance constituted a radical break with pagan polytheism,
animal sacrifice, and temple worship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins reminds us that Jesus was a messianic Jew intent on
overturning more than just a few moneychangers' tables in the
Temple in Jerusalem. Executed during a time of political ferment in
the Roman Empire, Jesus left a corps of fervent believers who went
on to found a church.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Armstrong or Elaine Pagels, however, Hopkins flirts with
danger stylistically. Some chapters are serious, scholarly
monographs. Others are written as fiction. Time travelers (equipped
with learn-as-you-go computer chips) experience pagan rites in
Pompeii and traffic in magic in Egypt. A fictional dinner party
runs aground when a religious discussion erupts between Christians,
pagans, and Simon the Jew, who refuses to partake of the wild boar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should just look around,'' Epiphanius the pagan says.
``The great mass of the world is suffering from want, cold, hunger.
Meanwhile the Christians, racked with fever and disease, dream of
posthumous immortality. Who is this God who can help you in the
next world but not in this? We don't need your God, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed throughout are letters from colleagues, reacting to
drafts that Hopkins has sent to them for comment. (One such
grouping is titled, ``Interlude: Objections). Reacting to the
dinner party piece, a scholar at the Jewish Theological Seminary in
New York writes, ``Somehow your piece seems more of an idealized
twentieth-century Cambridge college high table than genuine
second-century Antioch or Caesarea. Rather funny, really _ you try
to write a genuine atmospheric piece about antiquity, and quite
unconsciously, instead, you reproduce your own social world.'' He
goes on to pick apart the historic setting and the overall method
but makes a substantial contribution to the debate by sharing his
own take on God, demons, and angels.
</P>
<P>
   Like Edmund Morris in ``Dutch,'' Hopkins has a penchant for the
literary jump-cut, the fictive pause. But it works better here. The
theology is packed into pages of notes at the end of the book,
adding gravity without bogging down the narrative power of the main
text. Readers are more likely to remember the vivid dialogue in his
mini-screenplay, ``How the Dead Sea Scrolls Were Found and Lost,''
than slog through the source text, Justin's ``Dialogue with
Trypho.''
</P>
<P>
   As a host of apostles, rabbis, and pagan mythologizers realized,
it all comes down to the story. Hopkins, in the end, tells it well.

BINOCHE'S SPIRIT LIFTS `ALICE AND MARTIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
ALICE AND MARTIN 
Directed by: Andre Techine 
Screenplay by: Techine, Gilles Taurand 
Starring: Juliette Binoche, Alexis Loret, Mathieu Amalric, Carmen
Maura, Jean-Pierre Lorit, Marthe Villalonga 
Running time: 124 minutes 
Rated: R (a scene of sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no wonder that France's finest actors keep returning to
work with Andre Techine. The most underrated of French filmmakers,
he constantly specifies world after provincial world of gnarled
emotional complexity, rendered in striking images that amplify the
often careening lives of his protagonists. Catherine Deneuve and
Daniel Auteuil twice have teamed up with Techine, in ``My Favorite
Season'' and ``Thieves,'' Deneuve had one of her best roles in
Techine's ``Scene of the Crime'' and Juliette Binoche now follows
her breakthrough film, Techine's ``Rendez-Vous,'' with the even
more richly compelling ``Alice and Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   It rides several strong emotional arcs, yet it never plays like
anything preordained, as a Hollywood star vehicle (of which it
occasionally reminds us) would. It's messy and permeated by a
provisional air, although its passions are relentless. Techine also
trusts us to put the pieces together, refrains from spelling
everything out in exposition and dialogue. Rather, the film moves
in quantum leaps. They always proceed logically from what preceded
them. It takes us a while to figure out what's what, yet the effort
is more than repaid, especially in Binoche's performance as Alice.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a boy being brought to live in the grim
iron-gated house of a provincial industrialist, its squat stony
heaviness in vivid contrast to the hurtling nature of the scenes
played out there. One quick flash-forward later, we see the boy
named Martin, now a young man (Alexis Loret), flee the house. He
tries to lie low in the country, but when he's caught stealing eggs
in a henhouse, police are called, intervention from home ensues,
and he's soon on his way to Paris to live with his bohemian
brother, Benjamin (Mathieu Amalric), and the latter's musician
roommate, Alice, who at first resents Martin's presence, which she
regards as intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   Alice and Benjamin, who is gay, share everything except sex. To
their surprise, Martin the sensitive bumpkin, is spotted at a cafe
by an agent, who whisks him into a modeling career. Almost
offhandedly, and always with a light touch, Techine uses the
contrast between the slick, driven commercialism of the modeling
world and the maverick artist sensibility of Alice and Benjamin to
serve as a precursor of the tension that never quite departs when
Alice and Martin become lovers. It simply is rechanneled. The depth
of Alice's commitment becomes apparent when she learns she's
pregnant and fragile Martin freaks out.
</P>
<P>
   Binoche and Techine take their time unveiling Alice's quiet
strength. But there's no overlooking it once she makes up her mind
to go to Martin's home town in the southern region of Cahors and
put things to rights, against entrenched opposition. Martin's stern
father is dead, his widow (Marthe Villabella) is a born
stonewaller, another forceful local woman (Carmen Maura) plays a
part in Martin's story, and his brothers aren't quite what Alice
expected. Binoche convinces utterly as a force of nature who's
making it up as she goes along, possessed by a sense of mission,
but not premeditation. Without ever overdoing, Techine photographs
her as a force of nature, too, whether against a rocky seashore or
a deceptively mellow background of trees in autumn. I'd be
surprised if the year gave us another film in which a woman stands
by her man with such softly unstoppable resolve. Lucky Martin.

INSURERS TRY TO BOOST REPUTATIONS AS MONEY MANAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At most mutual fund companies, this would be crisis time.
</P>
<P>
   The top marketing executive quit in April. The chief executive
jumped ship in May. Both veterans left their slow-moving Boston
investment shop, State Street Research &AMP; Management, for Internet
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the times? That's what the firm's parent, MetLife
Inc., says as it hunts for new top talent for the group. But it's
also an indication of the struggle insurers face as they try to
boost their lagging stature as money managers _ especially insurers
that have just become publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle is both cultural and financial, as people who have
worked for insurance companies attest. With a few notable
exceptions, insurers have a poor record of inspiring top-notch fund
performance and attracting assets to their fund groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance company assets are managed in a completely different
way than retail mutual funds,'' said John Benvenuto, a consultant
with Financial Research Corp. in Boston. ``You have to literally
build a large firewall and let them operate completely
independently.''
</P>
<P>
   Most insurance companies have only been in the fund business
since the 1980s or later. They entered the field to help attract
customers and to offer one-stop shopping for customers' financial
needs. But many have learned that's easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston's John Hancock Financial Services Inc., which sold
shares to the public for the first time in January, fund assets are
dwindling at a time when more successful fund groups are exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Assets in Hancock's fund group have dropped 6.7 percent in the
past 12 months, to $31.9 billion, as investors have withdrawn
millions of dollars in investments. Hancock's pretax earnings on
the fund unit fell 25 percent from a year ago, to $16.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In another Hancock investment unit, Independence Investment
Associates, institutional investors have pulled $1.2 billion from
the firm, mainly to shift to lower-cost index funds, Hancock said
in its earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock declined to discuss its investment groups. But the
company installed a new chief executive for the funds at the end of
last year _ annuity expert Maureen Ford, formerly of Mass Mutual
Life Insurance Co. _ and recently changed its commission structure
to improve fund sales.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife, which went public in April, is grappling with the same
issue: how to grow an investment business under a conservative
insurance culture.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, MetLife said it earned only $11 million on
its investment businesses, down from $14 million a year earlier.
Those earnings will decline once the company's sale of its 48
percent stake in another Boston investment firm, Nvest LP, is
complete. MetLife said it couldn't pass up the $2.2 billion deal,
but the move sparked questions about the insurer's commitment to
the sector.
</P>
<P>
   State Street Research's interim chief, Jeff Hodgman, a longtime
executive of the parent, assures: ``Having a first-rate investment
capability is not only desirable. It's critical to the growth of
the insurance business.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words of a company suddenly trying to impress Wall
Street. State Street Research's assets have been stagnant at about
$54 billion for the past 12 months. And for years, State Street has
been all but homeless at MetLife, reporting to the insurer's
general counsel, instead of to someone with responsibility for a
business line.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgman said that reporting line may change, but he promised
nothing: ``It's unusual, but that's the way we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is watching with some interest to see who will
replace Ralph Verni as CEO, as a gauge of MetLife's seriousness
about growing the business. The top candidate is said to be an
executive from T. Rowe Price, the successful Baltimore fund group.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a strong investment person in charge would help State
Street Research, analysts said. Two standouts among fund groups
that are owned by insurance companies, Boston-based Putnam
Investments and MFS Funds, are run by strong leaders who didn't
grow up in the insurance world.
</P>
<P>
   MFS's earnings have surged over the past three years and are now
the biggest slice of the profits of its parent, Toronto's Sun Life
Financial Services. Sun Life also recently switched from a mutual
company owned by its policyholders to a publicly traded concern.
Putnam's revenues grew at a rate of 19 percent in the second
quarter, nearly double the overall 10 percent rate for its parent,
March &AMP; McLennan Cos. Putnam's operating income jumped 17 percent,
to $256 million.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of good management can replace the power of strong
investment performance in attracting assets, analysts said. Both
Hancock and State Street Research have struggled with spotty
performance in recent years, while MFS in particular has batted out
huge returns on the kinds of aggressive stock funds that investors
favor these days.
</P>
<P>
   Fund executives complain that only a handful of companies have
been enjoying investors' attention in recent years. Outside of
Fidelity Investments, Janus, Vanguard, and a few others, it's been
tough going, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lehman Brothers analyst Eric Berg said, MetLife appears
committed to State Street Research: ``I believe it's an area
they're working on _ believing that performance issues can be
turned around there.''
</P>
<P>
   If the newly public insurance companies can't make a go of asset
management, Wall Street will surely demand that they spend their
resources elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgman isn't giving in yet. He says the goal for State Street
Research is ``clearly to make it larger, stronger, more profitable
and certainly more involved in the future of MetLife products.''

   BRITAIN-QUEEN-MOTHER (London) _ Surrounded by three generations
of the royal family, Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, celebrated
her 100th birthday on Friday waving to cheering well-wishers from
the Buckingham Palace balcony where she had helped lead national
rejoicing at the end of World War II and on other notable
occasions. By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-EVOCATIVE-SIGNS (Mexico City) _ The map of the world's
largest metropolis is a kind of literary masterpiece. The street
guide reads as if a writer from the school of magical realism had
cut his work into confetti and sprinkled it over the city. People
live on streets named Heart and named Soul. They live on Forest of
Light, Mirror of Water, Forest of Miracles, Garden of Memories,
Tree of Fire, Forest of Secrets, Sea of Dreams. Surreal street
names can reflect hard realities: Work is long. Love and Happiness
are short. Good Luck crosses Hope, then hits a dead end.
Intersections become works of imagination: the Volga River flows
into the Nile, Beethoven meets Bach, the Himalayas cross the Alps.
And Comprehension ends in Silence. By Tim Weiner.

   GOP-BUSH-ECONOMY (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush's acceptance
speech at the Republican National Convention Thursday night
emphasized several touchstones of his economic plan _ that this is
an age of prosperity and that those in greatest need should receive
the greatest help. But much of the Bush program was not mentioned _

<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ Job growth slowed in July, in the
clearest sign yet that the red-hot economy is cooling down.
American businesses added just 138,000 jobs in the month, down from
242,000 in June. The number of government jobs tumbled, as the
Census Bureau disbanded the legions of temporary workers it hired
to conduct the 2000 census, resulting in an overall loss of 108,000
jobs. The decline in overall payrolls was the first since January
1996 and the biggest in nearly a decade. But factories added the
most jobs in almost two years, and employment surged at restaurants
and financial firms, and the unemployment rate held steady at 4
percent. Average hourly wages grew 0.4 percent, slightly more than
expected but the same pace as in June. By David Leonhardt.

   UNILEVER-DIVIDE (London) _ Unilever, the global consumer goods
giant that has been on a buying spree in the United States,
announced Friday that it would realign the company into two
divisions, one focused on food brands like Lipton Tea and Ragu and
the other on consumer products like Dove soap and Elizabeth Arden
products. Unilever also announces a 7 percent rise in
second-quarter profits, higher than expected. By Alan Cowell.

   ORPHANED-BRANDS (Cincinnati, Ohio) _ Is now a good time to try
to make a business out of someone else's jilted labels? Behemoths
like Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever are becoming more aggressive in
dropping brands that are no longer among the market leaders. The
business of reviving so-called ghost or orphaned brands has its
risks, of course. For the two former P&AMP;G employees who have
acquired Procter &AMP; Gamble's Oxydol laundry detergent, the challenge
is how much life they can squeeze out of the 73-year-old brand.
``The question is, is Oxydol such an ancient brand that it is
valueless and not worth it to revive it?'' says a branding
consultant, noting the market's fierce competition. By Kruti
Tirvedi.

BUSH MAKES IT ALL ABOUT HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 6, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PHILADELPHIA -- To George W. Bush, all this isn't business,
it's personal. In making that bet, and showing his cards, he has
left Al Gore an opportunity to make the other case _ that it isn't
personal at all, that it is indeed business.
</P>
<P>
   The concepts that have really mattered for the past two weeks to
the backroom strategists and the GOP nominee himself involve
leadership, character, boldness, vision, decency, inclusiveness,
his family and faith.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. It's been about Him.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sound bet, with some interesting history behind it. But
Bush has left Al Gore an opportunity to make the case that it isn't
about Me, it's about You, and there's some interesting history
behind that, too. Forget the partisan edges for a moment, this is a
great time to get serious about strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In putting together Bush's campaign even as President Clinton's
impeachment trial was bombing in the Senate, advisers who briefed
writers during convention week acknowledged that two conflicting
currents are at work this year.
</P>
<P>
   One is the stiff odds against vice presidents being elected to
succeed the presidents who named them. Since they started running
as tickets early in the 19th century, only two Veeps have made it _
Martin Van Buren in 1836 and Bush's dad in 1988. One reason there
have been so many failures is that the instinct for party change is
particularly strong when the presidency is open. And this year,
because President Clinton is such a divisive personal figure, the
Bush candidacy is based on a conviction that this instinct is even
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another current that's even stronger historically.
This one has always kept the ``in'' party around when the economy
is prosperous, incomes are rising, the public mood about the
immediate future is positive, and the belief is that the country is
headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Van Buren and Bush's dad beat the historical odds,
and ironically why they each got defeated for reelection, leaving
our history without a sitting Veep having won two terms as
president since some guy named Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush enjoys a well-earned bounce in the polls, his advisers
are aware of these currents, and they are laboring to strengthen
the first and weaken the latter. Judgments about the convention
must be hedged because of the unprecedented lack of public interest
and television coverage, but one truth about conventions appears to
have survived _ namely, that they require a nominee to show most of
his big cards by the end.
</P>
<P>
   Bush put at least three more on the table here in addition to
the overwhelmingly personal nature of his basic appeal. Each is
both serious challenge and real opportunity for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He has decided to join Gore and Clinton as his opponents in
order to enhance the Clinton fatigue that his campaign believes
will make the high hill all vice presidents must climb even
steeper. Dick Cheney began showing this card with his surprisingly
direct argument that ``you never see one without thinking of the
other.'' Bush himself was no less direct in claiming that the
administration was asking for ``another chance,'' a ``third
chance'' that should be denied.
</P>
<P>
   It's a solid move if you are going after voters who personally
disapprove of the president. But it allows Gore is to go after
those who approve of the job Clinton has done _ numbers without
precedent in polling history.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has decided to go straight at this sentiment, too, with
another surprisingly direct argument that the ``Clinton-Gore''
administration's record is an eight-year flop. His planners have
assumed that the prosperity is so great and long-standing that it
is a given in the public's mind and that there is an opening for
the assertion that Clinton-Gore have ``squandered'' the opportunity
to take advantage of it to accomplish big things like fixing Social
Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he made the prosperity ``a test of character,''
another example of making the election about himself and not merely
about policy choices. He has to try, but in showing this card, he
has offered Gore an opportunity to make a totally different case:
Use the last eight years to make the case about the economic policy
record as a backdrop about what it will take to sustain this
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But the other opportunity for Gore is to remind the country what
conditions were like before the administration took office, when
the White House was occupied by another guy named Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not shrink from his truly conservative agenda of
everything from massive tax cuts to the effort to end abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign has now framed his positions as those of
someone who will lead on principle, the word Bush used over and
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Once more, he has made the issues more a matter of character,
his own, than choices facing the people.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Gore faces a well-set trap. By taking the bait and making
his campaign mostly about Bush's proposals and Texas record, he
will become the pure pol, the whiner about ``risky schemes'' Bush
ridiculed so expertly, the negative philosopher of roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's real opportunity is to emphasize his own ideas, a far
more convincing refutation of the one aspect of the governor's
campaign that is purely negative.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has put his best foot forward _ himself. But that leaves
the rest of us.

   HELEN-THOMAS (Philadelphia) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepted
the Republican presidential nomination with a soaring speech that
might be summed up as ``promises, promises, promises.'' Actually,
he almost sounded like a Democrat _ and he swiped a few pages out
of President Clinton's book. But that's only fair. After all,
Clinton hijacked the GOP agenda with his call for a balanced
budget, welfare reform and cutting the national debt. By HELEN

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ The relationship between the
George W. Bush's Republicans and Bill Clinton is a fascinating
study in contradictions. On the one hand, GOP leaders express their
disgust with the president's behavior and speak longingly of having
a president worthy of their respect. On the other hand, their
decision to transform the GOP's image by opening the party's doors
widely to African Americans, Hispanics and gays copies the type of
strategy that twice won the presidency for Clinton and the
Democrats. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Aug 6.)

   &UR; BY WILLIAM SALETAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is running against an administration that is
presiding over the best economy ever. He is one of the least
experienced politicians ever nominated for president, and he
represents a party that has been humiliated in the national policy
wars of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow, in his speech at the Republican convention Thursday
night, Bush managed to describe these conditions so persuasively
that he now leads Al Gore by 11 percentage points in a
post-convention NBC poll. How did Bush do it?
</P>
<P>
   RECAST ENDS AS MEANS. Every administration presides over some
things that go well and some that don't. In Gore's case, the ratio
of good to bad is exceptionally high. To adjust the ratio in his
favor, Bush defined everything that was accomplished in the last
eight years as raw material given to Gore. By subtraction, this
reduced Gore's ``record''what Gore has done with the raw materialto
everything that wasn't accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared, ``America has a strong economy and a surplus. We
have the public resources to strengthen Social Security and repair
Medicare. But this administration, during eight years of increasing
need, did nothing.'' He added that ``prosperity can be a tool in
our hands used to build and better our country'' and that ``the
Clinton-Gore administration has coasted through prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice the metaphors. Whereas Gore and President Clinton have
portrayed the economy and the surplus as ends (gardens ``grown'' by
wise policies), Bush portrayed them as means (a resource, a tool, a
downhill road). By switching metaphors, Bush changed the question
from what Gore has done for the economy to what Gore has done with
it.
</P>
<P>
   DISCOUNT SOLVED PROBLEMS. When the country's glass is half full,
the challenger points out that it's half empty. When the country's
glass is completely full, the challenger points out that the next
glass is half empty.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the economic glass is full, but the moral glass
isn't. So Bush argued that baby boomers have ``discovered that who
we are is more important than what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a bit like discovering after dinner that reading a book
is more important than eating dessert. The emergence of your
intellectual appetite presumes that your physical appetite has been
satisfied. By couching our transfer of attention from economics to
morals as a ``discovery,'' Bush camouflaged this satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ERASE INCONVENIENT HISTORY. Gore has spent eight years fighting
Republicans in Congress and preparing to run for president based on
the story of that fight. But Thursday night, Bush told a different
story: In Texas, ``We improved our schools dramatically. We moved
people from welfare to work. We strengthened our juvenile justice
laws. Our budgets have been balanced with surpluses. And we cut
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the story of Clinton and Gore and Newt Gingrich? Bush
blew it off: ``I don't have a lot of things that come with
Washington. I don't have enemies to fight. I have no stake in the
bitter arguments of the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   No stake? That's a flat-out renunciation of the congressional
GOPand an audacious end run around Gore's election strategy.
</P>
<P>
   REPACKAGE INEXPERIENCE. Critics have called Bush unschooled in
federal policy debates. Thursday night, he replied that because
he's an outsider, he can ``change the tone of Washington to one of
civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubters have said Bush hasn't prepared himself for the
presidency. Thursday night, he answered proudly, ``For me, gaining
this office is not the ambition of a lifetime.'' He implied that
his innocence could wash away the nation's sins and cynicism:
``After all of the shouting and all of the scandal, after all the
bitterness and broken faith, we can begin again.''
</P>
<P>
   He even wiped clean the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty: ``Now is
the time not to defend outdated treaties but to defend the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   GENERALIZE MORAL FAILURE. As Bush described it, Clinton's trysts
with Monica Lewinsky didn't just disgust and embarrass the country;
they corrupted public education and national defense. ``This
administration did not teach our children, it disillusioned them,''
Bush asserted.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``America's armed forces need better equipment, better
training, and better pay,'' he added, they also desperately lack
``a commander in chief who earns their respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Bush offered to restore the nation's moral health
simply by fulfilling his pledge ``to uphold the honor and dignity''
of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   SHIFT THE ASSOCIATION OF RISK. Clinton and Gore have trained
swing votes to associate ``security'' with government programs, in
contrast to ``risky schemes'' such as tax cuts and Social Security
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reversed this equation. Money diverted from Social Security
to individual retirement accounts will be in ``sound, responsible
investments,'' he argued. ``It's just not a program, it's your
property. Now is the time to give American workers security and
independence that no politician can ever take away.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore has observed that people can lose their savings in
the stock market, Bush pointed out that this risk is relative,
since people can also lose their savings in a government trust fund
raided by politicians for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   BREAK THE LIBERAL FALLACY. As the uproar over Dick Cheney's
voting record illustrates, liberal politicians and journalists
equate concern about a problem with willingness to fund federal
programs that purport to alleviate that problem. In his speech,
Bush rejected this assumption: ``The alternative to bureaucracy is
not indifference. It is to put conservative values and conservative
ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity''
through targeted tax credits and grants to private social service
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than administer aid directly, Bush argued, ``Government
can take the side of these groups, helping the helper, encouraging
the inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   REDEFINE CULTURAL ISSUES. Gore wants to focus attention on
traditional moral issues such as abortion, which can be reduced to
yes/no debates to scare swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush responded in two ways. First, he diluted the
familiar issues from yes/no debates to differences of degree.
Rather than admit he favors outlawing nearly all abortions, Bush
said he supports parental consent laws and a ban on partial-birth
abortions. And rather than insist on abstinence-only sex education,
he called for ``elevating character and abstinence from
afterthoughts to urgent goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, rather than mute his religious faith, he advertised it
as a source of compassion, an inspiration ``not to judge our
neighbors but to love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these tricks, Bush has bumped up his lead to double
digits. But two weeks from now, Gore gets his turn at the wheeland
if the vice president is half as good at spinning as the Texas
governor says he is, Bush will need all the head start he can get.

 &HT;    Old photos convey much more than mere props for a GOP skit
 &HT;    By Mary C. Schulken
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The yellowed picture of a dark-haired girl
hardly shows the creases of the years it rode out bombs in a young
man's wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the snapshot of him on her nightstand convey the weight
of her wondering whether he would come home from that place where
the world had gone to war.
</P>
<P>
   He gave four years because he was asked, and because it was his
way to honor obligation. She waited four years because he was
handsome and kind and funny. Theirs is the story of a generation.
It is as familiar as the dust mice that live under the
refrigerator, and as remarkable as buried treasure.
</P>
<P>
   And now it has become a marketing device for a political party
with eyes fixed on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The party of George W. Bush, baby boomer, has put him forth as
its best to hold the highest office in the land. He has never
fought a war. He served in the National Guard. He has a father who
fought a war, the big war, they call it. And a father who later
held, with dignity if not overwhelming effectiveness, the office
his son seeks.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Philadelphia, on the occasion of George W.'s
nomination, the Grand Old Party for one night devoted its
convention to the veterans of the nation's wars. There were teary
tributes to the greatest generation, and to past Republican
presidents, including Bush, that pointed to their years in uniform,
and what that meant. There was '40s song and dance by costumed
young performers far too carefree to know about war.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was through, the lives of men and women in ragged
wartime snapshots were draped around a candidate who seeks the
presidency with the name of his father, and little else.
</P>
<P>
   The girl in the yellowed picture is my mother. She spent her
life prodding knowledge into the minds of children who sometimes
didn't have shoes. They give her bear hugs now in the grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   She is 81, and lives alone in the house she shared with the
young man who carried her to war in his back pocket. At night,
before she turns out the lights, she looks at him in his
dress-downs in that photograph on her nightstand, just as she did
those long years they were apart.
</P>
<P>
   The life they lived was true and good and honest. But the times
were filled with unforgiving choices. My parents asked no thanks
for their convictions beyond the chance to live quietly.
</P>

   1. HOW DID BUSH'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH ACHIEVE ITS GOALS? by
William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is running against an administration that is
presiding over the best economy ever. He is one of the least
experienced politicians ever nominated for president, and he
represents a party that has been humiliated in the national policy
wars of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow, in his speech at the Republican convention Thursday
night, Bush managed to describe these conditions so persuasively
that he now leads Al Gore by 11 percentage points in a
post-convention NBC poll. How did Bush do it?

   2. WHO REALLY CHOSE BUSH AND CHENEY? by Michael Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   The real nominating conclave, of course, took place over a year
ago. You imagine a couple of dozen middle-aged white men in suits
gathered around a conference table in a dark-paneled room _
possibly even in Philadelphia, home of the late E. Digby Baltzell,
who chronicled the Protestant Establishment and coined the term
WASP. Let's even put a grandfather clock ticking self-confidently
against one wall.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda was simple and businesslike: Bring in new management.
Focus on the bottom line. Make sure that the GOP doesn't blow it
this time through zealotry, as in 1992, or sentiment, as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Someone said: ``What about George's boy _ the older one, I mean.
The one we've got running Texas. He's totally reliable _ not too
bright, no strong views _ and he's a great pol. They love him down
there.''

   3. POWELL WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT VICE PRESIDENT -- BUT THAT'S
ALL, by David Plotz
</P>
<P>
   A hallowed rite of American politics ended last Tuesday. Every
few weeks for the last six years, reporters have speculated
hopefully about whether Gen. Colin Powell would deign to run for
president or vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Countless polls have confirmed the general's astounding
popularity_ only 7 percent negative! That's better than motherhood!
When he declined a presidential run in 1995, Powell declared that
running for office was ``a calling that I do not yet hear.'' Now it
seems clear he never will.

   4. THE WORLD'S GREATEST POLITICAL ADMAN, by Scott Shuger
</P>
<P>
   Who is Bill Hillsman? He is the greatest political adman who
ever lived. It was Hillsman's ad campaigns that turned an obscure
college professor named Paul Wellstone into a U.S. senator and
helped professional wrestler Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura become a
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even Hillsman can't make Ralph Nader president. But he has
exactly the skills necessary to turn Nader from a campaign
curiosity into a candidate formidable enough to elect George W.
Bush.

&HT;     INTERNET `WEB STATIONS' ARRIVE AT MAJOR LEAGUE BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The seventh-inning stretch is coming up at the
ballpark and you realize it's been more than two hours since you
last logged in.
</P>
<P>
   Like a left-hander coming in from the bullpen, relief is here.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this week in San Francisco, Giants fans will have
limited access to the Internet at one of five ``Web Stations'' at
the Pac Bell Park, making it the first major league baseball
stadium in the nation to provide such a service.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Streetspace Inc., the company that last year
installed similar terminals at cafes and shops in Berkeley, put the
sleek little machines in the ballpark to give people access to
e-mail as well as selected sponsor sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pretty much living online these days. If there's a
break in the action or people are just walking around, it's a great
way to keep in touch,'' explained Michael Wranovics, vice president
of marketing at Streetspace.
</P>
<P>
   The terminals allow people to check out the San Francisco
Giants' home page, SFGiants.com, as well as the other sponsoring
sites _ Hotmail, CitySearch Bay Area, FOXSports.com and
ABCNews.com.
</P>
<P>
   It does not give people full access to the Internet but instead
operates as a closed network powered by Pacific Bell's high-speed
digital subscriber line, or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Wranovics said the stations are not designed for people to spend
long periods of time surfing the Web. The limited Internet access
also restricts people from calling up objectionable material, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stations, rather, allow people to send or receive mail, make
restaurant reservations or transactions, look at movie schedules or
get other quick bits of information.
</P>
<P>
   While the service is free to users, they must first register
with Streetspace to access the sites. Wranovics said the
registration is for privacy and for the company's internal
information and that the data is not sold or shared with other
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also do not pay for the Web Stations. The service is
supported by the five sponsors, a number which may be increased but
will be kept small for simplicity's sake. The number of terminals
may also be increased to as many as 30.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Alioto, the Giants' senior vice president of corporate
marketing, said the Giants considered installing ``smart seats,``
or screens on the back of seats that could provide limited Internet
access and other features.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace's Web Stations offered a less intrusive alternative,
Alioto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we really wanted to do this is that it adds to the
experience at the ballpark,'' he said. ``It's there if you want it,
but you don't have to go to it. It's just part of the
attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Streetspace, which was founded a year and a half ago, the
deal with the Giants is something of a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Streetspace has other deals in the works with nationally known
partners, Wranovics said. ``We are basically building an
infrastructure and we plan to build it all over the country,'' he
said.

&HT;     SHOPPERS GEAR UP FOR TAX-FREE SPREE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By LUCY HOOD   
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express News   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Notebooks, pens, pencils, crayons, erasers and
lunch boxes remind shoppers that a new school year is just around
the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But school supplies aren't on the list of items exempt from
state and local taxes during the annual three-day tax-free holiday,
which began Friday morning and ends at midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators says they hope to add school supplies _ as well as
backpacks and sewing materials _ to next year's list of tax-exempt
items and to extend the three-day event to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the notion of a sales tax holiday makes good public
policy in Texas, because we have such a regressive form of
taxation,'' said Texas Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, who sponsored
a bill in the 1999 session that created the tax-free holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ```I think the consumers appreciate a tax decrease any way they
can get it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sales tax reprieve applies to clothing and shoes with a
price tag less than $100. Consumers in San Antonio will save 7.75
percent in state and local taxes if they purchase any of the more
than 100 items on the list this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes the expected _ pants, shirts, tennis shoes,
socks _ and the unexpected _ adult diapers, boat shoes, hunting
vests and chef uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander says she wants to add
backpacks to the list, as well as fabric, thread, needles and other
sewing materials. She also wants to extend the tax-free period, but
she has not yet determined how long the holiday should be, said
Nick Voinis, a spokesman for the Comptroller's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comptroller is running some numbers to see how that would
affect the overall budget and revenue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers statewide saved more than $32 million last year, and
they're expected to save about $37 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money that back-to-school shoppers pocketed last year
represented a $25 million loss in state revenue and $7 million loss
in local revenue. One city, Sunset Valley outside Austin, opted out
of the sales tax holiday. At least two others, San Marcos and
Beaumont, considered the possibility, but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   Voinis said the loss in revenue wouldn't be a problem, despite
cost-overruns in the state budget amounting to $610 million. A $1.4
billion surplus in revenue covers that and the amount relinquished
this year because of the tax-free holiday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis also wants to exempt school supplies from the taxes and
extend the three-day tax reprieve to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize there are fiscal implications,'' he said, but ``by
expanding it, it would make it a lot easier on merchants and
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes Rylander and Ellis advocated require the approval of
the Legislature, which will convene in January. If approved, they
would take effect next summer.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tax-free holiday is identical to last year's, with
one exception: Customers can put clothes and shoes away on layaway
this weekend and still get them tax-free when they buy them later.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of four states with a tax-free holiday. The others
are Iowa, Florida and South Carolina. New York offered two weeks of
tax-free shopping in 1997, but the state eliminated the sales tax
on clothing beginning March 1, 2000, making the sales tax holiday
unnecessary.

   PHILADELPHIA _ It was a country music convention, for a country
music party, led by a country music candidate. We discover the
first Tuesday in November if America is a country music country.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush gave a very good speech, the best big speech he's
made ever, with pretty fair delivery, from an artful text, with
short phrases that helped him negotiate his big night. Introduced
by a fetching video of him driving across his ranch with his dog
Spot on his lap, Bush avoided the landmine of going too negative
against the Democrats. His family hates everything about Clinton &AMP;
Clinton, but Bush &AMP; Bush Inc. understands America does not want a
bitter and vengeful president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of inclusion,'' he said to Republicans whose
takeover of the Sun Belt states was based on Richard Nixon's
southern strategy. Every black congressman but one is a Democrat,
but Bush pulled off the biggest cosmetic makeover of a political
party in modern times. His official campaign song's refrain is
populist pablum: ``We pay the taxes, we pay the bills, so they
better pay attention up on Capital Hill.'' But his speech ignored
the GOP leaders who control Congress, and who were relegated to bit
parts here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's post-speech tableau was often obscured by the cascades of
150,000 balloons and 300 million _ that's what they claim _ pieces
of confetti. It was excessive _ perhaps `Tex-cessive' is the word _
and the stage was often invisible in the visual clutter. But this
was the biggest cosmetic job since they invented plastic surgery.
If it works, Bush is a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Fixated on Bill Clinton as his party is and his family remains,
Bush spoke of the President who licked his old man more in sorrow
than in anger. To every Bush, Al Gore is but an afterthought, a
speedbump on the way to Pennsylvania Ave., the address every
delegate here thinks will be won soon. ``So many talents, so much
charm, such great skills,'' mused the younger Bush of the hated
Clinton, ``so much promise, to no great purpose.'' Take that,
Bubba!
</P>
<P>
   It is the Bush crowd that is making this campaign a morality
play, a restoration drama. Dubbaya plays Prince Hal to the old
man's Lear, the scamp who'll reclaim the castle and make everything
right again. His strategy assumes that Gore is Clinton and Clinton
Gore. ``This administration had had its chance. They have not led.
We will,'' he said three times in a sort of irregular meter that
left no doubt he's running against two Democrats, one past and one
maybe future, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the speech was a pithy pitch for class and racial
harmony, a soft-and-cuddly alternative to the past two hard-edged
GOP conclaves that ended in vainglorious defeat. The closest thing
we heard resembling his father's fatal ``read my lips, no new
taxes!'' mantra was a pledge to rescue Social Security, to wit:
``No changes. No reductions. No way.'' No kidding, that's how he's
packaging it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still has that goofy grin at odd moments, brow furrowed,
biting his lip, like Johnny Carson waiting to deliver a straight
line. If he debates as well as he read his speech, the Democrats
have a problem. Half his speech could have been delivered by Ted
Kennedy, the reach-out-to-racial-harmony stuff. Then we got
Dubbaya's Four Big Ideas: huge tax cuts; school vouchers;
privatizing part of Social Security; and the missile defense scheme
many scientists say can't work and most world leaders decry. So the
Russians hate the idea? They don't vote, right?
</P>
<P>
   He tossed the I'll-ban-partial-birth-abortion bone to the right,
and tried to mollify the middle with ``good people can disagree''
on abortion, though he's against it. The crowd was won over before
he strolled onstage. It was rapture rampant. They see him
delivering them from that Clinton clone, Al the Afterthought. The
game plan aims at swing voters with touchy-feely ``compassionate
conservatism.'' But he doesn't rely on polls. Nah.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a brilliantly camouflaged convention, with a
relentless assembly line of black and brown speakers, with much
worthy and hearty rhetoric about lifting up the downtrodden. Off
camera were the corporate lobbyists and millionaire contributors
who slipped George W. Bush $10 million at lunch the day he hit
town, putting his personal haul this season over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment? Never happened, so far as this crowd heard. Henry
Hyde? All those syruppy southern senators who led Pickett's Charge
up Impeachment Hill? Non-persons, banished by the scriptwriters.
Newt Gingrich? He's working for Fox TV now, with a lot of the other
Clinton-bashers on the Murdoch payroll. The Pat Robertsons and
Jerry Falwells, those roistering reverends who threatened the likes
of Bush Sr. and Bob Dole with bumptious Biblical brimstone, were
relegated to the cheap seats.
</P>
<P>
   Where camouflage was insufficient, there was collective amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Sr. beat Mike Dukakis with attack ads featuring Willie
Horton, the black convict made famous by Bush television
commercials, showing revolving doors of dark-skinned marauders
supposedly turned loose upon white America by that lying liberal
from Massachusetts. Bush Sr.'s 1988 acceptance speech, vowing death
to cop-killers and promising prayer in schools, included this: ``.
. . it is a scandal to give a weekend furlough to a hardened
first-degree killer who hasn't even served enough time to be
eligible for parole,'' thundered Papa Bush. But Bush Jr. is going
the compassion route.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Jr. beat Ann Richards for governor in Texas by claiming she
hadn't built enough prisons (she only added more cells than any
previous governor) and was squishy-soft on crime. George Jr. has
130,000 prison inmates in Texas, makes money by importing other
cons from states with more pricey prison cells like Massachusetts,
and executed 132 locals to date. He lops them off at the rate of
one convict a week, give or take.
</P>
<P>
   But he wants America to know he gets all teary-eyed when he
talks to a 15-year old boy in a Texas hoosegow who later got shot.
Too bad. Of course, George Jr. also signed laws allowing Texans to
carry concealed handguns, and to protect gun makers from government
lawsuits. You have to watch this Texan's sleeves when he deals, as
well as the hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard news out of Philly is that the Bush campaign is
rolling. The candidate delivered the speechifying goods as
promised, the campaign hammered the heck out of every possible
upstart and the train is rolling on time. The delegates who left
town Friday think they have a winner. It may yet turn out that
America is not as lustful for change as Bush &AMP; Bush think. But
that's for Al Gore to prove. Earth to Al: better get off your butt
pronto. Labor Day may be too late.

&HT;     STOLEN STATUES STUN SAN ANTONIO CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By MICHAEL PARKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Three 18th-century statues stolen from San
Antonio's Mission San Juan could disappear into an international
black market of stolen art treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said the value of the artifacts can't be
measured in monetary terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an atrocity and a sacrilege, not only against the
church but against the priceless heritage of the whole community
and the nation,'' said Monsignor Larry Stuebben, vicar general of
the Archdiocese of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Someone pried open the doors to the mission church Monday night
or Tuesday morning and stole the carved and painted wooden statues
of St. Joseph, St. Francis of Assisi and St. John of Capistrano,
police reported.
</P>
<P>
   The thief or thieves removed the statues from the church's altar
and carted them off on a two-wheeled dolly, which left tracks to a
secluded parking lot on the north side of the church, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The lot has a gate adjacent to the priest's residence, but it
was unlocked and the priest was not in at the time, a police report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police had no suspects and said the statues' worth could not be
determined because of their ``religious, cultural and historical
value.''
</P>
<P>
   The statues are 3 to 4 feet high. Archdiocesan business manager
David Castilleja said they were carved in Spain during the 18th
century but donated as gifts to the mission recently.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Alexander, a San Antonio art and antiques appraiser, said a
huge market exists for stolen religious artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just here, it's around the world,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the statutes could be easily shipped off to auction.
</P>
<P>
   Stuebben said church officials are ``making an urgent appeal for
whoever took these items to return them for the sake of the church,
the community and the nation. They're irreplaceable.''

understand the importance of Jan Bullock's introduction of George
W. Bush at Thursday night's Republican National Convention. Perhaps
the people in Kansas and Arkansas felt the same way about the 1996
convention coverage when Bob Dole and Bill Clinton accepted their
party's nominations. I don't know. It's apparent, however, that a

I toiled in the newspaper business I never won a Pulitzer Prize, or

of ``scoops'' I think deserved honorable mention. For anyone who
doesn't know, a ``scoop'' is when a reporter digs up a significant
story before anyone else. For example, if Chelsea Clinton decided
to marry one of the Bush grandsons and I found out about it and was
the first to get the story into print, I'd have myself a scoop.(Jim

place where the world had gone to war. He gave four years because

waited four years because he was handsome and kind and funny.
Theirs is the story of a generation. It is as familiar as the dust
mice that live under the refrigerator at home, and as remarkable as

   The New York Times News Service plans the following articles
from the Style section for use Sunday, August 6, and thereafter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TALISMAN-CHIC (Undated) ) There is a vastly expanding tribe of
New Yorkers who, trusting nothing to chance, attempt to ward off
evil or beguile the gods by draping themselves in exotic beads and
talismans. Beetles and Buddhas, scarabs, pentagrams and pale pink
quartz _ any of these may function as a symbol of sincere religious
belief. But in the age of Spirituality Lite, they are also likely
to attest to the wearer's inner grooviness, just as her Jimmy Choo
mules speak of her up-to-date chic. By Ruth La Ferla.

</P>
<P>
   ROCK-FAN-FAMILIES (Undated) _ The rock concert, once a raucous
and often drug-filled rite of initiation into American adolescence,
is slowly becoming a family affair. Parents of teenagers and
younger children _ ones who, in their day, treasured concerts as
escapes from the parental clutches _ now want to share the
experience with their own offspring. It is increasingly easier to
do this as the musical tastes of the generations meld _ the 40-plus
group of Americans now buy more rock albums than those 15 to 24 _
and as concerts have been tamed by commercial sponsors to be as
clean as Broadway musicals. By Leslie Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   NITEOUT-ELIZABETH GILBERT (New York) _ On the town with
Elizabeth Gilbert, creator of ``Coyote Ugly.'' The heavily hyped
new Disney movie is based on a 1997 GQ article by Ms. Gilbert about
her experiences tending bar at the real Coyote Ugly in New York's
East Village. By Simon Houpt.
</P>
<P>
   DOTCOM-BLUES (Undated) _ ``Our multimillion-dollar dot-com
folded'', writes Timothy Jack Ward, ``and all I got was this lousy
T-shirt ... Everyone at Posh&AMP;Sticks got one, the day our enigmatic
_ let's face it, odd _ name was announced last January. Now it is a
bittersweet souvenir from the rush for the elusive e-commerce
mother lode. Don't get me wrong: I loved the name and was proud to
wear it on my chest. We gave this our best shot, but we are
toast.''
</P>
<P>
   MARGARET-CHO (New York) _ TV comic and former sitcom star
Margaret Cho is back as the one-woman star of her own movie. By
Linda Lee.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ I once disdained cannas, but that was
before I met Cleopatra. And before encountering Aaron, I was among
the many who looked down on caladiums. Maybe we've all loosened up
a bit, or perhaps summer bulbs have improved their image. For
whatever reason, summer bulbs are way cool again. By Tovah Martin.

CRASH INVESTIGATORS FIND UNIDENTIFIED STRIP OF METAL ON RUNWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Investigators looking into last week's crash of the Air
France Concorde said Friday that they had found a 16-inch strip of
metal on the runway that did not belong to the plane, and that they
have also found a ``large gash'' in a piece of tire debris.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have so far been unable to explain why the jet
caught fire on take off and crashed into a small wooden hotel, just
north of Paris, killing 114.
</P>
<P>
   Without any theories, French transportation officials have
continued to keep Air France's remaining Concorde planes out of
service.
</P>
<P>
   But a statement released Friday by the French crash
investigating agency suggested that investigators might be
considering the possibility that a problem that had nothing to do
with the plane's mechanics could have caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Since the disaster on July 25, speculation has largely focused
on the possibility that a tire suffered a blow out and debris from
it or a wheel sliced through fuel lines or fuel tanks, triggering a
fire. But investigators have yet to offer their opinion. The metal
strip could explain how the tire was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   But in their statement, the investigators continued to steer
clear of theories. They offered a smattering of new facts without
explaining how any of them might fit together. They have said that
a preliminary report will not be ready before the end of the month,
and a final report could take 18 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that one of the plane's left side tires
was changed before take off and survived the crash intact. Debris
from another tire on the left side was found on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Tire marks on the runway also showed that the plane had veered
to the left before taking off. Traces of soot, pieces of water
deflectors above the tire and debris from a fuel tank were also on
the runway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a water deflector on a British Airways Concorde broke
off and punctured a fuel tank. The British airline later modified
the deflector so that could not happen again. But Air France
officials have said they did not install the same modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Some Air France employees on Friday sent an open letter to the
airline to organize a special Concorde test flight to show that
they still have confidence in the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to keep it on the ground,'' said Gilles
Belliard, spokesman for the National Union of Civil Aviation
Mechanics. Belliard said mechanics and other employees would
volunteer to board the special flight.
</P>
<P>
   But Air France officials said no such flight would take place
before the Transportation Ministry ruled that Concordes could fly
again.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways briefly suspended its Concorde flights but went
back to regular service the day after the crash, which killed all
100 passengers and nine crew members and five people who were on
the ground in the town of Gonesse, where the plane crashed in a
ball of fire.

CULLING THE INNER BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 6, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In this campaign of psycho-biography, and
especially in the wake of last week's GOP convention, there's
scarcely an acre of George W. Bush's formative experience left
unplowed.
</P>
<P>
   We know of young George's light-hearted manner, developed to
console a grieving mother, and the back-slapping bonhomie honed at
Andover. We've felt his pain at Yale chaplain William Sloane
Coffin's cruel comment that his father had been defeated for the US
Senate by ``a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   We've winced at drunken George's Oedipal offer to go mano a mano
with his old man, empathized with feral George's need to break out
of his father's shadow, and celebrated mature George's
40th-birthday decision to choose Laura Bush over Jack Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   And yet when it comes to predicting what presidential George W.
Bush would do, we might be better off paying a little less
attention to personality and a little more to the ideas and
principles that would inform his policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't spell out each and every one in his acceptance
speech Thursday, but like the riverbed boulders that dictate the
current above, they were all there, guiding his vision of the
``responsibility era'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   Some were apparent: With a tax cut scored at $1.3 trillion over
nine years ($1.9 trillion over 10), Bush wants to lessen
Washington's claim on the wallet so that, as vice-presidential
nominee Dick Cheney phrased it on Wednesday, families ``can spend
more on what they value rather than on what the government thinks
is important.''
</P>
<P>
   But what other ideas would guide the second President Bush? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A renewed federalism &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the nomination of George W. Bush represents the
victory of the Republican Party's governors over its congressfolk.
One defining belief of the chief political executives is that
decisions on most matters affecting the states are best made in
state capitals rather than in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is after all in his second term as chief executive in
Texas, appears as serious as anyone about that devolution. ``He's a
governor and he knows that governors focus on getting results,''
said Governor Paul Cellucci, a close ally, in a convention-floor
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Bush mentioned that time and again on the stump, he
has built it into his proposals. Bush, says Stephen Goldsmith, his
chief domestic policy adviser, rejects ``the idea that what
government needs to do is go away, that there is no reason for
government, but he also rejects the view that the role of
government is Washington-centric and kind of statist.''
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, that means pushing decisions down to lower
levels of government. When it comes to education, for example, the
federal government would set standards, but it would be up to the
states and communities to decide how best to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of that approach is that by once again turning the
states into the laboratories of democracy, experimentation could
highlight programs that work, the way Wisconsin and Massachusetts
have with their revamps of welfare and Texas has with its efforts
to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   The tradeoff is that while some states will excel, others may
well founder, leading to a disparity of services nationwide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Going to market &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another of Bush's basic tenets is a broad faith in the
marketplace as a way to maximize choice and efficiency. ``A key
principle is that, when government helps, it should do so through
individual choices,'' says Goldsmith. ``He respects individuals and
the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   That belief has been expressed in two ways that have attracted
particular campaign-trail attention. Most notable is Bush's plan to
let Americans invest a portion of their Social Security paryoll tax
in the stock market, a plan that has proved so popular that Vice
President Al Gore, due to be nominated officially by the Democrats
next week, quickly followed suit with a similar proposal of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most significant example both of his philosophy on
wealth creation and of giving authority to individuals, as opposed
to the Washington bureaucracy,'' says Goldsmith. A second is Bush's
proposal for a refundable tax credit to help low-income families
purchase private health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   More controversial, and muted, is Bush's proposal for federal
education dollars. Here's how he put it in his acceptance speech:
``When a school district receives federal funds to teach poor
children, we expect them to learn. And if they don't, parents
should get the money to make a different choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a voucher program that dares not quite speak its name.
But even if Bush avoids the ideologically charged word, a voucher
by any other name still smells as sweet to free-marketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Anathema to teachers unions, that approach has growing appeal to
minorities, who are disproportionately trapped in underperforming
urban schools. Which is why it should come as no surprise that
Colin Powell endorsed the idea in his own speech, saying: ``Let's
experiment prudently with school voucher programs to see if they
help. Let's use innovation and competition . . . to help give our
children the best education possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of such an approach are several: increased
choice, access to better schools, and, if competition has the same
salutary effects on schools as it does on every other human
endeavor, improved public schools as well.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disadvantages. Vouchers still need Supreme
Court clearance, at least if they are to apply to religious schools
_ and without religious schools, Bush's plan would be unlikely to
offer a wide array of affordable choice.
</P>
<P>
   A second drawback to Bush's market orientation is that although
increased choice carries the prospect of greater reward, it also
comes with greater risk. Expect Gore to make much of that risk in
his critique of Bush's Social Security plan. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Faith in faith &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a stout supporter of letting faith-based groups use
public dollars to provide social service more typically delivered
by government or secular nonprofits _ but not, his advisers insist,
simply because he believes himself personally redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's ultimately a pragmatist,'' says Lawrence Lindsey,
Bush's chief economic adviser. ``The evidence is that faith-based
institutions are very efficient deliverers of public service and
actually helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush clearly thinks so. Highlighting a Minneapolis ministry that
provides the homeless with meals and a spiritual message, he put it
this way: ``Government cannot do this work. It can feed the body,
but it cannot reach the soul. Yet government can take the side of
these groups, helping the helper, encouraging the inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   A second reason Bush likes the idea, says Marvin Olasky, a
University of Texas journalism professor who has advised him on the
issue, is that it ``allows different groups to try different things
rather than going with the one size fits all'' approach of
government-administered programs.
</P>
<P>
   Olasky, author of ``Compassionate Conservatism: What It Is, What
It Does, and How It Can Transform America,'' is quick to note that
Bush isn't endorsing one religion over the next. All would be
eligible. And, he says, there would always be a secular alternative
for service delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To help those groups, Bush would allow individuals an
above-the-line tax exemption _ which would reduce one's taxable
income in the same way an IRA contribution does _ for charities of
their choice. He would also allow them to direct part of their tax
payments as contributions to those charities.
</P>
<P>
   The tradeoffs? The first is obvious: Bush's plan would further
erode the wall between church and state, with all the concerns that
entails. But an equally knotty issue is how to distinguish between
religious organizations. Focus on results, says Olasky. And if a
cult has the best results? That question remains unanswered. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Communitarian, not libertarian &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are two divergent streams of modern American conservatism.
The libertarian thrust, most closely associated with Western
conservatism, is best expressed by a desire to get government out
of the way. In 1980, Ronald Reagan paid campaign-trail tribute to
that idea, asking, rhetorically, how long it would take for people
to notice if the federal government simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with his plans to direct federal dollars to private
organizations to pursue social functions, has plotted a different
course: Using government to strengthen civil society.
</P>
<P>
   That's the prevailing current of today's conservatism _ and if
faith-based groups and charities work as billed to strengthen
society, the upside is obvious. But other conservatives raise a
second objection: Government may weaken the very groups it hopes to
harness for social good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want strong, dynamic, vigorous private organizations to
solve social problems, you need to keep them private,'' says David
Boaz, author of ``Libertarianism: A Primer'' and executive vice
president of the Cato Institute. ``Giving them government subsidies
makes them soft and dependent and subject to regulation.''

 &HT;    Cyberspace is the latest destination for millions of Americans
on a spiritual quest
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In cyberspace, no one can hear you scream.
</P>
<P>
   You can't shout anyone down, can't wag your finger in someone's
face, can't storm out of the room. In short, it's a great place for
people of various faiths to talk about the potentially explosive
issue of religion.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Rev. Charles Henderson, pastor of the First
Church of Cyberspace, discovered after creating and leading an
online church that is open to people of many beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson's 4-year-old cybercongregation _ he says his church
budget is only $19.95, the monthly Internet fee _ includes
Christians, Jews, atheists and pagans. Between debates on religion,
these virtual parishioners share personal struggles, prayers and
cyberhugs.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old Henderson is an ordained Presbyterian pastor who
has been in the ministry for three decades, but he's never pastored
a congregation like his online church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tremendously diverse,'' said Henderson from the church's
office in New York. ``It has pagans, Wiccans, liberals, gays,
straight _ that's what makes it so exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to confine your search for God to a house of
worship anymore. God has gone online. Internet experts say that
religion has become one of the most popular stops in cyberspace. At
least 25 percent of the estimated 100 million Americans online use
the Internet regularly to seek or share spirituality, a 1998 study
by the Barna Research Group, an organization that tracks religious
trends, concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional image of a religious community _ like-minded
believers who gather in a mosque, synagogue or church _ is being
revolutionized by cyberspirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Internet experts are divided on where such online connections
will lead. Some warn that faith communities that don't go online
will eventually perish.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a church or a denomination to ignore the Internet would
strike me as utterly foolish,'' said Mark Kellner, author of ``God
on the Internet'' (IDG Books Worldwide, $24.99, 308 pages).
</P>
<P>
   Others view the popularity of cyberreligion in less Darwinian
terms. They say the Internet will profoundly change how faith
communities interact with one another and the world, but believe
that online sites will never replace actual communities of worship.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson thinks there will always be churches, the type made of
wood and bricks and stained-glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be at a place at the same time,'' he said.
``That's an indispensable ingredient to being a Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   But the communications superhighway is growing busier each day.
Metro Atlanta churches, synagogues and other faith communities are
jumping aboard in ever-increasing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Buckhead cybercasts its
services live every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Congregation Or VeShalom, a Sephardic Jewish community in
north Atlanta, posts upcoming events, service schedules, Jewish
links _ even recipes _ on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Drepung Loseling Institute, a center for Tibetan Buddhist
studies in Atlanta, uses its site for religious and political
reasons. It talks about Tibet's mystical tradition as well as its
struggle to retain its culture under Chinese occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most traditional religious leaders have seen the wisdom
of going online.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tim McDonald, pastor of the First Iconium Baptist
Church in Atlanta, ``hoops'' during his sermons _ a traditional
form of preaching in the African-American community _ dresses in
conservative suits and still wears an Afro.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonald is also a cyberevangelist who rattles off technical
computer jargon like Scripture and gushes over the Internet's
impact on his ministry. He uses the Internet to e-mail members,
research sermons and welcome out-of-town visitors and others to his
ch and biblical passages, said he appreciates too many religious
traditions to label himself by any particular faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I am,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's discovered that the Internet is a powerful tool for
satisfying his spiritual yearning.
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual guides are only a click away, he learned after
e-mailing a Catholic monk who had written a book on ``centering
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The monk ``was stationed somewhere in China as a missionary,''
Strand says. ``I got his first response within 24 hours. That's
revolutionary. Do you understand what I would normally have to do
to get to him?''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching someone thousands of miles away is a bonus offered by
the computer age. But reaching a person across the street still
involves personal contact. That's why McDonald isn't worried about
the Web and what it offers.
</P>
<P>
   It will never replace holding another person's hand in prayer,
he thinks, but it will bring additional people to God.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he's noticed that the anonymity of the Web
encourages people to be more open _ he recently counseled a drug
addict too ashamed to reveal his problem in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people won't go to their church but they will go to
another pastor on the Internet,'' McDonald says.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald treats his laptop like his Bible _ it's his constant
companion.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask his other companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I are going on a Caribbean cruise for our 25th
wedding anniversary and she made only one request,'' McDonald says,
chuckling. ``She said, `Don't bring your computer.'''

 &HT;    A sampling of faith on the net
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching for God online is like going to a shopping mall. It's
difficult to know where to start because there are so many options.
</P>
<P>
   There are several megasites, however, that can help computer
surfers find their way.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular is Beliefnet.com, a 7-month-old site
co-founded by Steven Waldman, a former editor at U.S. News &AMP; World
Report.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated Web site carries links to information about
all the major religions, a look at religion in the news and popular
culture, plus columnists such as Bishop T.D. Jakes and Andrew
Greeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of this site is to help people in their own
spiritual needs as opposed to my definition of their spiritual
needs,'' Waldman said.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a section devoted to prayer circles, memorials
and discussions _ key ingredients to the popularity of spirituality
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of religion and spirituality is about community,''
Waldman said. ``That's where the Web really thrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of other Web sites dealing with religion and
spirituality:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About.com/religion: A guide to all the world's major religions
and sacred texts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Virtualjerusalem.com: Traditional Jewish site that includes
teaching and news for a worldwide community.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  DharmaNet.org: One of the most comprehensive Buddhist Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Islamseek.com: Great source for people curious about Islam as
well as serious students of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Christianityonline.com/bc/current: Christianity through books
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Hindunet.org: Good source for people seeking information on
Hindu beliefs and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Forministry.com: Created by the American Bible Society, this
free site will set up Web sites for churches.

 &HT;    Here's a step-by-step guide to tell you how to get started
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Climb on!
</P>
<P>
   In rock climbing circles, that's the standard ready-to-go signal
at the start of an ascent. But it also could be the rallying cry of
the small but die-hard corps for whom climbing has become a
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a metaphor for life,'' claims Jerry Dodgen, a 69-year-old
retired Atlanta stockbroker who runs the Challenge Rock Climbing
School with his wife, Kathryn. ``Climbing teaches people about
trust, accomplishment and overcoming fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Indoor and outdoor climbing is still widely regarded as a fringe
sport _ the New York-based fitness research company American Sports
Data, Inc. reports that about 7 million Americans climbed at least
once in 1999, up slightly from the previous year. Many, says
spokesman Harvey Lauer, consider it a once-in-a-lifetime challenge,
``like bungee jumping.''
</P>
<P>
   But as more and more people seek out extreme activities,
climbing's popularity may surge. Thom Gillott, 44, corporate
marketing director for the indoor climbing gym Atlanta Rocks, says
the sport's appeal is broadening.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began climbing six years ago, the demographic was male,
30 and older, at least 50K a year,'' he says. ``Now, we're getting
many more women and families.'' Gillott's own daughter is in on the
act _ 8-year-old Angelica recently won a gold medal in her age
group at the Georgia Games.
</P>
<P>
   Women, in fact, may make better climbers than men, says Thornton
Elmore, 23, climbing specialist at the northeast Atlanta location
of the adventure sports chain REI. ``They're more agile, and they
don't try to muscle themselves up the rock like many men do.''
</P>
<P>
   But where to start? Unlike, say, jogging, rock climbing takes a
good deal of preparation and the initial supervision of more
experienced climbers. ``You never want to go alone when you're a
beginner,'' cautions Elmore. Below, we've provided a list of what
you need to get a leg up on this complex, fulfilling pastime.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT TO BUY
</P>
<P>
   Beginners get more than sound advice by accompanying advanced
climbers, climbing specialist Thornton Elmore says. Expert rock
crawlers usually come well-equipped with ropes, clips, rings
(called carabiners) and temporary anchors (cams), so novices need
only spring for these essentials:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  HARNESS
</P>
<P>
   Supports climber. Connects to ropes and rock anchors to prevent
falls.
</P>
<P>
   The REI Trilogy ($55), with padded, adjustable leg loops and
four gear loops, is a good starter. For people with back problems,
Elmore recommends the Black Diamond Dyno ($49.95), which allows you
to shift weight from the back to the legs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SHOES
</P>
<P>
   Sturdy, flat-soled climbing shoes, called board-lasted shoes,
are best for beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Elmore suggests the Five Ten Spire ($99): ``It's not very
flexible, so it's good for feet that aren't yet strong enough to
hold on to the rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CHALK BAG
</P>
<P>
   Absorbs sweat from the hands.
</P>
<P>
   Available in either finger or whole-hand sizes, each around $19.
Chalk, in palm-size solid chunks or in powder form, is about $4.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ROPE
</P>
<P>
   Intermediate climbers will want to invest in a rope that's
bi-colored, to aid in balancing lengths, and dynamic, or slightly
elastic, to cushion falls.
</P>
<P>
   Ropes range from $99 to $195.
</P>
<P>
   Where to learn
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Challenge Rock Climbing School. Conducts all classes
outdoors, at Rocktown on Pigeon Mountain in northwest Georgia and
other locations. One-day beginner classes teach the proper use of
equipment, knot-tying and basic climbing skills. $80, optional shoe
rental $10. 1085 Capital Club Circle, Buckhead, 404-237-4021,

class for ages 12 and older, $35, includes daily membership rate
and equipment. Supervised novice climbs Wednesdays, Saturdays and
Sundays; $22. Club memberships range from $75 for one month to $480

</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Zipper and Long Island. Two areas in the Chattahoochee

 &HT;    Once-seedy district San Francisco's South of Market morphing
into Bay area's newest center of culture
 &HT;    Eds: Emabargoed for Sunday, August 6.
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to recharging downtown, this city
apparently feels there's no such thing as too much art, too much
culture, too much cool.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're already swimming in it.
</P>
<P>
   When 146,000 tourists show up on an average day _ more than the
population of Savannah _ it seems only smart to keep the museums
and high-tech hot spots coming online. After all, not everyone's
lining up for the cable cars, Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz and the
other traditional attractions.
</P>
<P>
   That's where South of Market comes in. This edgy enclave south
of the main artery (Market Street) is the city's new cultural
crossroads, a thriving blend of museums, restaurants, clubs and
dot-com businesses. SOMA has extended downtown's cosmopolitan
appeal through a once-seedy warehouse district south, in the
direction of Pacific Bell Park, the new waterfront home of
baseball's Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Although occupying the flat part of town, topographically
speaking, SOMA's future appears to be all upside. Its colonization
of cultural capital has sparked a land rush of dot-com companies
and their college-educated employees who have spawned a wave of
condo conversions and construction, driving up the already
intergalactic cost of housing (and drawing ire for uprooting some
of the have-not locals).
</P>
<P>
   Two destinations with different missions, the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art and Metreon, a Sony-sponsored entertainment
complex, have led the way. Each has attracted a comfortable mix of
residents and visitors, the cafe crowd and technology-infatuated
families. A steady stream of conventioneers from the Moscone Center
adds to the daytime pedestrian crush. (The neighborhood thins out
considerably at night.)
</P>
<P>
   Although SOMA is spread over roughly an 11-block area, the heart
of its activity is the stretch between Third and Fifth streets.
Here you'll find the museum of modern art _ ``SFMoMA'' to the SOMA
set _ the city's most popular museum.
</P>
<P>
   Just down Third Street from the museum is the icily cool,
cyberchic W Hotel, fronted by the fashionable XYZ restaurant, a
favorite hangout for the digerati from nearby Media Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is a floppy-disk toss from the placid gathering place
of Yerba Buena Gardens and Center for the Arts, a visual, media and
performing arts nexus with a waterfall tribute to the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   That's adjacent to the high-tech, family-embracing Metreon,
touting the world's only Microsoft and PlayStation stores along
with 15 movie screens, an Imax theater, a Discovery Channel store,
a digital-era arcade for teens and an interactive Maurice
Sendak-inspired rumpus room for kids.
</P>
<P>
   And that's within eyesight of the under-construction Jewish
museum. Near the planned Mexican museum. Close to the proposed
African-American museum. The reborn Ansel Adams Center for
Photography that opens this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a profound transformation,'' says Chris Culwell,
spokesman for the Yerba Buena center, referring to the last seven
years, when SOMA began its turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, this area was a dive, skid row,'' Culwell
says. ``You still hear some criticism that the development has
pushed lower-income people out of the neighborhood. But I think San
Franciscans view what's going on in SOMA as a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, SOMA's development has cost the area some of its
funkier character, which drew from its heavy population of bikers,
gays and nightclubbers. But the area's success is hard to dismiss,
even for old-timers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fringe element is the biggest thing I miss,'' says Dennis
Juarez, house manager for Slim's, an eclectic live-music club
nearby co-owned by musician Boz Scaggs. ``You don't see as much
black leather around here anymore. But the influx of new people in
the neighborhood is one reason we're doing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Many feel the emphasis on culture is the key that made SOMA
work. ``It makes the city look more like an arts center,'' says
Culwell. ``People realize San Francisco should be more than a place
to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can shed your share of disposable income in SOMA,
too. It's also just a five-block walk to the upscale shopping
district of Union Square.
</P>
<P>
   If you're feeling athletically inclined, all of SOMA's hot spots
exist within walking distance of the city's most acclaimed new
landmark, Pacific Bell Park. Here, right field meets the bay, and
the national pastime becomes subservient to a spectacular panorama
that, in the context of SOMA's story, offers nothing less than
another artistic experience.

 &HT;    Cultural adventure is a San Francisco treat

<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco _ No cable car goes to SOMA (South of Market
street), a trendy new cultural development. That automatically cuts
down on the touristy feel of this one-time working-class
neighborhood, a place where you can blend in with artistically
inclined visitors and techies who live and work in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of SOMA is dense enough not to require car or cab, but
it has plenty of breathing room, with sidewalk cafes and Yerba
Buena Gardens offering ample space to spread out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll want wheels if you're headed to some of SOMA's
more remote high points, such as Pacific Bell Park, home of
baseball's Giants. They're walkable from the museum district on a
nice day, but too far unless you have time to stroll or, at night,
a taste for unwelcome adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The following guide spotlights some of SOMA's best offerings.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Museum

that its most popular museum is dedicated to 20th-century art:
SFMoMA has 40,000 members, about the same as Atlanta's High Museum
of Art. Its annual budget is in the neighborhood of $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   SFMoMA's dramatic building, opened in 1995, is headquarters for
an institution founded 65 years ago as the second oldest museum in
the country dedicated to modern art, after New York's Museum of
Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by an impressive acquisition spree in the past two
years that has netted more than $130 million worth of art (Robert
Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly), the permanent
collection includes key works by Belgian surrealist Rene Magritte,
Piet Mondrian and Marcel Duchamp.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, an exhibit of 70 Magritte works and a retrospective
of photographer Walker Evans are the marquee shows _ through Sept.
5 and 12, respectively. You can sample the permanent collection in
``Matisse and Beyond,'' featuring, among others, Jackson Pollock's
``Guardians of the Secret,'' Joseph Stella's ``Bridge, 1936'' and
Picasso's ``Women of Algiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is a good place to start your tour of SOMA's Yerba
Buena Gardens area _ and an easy one to find. Its geometric
burnt-sienna facade is centered by a skylight that caps a
five-story cylindrical turret of contrasting black-and-white
granite. Inside you can head upstairs to the galleries and read up
on exhibits at one of many computer stations. Or you can
people-watch in the adjacent Caffe Museo. Or you can shop in the
3,500-square-foot, Nordic ice birch-appointed museum store.

</P>
<P>
   Metreon
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling that when Atlanta leaders were talking about
a downtown entertainment center, this high-tech amusement park and
digital-era shopping mall is what they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   A Sony Entertainment Center, Metreon, 1 year old in June, is a
four-story phantasmagoria where your options move at main-frame
speed. You're never quite sure when you've switched from retail
world to entertainment city, mostly because the shopping is such a
hands-on experience.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are so busily interactive, they seem just as happy
showcasing an item as selling it. You can send a digital postcard
for free from the Microsoft store (the world's only one, Sony
claims). Check out software in the PlayStation store. Listen to any
CD in the Sony Style store.
</P>
<P>
   Tykes can push buttons and operate all kinds of characters in
the Maurice Sendak-inspired attraction ``Where the Wild Things
Are.'' Older kids will want to try HyperBowl, Metreon's most
popular attraction, a virtual keggling game where you roll a real
bowling ball that shows up on a video-screen lane. You then
maneuver its speed and direction over various landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Metreon's greatest appeal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big, it has a lot of technology and it's fun,'' says
Kevin Lee, 13, of suburban Burlingame, while on a HyperBowl break.
</P>
<P>
   For a city as cosmopolitan as San Francisco, the mallish $115
million Metreon brings a suburban feel to the inner city. Intowners
apparently approve, though. The 15-scring geared to tourists and
conventions,'' says Louisa Lin, 28, a resident who works in
advertising. ``But I like the way they did it. It's nice to have
theaters and shops nearby. After work, we'll stop in sometimes to
get something to eat or see a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty like her, too; 60 percent of Metreon's audience
is local.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that some of Metreon's crowd drifts over to SFMoMA can
only help the museum. Last year's attendance tallies: SFMoMa,
736,136; Metreon, 6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   If Atlanta leaders are interested in those numbers, call Sony;
the only other Metreons are in Berlin and Tokyo.

</P>
<P>
   W Hotel
</P>
<P>
   There are bigger hotels in SOMA (such as the Argent). Hotels
with more outlandish architecture (the Marriott has been called
``the Jukebox''). There are more intimate boutique hideaways (the
Palomar). Yet none fits its SOMA address, the corner of culture and
technology, like the W San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This 31-story, 423-room hotel next to SFMoMA caters to the wired
business traveler, with each room's dual-line telephones and
high-speed Ethernet laptop access. But it's not merely functional:
The design has a New Age noir feel. The halls are lit with tiny
blue lights, large mirrors play with your depth perception. It
doesn't skimp on luxe amenities, either: Bathrooms are stocked with
Aveda products, each exercise machine in its 24-hour workout
facility is equipped with a Sony TV.
</P>
<P>
   If the W doesn't fit your lodging budget _ doubles average $325
per night _ it's still a destination. The XYZ restaurant is noted
for the French-accented California cuisine of chef Jeffrey Amber,
recently named by the San Francisco Chronicle one of the city's
five young chefs to watch (a signature dish: Pumpkin Seed-Crusted
Monkfish). You can have a luncheon feast for two for under $100,
including tip.
</P>
<P>
   The XYZ Bar was featured in a recent Harper's Bazaar magazine
story titled ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' that
nominated the watering hole, with its Ultrasuede seating and
glowing, egg-shaped fertility lamps, as happy hunting ground for
would-be golddiggers. A segment on NBC's ``Today'' show about
Silicon Valley singles was also taped here.
</P>
<P>
   In the lounge-happy Living Room just off the lobby, a young
crowd drapes all over the furniture and each other _ drinking,
reading, playing chess or, as on a recent night, engaging in
spirited laptop necking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever those people were plugging in to, they tapped into my
whole vibe about the hotel,'' says Jaime Wolf, 38, an entertainment
lawyer from Manhattan and recent W guest. ``It's totally relaxed.
Even though I didn't introduce myself to anyone, it felt very
comfortable and friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf found the XYZ Bar ``a little more swanky and stylish than I
was expecting from San Francisco. But I feel like to some extent
this (scene) is part of the dot-comization of San Francisco, where
you find this growing class of itinerant young people with dough.''

<P>
   Center for the Arts
</P>
<P>
   ``You think this could play in Atlanta?'' asks Chris Culwell,
the center's public relations manager.
</P>
<P>
   We're watching a video in which performance artist Patty Chang
slices through her brassiere with a huge knife, eventually
revealing a halved cantaloupe, which she scoops out with a spoon
and eats, all while relating a family anecdote. With a plate
balanced on her head.
</P>
<P>
   Yerba Buena is a visual and performing arts complex specializing
in small, experimental and, in the case of a recent surfing
exhibit, wavy shows illuminating San Francisco's diverse culture
while commenting on its history and contemporary society. (The
surfing show featured a couple of dozen mechanized life-size hula
girls dancing while brandishing automatic weapons.)
</P>
<P>
   The arts center doesn't attract the crowds that Metreon and even
SFMoMA do, drawing 20,000 annually. But its outdoor esplanade,
highlighted by a waterfall tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., is a green refuge for thousands of workers, tourists and
conventioneers every day. An ideal spot to lunch, read, watch the
human parade go by.

</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell Park
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling the San Francisco Giants have thought of
everything with their new stadium, once you learn they've found a
way for you to watch the ballgame in person without a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Several screened archways in right field are vantage points
especially customized for ticketless pedestrians, who can watch the
game for free, while practically standing on the warning track.
Giants employees supervise and rotate crowds every three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fans with tickets get a lot more. The comfortable spectating
confines of a new retro design. A stunning view of San Francisco
Bay, which abuts the right field wall at Willie McCovey Cove, where
batted ball occasionally meets waiting boaters. A diversity of
pricey California-accented concessions (tacos, garlic fries, sushi,
microbrews); a cheeseburger and fries cost $9.50, not including
beverage.
</P>
<P>
   Like Coca-Cola Skyfield at Turner Field, PacBell has a
playground area above left field for kids. Instead of Turner's base
path, though, PacBell has a miniature version of the entire stadium
where kids can hit and circle the bases, while watching themselves
on a digital scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   You also get something with every game that you rarely got at
Candlestick Park (later 3Com Park), the Giants' former home: a full
house. ``The park has galvanized this town,'' says Ronn Owens,
morning host for KGO-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stadium is technically sold out for the season, the
team puts several hundred bleacher seats on sale for every game.
(The Braves visit Aug. 18-20.)
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there's that free standing room. And boat seating
appears unlimited.

</P>
<P>
   Hamburger Mary's
</P>
<P>
   Ask co-owner Rose Christensen the recipe for her popular
restaurant's 28-year success, and the answer comes fast and sunny
side up. ``Big portions. Heavy food. Fair price. Mediocre
service.''
</P>
<P>
   You get a laugh with that, too.
</P>
<P>
   If you're seeking to sample genuine South of Market character,
this roadhouse-style joint with its cluttered garage-sale decor and
colorful clientele is a natural starting point. It's even better if
you're looking to chase a hangover with one of the 11 hamburgers
and eight Bloody Marys on the menu. (We should note that this is
the original Hamburger Mary's restaurant; it's independent from the
small West Coast chain that an early owner has built.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're beyond breakfast or brunch, Hamburger Mary's can be
used as a launch pad or nightcap niche for late-nighters who
migrate to area nightclubs like DNA Lounge and Slim's. (Breakfast
is served all the time; the bar is open until 2 a.m. You can get
the peanut butter shake anytime.)
</P>
<P>
   For an Atlanta point of reference, it's a bit like Manuel's but,
true to SOMA's early gay-district origins, heavy on the kitsch.
Cream for your coffee sits in miniature baby bottles, nipples
intact. The centerpiece of the main room is a giant plastic heart
hanging from the ceiling wrapped in barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen takes SOMA's gentrification in stride, although the
restaurant's area has not yet seen the drastic changes that have
taken place in the museum district. With parking at a premium and
homeless people flagging taxis for you, it's still definitely for
residents of the urban core and heartier outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   1582 Folsom St. 415-626-5767
</P>
<P>
   Slim's
</P>
<P>
   Presenting everything from head-banging metal to introspective
folk, this nightclub co-owned by musician and Bay area resident Boz
Scaggs has been a sturdy live-music survivor on the city's south
side since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Its eclectic schedule is somewhat akin to that of Variety
Playhouse in Little Five Points; recent headliners have been John
Mayall, Bruce Cockburn and Peter Case. The exposed-brick interior
changes formations depending on what the act's clientele requires _
tables and chairs or ad hoc mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   The beer list is extensive, the menu limited. The club is long
on the working-class environment that used to dominate SOMA. If the
music bill suits your taste and you're in the mood for decidedly
ungentrified surroundings, Slim's, a short walk from Hamburger
Mary's, is worth the cover charge.

MAC USER READY TO TAKE PC PLUNGE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Many years ago, I bought a Macintosh computer
and have continued to buy Macintoshes through the years. I want to
buy a PC. Where can I have my files from Microsoft Word 98
converted to be used on my PC? If this is impossible, I may have to
buy another Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seen the Light
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SEEN: Stop! Put down that checkbook nice and slowly, ma'am.
That's it. Now back away from the MasterCard. Good, good. OK, cuff
her, boys. Another senseless Macintosh purchase avoided.
</P>
<P>
   You Apple-heads put your pitchforks and torches away. Whether
you like it or not, most of the world's personal computing is done
on the PC platform, and there are people just as fervent about PCs
as you are about your Macs. I've used both, and guess what? They
both crash, they both have their eccentricities and they both
occasionally make me want to drive my fist through the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of a computing platform should be based on which
software someone intends to use, not on goofy case colors or
Compuserve rebates. For example, there are graphics and digital
video programs that either work better on a Mac or simply don't
exist for the PC. If that's the stuff you use, the decision is a
no-brainer. If you lean toward office suite software _ word
processing, databases, spreadsheets _ you're probably better off
with a PC. At least the hardware is usually cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   When software publishers saw Apple's market share sliding a few
years back, they made sure there would be PC versions of their
stuff around just in case Steve Jobs decided it was time to have
the big garage sale. Today, programs like Quark Xpress, InDesign,
Photoshop and Microsoft Office can read and write files from either
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Word is a good example. If you create a document on the Mac in
Word, it can be opened by Word on a PC. But don't think you have to
pay somebody a ton of money to do this, unless you'd like to hire
me for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Put a PC-formatted disk in the Mac and save your Word document
to it. If you give it a .Doc extension as you save it, you'll make
it a little easier on the PC end. Take the floppy to the PC, call
up the file, then do a Save As (from the File menu) to save it
somewhere on the PC, making sure the ``Save as type'' box on the
Save As dialog box is set to ``Word document,'' which it usually
is.
</P>
<P>
   Now go buy your PC. Sorry, Steve. Bill Gates wins another one.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Sometimes when I turn on my computer, the
hourglass icon appears on my screen as if I have clicked on an icon
to start a program or action. Can you tell me what this might be?
</P>
<P>
   _ Tempus Fugit
</P>
<P>
   DEAR TEMPUS: No need to worry. That's just Microsoft's
Eavesdropper 2000, a little-known feature of Windows that sends a
complete inventory of your hardware, copies of all your personal
documents, your browser history file and your bank balance and
credit card numbers back to World Domination Headquarters in
Redmond, Wash., every time you boot.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that hourglass just means that all the little
behind-the-scenes programs are continuing to load. Sometimes they
add icons to the System Tray as they load, sometimes not. To get an
idea of what's running, hit Control-Alt-Delete to get a list. The
only things that absolutely have to be there are Explorer and
Systray. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Emilio Bombay was kidding about Eavesdropper 2000. Except
for the credit card numbers, of course. Write him at

   NEW YORK _ Back then, he coached the greats, from Bob Lanier to
Shaquille O'Neal. He traveled on the Orlando Magic's private jet,
stocked with lobster, steak and Shaq's very own seven-foot bed.
</P>
<P>
   Now? His greats have names like Teresa Witherspoon, Vickie
Johnson. Luxury? Even the coach has flown coach.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, guy talk.
</P>
<P>
   Now?
</P>
<P>
   ``The women cry at everything,'' says Richie Adubato, 62, the
coach for the New York Liberty, who, with four games until
playoffs, are the top team in the Eastern Conference of the Women's
National Basketball Association. ``They cry if we lose. They cry if
we win.''
</P>
<P>
   He's throwing up his hands as he strides off the court after
practice at Madison Square Garden. ``Tari Phillips!'' he says, on a
tear about his sojourn in this strange new country. ``It takes her
an hour to put on her makeup _ and that's if she can find it!''
</P>
<P>
   What's a coach who spent nearly 40 years around sweaty guys to
do?
</P>
<P>
   It happens that Adubato is thrilled to be here. After 19 years
as an up-and-down coach in the National Basketball Association, he
has been as rejuvenated by this gutsy team of women _ many started
this season green, injured or overweight _ as they have been by
him. Referring to last summer, his first with the Liberty and with
coaching women, he adds, sitting in his office, ``I tell you, I
never had so many hugs and kisses in one season.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever chanted with the sweet, exuberant Liberty crowds
of 14,000 at the Garden or seen a game on TV _ Lifetime carries the
big one Friday night against the Orlando Miracle, former team of
Tari Phillips, the Liberty's center _ you know Adubato. He's the
ginger-headed man (New Jersey Italian dad, New Jersey Irish mom) in
a natty suit, running along the sidelines, frantically signalling
the girls (his term), working the refs, hard:
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw look, she's an actor! Did you see that? Right there! That's
an Academy Award. That was a nasty, hard foul. Wow. Now that _ that
is a new trick. I've never seen that before. Look, she did it
again!''
</P>
<P>
   Although one year he was fined 27 times _ What? Just for
defending his team? _ Adubato has calmed down. Being hired and
fired a lot, divorced and remarried, having a granddaughter, can
have that effect on a person. He was an assistant in Detroit,
Dallas, Cleveland, New York and Orlando; head coach at Detroit,
Dallas and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Blaze _ Carol Blazejowski, the Hall of Fame
guard and Liberty general manager _ had a meeting with Adubato in a
New Jersey diner, Adubato was just consulting for the Celtics' Rick
Pitino. He was courtsick for a team of his own.
</P>
<P>
   She was skeptical about hiring someone who was older, a guy and
who had never coached women. (He wondered: ``Do I have to say
woman-to-woman defense or can I still say man-to-man?'')
</P>
<P>
   She didn't know Adubato, son of a Cincinnati Reds' scout,
elected basketball over baseball, on the theory that even if your
team is short and can't shoot, there are a thousand other ways to
win. That he loved basketball so much that for 18 years, while a
junior high classroom teacher in inner-city Paterson, N.J., he
coached at local Catholic schools and colleges (when, fans, he
befriended coaches like Dick Vitale and Hubie Brown).
</P>
<P>
   Nor that his worst moment was not being fired after his first
two years coaching in the NBA, but having to walk back into that
eighth-grade classroom as a teacher again.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of her concerns, Blazejowski liked him. What's not to
like? He's funny, kind, pumped-up, demanding, a natural teacher, a
storyteller, not a screamer and a basketballholic.
</P>
<P>
   As his wife, Carol, says, he may not be able to remember bread
AND milk, but he can recite plays from 40 years ago. He relaxes
watching eight NBA games a night, taking notes. Orlando, you better
believe that at practice, he was teaching your moves: he watched
four tapes and had a scout's reports.
</P>
<P>
   He is also astute:
</P>
<P>
   In a tight game with Orlando, Crystal Robinson, his prize
shooter, fouled a player on a three-point shot with 20 seconds
left. She looked devastated. During timeout, he soothed her. You
didn't foul. Bad call. You can shut them down. Buoyed, she did the
job and then some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's coming to dinner?'' he will shout into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Adubato is still on a learning curve with this woman thing.
If the women are more coachable, more eager, more grateful, more
team-spirited and harder-working than the men, they are also ``more
emotional.'' He'll often ask a co-captain to deliver his stern
message. As for personal stuff?
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys could talk to me about marriage and divorce,'' he
says. ``None of the women are even married; they don't have those
kinds of problems.'' They turn to the co-captains or Patty Coyle,
an assistant coach, with personal issues. ``They come to me about
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   He never won an NBA championship. In the WNBA, the Liberty has
to clinch the conference title, win the playoffs, face down mighty
Los Angeles or Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? His team surprised everyone this season. He always
fantasized about a Manhattan ticker tape parade. ``But I never
dreamed,'' he says in wonderment, ``it might be for women.''

&HT;     BANK OF AMERICA WILL HEADQUARTER CALIFORNIA OPERATIONS IN LOS
ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Continuing a management reshuffling and
de-emphasis of San Francisco in the wake of its merger with
NationsBank, Bank of America has announced it would reunite its
northern and southern California divisions into a single unit, with
a Los Angeles-based executive heading the state operation.
</P>
<P>
   That executive will report directly to Charlotte, N.C., where
the bank is now headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   The former Bank of America was based in San Francisco from its
founding in 1904 to its acquisition by Charlotte-based NationsBank
in 1998. NationsBank then assumed the old Bank of America name, but
virtually every other local vestige of the former bank has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Liam E. McGee, a 10-year veteran of the bank, has been serving
as the financial institution's president of operations in southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   As the new head of the statewide division, McGee, 45, will
report to Gene Taylor, who was recently promoted to nationwide
president of consumer banking. Taylor, based in San Francisco, will
move to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Beck, the president of Bank of America's northern
California operation, has been reassigned to head the bank's
Western division of its increasingly important private banking
service, which caters to wealthy individuals. Beck will remain in
San Francisco and will be Bank of America's top-ranking executive
in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Beck replaces Kathleen Brown, the former president of private
banking for the Western region. Brown is leaving the company to
pursue ``other personal and career interests,'' according to a
release.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a former state treasurer and a former California
gubernatorial candidate. She is the sister of Oakland Mayor Jerry
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   McGee will oversee 40,000 employees and the management of more
than $185 billion in loans and deposits. Statewide, Bank of America
has 960 branches and about 5,000 automated teller machines, and
contributed $1 billion - or about a third - of the entire company's
profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America's shares rose $1.88 to $49.06, or 4 percent, in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the changes are expected to have little impact on
customers' business with the bank, it may raise hackles from those
who believe the bank's power base has been drained away from The
City.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McGee referred to the new California operation
as ``one rather substantial regional bank.`` He said the statewide
operation would not have an appreciable impact either on customer
service or on internal banking operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived in San Francisco, I'll spend a considerable amount
of time in San Francisco and I don't think that's an issue,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest moves are yet another indication of how much the bank
has changed since 1998. Prior to its merger with NationsBank, Bank
of America managed each line of business _ consumer, commercial,
small business and so forth _ on a statewide basis. After the
merger, the new North Carolina owner consolidated management of all
business lines into essentially regional banks, covering Northern
and Southern California. Now those functions will be consolidated
yet again, covering all lines of business for the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Wells Fargo _ the state's second-largest bank _
splits its California business into five regional banks _ Northern,
Southern, Central, Bay Area and greater Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bank of America said it would cut about 10,000 jobs,
representing about 7 percent of its total U.S. work force. The bank
has not yet provided details of the expected cuts.

Midwestern battleground states. BY R.G. RATCLIFFE.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   HELEN-THOMAS (Philadelphia) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepted
the Republican presidential nomination with a soaring speech that
might be summed up as ``promises, promises, promises.'' Actually,
he almost sounded like a Democrat _ and he swiped a few pages out
of President Clinton's book. But that's only fair. After all,
Clinton hijacked the GOP agenda with his call for a balanced
budget, welfare reform and cutting the national debt. By HELEN
THOMAS.

<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   HINES-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ Now for the hard part. George W.
Bush has had a phenomenal post-primary season. Now Bush has
concluded a Republican National Convention almost devoid of the
usual right-wing diatribes and ham-fisted attacks on Democrats.
Bush has to wish the election were this Tuesday instead of Nov. 7.
By CRAGG HINES.
</P>
<P>
   ELY-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ Bill Clinton got it wrong when he
derided George W. Bush's campaign as being based on the fact that
his ``daddy was president.'' The younger Bush's campaign against Al
Gore resembles Ronald Reagan's and Clinton's more than it does his
father's. By JANE ELY.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ George W. Bush may have garnered
all the press attention last week during the GOP convention, but
make no mistake, the Republican Party was also on trial. By CLAY
ROBISON.
</P>
<P>
   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ The relationship between the
George W. Bush's Republicans and Bill Clinton is a fascinating
study in contradictions. On the one hand, GOP leaders express their
disgust with the president's behavior and speak longingly of having
a president worthy of their respect. On the other hand, their
decision to transform the GOP's image by opening the party's doors
widely to African Americans, Hispanics and gays copies the type of
strategy that twice won the presidency for Clinton and the
Democrats. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Aug 6.)

POLES MAKE A FEAST OF COLD WAR LEFTOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
 By PETER S. GREEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEGNICA, Poland _ The eye-watering fumes of fresh paint waft
into the office in a former airport hangar, where Zofia
Kargul-Smalewska, president of Gielda C.D., a small exhibitions
company, is organizing the annual auto show this summer in this
small city in western Poland. She expects 10,000 people to show up
for the three-day event, kicking the tires of new and used cars and
watching drag races and motorcycle demonstrations on a former
Soviet air force base that was decommissioned after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   There is no comparable building in Legnica, said
Kargul-Smalewska, who has helped turn the base into a makeshift
industrial park. ``The Russians have been good for my business,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kargul-Smalewska is among thousands of Poles who, with
government aid, have worked to beat Soviet swords into shares of
post-Communist prosperity, an opportunity they have grabbed with
both hands. The Russians left behind scores of military
installations around the country, and at many of them factories,
apartments and even resorts are rising or are being planned _
although some of these plans do not yet amount to much. Most of the
investors so far are Poles, including several former redevelopment
officials; no one has tracked the totals.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, the 108,000 inhabitants of Legnica (pronounced
leg-NEE-tsa) had a very different view of the Russians, and there
was not much fresh paint to be smelled in the cavernous hangar. The
occupying Soviet Army's Northern Group of Forces used the town,
which was once German, and its garrison buildings from the 1930s as
their Polish headquarters. The occupying forces were despised by
the locals.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets invested billions of rubles building roads, an
airport, barracks, bunkers and fuel dumps for their army. War never
arrived, but when the Russians pulled out of Poland, Hungary and
what had been Czechoslovakia in mid-1993, they took with them every
sewage pump, electrical wire, door frame and window pane.
</P>
<P>
   What they left behind across the region resembled battlefields.
But it was also a unique opportunity. Kargul-Smalewska, in fact,
was one of the economic development officials in charge of finding
a new use for the abandoned airport before she decided to form her
own company and use the base for trade fairs and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Getting started was a struggle, she said. First, the Polish army
had to remove the mines seeded around the airfield. Then experts
had to clean up the fuel spills and industrial wastes. Because the
Soviets even took the maps of the water and electric lines, it was
simpler to put in new ones. ``It looked like a typhoon had been
through here,'' she said. ``Only the sewer lines were still good.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, crop dusters and private planes occasionally use the
runway. The hangars alongside the tarmac house a supermarket, a
hardware and building supply store and a string of apparently
successful small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Ryszard Kliszewski moved his small workshop, which
makes burglar-proof steel doors, from the city center to a former
Russian electric transformer station near the airstrip. The
Russians left only a roof and four walls. He invested about
$10,000, he said, and business is up 30 percent. He has increased
his work force from four to six men.
</P>
<P>
   ``You add a door here, a window there and you have a building,''
he said. ``It's a good location. All the big companies are around
you and because of the exhibitions next door, lots of people see
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some abandoned airfields find less exalted uses. In Kluczewo in
northwest Poland, Franciscus Nouwen, a Dutch farmer and one of the
few foreign investors, raises potatoes along the abandoned runway,
storing his crop in the bunkers that hid Soviet warplanes from
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In Legnica itself, the Soviets occupied an entire district of
the city _ called Tarninow _ that before World War II was home to
the mercantile upper crust. Gates and armed patrols kept most Poles
out of the quarter, which had its own shops and services for the
Soviets. Nearly everything the Soviets occupied was left damaged or
destroyed, but much has been rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any choice,'' said Stanislaw Kasprowiak, who
runs the Legnica city office charged with reviving the formerly
Soviet areas that were handed back to the Polish authorities. ``We
had to reconstruct these bases. Otherwise our city would be half
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Communism in 1989 and the ensuing economic shock
therapy brought Poland hyperinflation and 20 percent unemployment,
from which it is still recovering. Legnica had almost no cash to
put into redevelopment, but investors were attracted by ads in
local newspapers and, later, a Web site (www.celarf.gov.pl) and
speeches that public officials gave around the region. ``The goal
was for people with money to come here and take over the
properties, and basically it worked in Legnica,'' Kasprowiak said.
More than 92 percent of the property once occupied by the Russians
in the town has found new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Bogdan Wyznikiewicz, an economist who is deputy director of the
Gdansk Institute for Market Economics, said Poles have been able to
capitalize quickly on the Russian withdrawal. ``This
entrepreneurship is something in the national character,''
Wyznikiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and economists say that spirit is an important factor
in Poland's booming economy, which is expected to grow 5 percent
this year. The country is also bursting with start-up companies and
high-technology ventures.
</P>
<P>
   While entrepreneurs are making the most of the old bases, it was
only through government-run programs that the bases were sold.
Western governments provided no money and just a few training
programs for Polish officials trying to build capitalism on these
Communist ashes. But national and local officials provided tax
breaks, advice and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the city of Legnica finished rebuilding two of the
Soviets' rickety prefabricated concrete apartment blocks as a
demonstration of the gold that could be found amidst the Soviet
dross. The refurbished buildings were so attractive that the
apartments were rented within weeks, and now developers are
rebuilding the remainder of the apartments for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the buyers and investors were from the area. The city
offered easy terms, and Kasprowiak said most borrowers were making
their mortgage payments on time. He estimated that while the city
has taken in only about $7.5 million from selling 497 buildings, 10
to 15 times as much was privately invested in rebuilding the old
installations, and 600 to 700 new jobs were created, increasing tax
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Polish government has used the changes as an
opportunity to encourage people to settle in certain areas. In
Borne Sulinowo, a northern village that once housed Soviet
intelligence officers, some 5,000 migrants were recruited; most of
them were from Warsaw and the Silesian coal basin and fed up with
high prices and polluted air.
</P>
<P>
   A local entrepreneur was lured in to build a furniture factory
that now employs more than 400 people. New government jobs for
doctors, teachers and public administrators helped to draw in
others. So did the prices. ``We were selling apartments for an
eighth or a tenth the price of places in Warsaw,'' said Maria
Czerwinska, who heads the Polish government agency overseeing the
sale of the bases.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the reconstruction stories have turned out so well.
Warsaw city officials had high hopes for one abandoned airfield
near the city center after the singer Michael Jackson signed a
letter of intent in 1997 to build a $500 million theme park there.
On a visit to Poland, he told local journalists that he had fallen
in love with the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's project has yet to materialize, and the Warsaw
mayor canceled a scheduled news conference in March as negotiations
stalled. Jackson said in a statement then that he remains
interested.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the sale of former military property winds down,
other opportunities remain. ``There's an airport on the Baltic
Coast,'' Czerwinska said. ``A beautiful space for a golf course or
a luxury hotel.''

MARKET INSIGHT: NAME YOUR FORECAST FOR PRICELINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Walker didn't play Kevin Costner's dad in ``Field of
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walker, the founder of Priceline.com, knows all about ``if
you build it, they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, that is what he has been saying since he started
Priceline. On Wall Street it's called a ``demand collection
system'' that allows people to name their price for things like
plane tickets and hotel rooms. But Walker has more building to do.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he agreed to sell eight million of his Priceline
shares to entities controlled by Paul Allen and John Malone. The
proceeds of that sale, about $125 million after taxes, will be
piled into Priceline's WebHouse Club, a cash-hungry affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been questioning Priceline and other e-tailers
since March. Last week, Mark Rowen, an analyst at Prudential
Securities, talked about Priceline's prospects. Excerpts from the
conversation follow:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would you explain the Priceline.com business model?
</P>
<P>
   A. First, Priceline's model has to collect demand and then move
it to one supplier or another to get repaid for the discounts they
have gotten for consumers. If they get millions of customers, they
can go to consumer products companies and say ``reimburse us for
these discounts.'' The model works best in industries that have low
variable cost of production or inventory. An airline seat, for
example, has a variable cost of around $15. But if the flight takes
off and the seat is empty, the seat becomes worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Q. WebHouse Club sells groceries and gasoline. Do these products
fit the model?
</P>
<P>
   A. In many product categories, grocery costs are extremely low,
compared to the selling price. If a supplier can be convinced that
Priceline is bringing them new customers, it is very attractive
because they will make a large variable profit.
</P>
<P>
   Groceries could be their next blockbuster category, but it
appears that getting the grocery suppliers to pay for the discounts
is taking longer than we initially anticipated. As far as gasoline
is concerned, there is clearly huge demand: They have had one
million people sign up for the gas card.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long term, the variable cost of gasoline is high and
there are not a lot of profits in the channel to pay for discounts
between refiners and gas station owners, who don't make much money
off gasoline. Gas station owners make it off other products. If
owners sign on, they are hoping they will get a new customer to buy
gas as well as a Coke or an oil change. That may work, but the jury
is still out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about Priceline's other products, like home mortgages,
new car sales and long-distance telephone service?
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it will be hard for them to make a lot of money in
these areas, because in each of these products there are not
big-enough savings to pass on.
</P>
<P>
   The company is extremely bullish on long distance. But telephone
service is increasingly less expensive and commoditized. That makes
it hard for Priceline to get significant market share based on
price alone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a model that can work in just about every
industry. When I first heard about groceries, I didn't think it
would be particularly attractive. Yet once I got into it and
understood the power of the model in that industry, I changed my
mind. If the grocery business is successful for them, it can be a
$25 billion business for them, maybe bigger. Also, it is clear they
are going to roll this out internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is Priceline's e-tailing model anything like Amazon.com's?
</P>
<P>
   A. The models are completely different. Priceline's is more
attractive, because they are using existing infrastructure and the
Internet and technology to collect demand and direct traffic to
certain retailers and suppliers, and selling to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Doesn't their model make them less susceptible to problems in
a downturn?
</P>
<P>
   A. The fact that companies like Priceline and eBay don't take
physical possession of inventory and don't have to make large
investments in fixed assets makes their models more attractive than
Amazon's. Also, their core users, the real middle class of America,
are not even online yet. Long term, that bodes very well for
Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   In downturns, discounters are the retailers who fare better,
because people want to save more money. In a recession, I think you
will see Priceline do much better than many of the online and
traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You cut your rating on the stock to ``hold'' from ``strong
buy,'' and lowered your price target to $40 from $100. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. Part of the reason for the downgrade was that while the
travel business, which is doing about $1 billion in revenues, is
good, growth is starting to slow. I thought by the time growth in
the travel segment started to slow, the grocery business would be
there to take investors to the next level. But groceries are not
ready for prime time yet.

&HT;     MUSSELS: THE MIDDLE-CLASS OF THE MOLLUST FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA   
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mussels seem to be the middle-class of the mollusk family. They
aren't as revered as oysters and aren't as common as clams. But
they're there, by the thousands, filling bouillabaisse bowls and
adding color to paellas. But mussels are good for more than just
adding body to mixed seafood dishes. Mussels are also tasty on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of mussels available in Capital Region
grocery stores and seafood markets: The smaller, black, Prince
Edward Island mussel and the large, green-lipped New Zealand
variety.
</P>
<P>
   Black mussels have a delicate briny flavor and go well with
light ingredients such as white wine and chopped shallots. Most of
the black mussels you'll find in stores are farm-raised, which
means they'll be relatively free of sand and silt. They're also not
as flavorful as the wild mussels you can pluck from rocky beaches
in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the small black mussels, green-lipped mussels have a
pronounced flavor that can be paired with stronger ingredients such
as curry powder, chorizo or ham. The meat varies from tan to a rich
salmon color but this is no indication of taste or quality.
</P>
<P>
   When buying live mussels, whether black or green, look for
shellfish that are tightly closed. If the mussels are open, tap the
shell with your finger. The mussel should close within 30 seconds.
If it doesn't, the mussel has died and should be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Store fresh mussels in a bowl in the refrigerator covered with a
damp dish towel, writes James Petersen in ``Fish &AMP; Shellfish''
(1996). They are best eaten the same day they are purchased but can
be stored for a day or two. However, be sure to check them again
before cooking to ensure they are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Clean mussels by scrubbing with a stiff brush and remove the
beards just before cooking. How many to serve? If using as an
appetizer, allow 1/2 to 3/4 pound per person, according to the New
York Seafood Council. For a main course, 1 1/2 pounds per person is
sufficient.

   Now for the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has had a phenomenal post-primary season. He's
dominated media coverage both on image, not difficult given his
personality, and, more amazingly given the wispiness of some of his
proposals, on substance. Al Gore, meanwhile, has flounced from one
incarnation to another (nice Al, nasty Al, populist Al) seeking the
right tone for his campaign. Gore has yet to come anywhere close to
finding a silver bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush has concluded a Republican National Convention almost
devoid of the usual right-wing diatribes and ham-fisted attacks on
Democrats. Bush delivered a hope-filled acceptance speech and seems
to be at least 10 percentage points ahead of Gore in national polls
of likely voters. Maybe Bush has even picked up a touch of the
``inevitability'' factor that melted away in the heat of John
McCain's assault last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has to wish the election were this Tuesday instead of Nov.
7. It's not, as he and his campaign are painfully aware, but they
still like their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a powerful position in a very tough, close race,''
Bush strategist Karl Rove told reporters in Philadelphia last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will attempt to get back in the hunt with the announcement
Tuesday of his vice-presidential running mate as a curtain-raiser
for the Democratic convention that begins Aug. 14 in Los Angeles.
But it's difficult to see how almost any of the main prospects,
each a classic center-left Democrat, would dramatically alter the
basic political equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that Gore could do to jolt the race,'' Rove
contended.
</P>
<P>
   What Gore can do at his convention is seek to bring more
Democrats home. Polls show Bush already has the solid backing of
most Republicans (in the 90 percent range), but Gore lags on
support from traditional Democrats (in the 70s-low 80s).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe that if Gore plays his convention correctly,
he could pick up those wavering Democrats and see a good bounce in
national polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is far from over,'' Rove said. ``This race is
going to be by Labor Day in single digits one way or the other.
There are going to be points after the Democratic convention where,
in all likelihood, we're going to be behind.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not telling you I think Rove really believes that. I'm
telling you he said it.
</P>
<P>
   After the conventions, the race hinges on swing voters and swing
states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is looking most closely, Rove said (and he's the one who
really does the looking), at &QL; 
(1) suburbanites classed as ``weak Republicans'' or independents, &QL; 
(2) Roman Catholics, a big bloc in the usually closely contested
Great Lake states, and (3) Hispanics, who can be the margin of
victory in California, Florida and some smaller states.
</P>
<P>
   Looking across the Electoral College map, Rove found ``an
embarrassment of opportunities.'' Most alluring is the West Coast,
where Republican presidential candidates have not fared well &QL; 
of late.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally accepted that Gore cannot win without taking
California, and Rove believes Bush remains competitive in the
Golden State, despite the GOP's crash-and-burn showing in state
races two years ago and constant attention from President Clinton
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be getting our brains beat in California, and, in
fact, we're not,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of bravura, Rove did the map without even mentioning
the usual battlegrounds of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan
and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an election that has yet to shape up to a few, simple
states,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest test for Bush between now and November is almost
certainly the debates. Along with the national party conventions,
that's the only time the nation is anywhere close to being focused
on politics.
</P>
<P>
   These contests are a legitimate worry for Republicans. There's a
reason anti-wonk Bush is not known as a fabulous debater, and his
campaign remains hard at work to lower already basement-level
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our debate strategy can be summed up in one word: survive,''
said Rove, a grin starting to form. ``We hope to survive Governor
Bush's necessary appearance in debates against the world's most
pre-eminent debater _ a man who is more proficient at hand-to-hand
debate combat than any. ...'' You get the idea.

   THE WRONG MAN: MY NAME IS NOT ROBERT
</P>
<P>
   WRONG-MAN-JAILED-CENTERPIECE _ At 11:56 a.m. on Oct. 5, 1993,
Kerry Sanders was arrested in Los Angeles and booked as Robert
Sanders. The booking sheet included Kerry's physical
characteristics _ his height and weight, his right thumb print, the
scar on his left arm _ and Robert's birthplace and fugitive warrant
number. Within 24 hours, Kerry Sanders' extradition was approved.
Within two weeks, he was in the New York State correctional system.
But he was the wrong man. A look at how sloppy police work, a
hands-off justice system and an asleep-at-the-wheel prison turned
one man named Sanders into another. By Benjamin Weiser.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Iovine, co-chairman of Interscope Geffen A&AMP;M, slips the
videocassette in the player and plunks down in a comfy chair. He's
screening an early episode of ``Farmclub.com,'' a weekly music show
he's producing on the USA network. ``Farmclub'' runs right after
the World Wrestling Federation's ``Raw Is War,'' a
let-them-eat-beefcake extravaganza that is cable TV's highest-rated
show. The conjunction was no accident. Iovine avidly pursued it
because he wanted to capture the young males who watch wrestling.
The star of this episode is unquestionably Fred Durst, front man
for Limp Bizkit, a group that minted rap-metal, the aggressive,
hypermacho and extremely lucrative new pop-music genre that mixes
rap with rock. ``Watch this,'' Iovine says. ``This is what
'Farmclub' is all about.'' Just then, on the tape, Durst, enraged
that the show has just run the wrong version of a Limp Bizkit
video, threatens to hide a TV camera somewhere on the person of a
staff member.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is quite possibly the future of white male youth
culture _ camera-ready anger, staged to resemble wrestling. Iovine
is an entrepreneur of rage. He linked arms with the rap label Death
Row in the early '90s and made the gangsta rappers Snoop Dogg and
Dr. Dre household names. He signed Nine Inch Nails, whose
transgressive lyrics are the target of Washington conservatives,
and he, along with Dr. Dre, brought the world Eminem, the
anti-role-model white rapper who has recently been embroiled in a
public dust-up over virulent antigay lyrics. Iovine sees a great
future ahead for artists who take hip-hop in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you understand the impact on young white America that
hip-hop is having?'' he asks. To illustrate, he searches his Los
Angeles office for the FBI tally of crime statistics he keeps close
at hand. ``Crime has gone down remarkably. And rap music has been
the biggest it's ever been. So do guys like Tupac and DMX deserve
the Nobel Peace Prize? I don't know. What do you think?'' He's
joking, but only just.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Iovine frequently ponders the connections
between outrageous music and outrageous behavior, if only because
his artists and others like them often have a foot on both sides of
the line. Take last year's Woodstock, where rap-metal had its messy
coming out. The artists Rage Against the Machine, Korn, the Insane
Clown Posse and Everlast all played there, all of them fusing heavy
guitar sounds to boastful, profane hip-hop attitude. Promoters were
hoping for a nice millennial assortment of good vibes, while
audiences and artists clearly wanted to carve out a nastier slice
of history. It was Durst who put his finger on the scale. Before
the sea of Woodstock humanity, he announced: ``They want us to ask
you to mellow out. They said too many people are getting hurt.
Don't let nobody get hurt, but I don't think you should mellow
out.'' And then the seams split open. Limp Bizkit played their
testosterone-drenched ``Break Stuff,'' and the mood changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break Stuff'' rants against ``the he says-she says'' and
builds to a vow to ``break your ... face tonight.'' That's the
quintessential rap-rock moment, when everyday pressures and the old
he says-she says ignites in an updraft of rage. At Woodstock one
woman was reportedly raped as Limp Bizkit played, and a gang rape
allegedly occurred while the band Korn performed. Crisis counselors
say there were even more attacks, and at party's end, fires broke
out all over the grounds as rock fans trashed vehicles, automatic
teller machines and vendor stalls. There were few reports of
anybody mellowing out.
</P>
<P>
   Iovine thinks those who link Limp Bizkit to the Woodstock melee
miss the point. Earlier that day, he informs me, a 6-year-old
Michigan youth shot and killed another child. Iovine's artists have
been blamed before when fans have engaged in criminal behavior, so
he is quick to say now that music is not responsible for the
Michigan killing. While he laments what happened at Woodstock, he
contends that pushing audiences to respond is what great art does.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Detroit _ rap-metal's ground zero, home to Kid
Rock, Eminem and the Insane Clown Posse _ and I knew people who
needed Kid Rock in their lives, an artist raising the self-esteem
of doormats everywhere. The last time I saw my best friend from
high school, he was standing on the hood of his car, smashing in
the windows with his dad's golf clubs. I bet today he and his
children are Kid Rock fans. Boasting that he comes ``straight out
of the trailer,'' Rock hurls the epithet of ``white trash'' back at
the world, much in the same way gangsta groups like NWA did with
Compton and ``nigga.'' At its best, the current fusion of rap and
metal lets people who feel unblessed by the economy express some
righteous anger. But more often, rap-metal aims a lot lower.
</P>
<P>
   The new rap-metal frequently seems calculated _ to offend, to
rake in a quick, lewd buck. The influence of pornography on this
culture is worth noting. The band Korn, for example, garnered early
credibility among fans by posting interviews with porn stars on its
Web site. The Insane Clown Posse goes on cable-access porn shows.
Fred Durst appeared in ``Backstage Sluts 2.'' Porn gives bands cool
points and boosts their fan base.
</P>
<P>
   There is something creepy about the ongoing compulsion to wed
rap and metal and from there to fuse it with wrestling and porn and
seemingly every other precinct in popular culture. And it hasn't
peaked yet. Recently, Eminem's new album broke records for
first-week sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the music itself can sometimes be profound. Eminem, in
his brilliant ``Guilty Conscience,'' ponders robbing a liquor
store, taking advantage of a 15-year-old and killing a cheating
wife. He gleefully forces you to consider whatever differences
exist between thoughts and deeds while making you extremely
uncomfortable to discover that maybe the two aren't far enough
apart. (And judging from recent reports of his offstage behavior,
words and deeds might not be so distant for Eminem, either.) It is
about the meaninglessness of good intentions and maybe even the
death of them.
</P>
<P>
   Call them knuckleheads or young white guys; Spin magazine
lambasted them with the term ``mooks,'' a label that has since bee
picked up as a badge of honor. And suddenly there are enough
members of the mook club to fill up many Woodstocks. We've all seen
them at the mall: kids who ostentatiously say ``whuzzup'' to one
another; the frat brothers who wear stop-and-frisk fashions; the
countless fans who recognize the porn star on the cover of
Blink-182's last album.
</P>
<P>
   White music fans have long been curious about black culture, but
the wholesale interest in miming the black underclass is new. As
far back as ``On the Road,'' Jack Kerouac fantasized raptly, ``At
lilac evening I walked with every muscle aching ... wishing I were
a Negro, feeling that the best the white world offered was not
enough ecstasy for me, not enough life, joy, kicks, darkness,
music, not enough night.''
</P>
<P>
   James Brown fascinated white kids in the '60s with a peephole
glimpse of a world of grace and grit. But the black rapper DMX, and
before him Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., now offers a
wide-screen movie of ghetto life, relishing the details, relating
the intricacy of topics like drug dealing, brawling, pimping and
black-on-black crime. Rap makes these things seem sexy, and it
makes life on the streets seem as thrilling as a Playstation game.
</P>
<P>
   Today black youth culture is no secret, nor is it about joy and
kicks. Today a thousand arena spotlights shine on such race
fantasies, and they are billboarded and exploited by media outlets
and entertainment conglomerates. The fantasy lands of rap,
wrestling and porn have aligned to shape a real audience, one that
looks awfully hardened. Woodstockers have been called spoiled
brats, pacified suburbanites, testosterone junkies with no real
reason to be angry. Their crime, to their critics, is one of
insincerity. It's a powerful argument. But once the windows start
breaking, rage isn't really earned or counterfeit. It just is. And
at that point, rage is no longer the problem of a group of problem
kids. At that moment, it's everybody's problem.
</P>
<P>
   The literature of mookography is full of family turmoil, of
parents and children turning on one another. Take the weekly saga
(run between matches) involving the WWF overlord McMahon and his
kids, who wrestle, turn very, very bad, ``marry'' wrestlers Dad
doesn't approve of, get ``gang raped'' and so on. Even professional
wrestling is about family excess.
</P>
<P>
   Making parents mad and recounting family tensions have always
been a part of rock 'n' roll since Daddy took the T-Bird away, but
today's full-out family trauma is different, and part of what makes
rap-metal stand out in comparison with the other top-ranking pop
music, teen bubble gum. Eminem raps about discovering that his
mother was a drug addict. In real life, she's suing him for $10
million for defamation of character. Kid Rock once told an
interviewer that he found career motivation in being kicked out of
his parents' house for refusing to go to family therapy. The band
Korn once put out a news release stating that some of its members
were child-abuse survivors. Fans know the lyrics and the back
stories and are drawn in because in these stories, they see
something of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Fred Durst, the man who has taken lumps for
``triggering'' Woodstock, hedges his bets, sounding simultaneously
apologetic and defiant. ``I literally don't do anything to hurt
anyone,'' Durst says. ``I believe in karma more than you
understand. And I believe in God. And when I'm at Woodstock and a
riot breaks out _ I didn't know. Everybody's jumping and I can't
see and all of a sudden there's these riots and someone got raped.
Dude, if I'd known that, I would have stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls ``Break Stuff,'' the song he played when the mood
palpably changed at Woodstock, ``a mistake,'' which he won't repeat
on the next Bizkit album. But he's not ready to shoulder all the
blame: ``They burned the place down, but it's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst, 29, grew up in Gastonia, N.C., a small town where one of
his best friends was a black kid whose father, a D.J., played Fred
rap records that he had bought in New York. ``All of a sudden I was
obsessed with this beat and this way of storytelling,'' Durst
explains. ``And I thought, Man, I tell you what, this has got to be
the best thing that's ever happened in my life.'' He became a
figure common everywhere today: the white kid with the boom box,
the stylized walk, the pants flashing boxers. Before this kid was
an archetype, though, he was more likely to be called weird, or
worse. In a place like Gastonia, and then Jacksonville, Fla., where
his family moved, Durst was called ``nigger lover.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined a break-dance crew _ four black kids and him _ and won
the seventh-grade talent show. But after that, things were
different at school. Suddenly all the jocks wanted to beat him up,
he says, ``and anybody that was, like, 'normal' said, 'Hey this
guy's a freak.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the years after school, Durst fathered a child, spent a year
in the Navy, worked as a tattoo artist and then formed a band. The
mid-90's was a savvy moment to create a new sound. Jordan Schur,
who founded Limp Bizkit's label, Flip, explains: ``Rock had kind of
fizzled, and a lot of these young kids in the suburbs, the
skatekids, they wanted a rock-star element. They were getting more
of that from rap. But a lot of those kids still liked the big riffs
and the big sound of rock. It was natural to go toward a fusion of
the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the Los Angeles rehearsal studio, standing among
mannequins of monsters, the members of Limp Bizkit don't look like
teen-age icons. Durst sits on a couch, repairing a skateboard as
the rest of the group sets up. The band plays four songs that this
fall, on their next album, ``Chocolate Starfish and Hotdog Flavored
Water,'' will continue posing the argument that hip-hop is white
culture too.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is happy with where the music is going. The
African-American rapper Mos Def pointedly attacks Limp Bizkit
(along with Elvis and Kenny G) on his recent album ``Black on Both
Sides,'' recasting a familiar charge that hip-hop and rock 'n' roll
are both black music that whites have appropriated. He is in some
ways right.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Limp Bizkit continues to pursue total world
domination. Durst has become a senior vice president at Interscope
Records; as a high-ranking talent scout, he envisions huge
battles-of-the-bands traveling across the country, with the best
getting signed to his label. And Durst says he has raised
``hundreds of thousands of dollars'' for a cable channel featuring
round-the-clock extreme sports and music programming.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even his most ambitious project. He hopes to erase the
blot of Woodstock with a huge festival of hard-core hip-hop and
rap-metal, the edgiest stuff he can get. He would like to line up
Korn, the Ruff Ryders, Wu-Tang Clan, Dr. Dre and Eminem and more.
The show will be free, and he's toying with the idea of making the
food and drinks free, too, a rebuke to Woodstock's $12 pizzas. And
he vows to make it violence-free.
</P>
<P>
   The responsibility weighs heavily on Durst's sloping shoulders.
``Pretty much everybody says our generation has this problem,'' he
says. ``We were the problem at Woodstock. But you know what? I'll
put together the heaviest rock and hip-hop bands, and it will be
the most peaceful, fun, killer event you'll ever see.'' It's a long
way from happening, though. Should it work, a generation will have
a whole new set of defining symbols. And one of them will be
wearing a red baseball cap backward.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly every day inside Green Haven Prison in Stormville, N.Y.,
behind the 30-foot-high concrete walls and 12 watchtowers, within
the endless gray corridors and tiers of windowless cells, the
inmate Robert Sanders asked the same question: Why am I here? He
asked the guards in the main unit of the maximum-security prison,
where he spent most of his time alone in Cell No. 22 on the third
level, crying and praying and drinking too much coffee. He asked
the doctors, social workers and nurses in the psychiatric unit,
where he was often sent to deal with the voices in his head.
</P>
<P>
   To the staff members, his questions were evidence of his
psychosis. ``He becomes delusional,'' they wrote in his chart. ``He
has bizarre behavior.'' The prisoner had a habit of picking
cigarette butts up off the floor, but not of showering. Everyone
complained that he gave off an unbearable smell, and the red-hooded
sweatshirt he habitually wore was caked with food and dirt. They
complained at night, too, when his chattering echoed down the
narrow hall of A Block. The psychiatric team urged him to improve
his hygiene and attend classes in ``daily living skills.'' He was
given 15 minutes of weekly therapy and heavy doses of Haldol, an
antipsychotic drug that left his body rigid and his emotions flat.
But his bewilderment grew. ``Pt. said he has no idea why the plane
took him to N.Y.,'' a nurse wrote in Sanders' chart. He also ``does
not know what crime he did and his name is not Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison records showed that Robert Sanders was a career criminal
from New York who tried to kill a man over cocaine in 1990 and
escaped three years later while on work release at a
minimum-security prison in the Bronx. Within months, he was
recaptured and sent to Green Haven, a virtual fortress that houses
the state's only execution chamber and 2,194 of its most violent
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   There, the inmate told the staff about his life in Los Angeles.
He talked about his mother, Mary, who had given birth to eight
children before she had her youngest child, a boy named Kerry. He
knew a lot about carpentry. And he remembered spending time at a
mental hospital in Los Angeles because he was sick. But he could
not understand why he was in prison or why everyone was calling him
Robert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks somewhat confused,'' wrote Dr. Edward Y. Chung, the
psychiatrist who oversaw the inmate's care, ``and the response to
the questioning is illogical.'' Harold Roberson, a therapist in the
psychiatric unit, recorded similar observations. ``He has on
several occasions made statements that would indicate delusional
thinking,'' Roberson wrote in the chart. ``He stated we are holding
him here because he committed no crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmate's assertion might well have seemed implausible, given
the extensive system of checks and safeguards used in law
enforcement to ensure that one person is not mistaken for another.
There is a national database of fingerprints and photographs, which
are taken when people are arrested; there are lawyers and judges to
protect and administer justice; and there are prison staffs with
files on the medical, personal and criminal histories of inmates.
The United States has had its share of wrongly convicted people,
but the idea that a man who had never even been convicted was
behind bars seemed inconceivable. That a prison did not know whom
it had in custody would mean it had failed the most basic test of
its competence and security.
</P>
<P>
   So Sanders was shuttled from his cell to the psychiatric unit
and back to his cell again. The staff continued to give him Haldol.
He continued to sink deeper into depression and invisibility.
Weeks, months and finally two years passed as Mary Sanders Lee
searched for her youngest son in the streets of Los Angeles. But
she would never find him there. Kerry Sanders was in Green Haven
prison in Stormville, N.Y., serving time for a man named Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sanders had a sweet disposition, but he was not someone
who had much luck in life. Being born on the particular day of June
25, 1966, would turn out to be his greatest misfortune. He had
grown up in the neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles, and by
the time he was 27, he had been in and out of mental hospitals for
seven years, his body and spirit losing out to the voices in his
head. He was found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and
like many people with the disease, he felt the relief and
desperation that came with going on and off his medication.
</P>
<P>
   When Sanders was not in the hospital, he stayed with his mother
or one of his sisters. When his demons became too great, he would
leave for the streets. On the morning of Oct. 5, 1993, he was
sleeping on a bench outside the Los Angeles County-University of
Southern California Medical Center when Richard S. Bentley, a
county police officer patrolling the hospital grounds, approached
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up?'' asked Sanders, who was wearing a black T-shirt
and jeans and had just opened his eyes. Officer Bentley's police
report shows that he asked Sanders if he was all right or needed
medical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm all right,'' Sanders replied. ``I was just
sleeping.'' There was a bandage on his leg, and he said he had been
treated at the hospital earlier that night. He told the officer he
was homeless and showed him hospital identification, which gave his
name, Kerry Sanders, and date of birth. The officer asked whether
he had ``any business'' at the hospital. ``No, sir,'' Sanders
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley then cited Sanders for trespassing and radioed the
information to a police dispatcher. Up came two warrants under the
name Sanders with the birth date of June 25, 1966. One was for
Kerry Sanders, for failing to appear at a hearing over a jaywalking
ticket in Los Angeles. The other was for Robert Sanders, an escaped
felon from New York; it advised ``caution.'' The warrants listed
each man as African-American. Robert Sanders was described as 5
foot 8, 175 pounds and a native of New York City. He had scars on
both arms. Kerry Sanders was described as 5 foot 6 and 155 pounds.
He had one scar on his left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Bentley said in a recent interview that when he asked Sanders if
he used any other names, he responded, ``Yes _ Terry and Robert.''
``I asked him whether he was the Robert Sanders they were looking
for in New York,'' Bentley said, ``and he looked me straight in the
eye and said, 'Yes, I am.''' But in his police report, Bentley
listed only ``Terry'' under nicknames and made no mention of the
exchange about New York. Bentley told his superiors that he
suspected Kerry Sanders was the fugitive Robert Sanders. The case
was turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department, and at 11:56
a.m. Kerry Sanders was arrested and booked as Robert Sanders. The
booking sheet included Kerry's physical characteristics _ his
height and weight, his right thumb print, the scar on his left arm
_ and Robert's birthplace and fugitive warrant number. Within 24
hours, Kerry Sanders' extradition was approved. Within two weeks,
he was in the New York State correctional system, answering to the
name Robert as well as his own, a confused response that would have
devastating results.
</P>
<P>
   A man incapable of making his own breaks, Sanders never got one
along the way. In Los Angeles, he was not given the required
screening that could have revealed his poor mental state. Police
and corrections officials in Los Angeles and New York never noticed
that the photographs of the two men did not match - nor that Robert
had multiple tattoos, while Kerry had only a small one on his hand.
No one saw that the jaywalking ticket Kerry Sanders received in Los
Angeles on July 14, 1993, was issued while Robert Sanders was
serving a three-to-nine-year prison term more than 2,800 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever compared the two men's fingerprints and matched them
through the vast national computer database. Had they been checked,
a routine law enforcement practice when a felony suspect is
apprehended, it could have taken just hours to show that Kerry was
the wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he found himself in the Municipal Court of Los Angeles
the next day, stuck in a holding tank with dozens of other
prisoners awaiting hearings. He was assigned a deputy public
defender, Stanley I. Efron, who met briefly with him, encouraging
him not to fight extradition. Efron said in an interview that he
examined the warrant and noticed the physical discrepancies between
the two men. But he found them to be innocuous, so he asked his
client whether he was Robert Sanders from New York. ``Yes,'' Kerry
replied. Efron explained that if he fought extradition, he would
only prolong his stay in the county jail before being returned to
New York anyway. He said Kerry agreed to sign a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   In his own records, the public defender summarized his meeting
with Kerry Sanders this way: ``Admits ID. Can't bail. Wants to
waive.'' Efron left blank the other sections on the form for
information about the defendant's family, pending cases, prior
record and financial status. Efron, 58, who has worked for 30 years
in the public defender's office, said Kerry ``answered all the
questions, and I was convinced he was the guy.'' It was one of four
extradition cases the public defender handled that morning, and he
remembered Kerry as being subdued and slow. ``I had to explain
things to him more than once,'' Efron recalled. But he said Kerry's
behavior did not set off any alarm bells, nor did the events that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   When Efron gave Kerry copies of the waiver, which began, ``I,
Robert Sanders, do hereby freely and voluntarily state that I am
the identical Robert Sanders,'' he signed them ``Kerry Sanders''
and drew doodles all over one copy. The case then moved to Judge
Abraham A. Khan, who stopped the proceeding after Kerry said he
hadn't even read the form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you sign it?'' Khan asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Kerry replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you sign it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they told me to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan had the public defender review the form again with his
client. Within minutes, both said it had been read and understood.
``The court is satisfied,'' Khan said, moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's fate now belonged to New York, and on Oct. 20, Sgt.
Joseph H. Badstein Jr. and another state correctional officer
picked up their prisoner in Los Angeles. It was raining late that
night when Kerry, shackled in leg irons, handcuffs, a waist chain
and black lockbox, arrived with the two officers at the Downstate
Correctional Facility in Fishkill, N.Y., a processing center for
inmates. The watch commander wrote in his logbook: ''11:04 p.m.
Received absconder from Fulton C.F. Sanders, Robert 90 A 8885.'' He
was issued an inmate ID card, which he signed ``Kerry Sanders.''
The corrections department typed ``Kerry Sanders'' into the name
line as well. He was taken to the infirmary, given a delousing
shower and examined by a nurse, Linda A. Rohling. Within 15
minutes, she concluded that he might be mentally ill. Sanders
``claims past psych history,'' Rohling wrote. He had been taking
Haldol, an antipsychotic drug, and Cogentin, which was given to
alleviate the physical side effects of Haldol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last dose five months ago,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   A social worker, Michelyne Duvivier, who examined him the next
morning, checked the records on Robert Sanders, who was in prison
five months earlier, and found no history of mental illness. ``No
records found of psych in prison,'' she wrote. The significance
went unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 12 weeks, Kerry remained in the mental-observation
unit at Downstate, one of 35,801 inmates who entered the New York
State prison system in 1993. Withdrawn and quiet, he paced back and
forth in the unit's recreation area. He giddily said he had
``special powers,'' but they were ``good powers'' he used to help
others. One morning he flooded his cell with water. ``He tried to
'wash his clothing' in the toilet,'' the chart says. ``Sees nothing
unusual about this behavior.'' He also repeatedly asked why he was
locked up, pleading with one nurse, ``When can I go home?'' The
nurse later wrote that he was still confused about where he was,
even claiming ``disbelief that this was a prison.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of December, Kerry was transferred to Green Haven, a
maximum-security prison about 60 miles north of Manhattan. Given
that Robert Sanders had absconded from a minimum-security site, it
was determined that he would require a more secure location. The
New York authorities, now believing they had their man, pulled
Robert Sanders' fugitive warrant from the national computer system.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of nine children, Kerry Sanders had a singular
connection with his mother, Mary Sanders Lee. When she dropped him
off at elementary school, the teachers told her that she might as
well stay, too, because her son would chase after her anyway. When
Kerry and his friends swooped through the streets on their bikes,
she followed them in her car. ``He was the leader of all
devilment,'' Lee said of her rambunctious son. ``He was a good
little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's father, John Sanders, a gas-station attendant in Watts,
was Lee's second husband. She has been married three times and
widowed just as many, and for long periods struggled financially to
support her nine children. As a young child, Kerry had a healthy
mind and body, and his family remembers the little boy who played
with his hamster and his dog and loved to read. ``He was a whiz in
books,'' said his sister Diane, who is three years older than Kerry
and used to get help from him with her homework. But as Kerry got
older, his family life became increasingly turbulent. His father
died when he was a teen-ager. His brother Carl was killed in a
police shooting. Two other brothers were in and out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee hoped Kerry would go to college like another son,
Gilbert, who became a music professor. But her youngest child was
not inter-ested. ``He wasn't going to go to no college,'' she said.
``I wasn't going to make no professor out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Kerry enlisted in the Job Corps in San
Bernardino, Calif., where he learned carpentry skills and fell in
love with a girl named Kim, whose name he had tattooed on the back
of his right hand. They had a baby, a daughter. But Kim's parents
didn't approve of him and soon took mother and child away.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1986, when Kerry was 20, psychological problems
began to manifest themselves. He told doctors at one psychiatric
ward that he had been hearing voices for five years. ``He kept the
voices a secret until one month ago, when they became
intolerable,'' a doctor wrote. ``The voices now tell him to kill
himself, and he feels he may lose control.'' The doctors diagnosed
schizophrenia and chronic paranoia and put him on antipsychotic
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, Kerry floated among hospitals, the
streets and the homes of family members, struggling with the
hallucinations and delusions, the disorganized speech and erratic
behavior, caused by his illness. He could be stubborn and
frightening and difficult to control. ``Every once in a while he
would at least come home to eat,'' said a cousin, Linda Evans.
``We'd have to hold him down to get a shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee welcomed her son at the door when he showed up and
prayed when he left. She took him to psychiatrists and to
hospitals. She befriended the owners of delicatessens, doughnut
shops and check-cashing stores on the streets where Kerry roamed,
asking them to keep an eye out for her son. And she tried to focus
on the better times: Kerry, when stabilized on medication, would
dance with his niece and watch his baby cousin and spend hours at
his mother's home, reading magazines and mysteries and books on
carpentry. He promised to build her a house someday. ``I told him,
'I be so old I won't be able to sit down in it,''' Lee recalled.
``He said, 'Momma, you don't know what I'll do for you, so hush.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1993, Kerry was once again off his medication
and living on the streets, and he was out of touch with his family
for weeks at a time. On July 14, the police stopped him for
crossing against a red light. He was issued a ticket for jaywalking
but did not appear for a hearing. A misdemeanor warrant was issued
for his arrest and entered in the police computer. By late fall,
Lee became alarmed when she still hadn't heard from Kerry and he
hadn't shown up to get his monthly disability check. She said she
took the uncashed check to the Social Security office, telling a
clerk that she had no idea where her son had gone.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 29, 1993, Kerry Sanders arrived at Green Haven, a
sprawling compound of weathered concrete buildings on 928 acres of
Dutchess County farmland. Low-rising corridors connect each of its
nine cellblocks like a maze, giving boundary to several grassy
prison yards and numerous guarded checkpoints. Sanders was
constantly being moved between his cell and the psychiatric ward.
He was a stocky man, soft-fleshed and gentle, and his round face
made him look much younger than his 27 years. From the beginning,
he was a peculiarity to the staff and other inmates - silent,
withdrawn, disoriented.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his arrival, Sanders met Dr. Chung, the psychiatrist
who would supervise his care. The prisoner was cooperative but had
problems, Chung wrote in the chart. His posture was rigid, his gait
not spontaneous. ``He looks like a zombie,'' the doctor noted,
ordering that Kerry remain on Haldol and stay in the psychiatric
unit ``for closer observation.'' On Jan. 3, 1994, Sanders attended
his first weekly session with the mental health team assigned to
his case. A nurse, Silvia Koola, wrote in his chart that he
``observed that he was confused and does not know why he is in New
York prison; even his homeland is Los Angeles.'' She added, ``He
also was telling he does not know what crime he did and his name is
not Robert.'' In mid-January, Sanders was transferred to the third
tier of A Block, one of several cramped cellblocks on the west side
of the compound, near the psychiatric facility, a prison yard and
the mess hall. At times, the grayness of the place was consumed by
its own monotonous noise, of bars clanging, of inmates being led
through the corridors, of guards yelling out orders and counting
the jumpsuited men in their cells.
</P>
<P>
   It was a world in which Sanders feared to be alone but was more
fearful of being with others. He spent most of his time in his
cell, making occasional trips to the yard to smoke, to watch
television or to play dominos or cards. His counselors remarked
that he befriended no one and that they could not get him to
participate in group activities like the video club or table games.
``He has a psychiatric disorder,'' a social worker, Donald L.
Hanson, noted. ``He needs a supportive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff listened to him talk about his family, his woodworking
and his stays in mental hospitals in California. They wrote it all
down, meticulously. None of it matched the information the prison
system had on Robert Sanders, but no one noticed anyway. Chung
continued to see Kerry regularly, usually once a month, in his
office in the psychiatric unit. The doctor reported after each
session that the patient was ``doing well.'' Other mental health
workers described a grimmer picture.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of July 7, 1994, a guard found a frightened
Sanders acting bizarrely in his cell and escorted him to the
psychiatric unit. ``He appears somewhat confused,'' wrote Dr.
Stanley Skollar, the psychiatrist on duty. ``He is willing to
accept medication but indicates that because of this 'fright' he
didn't sleep last night and 'will not sleep tonight.' We will give
him his Haldol.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, Chung wrote in his notes that Sanders said he was
pregnant; the doctor also observed that Sanders was ``doing well''
in his daily activities. That month, Hanson, the social worker,
noted that Sanders was doing poorly in his academic classes. Harold
Roberson, the recreational therapist, wrote that Sanders was
depressed and tired. ``Client continues to feel that we are holding
him here,'' he added, ``often asking when are we going to let him
go home.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 16, Chung wrote that Sanders no longer believed he was
pregnant and that he was doing better in his classes. ``He sleeps
well and eats well.'' One week later, on Sept. 23, Roberson
observed Sanders to be hearing voices and talking to himself. That
same day, Chung noted that he was smiling and laughing
inappropriately. He said he was 24 years old, even though he was
28. ``He is doing well,'' the doctor wrote. On Oct. 20, 1994, as
Sanders' first year in prison ended, Roberson wrote that the
prisoner was still hearing voices and complaining, ``They won't let
me go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee tied a handkerchief around her head and set out by bus
and then foot to search the streets of South-Central where she knew
Kerry liked to hang out: Florence, Hoover, Figueroa. She had been
looking for her son for months, knocking on doors, going in and out
of stores and showing Kerry's photograph to as many people as she
could. Her road map, she said, was ``wherever you think his mind
would think to take him.''
</P>
<P>
   The blocks, many of them burned out and deserted, the remnants
of the Rodney King rioting in 1992, were controlled by rival gangs,
and Lee, 60 and practical, did not hesitate to rely on them to help
her on her way. When she finished on one block, gang members guided
her to the next one, whistling loudly as they passed her into new
territory. She changed the handkerchief around her head to match
the next gang's colors and kept going.
</P>
<P>
   The search was exhausting. One day, dispirited, she found
herself being encouraged by a young boy who walked alongside her.
``Mary Mother, she been crying like you when Jesus was missing them
three years,'' he told her. ``So you crying about your son? What
about Jesus, who died for us?'' It was ``the beautifulest thing
that I ever heard a young boy tell me in my life,'' said Lee, the
granddaughter of a Baptist minister. ``I really did step fast then,
when that child told me that.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt driven to find her son, she said, despite the
conviction of family members that her search was futile. Some of
her children suggested that she hold a memorial service for Kerry
and grew concerned when she said she could hear his voice. ``Round
by dusk, dark, I could hear him calling,'' Lee explained. ``I could
hear the sound of keys, the rattling of keys. I kept telling them:
'Well, he's got to be somewhere, kidnapped. Somebody got him
somewhere locked up, and he can't get to me. I keep hearing him
say, 'Momma,' and I know I'm not going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   She combed the parks, skid row and hospitals and pleaded with
the homeless. She sent Kerry's picture to the Sally Jessy Raphael
show after seeing a program about missing family members. And she
forced herself to make trips to the county morgue, where she asked
about the latest ``John Doe'' bodies. ``I didn't have it in my
heart that my son was dead,'' Lee said. ``If he's dead, I'm dead.''
</P>
<P>
   She became a regular at the police station in her neighborhood,
seeking out officers who patrolled the streets and knew her son.
When she wasn't at the station house, she was phoning the officers
there to see if there was any news. ``Did you pick him up or
anything?'' she asked them. ``I hope I'll find him 'fore you do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kerry Sanders arrived at Green Haven, his hold on reality
was faint and fragile: he knew his name, he knew details about his
family and life in Los Angeles and he remembered his time in the
Job Corps. By the fall of 1994, as he entered his second year in
the prison, that thread of sanity was all but vanished. As the
voices in his head grew louder, so did his chattering. ``He said he
was aware of it and it will not happen again,'' Hanson wrote after
other prisoners complained that Sanders was keeping them up at
night. As the months dragged on, so did Sanders' solitary routines.
``He rarely comes to staff to complain about anything except, 'When
am I going to be let out of here?''' Roberson observed on Nov. 23,
1994.
</P>
<P>
   There was a widespread view among the staff that Sanders'
questioning did not need to be investigated. Juan Villalba, a
correctional officer assigned to inmates with psychiatric problems,
would later say that Sanders came to him at least once a week,
asking: ``Mr. Poncho, when they going to let me go? I didn't do
nothing.'' Villalba, who said he heard such complaints from many
prisoners, humored Sanders, saying he would be released ``one of
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Rassin, another recreational therapist, would also
later acknowledge that Sanders possibly said to him as many as 75
times, ``I don't know why I'm here.'' Rassin told him to write to
the superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of 1995, Sanders' questioning became more frequent
as he grew more desperate. The psychiatric chart shows:
</P>
<P>
   January: Admits he hears voices. States he is depressed because
he is in prison and there is nothing he can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   March: Says we are holding him here because he committed no
crimes. Will be encouraged to come to the staff and talk when he
feels he has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chung said in a recent interview that he saw his job as limited
to treating the patient's psychotic symptoms, not exploring his
claims of wrongful imprisonment. ``Not my responsibility,'' he
said. Chung was the only employee at Green Haven who agreed to be
interviewed for this article. At 71, he is a veteran of the state
system, having spent 10 years at Green Haven before recently moving
to another prison. Born in North Korea, he escaped at the age of 15
to the South, where he went on to attend medical school. In 1977,
he moved to the United States and completed a residency in
psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   At Green Haven, he said he saw 50 to 75 patients a week and did
not remember the Sanders case specifically, but after reviewing a
copy of his handwritten notes in the chart, he confirmed his
participation. Chung said that many prisoners made claims of
innocence: ``Ninety-nine percent of people deny that they are
criminals.'' He said some of his patients ``claim they came from
heaven, and some of those, that they are Jesus Christ.'' By the
summer of 1995, the line between reality and delusion disappeared
for Sanders. Some members of the staff were calling him Kerry as
well as Robert. The chart continues:
</P>
<P>
   June: ``I hear these voices.'' Says he sees his mother in the
prison. august: Says people are coming out of the walls. Unable to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   September: Expressing thoughts about being held in prison by the
staff against his will.
</P>
<P>
   A man who was known on the streets as ``chicken'' was waiting
for the bus and 26 pounds of crack cocaine at the Greyhound
terminal in Cleveland on Oct. 7, 1995, when the federal agents
showed up. The Drug Enforcement Administration had been tipped off
about the drug deal, but its agents had no idea what else they were
about to discover when they made their arrest. The man they
apprehended had a muscular build and a long face. He had many
tattoos and scars. He showed them a license bearing the name
Laradney J. Dixon and an address in Cleveland. One agent suspected
that it was a fake, especially after noticing that one tattoo on
his arm read ``Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsure of the man's identity, the agents took fingerprints and
sent them to the FBI in Washington. Within hours, the DEA learned
that the prints matched those of a felon named Robert Sanders. But
he was supposedly sitting in a prison in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Capuano was working as a clerk in charge of inmate
records at Green Haven when the DEA's call came in. An agent told
her he had the fugitive Robert Sanders in custody. She said that
was impossible; he was already at Green Haven. The agent, to prove
his contention, asked her to send Robert Sanders' fingerprints to
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano, suspicious, noted in a memo that she called the bureau
to verify that the DEA's request was real. Reassured, she sent the
prints the prison system had on file for Robert Sanders, taken
during his initial imprisonment in 1990. They matched those of the
man arrested in Cleveland. Mystified, officials at Green Haven then
fingerprinted the inmate they had imprisoned for two years as
Robert Sanders. In all the time since Kerry's arrest on the bench
in Los Angeles, this was the first instance his prints had been
taken and examined. They matched none in the FBI's files. On Oct.
26, Capuano began to pore through prison records and discovered
that since the inmate was brought back to New York, he had been
``signing Kerry Sanders, not Robert Sanders.''
</P>
<P>
   ater that day, George W. Seyfert 3rd, a deputy inspector general
with the New York State Department of Correctional Services, was
called to Green Haven and began his own review of the files on
Robert Sanders. They showed that Robert Sanders had been arrested
several times before he shot a man over cocaine in Harlem in 1990.
He was sentenced to three to nine years in prison. He was
fingerprinted, photographed and assigned identification No. 90 A
8885. A clerk wrote that he was ``adjusting without incident'' and
that he had no medical or psychiatric problems. The files also
showed that after three years in the New York system, Robert
Sanders was moved to Fulton State Correctional Facility in the
Bronx. Under its work-release program, he was allowed to leave each
morning at 8 to work in a Harlem barbershop. He came back every day
at 3, except on Aug. 30, 1993, when he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 p.m. on Oct. 26, 1995, Seyfert, who had settled into a
conference room that is used for parole hearings, called for the
``inmate who claims to be Kerry Sanders.'' He looked at Kerry and
at the photograph of Robert Sanders. There was no resemblance. Over
the next hour, Seyfert questioned Kerry, who responded slowly,
mumbling and slurring his words at times. But the inspector heard
and wrote down what he needed to know: Kerry Sanders. Date of
birth: June 25, 1966. Born in Los Angeles in a hospital near the
Coliseum where the Rams played. His father was John Sanders; he
died in 1982. His mother was Mary. His sister was Roberta. He had a
brother who died. He named his other brothers: Don, Rickey,
Gilbert. He gave his Social Security number. ``I used to work as a
carpenter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry told Seyfert that he was arrested for ``sleeping on a park
bench'' in Los Angeles. He said he answered to the name Robert
after his arrest there but had never used the name before that.
Seyfert asked him if he ever did anything wrong. Kerry began to
ramble on about an incident in which he said he shot a wall while
baby-sitting in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Had he ever done anything else wrong? Seyfert asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Masturbate _that's it,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector had one more question. ``How are you doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm OK,'' Kerry replied. ``It's good here, but you wouldn't
like it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Robert Sanders now in federal custody in Cleveland in the
crack cocaine case, the authorities in New York were determined to
have him serve out the remaining time on his original state
sentence. So they reposted the warrant for his arrest in the
national database.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Seyfert began trying to reach Kerry's family. On the
afternoon of Oct. 27, he tracked down Mary Lee's phone number and
began dialing. She picked up the phone. Seyfert asked her to hold
for a minute, and then put Kerry on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello? Yes _ Momma?''
</P>
<P>
   Five hours after Seyfert's phone call, Sergeant Badstein, one of
the New York correctional officers who flew to Los Angeles two
years earlier, took Kerry back home. ``Here come Kerry with a red
sweater on and some blue jeans, and he's so glad to see his Momma,
he didn't know what to do,'' Lee remembered. ``I said: 'Where your
coat at? You been in New York? You mean to tell me that you didn't
have no coat on up in New York? You get devil cold.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lee hugged her son and hugged the two Los Angeles police
officers who escorted him from the airport. She invited them in for
coffee as she and her family celebrated Kerry's return, but the
officers declined. Badstein, in a memo to his supervisor, seemed
pleased with Lee's reaction and that New York's role had remained
largely invisible. ``She was only interested in his safe return,''
Badstein wrote, adding that Kerry's mother ``thanked us
profusely.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there were ``no press or media cameras or the
like'' and that Lee ``did not ask my name, nor did anyone else in
her apartment. No identification was requested and none was
offered. All parties seemed satisfied to see only the uniforms of
the LAPD escorts.'' Badstein said he left Kerry with nothing that
``bore the name'' of Green Haven or the New York corrections
department. Kerry was sent home with $48.13, a plastic bag with
some medicine, a soda and a pack of cigarettes _ but with no
explanation for his imprisonment or recommendations on following up
his psychiatric care. It was Kerry who told his family about his
time in prison. ``They took me to New York,'' he said to his sister
Roberta. ``It was so cold there. They put me in this little room.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his family tried to find out more. His mother ultimately
contacted Green Haven's superintendent, Christopher P. Artuz. ``My
son is mentally challenged,'' she wrote on Dec. 6, 1995. ``He does
not remember everything, and I need this information.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony J. Annucci, deputy commissioner and the top lawyer for
the corrections department, responded two months later. He
suggested that Kerry was mostly to blame for his imprisonment,
noting that he had answered to ``Robert'' at the time of his arrest
and in Green Haven. ``The diminished mental faculties of Kerry
Sanders apparently were a significant reason why this error went
undetected for as long as it had,'' Annucci wrote. ``I deeply
regret any hardship to Kerry Sanders and his family occasioned by
this case of mistaken identity.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years after Kerry's release, his family said they saw
a disturbed man deteriorate further. ``He wasn't the same,''
Roberta said. He had flashbacks and shortness of breath. He told
his sister and her daughter that he had been sexually assaulted in
prison. When he slept at Roberta's house, he kept the lights on.
When they watched television, she said he would suddenly shout as
if he were back in his cell, ``Man, leave my stuff alone!'' or
``Don't get on my bunk.'' His moods grew more erratic, his behavior
more volatile. He went on and off his medication and often went
back to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of Jan. 10, 1997, two officers spotted Kerry
crossing against a ``Don't Walk'' sign on Florence Avenue, forcing
cars to brake suddenly as they exited the freeway. They stopped him
and asked him for his name and birth date. They radioed the
information to the dispatcher and heard back about the felony
warrant for Robert Sanders from New York. The police in Los Angeles
apparently did not notice that Robert Sanders was in prison in the
federal cocaine case. The officers pressed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   According to their report, they asked Kerry whether he knew
there was a warrant for him in New York and he responded: ``Yes, I
was there 10 months ago, and I used the name Robert Sanders. Here,
in California, I use the name Kerry Sanders so no one will know I'm
Robert Sanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sanders was booked and jailed as Robert Sanders, with
``Kerry'' listed as an alias. Again, the police did not check
fingerprints. They notified prison authorities in New York that
they had Robert Sanders in custody. Three days later, New York said
to let him go, and the case was dismissed. ``Wrong suspect,
exonerated,'' the police report says. When he saw his mother, Kerry
told her what happened. ``I been in jail for Robert Sanders
again,'' he said. ``Momma, they cannot keep Robert Sanders in jail.
He got to do his own time by himself, Momma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to
get you.'' So read the sign hanging in the waiting room of the
psychiatric unit at Green Haven when Benjamin Schonbrun, a lawyer
in a small civil rights practice in Los Angeles, visited the prison
in May. Its sting was not lost on Schonbrun, who went there to talk
to staff members who treated Kerry during his time there.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her son's return, Mary Lee hired Schonbrun's firm
to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against the authorities in
New York and Los Angeles. Five years later, they are still trying
to sort out moral, legal and financial responsibility for what
happened. Lee hopes that any damages will enable her son to afford
better psychiatric care, a wish that has become a backdrop of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit argues that Kerry's imprisonment not only damaged
his already poor mental health but has also had residual effects in
the years since his return home. In the spring of 1998, he was
arrested three times. The police said he defaced a window at a Jack
in the Box, destroyed a beauty shop door and was found one day with
a semiautomatic rifle he had picked out of a garbage bin.
</P>
<P>
   This January, the law firm negotiated a $290,000 settlement with
Los Angeles County for its role in the case. In a letter to the
county board of supervisors, the county's own lawyers sharply
criticized the police, the public defender and jail officials,
noting that the most basic screening tools of law enforcement,
fingerprints and photographs, were abandoned. ``Further,'' the
county's lawyers wrote, ``there was no suspicion that Kerry Lee
Sanders suffered from mental illness that would have alerted
individuals to the fact that they might have the wrong person in
custody.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the attorney general's office has chosen to fight
the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, not disputing that
Kerry was wrongly imprisoned but denying any liability. It first
claimed that the suit should be dismissed because the statute of
limitations had run out; it soon withdrew that argument. It also
contended that to bring the suit, Kerry had to meet strict legal
requirements that apply to prisoners. Judge Deborah A. Batts, who
has not hid her disdain for some of the state's arguments, found
this one to be ``without merit.'' The requirements didn't apply,
she ruled, because Kerry shouldn't have been a prisoner in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, including spokesmen for the Department of
Correctional Services, the Office of Mental Health _ which runs the
psychiatric unit at Green Haven _ and the attorney general's office
have refused to comment because of the pending lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shechtman, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the
correctional system from 1995 to 1996 as the criminal justice
adviser to Pataki, called the case remarkable. ``Whatever else,''
Shechtman said, ``it does seem that it's appropriate for the state
to say mea culpa.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as this spring, the state attorney general's office
informed Kerry's lawyers that except for the psychiatric records,
all other files pertaining to his two years in the prison had been
lost. A trial date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Since last October, Schonbrun and two of his partners, Wilmer J.
Harris and Michael D. Seplow, have been taking depositions from
prison and mental health employees involved in the case. Almost all
those involved see themselves as blameless, saying they were not
responsible for checking into Sanders' claims of innocence. ``I let
him know there was nothing I could do,'' said Michael Rassin, the
recreational therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a legal aid society,'' Harold Roberson, the other
recreational therapist, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job _ I don't do that,'' said Silvia Koola, the
nurse. Questioned about Kerry's release from Green Haven, Sergeant
Badstein, the correctional officer who wrote to his boss that he
did not show ID when he accompanied Kerry home, said, ``All of our
transports are low profile.'' Badstein also now maintains that he
told Mary Lee who he was.
</P>
<P>
   Seyfert, the deputy inspector general, asked whether he arranged
any follow-up care for Kerry, said it was not the state's
responsibility. ``My jurisdiction ended at the door of the Green
Haven Correctional Facility.'' Seyfert, who has worked for the
corrections department for 25 years, said the Sanders case was the
only one he was aware of in the state system in which an innocent
man, unable to speak for himself, was picked up and put in jail in
place of an escaped convict. He acknowledged, however, that he had
not investigated whether there were any other such cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, the lawyers also contend that Kerry was sexually
assaulted in prison and that his comments to the staff that he was
pregnant should have been seen as a sign from a mentally ill man
that he was raped. Chung, asked in his interview about Kerry's
pregnancy comment, said it can be viewed only one way: ``Just
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think it makes any sense that a male is pregnant?''
Chung asked. ``If the patient is female, then it can make sense.
Maybe rape or some relationship. Even if he had a relationship with
others, a male can't be pregnant.'' Asked whether Kerry might have
been signaling that he had been raped, Chung said, ``We say, G-O-K
_ God only knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the more than 20 people who have testified in depositions or
been interviewed for this article, only one official expressed
shock at Kerry's imprisonment. Wayne L. Strack, a deputy
commissioner for corrections at the time, said he was
``flabbergasted'' when he learned about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the checks and balances that we've got, I can't
understand how it happened,'' Strack said in a deposition. ``I
mean, it's drilled in you from Day 1 of the job: You take an
inmate, you're responsible, you identify him. I mean _ my mind goes
boggled.'' He said the responsibility was broad because ``too many
things happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues of responsibility and culpability, of quality of care
and of monumental and systematic failings continue to surround the
lawsuit. Yet in 2,000 pages of depositions, there have been few
displays of compassion and fewer of outrage. At Green Haven, no one
on the staff was even told what happened, and no one asked. One
day, Kerry Sanders just disappeared. Chung, only recently learning
the details, said it was better for Kerry to be in prison than
wandering the streets. ``He got medication, free meal, food,
everything,'' the doctor said in his deposition. ``He should say,
'Thank you, for two years you guys treated me very nicely.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Sanders turned 34 on June 25 and he says he is ``ready for
the future.'' Since March, he has been staying at a supervised
board-and-care residence in Los Angeles, where he has his own room
and a structured schedule. A psychiatrist visits him once a month,
and a nurse dispenses his medication, cooks his meals, organizes
his activities and makes sure he rises each day at 6 so he will be
ready for a van that takes him to a therapy center for counseling
and classes.
</P>
<P>
   His room at the residence is spare but neat, and he has his own
stereo. He spends his time playing cassettes _ the Temptations and
Tyrone Davis are among his favorites _ watching Superman cartoons
and talking with his housemates. ``Two girls and six guys _ and
me,'' Kerry said in one of several recent interviews. He can sign
out to walk to a nearby park or to a grocery store, where he buys
cigarettes and chips. His mother, now 67, visits him regularly, and
she can take him home on weekends to her apartment in Inglewood,
where he can see his sisters and their children.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry remains stocky, his movement slowed by medication, his
speech tentative, his memory clouded. But he can recall some of his
two years at the prison. ``When I got invited to go to New York, I
don't know what happened,'' he said. ``They picked me up, and they
asked me if I was Kerry Sanders or Robert Sanders. I told them my
name was Kerry Sanders.'' ``It was just horrible,'' he added.
``Going in and out of cells every day. Going to dinner. Standing at
attention.'' He cried and prayed a lot. ``I wanted to get out, and
I wanted to come home,'' Kerry said. ``It was like losing oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   After so many chaotic years, Kerry's life is more stable now,
and he seems unencumbered by bitterness or anger over what happened
to him. Yet he has a sad resignation about what he knows his future
will mean. ``It will be the same as it is today,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sanders remains in federal prison in the Cleveland drug
case, serving a 15-year sentence. New York still has the warrant
out for his arrest.

 c.2000 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner is smaller than expected, tanned like a '60s
rock star settling into lithe middle age. He's walking along a
dusty road between wheat fields in Kosovo with Lt. Gen. Juan
Ortuno, the Spanish commander of the NATO troops, and two Kosovar
politicians beside him, while a TV crew retreats slowly backward,
recording their advance. Although it has been about a year since
NATO called off its bombing campaign and the Serbian Army trooped
out of Kosovo, Finnish soldiers keep telling the camera crew to
stick to the path: the benign-looking fields may be mined.
</P>
<P>
   At the place where the dirt road crosses a railway track are the
fire-scorched remains of a rusty red van. Where the engine used to
be, there is a hole; where the driver's seat used to be is another
hole; and where the driver's door used to be is a twisted flange of
metal. Bernard Kouchner, special representative of the U.N.
secretary-general in Kosovo, runs the U.N. mission in Kosovo. His
job is to rebuild a land seared by war and hatred and to get
Kosovo's Albanian majority to live side by side with the remaining
Serb minority. The charred and twisted van is yet another proof
that this objective remains out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Who was responsible? Brig. Richard Shirreff, a British commander
of multinational troops in central Kosovo, couldn't possibly
speculate. Kosovo is crawling with undercover intelligence agents
from a dozen countries, but they report to their agencies, not to
the local NATO commanders. The one certainty is that the dirt track
linked two Serb villages, and the only people using it were Serbs
and NATO patrols.
</P>
<P>
   The still photographers are now in position. The TV cameras are
rolling. Kouchner puts his arms firmly behind the backs of Ibrahim
Rugova and Hashim Thaci, two Kosovar Albanian politicians, and
nudges them forward so that they can all be photographed looking at
what is presented _ without a word being said _ as another Kosovar
Albanian attack on Serbs. This is the first time Thaci and Rugova,
inveterate enemies and rivals for power, have appeared together to
denounce what Kouchner calls ``a terrorist attack upon the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   It is widely believed that Thaci, also known as ``the snake''
when he was a guerrilla commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
may know more about who is behind this and other similar attacks
than he lets on. Most Serbs believe his ex-KLA men are in fact
responsible. Thaci knows what Kouchner expects of him, so he runs
through his lines with a solemn face, condemning, regretting,
affirming and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, looking ill and shrunken, stares glumly down at the
dirt, and when it is his turn, only mumbles: ``We need to work in
order not to have another tragic occasion. We need to change
opinions in Kosovo.'' The speeches are meager and perfunctory, but
Kouchner pronounces himself satisfied. ``The fascists must not
prevail,'' he says, in his Maurice Chevalier English.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the show is over, Kouchner works his way through the
small group of journalists, with an arm around the shoulder for
one, a quiet word for another. Thaci, too, briefly strokes the
local press before jumping into his car and racing off through the
howls of furious men lining the roads of the nearby Serbian
village. As Kouchner passes these crowds, behind the tinted windows
of his armored jeep, the Serb men look at him in angry silence.
``You've heard of virtual war,'' one member of his staff whispers,
wearily. ``Well, that was virtual peacemaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Thaci and Rugova to the scene of the crime is supposed
to ``isolate'' the terrorists, to demonstrate that violence does
not represent the will of the Kosovar people. Yet there is a
willing or unwilling conspiracy of silence in support of these acts
among ordinary Kosovars, and the politicians' condemnations in
front of the cameras seem less convincing as a political message
than the dirty red van with its guts ripped apart.
</P>
<P>
   In the walled precinct of the Serb monastery at Gracanica, where
Kouchner's convoy appears next, he and Ortuno are not expected. The
only person there to greet them is the bishop's ``chief of
protocol,'' an apologetic Serbian woman in her 20s, who says that
the bishop is away but that his deputy, the Rev. Sava Janjic, is on
his way.
</P>
<P>
   Father Sava, as he is always called, a bespectacled monk with
the distracted air of a bright but harried graduate student, rushes
in, sweating from climbing the flight of stairs. He beckons
Kouchner and Ortuno to be seated. A spare chair is kept empty
between the two of them for Bishop Artemije, Father Sava's
superior.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are the leaders of the ``monastery moderates,'' the
U.N.'s wishful phrase for the Gracanica Serbs. Moderation in Kosovo
is a complicated thing. In the case of Father Sava, it simply means
that he has been willing to talk to Kouchner and even take part in
meetings with the Kosovar Albanian majority. But Father Sava
represents only a minority of Serbs. The majority live in the
enclave of Mitrovica, and their leadership won't have any part of
Kouchner's attempts to create dialogue between the two sides.
Kouchner tells the monk that he has come to express his condolences
at the latest attack. The Spanish general chimes in with a promise
in his broken English ``to increase the tempo of our operations.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means much to Father Sava. Only a week before, NATO
patrols had failed to stop a grenade attack in a Gracanica market.
And the attacks on Serb churches continue despite NATO's efforts.
Kouchner tries to soothe the monk's nerves with promises of
continuing political support. ``We are trying to endure the
pressures,'' Father Sava replies, looking bleak and uneasy. The
pressures are not just from Kosovar hit squads with grenades; they
also come from Serbian hotheads outside the monastery walls who
don't think the father should be talking to Kouchner at all. ``I
can only say where it hurts,'' Father Sava says plaintively to
Kouchner. ``You will have to find the cure. You're the doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a doctor, an M.D., and in this case, his patient is a
rugged, south-Balkan province the size of Connecticut that remains
on life support a year after the NATO intervention. Getting Kosovo
to stand on its own feet again _ in truth, building its entire
political and economic infrastructure from nothing _ is the most
ambitious project the United Nations has ever undertaken. Kouchner
and a staff of several thousand have restarted the schools, found
shelter for hundreds of thousands of returning refugees and
established an official currency _ the German mark. Their signal
failure, so far, has been to get Kosovars to live with the
remaining Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner is not just another international politician making a
second career in the Balkans. He sees Kosovo as the culmination of
everything he has ever worked for. Thirty years ago, as a young
doctor working for the International Red Cross in Biafra, he
rebelled against the doctrine of silent neutrality. He ripped off
his Red Cross armband and helped found Doctors Without Borders, the
organization whose noisy denunciation of rights-violating regimes
marked a revolutionary departure from the silent discretion of the
Red Cross. Though he separated angrily from Doctors more than 20
years ago, when the group won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, his
French critics _ and they are legion _ observed sardonically that
he behaved as if he had won the prize himself.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three decades, as a militant doctor, Kouchner has
been campaigning for le droit d'intervention humanitaire, the right
to intervene when states oppress their own citizens. He is
criticized for talking as if he invented the doctrine of
humanitarian intervention all on his own. But certainly as
Mitterrand's minister for humanitarian action in the 1980s, he did
a spectacular job of publicizing the idea with dramatically staged
media operations.
</P>
<P>
   He claims with a certain disingenuousness that he seeks
publicity not for himself but for victims: ``Without photography,
massacres would not exist. Nothing can be done without pressure on
politicians.'' It is Kouchner, more than anyone else, who taught
nongovernmental aid agencies to use the political and fund-raising
power of the media. Where Kouchner led with Doctors Without
Borders, all modern humanitarian agencies now follow. When the
French insisted on his candidacy for the Kosovo job last year, many
veterans of the Balkans rolled their eyes in disbelief. But even
his harshest critics in Kosovo concede that he has stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Those in Pristina who predicted he would be on the plane home to
Paris every weekend have been proved wrong. ``He lives the job 24
hours a day,'' says Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the German who until
recently served as the commander of the NATO-led Kosovo force,
known as KFOR. ``That's his strength, and also his weakness.'' Why
weakness? Because he takes everything personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I do,'' Kouchner retorts. ``I've been a human rights
activist for 30 years, and here I am unable to stop people being
massacred.'' Which is why when U.N. headquarters in New York is
calling Kosovo a success _ compared with the U.N. mission in Sierra
Leone, Kosovo is bound to look like a success _ Kouchner refuses to
use the word. ``Politically maybe, we are a success, but in human
rights terms, no.''
</P>
<P>
   In his office in Pristina, he shows reporters a graph of
inter-ethnic killings: from a high of about 50 a week last year,
they have declined to one or two a week. There are more murders in
Washington than in Kosovo, Kouchner insists, but he must know that
this is beside the point. The Kosovo killings are political, and
they are a direct challenge to the 19-nation coalition that
intervened in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing and finds itself
unable to prevent cleansing in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, Kouchner says. The systematic use of Serbian
state terror to kill thousands of people and expel nearly a million
others from their homes cannot be compared to individual acts of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the ferocity of the hatred in Kosovo took Kouchner by
surprise. He arrived in July 1999 talking about European values,
tolerance and multiculturalism. By Christmas, though, as the tide
of killings kept rising, he had scaled back his rhetoric of
reconciliation. The word he uses now is coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   Coexistence has nothing to do with any Western ideal of
multicultural tolerance. Coexistence means going back to the way
Kosovo was between 1974, when Tito gave the Kosovars autonomy, and
1989, when Serbia's Milosevic abolished it. In those relatively
good old days, at least if memory is not lying, there were Serbs on
one side of the main street in Pristina and Kosovar Albanians on
the other. One street, two languages, two ways of life. Now there
is just one language and one way of life in the cafes, and ordering
a beer in Serbian is a distinctly bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of hatred gives Kouchner a huge political problem:
donors won't pony up the money for rebuilding and countries won't
send contingents of soldiers and police because they don't want to
be seen aiding and abetting a nasty new ethnic majority tyranny in
Kosovo. But children's graves in places like Celine explain why
Western sermons about tolerance are met with stony silence among
the Kosovar population. There may be as many as 500 other Celines,
mass grave sites where forensic teams from the International
Criminal Tribunal at The Hague are still pulling bodies from the
ground. Despite revisionist claims to the contrary, original NATO
estimates that more than 10,000 Kosovar Albanians were killed in
Kosovo by Serb police and paramilitaries between March and May 1999
will be proved right. In addition, there are more than 1,500
detainees in Serb prisons, as well as thousands still missing. This
ensures that the past in Kosovo remains a wound that will not heal.
</P>
<P>
   In the courts that Kouchner has managed to set up, mixed panels
of Kosovars, international judges and Serbs are trying the few
perpetrators who did not flee to Serbia. The defendants are charged
not with murder but with genocide. And while foreign observers,
notably Israeli reporters, have been incredulous that there can be
a genocide trial with only one named victim and one perpetrator,
Kosovars remain convinced that they were all potential victims of a
crime against humanity that failed only because both NATO and the
KLA came to their defense.
</P>
<P>
   This new identity as intended victims of genocide helps to
explain, if it does not justify, the lack of affect with which
people tell you, for example, that there had been Serbs in their
apartment blocks in Pristina but they were all in Serbia now _
except, of course, the old lady who had been thrown into her
bathtub in her clothes and drowned by a young Albanian couple
looking to take over her two rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But Kouchner's problem is not just overcoming the cold fury of
the Kosovars. There is also the huge obstacle of Serb denial, the
refusal to admit either the crimes done in their name or their
historical defeat. In Mitrovica, a Kosovo city divided by the Ibar
River, the Kosovar Albanians live in the south while the Serbs live
in the north. These Mitrovica Serbs along with those living in
other towns north of the river total 55,000. They are effectively
living in Serbia, drawing pensions and salaries from Belgrade,
using the dinar rather than the mark and effectively frustrating
any attempt by the United Nations to return Kosovars to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb leader there, Oliver Ivanovic, is an ingratiatingly
fluent English speaker, a former factory manager in his 50s who
taught karate on the side. When NATO rolled into Mitrovica last
summer, Ivanovic organized his karate class into the ``bridge
watchers,'' the men in dark glasses with walkie-talkies and
concealed weapons who guarded the north side of the river and made
it impossible for the small number of Kosovar Albanians to return
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic denies that he is Milosevic's man in Mitrovica. Indeed,
he claims to be his own man and insists that Milosevic made a
mistake in taking on ``the international community'' over Kosovo.
His job, Ivanovic says, is to get the Serbs to cooperate with the
internationals. So he will tell you that he can do business with
the American general who runs the U.N. operation in Mitrovica and
how he is willing to work with the Kosovar Albanian mayor on the
south side of the river. But when he strays from his script and
talks about the local zinc and tin mines, the cooperative language
fades.
</P>
<P>
   Look what has happened to the mines since we retreated in 1999,
he says, waving his arms. The Albanians have ruined them. They're
all flooded. And look at the electricity generators. Now that the
Serb managers have left, the power keeps shutting down. Two decades
of Serb underinvestment and neglect are bypassed in an argument
that ends, inevitably, with the suggestion that everything would be
fine if the old Serb managers were put back in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Ivanovic says, Kouchner is really here to prepare
Kosovo for independence. He's not here to protect us. He's here to
give the Albanians what they want. When this is reported to
Kouchner, he shrugs again with fatalistic patience and fingers his
worry beads. ``I never talk about independence,'' he says. ``It has
nothing to do with me. My mandate is purely and simply to prepare
Kosovo for substantial autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that 1244, the U.N. resolution he has been sent
here to enforce, is political science fiction. It reaffirms the
sovereignty of Yugoslavia over Kosovo, and it also calls for the
Kosovars to enjoy ``substantial autonomy and self-government.''
Which sounds fine, except that no Kosovar will ever accept
Belgrade's sovereignty in Kosovo and no Serb in Kosovo wants to
accept Kosovar majority rule.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a minority that still believes it is in Serbia and a
majority that wants a state, Kouchner and his team have gradually
given up talk of tolerance. They have focused instead on hard
politics _ assembling a Kosovo Transitional Council to force the
local leaders to sit down together, enrolling voters for municipal
elections in the autumn and helping to draft a blueprint for
self-governance. Changing hearts and minds will come later.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Kouchner's job is to force Serbs and Kosovars to
cooperate, to make them practice Western values, if not at
gunpoint, then under the implicit threat that if they don't, the
internationals will go and leave them to their Balkan hatreds. But
the threat is a weak one, because most Kosovars understand that the
Western troops cannot withdraw as long as Milosevic is in power in
Belgrade. So the locals have the internationals over a barrel. As a
result, the progress of coexistence is agonizingly slow. Kosovars
and Serbs sit in Kouchner's large office, a former government
headquarters, and they fight over every comma and semicolon. At the
end of the meetings, Kouchner's shoulders hurt from the strain of
simply keeping victim and victimizer from stalking out. But this is
the core of his job: to create political trust where none exists,
to create democracy where none has ever taken root before.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Kouchner what he has learned from Kosovo, he says it
is something he knew all along: that humanitarianism is political.
It means abandoning specious kinds of neutrality, taking the side
of the victim and making enough noise to rouse the powerful and
indifferent from their slumbers. But as practiced by Bernard
Kouchner, humanitarianism owes more to Machiavelli than to Mother
Teresa. Not that he would want it any other way. Having called for
intervention all his life, suddenly at 60 years of age he's staking
his reputation on the proposition that he can actually make one
work.

   PHILADELPHIA _ The small, distinctive building in a historic
section of this historic city began its life 250-plus years ago as
the colonial capitol, or state house, of Pennsylvania. Most of us
now recognize it as Independence Hall, the place where the United
States was born.
</P>
<P>
   The act of giving birth still ranks as the most difficult
political decision ever made in this country. Benjamin Franklin's
warning to his fellow Declaration of Independence signers was,
after all, quite literal:
</P>
<P>
   ``We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang
separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in this city, in a sports arena _ a place far less
dignified _ other political decisions were made and/or carried out
last week during the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest immediate stakeholder in how those decisions and the
overall convention message were received by the American public was
George W. Bush, the GOP's presidential nominee. But the Republican
Party itself also was on trial.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions were far too numerous to list here. They ranged
from the inconsequential _ such as the choice of tie for Bush to
wear during his acceptance speech _ to the delicately balanced
selection of other convention speakers and the oh-so-delicately
balanced selection of topics to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Should Colin Powell be allowed to make a pitch for affirmative
action? He did. Should an openly homosexual man be invited to
address a Republican National Convention for the first time ever?
He was, but he was allowed to discuss only trade, not gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   And on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The convention was well-scripted and under the airtight control
of the Bush campaign. It presented televised podium images of a
demographic mix designed to further Bush's message of inclusion and
tolerance, his professed goal of expanding the GOP's tent to all
Americans without breaking down into a ``quota'' system that,
Republicans contend, has cost the Democratic Party a sense of
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It is a theme that Bush will continue to try to hammer home
during the fall campaign, balancing a message that he hopes is
conservative enough to keep his party's right wing solidly behind
him and compassionate enough to attract the independent and
moderate Democratic voters he also will need to capture the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party has been on a roll in Texas in recent
years, and it controls both houses of the U.S. Congress and most
governorships. But the party's efforts to put its best face forward
at its convention also displayed its biggest weakness for the
not-too-distant future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the abundance of black and Hispanic speakers, the
convention audience was overwhelmingly Anglo, a characteristic
rapidly becoming out-of-step with America's changing population
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how Bush fares in this election, his party may be
turning out its lights _ for good _ within the next generation or
two if it does not become more aggressive _ and more successful _
in recruiting blacks and Hispanics. The reason is simple
arithmetic. Those two groups, combined, will make up a majority of
the country's population before too many more presidential
campaigns have run their course, and they remain overwhelmingly
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been wooing minorities with some success, both as
governor of Texas and in his national campaign. He backs up his
calls for inclusion and his claim to be a ``different kind of
Republican'' with calls for such critical advances as improved
health care and improved educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems sincere, and his presidential race, if successful,
could pump new life into the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   But, Democrats argue that Bush hasn't done nearly enough to
advance educational and social issues. And, they contend, the
governor's ``compassionate'' side is still overshadowed by his
conservatism _ a desire to cut taxes for corporate America and
avoid confrontations over social issues with his party's right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is valid, and how it plays out will affect Bush's
future after November.
</P>
<P>
   It also will help determine how much longer his party remains on
the active political landscape.

   NY-SINATRA-STATUE (New York) _ The Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy
got a spot on Times Square in 1936 for his heroics on the
battlefield and the streets of Hell's Kitchen. George M. Cohan
followed in 1959 as a tribute to one of show business's greatest
song and dance men. Mayor Rudy Giuliani says there is room for one
more, Frank Sinatra, whose last big hit, in 1980, was ``New York,
New York.'' But the hushed refrain playing around Times Square is
not so gushing or welcoming. No one really wants to say so, at
least not loudly enough to irk Giuliani or offend the Sinatra
family, but the plan to erect a statue of Ol' Blue Eyes on a
traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway has acquired some
powerful enemies. The local community board, along with some Times
Square developers, isn't crazy about the idea. And theater moguls
say the square's theatrical tradition would be shortchanged by
showcasing a singer and film actor who started in Hoboken, made a
quick splash at the Paramount Theater and then followed fame and
fortune west of the Hudson.

   ANARCHY-REVIVED (Undated) _ Since Karl Marx bested the anarchist

Paris Commune in 1871, suppressed in the United States after an
anarchist shot President McKinley in 1901, destroyed by Franco in
the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s and it withered away with
1960s student radicalism. Ideologically opposed to power and
ambivalent about organization, anarchists perpetually live on the
fringe of great movements _ and on the verge of defeat. Yet the
very qualities that consign anarchism to obscurity also endow it
with many lives, if only as a prefix: anarcho-collectivism,
anarcho-syndicalism, anarcho-mutualism, anarcho-individualism,
anarcho-ecologism. And at the turn of this century, it is

&HT;     BUSH'S SPEECH: PROMISES, PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HELEN THOMAS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers +
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The speech by Texas Gov. George W. Bush accepting
the Republican presidential nomination can be summed up as
``promises, promises.''
</P>
<P>
   It was long on general themes but short on specifics. We await
with great interest the details. He is going to have to do some
explaining to translate his high flown rhetoric into actual deeds.
His words evoke memories of the famous dare by former Attorney
General John Mitchell: ``Watch what we do, not what we say,''
referring to his days in the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the worshipful assemblage that the nation should seize
this time of peace and prosperity to confront threats to our
national security and threats to our health and retirement
security. ``And we will extend the promise of prosperity to every
forgotten corner of this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will have his work cut out for him when he tries to make
good on those pledges, especially when he says ``big government is
not the answer,'' a line stolen from both Presidents Ronald Reagan
and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also swiped the slogan that ``no child will be left behind,''
an adage originated by the Children's Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may find that people do not hate the government as much as
his ``compassionate conservatives'' do because they are taught that
the government is ``we the people.'' And much as they try,
religious charities cannot possibly take care of the millions of
the poor, the sick and the maimed.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bush's well-rehearsed address to the foot-stomping
delegates made him sound like a Democrat _ and in fact he
confiscated a few pages out of President Clinton's book.
</P>
<P>
   But all's fair in love and war. After all, Clinton hijacked the
GOP agenda's calling for a balanced budget, welfare reform and
reducing the national debt. But Clinton amazed his critics by
accomplishing those goals, with the help of the Republican-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There's irony in the fact that Bush hopes to ride the crest of
the Clinton-Gore prosperity but, at the same time, he's being very
careful to avoid giving them credit for the good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosperity can be a tool in our hands,'' Bush said and recited
his goals to use the government surpluses. But he seems to have
conveniently forgotten that his father lost his reelection bid in
1992 because the economy back then was in a slump. Clinton's
in-house campaign slogan that year was a reminder to the candidate
and his staff: `It's the economy, stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the disconnects between Bush and reality.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it was almost embarrassing when Bush praised the
heroes of World War II, considering the fact that he and his
running mate Richard Cheney resorted to loopholes to dodge the
draft in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and let's not forget the video picturing John F. Kennedy,
the Democratic icon, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
That snippet overlooked the fact that Cheney voted against making
King's birthday a national holiday when he was a House member.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the spectacle of Bush promising to expand the
goals of Head Start, a highly successful government-funded
education program, which Cheney also voted against when he was a
six-term congressman from Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure many in the audience grinned as I did when Bush, who
attended Andover, Yale and Harvard, spoke of his ``lack of polish
of Washington''in seeking to depict himself as an outsider. Give me
a break.
</P>
<P>
   So Bush has a lot of blanks to fill in _ unless American voters
let him off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Westerners are known for calling a spade a spade. So why do
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, proud sons of Texas and Wyoming,
resort to code words when talking about their opponents?
</P>
<P>
   Their barbs against Clinton come wrapped in such gauzy veils as
the need to restore ``respect, dignity and honor'' to the West Wing
of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Potential first lady Laura Bush also slipped into code when she
said moms, dads and grandparents are telling her husband: ``I want
my son and daughter to respect the president of the United
States.'' She later denied she was attacking the president.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying such mysterious lingo is the fact that the
Republicans are afraid get too blunt when talking about Clinton's
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. They fear
voter backlash against any heavy-handed negative attacks. The last
such Republican effort ended in an embarrassing defeat for the GOP
when the Senate failed to convict Clinton of his impeachment
offenses _ and the voters removed some Republican House members in
the middle of the flap.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started the current round of code talk when he went to
Arkansas, Clinton's home state, and introduced Cheney as a man who
knows ``what the definition of `is,' is,'' an obvious reference to
Clinton's much lampooned hair-splitting answers to the Kenneth
Starr grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Arkansas rally understood the code and roared
appreciatively. It was more than Clinton could stand. He slammed
back at Bush, calling him in effect a ``Daddy's boy'' who was
riding his father's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush responded by threatening to tell the world what
he really thought of his successor ``as a human being and a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   In attacking Clinton, Bush had departed from the Republican
script, which called for him to avoid the ``politics of personal
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole exchange suggests that the younger Bush has been
harboring resentment against Clinton for defeating his father in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush says he takes after his mother Barbara Bush in
her feistiness, and therein lies the problem.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign strategists want only a ``positive reflection'' of
the candidate _ they want him to control his combative nature and
desire to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Like the party pros, former President Jerry Ford was
disapproving of the negative approach and called it
``counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Pollster John Zogby says Hillary Rodham Clinton is doing
``terrible'' in her bid for a Senate seat from New York. She's
eight points behind Rep. Rich Lazio a Republican from Long Island,
according to a recent Zogby poll. It's Zogby's contention that the
first lady ``should have waited'' until her husband was out of
office, and then perhaps run for Senate from her native Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The pollster said that Clinton ``is doing everything right'' but
she is ``not connecting'' with the women in New York. It seems that
New Yorkers are hung up on the fact that she was not born in New
York, a ``carpetbagger'' label she has been unable to shake off. It
is an angle that Lazio is playing up to the hilt. Not that the
first lady is totally bereft of political fodder. Lazio was close
to former Speaker Newt Gingrich and voted for the convervative
manifesto ``Contract for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some New York women are still mad at Hillary because she didn't
leave her husband in the aftermath of the Lewinsky affair. Their
chagrin is matched by Cheney's ultra conservative wife Lynne who
said the first lady was ``hypocritical'' for holding her husband's
hand in public.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the same Lynne Cheney who flaunts ``family values'' but
who seems incapable of understanding women who believe in
forgiveness? I guess not.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, President Clinton says he wishes he could help his
wife more and feels that her Republican opponents are using their
enduring antagonism against him to tar her with the same brush.
Zogby claims the late Robert Kennedy was victorious in his Senate
race in New York because of his brother's assassination, winning
him a sympathy factor. He also says that the ``worst thing to
happen'' to Mrs. Clinton was when the more vulnerable New York
Mayor Rudy Giuliani dropped out for health and marital reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Senate race is already the most interesting
election contest this year. Bush vs. Gore doesn't even come close.

 &HT;    Three little words for Mr. Sam's lake
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Legendary Texas politician Sam Rayburn said the
three most important words in the English language were: ``Wait a
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   In considering recent state action regarding water quality at
the important reservoir named for ``Mr. Sam,'' citizens might well
demand the thoughtful pause he advocated.
</P>
<P>
   The state's three environmental commissioners last week voted
unanimously to lower water-quality standards for the Sam Rayburn
Reservoir in the Piney Woods of East Texas. The vast impoundment is
a popular bass fishery and water sports site.
</P>
<P>
   Angler groups and environmentalists were abashed and said, in
effect, ``Wait a minute.'' They asked federal regulators to
overrule the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and set
a higher standard for the lake. They noted that the woodland
reservoir is a ``world class'' fishery that generates an estimated
$38 million in recreation revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments for the downgrade came mainly from owners of the
60-year-old Donohue Industries paper mill on the shore near Lufkin.
The mill empties industrial wastewater into a tributary of the
Angelina River, which feeds the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, Abitibi Consolidated Inc., of Montreal, contend that
tighter pollution standards could force them to close the paper
mill, a major East Texas employer.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental commissioners last week adopted new
water-quality standards for streams, lakes and bays as part of the
state's duties under the federal Clean Water Act. New protections
for aquatic habitat, coastal seagrasses and wetlands were hailed by
anglers and environmental groups as advancing protection of Texas
waters. Commissioners said the statewide plan would improve overall
water quality.
</P>
<P>
   But downgrades of standards for some waterways, in particular
Sam Rayburn Reservoir, were called a threat that federal regulators
should examine critically. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
opposed the change.
</P>
<P>
   Downgrades were also approved for part of the Nueces River near
Corpus Christi, the Pease River in West Texas and various East
Texas streams.
</P>
<P>
   The big reservoir was completed in the mid-1960s and named for
Rayburn shortly after his death. It honors a plainspoken East Texan
who served as speaker of the Texas House and the U.S. House,
serving almost five decades in Congress. He is recalled for his
political skills, simple tastes, fierce rectitude and refusal to
use positions of public trust to amass wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Rayburn would understand the political realities that bear on
many modern environmental decisions. He might less readily
recognize his home state's rapidly growing population, flourishing
industries and daunting challenges for cleaning up air and water.
</P>
<P>
   The water supply grows increasingly precious each year, and a
scarcity of clean water for drinking and recreation threatens many
communities. The environmental commission's decision to downgrade
water quality standards for this important reservoir in the heart
of the Angelina National Forest deserves, at the very least, closer
public scrutiny. Practical compromises between needs of industry
and public need may be possible. Federal regulators should not
accept the state decision without saying, as Mr. Sam might have
said, ``Wait a minute.''

 &HT;    A view from inside death row
 &HT;    By Prat Thakkar
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Texas _ The East Texas heat is so intense that time
itself seems to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   The winding, two-lane road to death row curves past farms ringed
by low wooden fences. In the pastures, cows compete for shade and
graze on parched grass. Those pastoral scenes soon surrender to
high steel fences topped by coils of razor wire, their jagged edges
glistening in the blazing sun. The steel guards the Terrell Unit,
home to Texas' death row.
</P>
<P>
   As in other states, death row here is part of an elaborate
machine created to extract the ultimate penalty. The theory is
biblical: An eye for an eye. But matters of human life and death _
even here _ are rarely that simple. As the country re-examines the
death penalty and Texas undergoes renewed scrutiny because its
governor would be president, questions about capital punishment
demand answers that are as elusive as they are difficult.COMMUNITY
LIFE
</P>
<P>
   The chain-link fences and boxy, nondescript buildings that make
up the Terrell Unit are like a Hollywood version of a prison.
Nothing on the outside calls attention to the prison's dubious
distinction of housing more than 450 men sentenced to die in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Not much on the inside does, either. The foyer gleams from the
constant attention given it by trusties whose job is to polish,
vacuum and buff. The benign facade crumbles as you approach death
row.
</P>
<P>
   On death row, innocuous tasks mark the slow passing of the hours
and days. It's a place where questions are plentiful and easy
answers are scarce. The questions echo off the constant chatter of
hundreds of men engaged in conversation around the clock each day.
</P>
<P>
   Several electronically controlled gates lead to death row. The
hallways inside lead to the six identical death row ``pods''
labeled from A to F. Each pod has 84 cells divided into six
sections, again labeled from A to F. Along the far wall are
two-tiered rows of cells with heavy white metal doors. Each door
has a rectangular slot for the food tray. The slot is opened by
officers at mealtimes _ breakfast begins at 3:30 a.m., lunch at 10
a.m., dinner at 3:30 p.m. So populated is death row that feeding
the inmates takes two to two and one-half hours for each meal.
</P>
<P>
   The doors also have two narrow rectangular panels, about 2.5
inches wide and 12 inches long, of thick black metal grill _ the
only view inmates have into the pod.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a cell that is about 6 feet by 9 feet is a steel bunk
against the back wall with a mattress and pillow. Two metal shelves
jut from the wall, used as a table or as supports. A metal toilet
with a small metal sink sits in one corner and above it, built into
the wall, is a tubelight and an electrical outlet. The only other
source of light is a thin strip of window above the bed.
</P>
<P>
   GOOD BEHAVIOR PAYS
</P>
<P>
   Inmates who have the money and behave themselves are allowed to
buy items such as hot plates, fans or radios from the prison
commissary.
</P>
<P>
   Each pod also has 12 showers, six indoor and four outdoor
recreation areas. The indoor rec areas are mostly rectangular
spaces encircled floor to ceiling by black steel bars. Inside are a
few metal stools and a chinning bar. The outside rec areas have a
basketball, a hoop and a chinning bar. Sunlight filters in through
the mesh ceiling. Recreation time _ like visiting time _ is a
privilege, varying according to prisoners' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Among the men receiving visitors that day is Danny Dean Thomas,
44, on death row since 1982. He was 27 when he became a dead man.
Thomas was convicted for shooting a woman named Sylvia Hamson in
July 1981. He and an accomplice killed Hamson, tied bricks to her
body and dumped her in the San Jacinto River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas, someone still comes to visit you?'' asks Larry
Fitzgerald, manager of public information for the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' shoulders droop over his lanky frame. A slow,
anticipatory smile breaks across his lined face as he looks at the
door that leads out of the building. ``Yeah, every week, Larry,''
he replies, eyes glistening.
</P>
<P>
   In the regimented world of prison, visits are prized, their
frequencies varied as a way of encouraging good behavior. Visits
mark one of the rare opportunities for death row inmates to leave
the death row building.
</P>
<P>
   A DEAD MAN'S REQUEST
</P>
<P>
   Back on death row, the catcalls from neighboring sections drown
out the voices of my guides.
</P>
<P>
   Once the novelty wears off, the screaming dies down and the
chatter picks up. But the seven men along the bottom tier of Pod A,
section F stare at me silently. The cells in the top tier are
empty. This section houses inmates whose appeals are exhausted and
who have scheduled execution dates.
</P>
<P>
   A short, sprightly man named Cruz calls out to Fitzgerald. Cruz
asks if he can shoot a video explaining how he ended up on death
row as a warning to young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll look into it and get back to you,'' Fitzgerald says.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz breaks into a broad, mischievous smile. ``I'll still be
here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz laughs, scampers back to his cot and sits down to write.
Bright photographs paper the wall by his cot. He looks no older
than 22. He's 33, and has been on death row since 1989. EXECUTIONS
SET
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, David Oliver Cruz is a ``model inmate.''
Personable, cheerful, well-behaved. He is also a rapist and a
murderer. His victim was 24-year-old Kelly Elizabeth Donovan. His
co-defendant got a 65-year sentence for murder in exchange for
testifying against Cruz. A few cells down is Brian Keith Roberson,
36, who has been on death row since 1987. He was convicted for the
stabbing death of his 79-year-old neighbor, Jamie Louis Boots. He
also killed Lillian Wallace Boots before burglarizing the home.
</P>
<P>
   Roberson and the men in neighboring cells spot me and walk up to
the cell doors, leaning their arms and faces against the black
grill panels. They all stare at me silently. Tiny beads of sweat
collect on Roberson's face. His neighbors move back to their cots.
Roberson continues staring, a curious mixture of hope and
desperation frozen in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cruz and Roberson are scheduled to die Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stagnant hot air inside death row offers no answers to the
questions that lurk behind my inquiries about the routine of life
on death row _ how did men such as Cruz and Roberson go so wrong?
Was there a more fitting punishment for the lives they ruined so
carelessly? Death row offered no clear answers, no clear sense of
revenge or justice.

 ART ADVISORY: With 1933 photo of Indians contesting treaty
violations in court (NNS1) and a graphic available on the Newhouse
BBS showing decline in tribal lands from 1775-1992 
 By COURTENAY THOMPSON  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- In 1783, George Washington wrote that American
settlers moving west would uproot American Indians and ``certainly
cause the savage as the wolf to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he compared Indians to ``wild beasts of the forest,''
Washington and his new government dealt with tribes as independent
nations with recognized claims to the lands desired by American
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian affairs was the most important foreign affairs issue
facing the Colonies,'' says Robert J. Miller, assistant professor
at Northwestern School of Law of Lewis &AMP; Clark College and a member
of the Eastern Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma. ``The people who were on
their borders were Indian tribes. The biggest risk was that.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars say the nation's founders inherited the policies
of the British and French, who made treaties with tribes in the
18th century for peace, land and later as allies in the
Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   And these policies, they say, became enshrined in the U.S.
Constitution, as well as in two centuries of Supreme Court
decisions upholding the sovereignty and treaties of tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for many Americans today, the concept of tribal sovereignty
remains elusive and ill-understood, tribal leaders and scholars
say. And that ignorance, they say, leads to such proposals as the
recent Washington state Republican Party platform that included
language seeking ``to terminate all such non-republican forms of
government on Indian reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest tribes took that as a direct attack on their
sovereignty, and Republican leaders in Washington state and in
Congress have scrambled to distance themselves from the
controversial position.
</P>
<P>
   But tribal leaders and scholars say more needs to be done to
educate the public about the history of tribal sovereignty --
especially at a time when tribes, bolstered by gambling revenue and
favorable federal policies, are increasingly asserting their unique
rights to govern themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the greatest untold stories, and one of the most
disappointing deficiencies of our educational system,'' says W. Ron
Allen, chairman of the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe in Washington
state and vice president of the National Congress of American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said no other nation has such a relationship with its
aboriginal tribes, a relationship in which they are
semi-independent tribal nations, with their own laws, territory and
cultures. They exist within the United States with unique rights to
hunt, fish, even go whaling, rights that are not necessarily shared
by the rest of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always talk about a historical foundation that has to be
seen in the birth of this country,'' says Alan Parker, director of
the Northwest Indian Applied Research Institute at Evergreen State
College and a Chippewa Cree from Rocky Boy, Mont. ``The British
government, when it first sent settlers to this country,
established a precedent of negotiating treaties. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for those treaties was easy to understand. They
were suing for peaceful relations, and in some cases suing for an
exchange of land. They were dependent on having peaceful relations
or the little colonies wouldn't have survived.''
</P>
<P>
   That was particularly true as the new, weak federal government
struggled to control the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The states were entering their own treaties with tribes,
pushing tribes around, stealing land, starting wars,'' Miller says.
``I think everyone agreed the federal government had to be in
charge of Indian affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, he says, was included high in Article 1, Section 8,
of the U.S. Constitution: that Congress shall have the power to
``regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several
states, and with the Indian tribes.''
</P>
<P>
   As the federal government grew more powerful during the early
19th century, treaties became increasingly favorable to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830s, the federal government adopted a removal policy to
push Eastern tribes west of the Mississippi or force them to
assimilate. Tens of thousands of Indians died in forced
relocations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But tribes were already becoming more legally sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   The Cherokee Nation fought the state of Georgia, taking the case
to the U.S. Supreme Court, which for the first time defined tribes'
status as that of domestic, dependent nations.
</P>
<P>
   The court also described the federal government's trust
responsibility to tribes: the legal obligation to look out for
their interests.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1800s, as the discovery of gold in California and the
Homestead Act of 1850 sped white settlement westward, the federal
government hurried to reach treaties with tribes in the West.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of federal treating-making in the Northwest in 1855,
tribal leaders agreed to give up millions of acres of aboriginal
lands in exchange for reservations and specific rights, especially
to fish, hunt and gather the roots and berries on which they
depended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very intelligent, creative people with a high degree
of civilization, albeit different from European,'' Parker says of
the tribal negotiators. ``I believe they knew what was going on and
tried to protect themselves as best they could.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the 19th century waned, federal policy shifted toward
trying to assimilate Indians through a series of policies that
devastated tribal cultures: children were sent away to boarding
schools, traditional languages and religions were banned, and
reservations were whittled down through subsequent treaties and the
1887 Dawes Act, which broke up many reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, faced with evidence of appalling tribal
poverty, the federal policy pendulum swung back toward
strengthening tribes through the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War II, federal policy once again encouraged
assimilation. In the 1950s, Congress moved to terminate its
relationship with more than 100 tribes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, the Kennedy administration ended the termination
policy. Against the backdrop of civil rights, the federal
government, under the leadership of President Nixon, once again
moved to strengthen tribal governments.
</P>
<P>
   Parker said tribes were also tapping into the modern legal
system in the 1970s and 1980s, making great strides toward having
their rights recognized and respected.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In the Northwest, for example, tribes fought an emotional and
contentious battle for their treaty rights to fish on the Columbia
River, rights upheld in the 1970s by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians never assumed their treaties were affected by the
passage of time,'' Parker says.
</P>
<P>
   Tribes increasingly asserted their rights, following the lead of
visionary tribal leaders such as Joe DeLaCruz, the recently
deceased leader of the Quinault Indian Nation in Washington, Parker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His vision was we needed to assert those rights if we are
going to protect ourselves,'' he said. ``A lot of the conflicts
over zoning, over gaming, over fishing, they are conflicts because
tribes had these rights but they never attempted to assert or
exercise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a generation of leaders who saw this is what they
should do.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Terminated tribes sought, and won, re-recognition from Congress.
Tribes moved into gambling, sparking an economic and political
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Rapida, associate professor of public administration at
Portland State University in Oregon, said the concept of
sovereignty, outside its legal definitions, is difficult to explain
in part because it is so all-encompassing.
</P>
<P>
   Rapida, a member of the Shoalwater Bay Tribe in southwest
Washington, said that for Native American people, sovereignty is
the ``right to be who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   For many tribes, it is a sacred, spiritual concept, intimately
tied to the land -- it's their right to worship, to abide by their
own laws derived from their creator, to eat their traditional,
sacred foods such as salmon and berries.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to give up land in treaties, Rapida said, tribal
leaders made sure they kept the right to govern themselves, take
care of their land and decide as a community what is important.

<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush's ``iron fist'' management of the Republican
convention and its message robbed it of spontaneity and suspense
but probably boosted his bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That's the view of a cross-section of political scientists and
politicians, including some Democrats. Only an adverse public
reaction over the next few days to Bush's acceptance speech
Thursday night, they said, could dampen the post-convention lift
he's likely to get in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They accomplished everything they wanted -- a safe vice
presidential candidate, no problems with the far right, and they
stayed on Bush's message,'' said Harold Hodes, a Trenton, N.J.,
Democratic political consultant and adviser to Vice President Al
Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The message -- one that all week soft-pedaled partisanship,
promised Thursday night to spread prosperity and in general
preached a ``compassionate conservatism'' -- drew favorable comment
from those interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either through good intuition or focus groups, they've
properly judged the temper of the times,'' said Stephen Hess, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.
``It's a feel-good time. Civility, shaving down the sharp edges (of
politics) is probably what Main Street wants today.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Green, director of the Ray Bliss Institute of Applied
Politics at Akron University in Ohio, concurred. ``Overall, they've
probably helped themselves a good bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green cited as especially wise Bush's decision to avoid focusing
on the Clinton impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich and the impeachment managers are very
controversial. They've given the party a bad image and people are
offended by their strident tone,'' Green said. ``By staying away
from them, George Bush is saying, `I'm different from the
congressional wing of the party.'''
</P>
<P>
   Washington political consultant Lyn Nofziger, a staunch
conservative and former political operative in the Reagan White
House, is not sympathetic to Bush's ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   He found Colin Powell's defense of affirmative action ``a
discordant note,'' for example. And he would have liked at least
one plank in the Bush platform used to bash Bill Clinton over
impeachment and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that Bush's decision to side-step impeachment in
favor of an ``above the (Washington) battle'' stance may be smart.
``You journalists have made the public think they're tired of
impeachment,'' Nofziger cracked.
</P>
<P>
   And he had high praise for the Bush team's tight control over
the convention -- better even than the 1984 ``Morning in America''
convention that preceded Reagan's landslide re-election, Nofziger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even higher praise came from an unexpected quarter -- Russ
Hemenway, head of the National Committee for an Effective Congress,
which provides money and campaign help for liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Bush's surge in the polls in the weeks leading to the
convention and this week, Hemenway said, ``This is the most
brilliantly managed three weeks I've ever seen in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, he said, ``cut a deal with the Christian Coalition, told
them to shut up, and they did. It's extraordinary. Everyone's on
message. The convention speakers were good, especially Colin
Powell. Dick Cheney was the worst. He doesn't help, but he doesn't
hurt either. Vice presidents almost never do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemenway said he is particularly impressed with Bush's success
in ``defining himself as a moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's believable,'' he said, ''`and it resonates. It's
what people want. If they can keep this up for 90 more days,
they're probably in.''
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Cheney as Bush's running mate -- and his
acceptance speech -- drew mixed reviews. But several felt that
Cheney's solid record as a social conservative -- his appeal to the
party's right-wing base -- freed Bush Thursday night to appeal to a
wider audience, to moderates and even disgruntled or disappointed
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what Bush did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Cheney) let Bush go broader,'' said Merle Black, professor
of politics at Emory University in Atlanta. ``He let him say that
this is a different type of Republican Party, more diverse. He let
him really go after moderates.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if they get them, they'll win,'' Black added.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, most felt Cheney would not hurt Bush (``He's a
serious adult,'' Black said) but would not help much, either in the
Electoral College or as a party-rallying stump speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's no stem-winder,'' said Brookings' Hess, ``but I found a
certain charm in his acceptance speech -- until I fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   A problem for Bush -- ``a heck of a problem,'' Akron
University's Green called it -- is the robust economy of the
Clinton-Gore years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rightly or wrongly, Democrats get a lot of the credit,'' Green
said. Bush's strategy, evident in his acceptance speech, is ``to
change the subject to reform of the economy -- reform of education
and Social Security -- and to values,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   While most applauded Bush's promise of a more civil tone in
political debate, several questioned how long he can hold to that
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Nofziger, the GOP conservative, predicted flatly that it won't
last: ``He can't stay above the battle. He has to answer charges
and say why Gore should be defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Democrat Hemenway. But what worries Hemenway most is a
campaign in which Bush is seen as running a high-road campaign
while Gore hurls thunderbolts daily. It's Gore's stock-in-trade,
Hemenway said, what he does best, as he has demonstrated in two
national campaigns and in demolishing his Democratic rival this
year, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gore's closest advisers, particularly media expert Bob
Shrum, specialize in rough stuff, Hemenway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Bush handlers) will say, `There they go, slinging
mud again.' These guys worry me,'' Hemenway said of the Bush team,
especially Karl Rove, the boss of Bush's campaign brain trust.
``He's terrific,'' Hemenway said of Rove and his handling of the
Bush campaign and the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the key to Bush's ``bounce'' from this
convention lies with voter reaction to Thursday night's acceptance
address.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's viewed as a flop,'' said Merle Black, ``then nothing
else that went on in Philadelphia will matter much.''

THE MAGIC OF WRITING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Uganda)   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Growing up in Uganda, Moses Isegawa was an insatiable
reader, savoring books by writers as diverse as Philip Roth, V.S.
Naipaul, Timothy Mo and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. From the age of 14,
he dreamed about becoming a novelist himself. ``I thought it must
be magical to be a writer,'' he said recently. ``To tell a story
and somebody deep in a village in Uganda reads it and can identify
with the place and the characters _ I never lost that idea of the
magic and the excitement of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   It took many years, but at 37 Isegawa is a novelist, with an
increasing international reputation. His first novel, ``Abyssinian
Chronicles,'' was recently published by Alfred A. Knopf, having
already been published in the Netherlands (where the author now
lives) and in Finland and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The book is both a coming of age novel with a cast of evocative
African characters and an account of the political turbulence
during the regime of Idi Amin, the former Ugandan dictator.
</P>
<P>
   During his first visit to New York, Isegawa said the book was 90
percent fiction and 10 percent memoir. But throughout it resonates
with the knowledge of a first-hand experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skeleton'' of the novel, he said, came from his life _ his
move from the country to the city of Kampala, his years studying in
a Roman Catholic seminary and his eventual departure for the
Netherlands. He fleshed out the book by cross-pollinating
characters, ``working up'' incidents and imagining dramatic events.
At the heart is an Isegawa-like protagonist named Mugezi.
</P>
<P>
   From the first sentence of the novel, it is clear that this
fictional world is not so distant from magic realism: Mugezi's
father is consumed by a ``colossal crocodile.'' Then the book moves
into a flashback. Isegawa's father and mother live in Uganda, and
they have not yet read their son's book. They may be surprised by
the unflattering portraits of Mugezi's parents, especially the
mother, who is emotionally and physical abusive of her son. If his
parents are upset, Isegawa said, so be it: ``I think Philip Roth
said, if a family gets a writer in its midst, there's going to be
trouble _ and it's going to be on my address, on my doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugezi has his own strong streak of malice, often pitting his
parents against each other. This is not a portrait of a hero as a
young man. Instead, in the author's words, Mugezi is closer to a
villain. ``I tried to get away from the love-me kind of book,'' he
said. ``I wanted to treat everybody the same way. I was not going
to be soft on myself and then go out and start punching people
below the belt. I wanted to write a challenging book, challenging
to myself and to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed the fictive elements in his protagonist. ``If I had
written a book about myself,'' he said, ``it would have been the
most boring book ever written.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the aggressive Mugezi, Isegawa seems soft-spoken
and genteel. Mugezi may be a case of wish fulfillment: ``He became
my cowboy, my outer ego, who is not afraid to get in trouble: to
hit and also get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the family story, the portrait of Idi Amin is
drawn directly from life. When Amin leads a coup d'etat in 1971 to
overthrow the corrupt Obote administration, Mugezi _ in common with
other Ugandans _ greets him as a savior. At first, Isegawa said,
``He did everything people wanted him to,'' and announced political
and social reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only afterwards that reports started coming in that
people had been kidnapped and killed.'' In one of several harrowing
scenes in the book, soldiers rape one of Mugezi's aunts. In the
end, Amin also ``destroyed the physical structure of the economy''
and the culture, as publishers left the country and books
disappeared from bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Isegawa knew little about the regime. Politics was a
taboo subject at home. In his family, it was his grandfather, a
lawyer, who was the most communicative, and it was from him that he
gathered family stories.
</P>
<P>
   While at the seminary Isegawa began writing short stories. He
sent some to a pen pal friend in the Netherlands who passed them on
to a Dutch missionary magazine, which published them, and then
asked Isegawa to write a monthly column.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by this encouragement, at 26 he decided to leave
Uganda. ``It was like stealing away,'' he said. He told only a few
people, and simply got on a plane and flew to the Netherlands. An
aunt and a cousin saw him off at the airport: ``They didn't even
know that I was going to be a writer. They thought I was going to
do what other young people do'' _ leave the country to make money
and send it back home.
</P>
<P>
   He had something entirely different in mind. ``I had burned all
my bridges,'' he said. ``I think writers need a shock. In Amsterdam
I had to begin at zero level. I had to learn the language, and find
my own feet. When people would ask what are you doing, I would say
I was a bookkeeper.'' That was one of his occupations. In secret he
became a book writer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years his book grew larger and more personal, and by 30
he was more confident about his talent. When he finished the novel,
he made four copies and sent them at random to four Dutch
publishers. Two immediately returned the manuscript, but the third
publisher accepted it and commissioned a Dutch translation of the
English. The author was jubilant, and the subsequent rejection of
the fourth copy did not discourage him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, eight months before the book was published, he was
interviewed on Dutch radio, and that set off a series of other
interviews. By the time the book came out, he was already a
celebrity in the Netherlands. Favorable reviews sparked sales.
Acting as intermediary, his Dutch editor helped find publishers in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the curious title, Isegawa said he wanted to find a
word that would encapsulate the desperate situation in Uganda, and
hit upon ``abyss,'' then expanded it to Abyssinia. As the father
says in the book, ``Uganda was a land of false bottoms where under
every abyss there was another one waiting to ensnare people.'' For
him, it was Uganda not Ethiopia that was really Abyssinia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Isegawa could call himself a writer, a feeling that was
underscored during his visit to the United States. In New York he
shared an evening's reading with the critic Stanley Crouch, who
told him he had been at a birthday party for Saul Bellow and had
recommended that Bellow, Roth and William Kennedy read ``Abyssinian
Chronicles.''
</P>
<P>
   When Isegawa heard that, he said, ``Wow! Incredible stuff. I
can't imagine those writers taking the time to read my book. I
would be honored to be in their company, but, for me, I'm still the
wannabe. I have one book. I'm just saying this is the way I want to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book the name Mugezi is defined as meaning brilliant in
Ugandan. Asked what Moses means, he said, ``taken out,'' which
seems relevant: He was taken out of Uganda. But as Mugezi says, ``I
carried the village with me, and it would remain so the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still part of it,'' Isegawa said about Uganda. ``When you
leave, you leave with all the images. I planted that tiny village
in the book and now it has grown to this big thing in the world.
You leave a situation but you can't leave it psychologically.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer the British edition will go on sale in Uganda. His
parents will have a chance to read it, and the author will return
home, for the first time. In some small outlying village other
young men may read the book and be inspired by the magic of
Isegawa's story.

A NIGHT OUT WITH ELIZABETH GILBERT AND THE COYOTE REGULARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 6)  
 By SIMON HOUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was definitely a mistake to have only one pint of
Jack Daniel's before seeing that,'' Elizabeth Gilbert said to her
friend Jana. This was a few minutes after the end credits rolled at
the Monday night Ziegfeld premiere of ``Coyote Ugly.'' The heavily
hyped new Disney movie is based on a 1997 GQ article by Gilbert
about her experiences tending bar at the real Coyote Ugly in the
East Village. She was out of sorts after watching the film, which
transformed the gritty, tiny, blue-collar dive into an outsize,
airbrushed party palace. Usually armed with a quick and cynical
wit, Gilbert could only mutter, ``It's so weird,'' as she wandered
toward the exit.
</P>
<P>
   But feeling weird is normal for a writer at a movie premiere,
fluttering through the big night in an odd twilight between being a
star and a nobody. Gilbert went to join her friends, the Coyote
regulars Beertruck, Big Daddy and Redneck Lou, who were waiting at
the exit with her husband, Mike. The movie's cast was being ferried
the three blocks to Roseland by stretch limos for the after-party.
Gilbert's posse walked. Disney booked their car only for the first
half of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Flashbulbs were popping at the Roseland entrance. ``Hey, Liz, is
it like this on your book tour, too?'' Jana asked in mock
amazement. Gilbert had just come back from two weeks spent in small
Maine bookstores, reading from her new novel ``Stern Men.'' ``Oh,
yes,'' she replied, going along with the joke, though the
flashbulbs stopped at her arrival when none of the paparazzi
recognized her.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the ballroom had been transformed into a theme version
of the celebrated drinking hole. ``Wow, faux ugly!'' Gilbert
exclaimed, taking in the battered license plates, neon beer signs
and bras hanging from the fixtures, all of which serve as decor at
the real Coyote Ugly. Sexy young things stripped down to black bras
and leather pants strutted atop the bar. Every so often they
breathed fire or sprayed water into the crowd, dancing to David
Bowie, ZZ Top and Kid Rock. ``It's like a ride!'' Gilbert
exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   She and Jana headed straight for a makeshift tattoo parlor, an
attraction the real bar doesn't offer. Though the only tattoo
available was a decal of the movie's logo, they nonetheless took
turns applying it to each other's biceps. Hugh Jackman (``X-Men''),
'N Sync and LeAnn Rimes were there with the movie's cast. Gilbert
went to say hello to Piper Perabo, the lead actress, but was
waylaid when the bartenders uncorked a thunderstorm of bottled
water onto the heads of the crowd. Most scurried away, but Gilbert
stood her ground, removing her leather jacket to shield herself
from the downpour. After a couple of minutes she'd had enough and
gathered her friends to make a run to the real Coyote Ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``First Avenue between Ninth and Tenth, please,'' she instructed
the cabdriver. ``Boy, if I had a nickel for every time I've said
that.'' At 12:30 a.m., Gilbert made a grander entrance at the dark,
steamy, sweaty, genuine Coyote Ugly, where she was greeted with
hoots and hollers. She hit the jukebox and punched in the kind of
music they didn't play up at Roseland: the country stalwarts George
Jones, Merle Haggard, Dwight Yoakam. When Hank Williams Jr.'s
``Family Tradition,'' came on, Chris, the only male bartender, took
her hand and struck up an impressive two-step.
</P>
<P>
   By 2:30, Gilbert's feet were getting tired. Claiming she no
longer had the same stamina as when she worked at the bar seven
years ago, she and Mike headed for the door, despite pleas from
Beertruck and Big Daddy. ``We're leaving,'' Gilbert said firmly.
``It's Monday night and I'm 31 and I need an Advil. It's time for a
cab.''

CULLING THE INNER BUSH

 (For release Sunday, Aug. 6, 2000)  
 (Resending with edits thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In this campaign of psycho-biography, and
especially in the wake of last week's GOP convention, there's
scarcely an acre of George W. Bush's formative experience left
unplowed.
</P>
<P>
   We know of young George's light-hearted manner, developed to
console a grieving mother, and the back-slapping bonhomie honed at
Andover. We've felt his pain at Yale chaplain William Sloane
Coffin's cruel comment that his father had been defeated for the US
Senate by ``a better man.''
</P>
<P>
   We've winced at drunken George's Oedipal offer to go mano a mano
with his old man, empathized with feral George's need to break out
of his father's long shadow, and celebrated mature George's
40th-birthday decision to choose Laura Bush over Jack Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   And yet when it comes to predicting what presidential George W.
Bush would do, we might be better off paying a little less
attention to personality and a little more to the ideas and
principles that would inform his policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't spell out each and every one in his acceptance
speech Thursday, but like the riverbed boulders that shape the
current above, they were all there, guiding his vision of the
``responsibility era'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   Some were apparent: With a tax cut scored at $1.3 trillion over
nine years ($1.9 trillion over 10, according to Citizens for Tax
Justice, a progressive nonprofit), Bush wants to lessen
Washington's claim on the wallet so that, as vice-presidential
nominee Dick Cheney phrased it on Wednesday, families ``can spend
more on what they value rather than on what the government thinks
is important.''
</P>
<P>
   But what other ideas would guide the second President Bush?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A renewed federalism &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember that the nomination of George W. Bush represents the
victory of the Republican Party's governors over its congressfolk.
One defining belief of the chief political executives is that
decisions on most matters affecting the states are best made in
state capitals rather than in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is after all in his second term as chief executive in
Texas, appears as serious as anyone about that devolution. ``He's a
governor and he knows that governors focus on getting results,''
said Governor Paul Cellucci, a close ally, in a convention-floor
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Bush mentioned that time and again on the stump, he
has built it into his proposals. Bush, says Stephen Goldsmith, his
chief domestic policy adviser, ``rejects the idea that what
government needs to do is go away, that there is no reason for
government, but he also rejects the view that the role of
government is Washington-centric and kind of statist.''
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, that means pushing decisions down to lower
levels of government. When it comes to education, for example, the
federal government would set standards, but it would be up to the
states and communities to decide how best to meet them.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of that approach is that by once again turning the
states into the laboratories of democracy, experimentation could
highlight programs that work, the way Wisconsin and Massachusetts
have with their revamps of welfare and Texas has with its efforts
to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off is that while some states will excel, others may
well founder, leading to a disparity of services nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Going to market &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another of Bush's basic tenets is a broad faith in the
marketplace as a way to maximize choice and efficiency. ``A key
principle is that, when government helps, it should do so through
individual choices,'' says Goldsmith. ``He respects individuals and
the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   That belief has been expressed in two ways that have attracted
particular campaign-trail attention. Most notable is Bush's plan to
let Americans invest a portion of their Social Security payroll tax
in the stock market, an idea which proved so popular that Vice
President Al Gore, due to be nominated officially by the Democrats
next week, quickly followed suit with a similar proposal of his
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most significant example both of his philosophy on
wealth creation and of giving authority to individuals, as opposed
to the Washington bureaucracy,'' says Goldsmith. A second is Bush's
proposal for a refundable tax credit to help low-income families
purchase private health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   More controversial, and muted, is Bush's scheme for federal
education dollars. Here's how he put it in his convention
acceptance speech: ``When a school district receives federal funds
to teach poor children, we expect them to learn. And if they don't,
parents should get the money to make a different choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a voucher program that dares not quite speak its name.
But even if Bush avoids the ideologically charged word, a voucher
by any other name still smells as sweet to free-marketeers.
</P>
<P>
   Anathema to teachers unions, that approach has growing appeal to
minorities, who are disproportionately trapped in underperforming
urban schools. Which is why it should come as no surprise that
Colin Powell endorsed the idea in his own speech, saying: ``Let's
experiment prudently with school voucher programs to see if they
help. Let's use innovation and competition . . . to help give our
children the best education possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of such an approach are several: increased
choice, access to better schools, and, if competition has the same
salutary effects on schools as it does on every other human
endeavor, improved public schools as well.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also disadvantages. Ultimately, vouchers will need
Supreme Court clearance, at least if they are to apply to religious
schools _ and without religious schools, Bush's plan would be
unlikely to offer a wide array of affordable choice.
</P>
<P>
   A second drawback to Bush's market orientation is that although
increased choice carries the prospect of greater reward, it also
comes with greater risk. Expect Gore to make much of that risk in
his critique of Bush's Social Security plan. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Faith in faith &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a stout supporter of letting faith-based groups use
public dollars to provide social service more typically delivered
by government or secular nonprofits _ but not, his advisers insist,
simply because he believes himself personally redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's ultimately a pragmatist,'' says Lawrence Lindsey,
Bush's chief economic adviser. ``The evidence is that faith-based
institutions are very efficient deliverers of public service and at
actually helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush clearly thinks so. Highlighting a Minneapolis ministry that
provides the homeless with meals and a spiritual message, he put it
this way: ``Government cannot do this work. It can feed the body,
but it cannot reach the soul. Yet government can take the side of
these groups, helping the helper, encouraging the inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   A second reason Bush likes the idea, says Marvin Olasky, a
University of Texas journalism professor who has advised him on the
issue, is that it ``allows different groups to try different things
rather than going with the one size fits all'' approach of
government-administered programs.
</P>
<P>
   Olasky, author of ``Compassionate Conservatism: What It Is, What
It Does, and How It Can Transform America,'' is quick to note that
Bush isn't endorsing one religion over the next. All would be
eligible. And, he says, there would always be a secular alternative
for service delivery.
</P>
<P>
   To help those groups, Bush would allow individuals an
above-the-line tax exemption _ which would reduce one's taxable
income in the same way an IRA contribution does _ for charities of
their choice. He would also allow them to direct part of their tax
payments as contributions to those charities.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-offs? The first is obvious: Bush's plan would further
erode the wall between church and state, with all the concerns that
entails. But an equally knotty issue is how to distinguish between
religious organizations. Focus on results, says Olasky. And if a
cult has the best results? That question remains unanswered. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Communitarian, not libertarian &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These are two divergent streams of modern American conservatism.
The libertarian thrust, most closely associated with Western
conservatism, is best expressed by a desire to get government out
of the way. In 1980, Ronald Reagan paid campaign-trail tribute to
that idea, asking, rhetorically, how long it would take for people
to notice if the federal government simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, with his plans to direct federal dollars to private
organizations to pursue social functions, has plotted a different
course: using government to strengthen civil society.
</P>
<P>
   That's the prevailing current of today's conservatism _ and if
faith-based groups and charities work as billed to strengthen
society, the upside is obvious. But other conservatives raise a
second objection: Government may weaken the very groups it hopes to
harness for social good.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want strong, dynamic, vigorous private organizations to
solve social problems, you need to keep them private,'' says David
Boaz, author of ``Libertarianism: A Primer'' and executive vice
president of the Cato Institute. ``Giving them government subsidies
makes them soft and dependent and subject to regulation.'' &QL;

 &HT;    The need for speed
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Speed thrills. Always has. From Johnson to Johnson,
Walter to Randy, the Big Train to the Big Unit, the hard throwers
always have awed baseball. The bringers of the heat. The fastball
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   They are an integral part of the game's romance and mystique.
From Walter Johnson to Bullet Bob Feller, from Sandy Koufax to the
legendary, terrifyingly wild blur that was Steve Dalkowski, from
Nolan Ryan's express to Mark Wohlers' once-103 mph cheese to the
current electricity of Billy Koch, Randy Johnson and Pedro
Martinez, baseball's always had a fastball fetish.
</P>
<P>
   Yet never more than nowadays, what with JUGGS guns and
velocities flashed on the scoreboard and a corps of closers who
traffic in speeds normally reserved for NASCAR superspeedways. For
fans, the velocirapture's never been higher, the fastball connected
to the longball as never before.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like now, velocity's everything,'' says Jim Guadagno,
the Braves' employee who charts pitches at all Braves games. ''Back
then, it was guys that pitched. Now, it seems velocity means a lot.
You see the readings on the board and the readings on TV. People
want to see the speed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the home-run hitters,'' Guadagno says. ``It brings
people out to the park. They've got K's up on the board a K
counter. People want to see home runs and strikeouts. They're
enamored with it. It's almost like the game's being built around
power, whether it be the homer or pitching. Why do they have
velocity up on the board? They don't have a groundball counter up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they have boards flashing 100 mph, even 101, the speeds Koch
hit in Turner Field in early June, when every pitch Toronto's
left-handed closer threw hit triple-digits. Koch is the fastest
pitcher in the game today. ''By far,'' Guadagno says. ''Every pitch
he threw here, it was 100. I couldn't believe it. Easy cheese.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He throws extremely hard,'' Braves bench coach Pat Corrales
says. ''I don't know if he knows what he's doing, but his ball cuts
and sinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, it hums. Not quite like Wohlers' did in 1995, when
Guadagno clocked him at 103, the fastest reading he's ever
recorded. Corrales recalls Wohlers hitting 101, 102 on consecutive
nights at Florida in 1996 or '97. That was when Robb Nen was in his
100 heyday as the Marlins' closer; now, he's merely a mid-90's
fastballer-by-the-bay in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker has hit 100 occasionally. Houston's Billy Wagner
regularly flirted with 100 and sometimes reached it before blowing
out his elbow earlier this season. The Mets' Armando Benitez is a
97-98-mph regular, as was Montreal's Ugueth Urbina until injuring
himself this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among today's starters, Johnson and Martinez have company in
Curt Schilling, who routinely throws 95. Kris Benson of the Pirates
and Kevin Brown of the Dodgers also throw mid-90s. As preocuppied
as we have become with the need for speed, what separates the real
pitchers from the hard throwers is command of the strike zone, and
the threat of another pitch, or two, to make the hardball harder to
hit. Ask Andres Galarraga, who calls Martinez, Johnson and
Schilling his toughest fast guys to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pedro, when he's got the changeup and he's throwing the
fastball, that's why he's the best now,'' Galarraga said. ''And
Johnson, with the slider and the fastball. They throw the ball and
command the game. You're feeling like they're going to throw a
no-hitter every time.''
</P>
<P>
   By throwing more than mere fastballs. ''They throw like that, we
can hit it,'' Galarraga said, motioning with his hand to simulate a
straight fastball. ''The problem is when they throw a changeup, or
breaking ball, when you're waiting on a 95.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball looks that big,'' he said, forming a small circle
with his fingers. ''Really small, like an aspirin.''
</P>
<P>
   It can cause severe headaches for the best of hitters. The
problem comes from an assortment of pitches, of varying speeds,
angles and movements. Remember Koufax, perhaps the greatest lefty,
with the lethal fastball but also a nasty curve thrown seemingly
from somewhere out in right field?
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a curve,'' says Corrales, who hit or tried to hit
against Koufax. ''It was more of a drop. A curve goes right and
left. This was a drop. Made your head go up and down.'' And
ultimately left it shaking in bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Koufax? Try Johnson, although the Braves' Chipper Jones
says: ''Randy is like no one else. We've all faced lefties who can
throw 98 and lefties who can throw sliders. But we've never faced a
guy who's 6-10 and is closer than anybody else when he releases the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is an extreme example of home-plate proximity that makes
some fastballs seem even faster. You usually find it in tall
closers with big deliveries, such as Wohlers, Benitez, Nen or
Florida's Antonio Alfonseca.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your hardest-throwing guys are always going to be your
closers,'' 15th-year veteran Wally Joyner says. For Joyner, Johnson
is the fastest left-hander he's ever faced and Wohlers the fastest,
period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Closers get on top of you very quickly,'' Joyner says.
``Wohlers had the long delivery, the long stride. In all actuality,
they end up throwing closer.''
</P>
<P>
   And harder. If not quite as hard as Walter Johnson, who won 416
games for the Washington Senators and was the first of the true
flamethrowers. The Big Train's fastball flew so quickly that he
genuinely worried he would bean and kill someone. Feller wasn't
called ''Bullet Bob'' or ''Rapid Robert'' haphazardy. The Indians'
Hall of Famer was the hardest thrower of his era. Team officials
once tried to measure his fastball with a crude, early version of a
radar gun; later, Feller squared off against a motorcyclist who
sped by just as Feller released the ball. The ball won.
</P>
<P>
   At Fresno High School, Corrales caught Jim Maloney, who once
struck out 26 batters in a game and later threw 100 mph for
Cincinnati. ''When he lost seven miles an hour off his fastball, he
couldn't get anybody out,'' Corrales says.
</P>
<P>
   Corrales also once caught Ryne Duren, the goggle-eyed fireballer
for the Yankees in the early '60s. ''He tried to make people think
he was wild, but he wasn't,'' Corrales says. ''If he had eight
warmup pitches, the last one was up in the screen. A lot of his
(wildness) was for show.''
</P>
<P>
   But still at warp speed. The list of flamethrowers burns still:
J.R. Richard. Tom Seaver. The young Doc Gooden. Goose Gossage.
Roger Clemens. Lee Smith. The Braves have had their share: Steve
Bedrosian. Alejandro Pena. Len Barker. Long before arriving in
Atlanta, Barker beaned a guy in the instructional league and split
his helmet; later, he threw a perfect game in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Berenguer became ''Senor Smoke'' for a reason. ''In his
early days, he could throw as hard as anybody,'' Braves third base
coach Ned Yost says. ''When he was in the minors, he'd tell you a
fastball was coming. Guys still couldn't hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there was the great Gibson, Bob Gibson threw so
fast and so well that he literally changed the game of baseball.
After he posted a 1.12 ERA in 1968, baseball lowered the height of
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pitched inside, he pitched outside,'' Corrales says. ''He
could make a ball do what (Greg) Maddux does: cut it. He threw a
cutter, and a sinker, 94-95 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones can relate. ''Kerry Woods has thrown me the
hardest pitch I've ever seen,'' Jones says. ''That was prior (to
Woods' elbow surgery after the 1998 season). He threw it right at
my kneecaps.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Usually, you don't look up (at the pitch speed),'' Jones says.
``But that got my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   A pitch at the knees at 98 mph will do that. So will almost any
pitch from Martinez. ''Pedro, he has a reputation as a
headhunter,'' Jones says. Perhaps, but Martinez breaks the mold of
the 6-foot-4, 230-pounder who fires the ball at 100 mph. ''A guy
5-8, 5-9, 145-to-150 sopping wet is not supposed to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor throw at peak velocity late in the game. But he does. So did
John Smoltz until elbow surgery shelved him this season.
''Smoltzie's one of the guys who's maintained his velocity at the
end of the game as good as anybody,'' Guadagno says. ''They said
guys like Seaver and Gooden could turn it up at the end of a game
when they had a win. John has done that, too. Like Clemens, his top
velocity may come back at the end of a game. That's a rare animal,
but those guys are horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Horses who can haul it in the low-to-mid-90 range, often for a
full nine innings. ''There's a big difference between throwing that
for a game and Koch throwing 100 for an inning,'' Guadagno says.
''Velocity doesn't equate to success. It narrows down to guys who
know how to pitch. The guys that know how to pitch Maddux, Glavine,
Neagle check out their velocities, (which rarely break 90). That,
to me, says everything.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fans want to see people blow guys away rather than Glav win
200 games just tricking 'em,'' Guadagno says. ``Or Doggie. He'd
rather have a guy ground out on the first pitch than get a
strikeout.''''
</P>
<P>
   Even without a groundball counter updated regularly. ``Eleven of
Maddux's 18 outs have come via groundballs'' isn't as exotic as
``103 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily, I don't think the baseball people are as caught up in
the numbers as everybody else,'' Guadagno says. ''I think that's
more for promotion, TV. But the baseball people know it matters to
get you out.''

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It was a country music convention, for a country
music party, led by a country music candidate. We discover the
first Tuesday in November if America is a country music country.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush gave a very good speech, the best big speech he's
made ever, with pretty fair delivery, from an artful text, with
short phrases that helped him negotiate his big night. Introduced
by a fetching video of him driving across his ranch with his dog
Spot on his lap, Bush avoided the landmine of going too negative
against the Democrats. His family hates everything about Clinton &AMP;
Clinton, but Bush &AMP; Bush Inc. understands America does not want a
bitter and vengeful president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the party of inclusion,'' he said to Republicans whose
takeover of the Sun Belt states was based on Richard Nixon's
southern strategy. Every black congressman but one is a Democrat,
but Bush pulled off the biggest cosmetic makeover of a political
party in modern times. His official campaign song's refrain is
populist pablum: ``We pay the taxes, we pay the bills, so they
better pay attention up on Capital Hill.'' But his speech ignored
the GOP leaders who control Congress, and who were relegated to bit
parts here.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's post-speech tableau was often obscured by the cascades of
150,000 balloons and 300 million _ that's what they claim _ pieces
of confetti. It was excessive _ perhaps `Tex-cessive' is the word _
and the stage was often invisible in the visual clutter. But this
was the biggest cosmetic job since they invented plastic surgery.
If it works, Bush is a genius.
</P>
<P>
   Fixated on Bill Clinton as his party is and his family remains,
Bush spoke of the President who licked his old man more in sorrow
than in anger. To every Bush, Al Gore is but an afterthought, a
speedbump on the way to Pennsylvania Ave., the address every
delegate here thinks will be won soon. ``So many talents, so much
charm, such great skills,'' mused the younger Bush of the hated
Clinton, ``so much promise, to no great purpose.'' Take that,
Bubba!
</P>
<P>
   It is the Bush crowd that is making this campaign a morality
play, a restoration drama. Dubbaya plays Prince Hal to the old
man's Henry IV, the scamp who'll reclaim the castle and make
everything right again. His strategy assumes that Gore is Clinton
and Clinton Gore. ``This administration had had its chance. They
have not led. We will,'' he said three times in a sort of irregular
meter that left no doubt he's running against two Democrats, one
past and one maybe future, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the speech was a pithy pitch for class and racial
harmony, a soft-and-cuddly alternative to the past two hard-edged
GOP conclaves that ended in vainglorious defeat. The closest thing
we heard resembling his father's fatal ``read my lips, no new
taxes!'' mantra was a pledge to rescue Social Security, to wit:
``No changes. No reductions. No way.'' No kidding, that's how he's
packaging it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush still has that goofy grin at odd moments, brow furrowed,
biting his lip, like Johnny Carson waiting to deliver a straight
line. If he debates as well as he read his speech, the Democrats
have a problem. Half his speech could have been delivered by Ted
Kennedy, the reach-out-to-racial-harmony stuff. Then we got
Dubbaya's Four Big Ideas: huge tax cuts; school vouchers;
privatizing part of Social Security; and the missile defense scheme
many scientists say can't work and most world leaders decry. So the
Russians hate the idea? They don't vote, right?
</P>
<P>
   He tossed the I'll-ban-partial-birth-abortion bone to the right,
and tried to mollify the middle with ``good people can disagree''
on abortion, though he's against it. The crowd was won over before
he strolled onstage. It was rapture rampant. They see him
delivering them from that Clinton clone, Al the Afterthought. The
game plan aims at swing voters with touchy-feely ``compassionate
conservatism.'' But he doesn't rely on polls. Nah.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a brilliantly camouflaged convention, with a
relentless assembly line of black and brown speakers, with much
worthy and hearty rhetoric about lifting up the downtrodden. Off
camera were the corporate lobbyists and millionaire contributors
who slipped George W. Bush $10 million at lunch the day he hit
town, putting his personal haul this season over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment? Never happened, so far as this crowd heard. Henry
Hyde? All those syruppy southern senators who led Pickett's Charge
up Impeachment Hill? Non-persons, banished by the scriptwriters.
Newt Gingrich? He's working for Fox TV now, with a lot of the other
Clinton-bashers on the Murdoch payroll. The Pat Robertsons and
Jerry Falwells, those roistering reverends who threatened the likes
of Bush Sr. and Bob Dole with bumptious Biblical brimstone, were
relegated to the cheap seats.
</P>
<P>
   Where camouflage was insufficient, there was collective amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Sr. beat Mike Dukakis with attack ads featuring Willie
Horton, the black convict made famous by Bush television
commercials, showing revolving doors of dark-skinned marauders
supposedly turned loose upon white America by that lying liberal
from Massachusetts. Bush Sr.'s 1988 acceptance speech, vowing death
to cop-killers and promising prayer in schools, included this: ``.
. . it is a scandal to give a weekend furlough to a hardened
first-degree killer who hasn't even served enough time to be
eligible for parole,'' thundered Papa Bush. But Bush Jr. is going
the compassion route.
</P>
<P>
   Bush Jr. beat Ann Richards for governor in Texas by claiming she
hadn't built enough prisons (she only added more cells than any
previous governor) and was squishy-soft on crime. George Jr. has
130,000 prison inmates in Texas, makes money by importing other
cons from states with more pricey prison cells like Massachusetts,
and executed 132 locals to date. He lops them off at the rate of
one convict a week, give or take.
</P>
<P>
   But he wants America to know he gets all teary-eyed when he
talks to a 15-year old boy in a Texas hoosegow who later got shot.
Too bad. Of course, George Jr. also signed laws allowing Texans to
carry concealed handguns, and to protect gun makers from government
lawsuits. You have to watch this Texan's sleeves when he deals, as
well as the hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard news out of Philly is that the Bush campaign is
rolling. The candidate delivered the speechifying goods as
promised, the campaign hammered the heck out of every possible
upstart and the train is rolling on time. The delegates who left
town Friday think they have a winner. It may yet turn out that
America is not as lustful for change as Bush &AMP; Bush think. But
that's for Al Gore to prove. Earth to Al: better get off your butt
pronto. Labor Day may be too late.

DISPUTE WITH HANDBAG MAKER TAKEN TO STORE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nieves Pena watched in admiration a year and a half
ago as her mother voted to unionize the garment district factory in
which she worked, one that made handbags for Kate Spade.
</P>
<P>
   But when Pena tried to help start a union in June at her own
factory, KC Accessories, which also happened to make Kate Spade
bags, she ran into a wall, she said. The owner, Kulwant Chouhan,
pulled her aside and told her not to talk about a union, she said.
Then, on June 30, he dismissed all 50 or so workers, most of them
Latino immigrants, she said. Later, she said, he rehired about 20
who were not union sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do anything he wants,'' said Pena, who came from the
Dominican Republic in 1998. ``There's a reason why we want to join
a union.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees has
filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing
KC Accessories, at 22 W. 32nd St., of anti-union practices.
Chouhan's lawyer has denied the allegations, and an investigation
is pending. But Thursday, Pena joined two dozen protesters outside
a Kate Spade boutique in SoHo to denounce her former employer and
to ask Kate Spade to put pressure on Chouhan.
</P>
<P>
   The action against KC Accessories is the latest in a series of
complaints against high-end designers and the contractors who do
much of their manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Spade has taken the stance that it has no control over the
labor practices of its contractors. ``They're not our employees;
it's not our business,'' said Elyce Cox, a partner at Kate Spade,
which had more than $60 million in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Post, a lawyer who represents both KC Accessories and
Kate Spade, denied the allegations against Chouhan. ``KC
Accessories complies with all applicable labor laws and
regulations,'' he said. ``We believe that KC Accessories will be
vindicated by the National Labor Relations Board after the board
has had the opportunity to review all of the circumstances and not
just one side of the story, as it has now.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers said that in June, Chouhan began meeting with
workers one by one to discourage them from forming a union. This
came after some workers had already approached UNITE about
unionizing the shop, and had begun to collect signatures from their
colleagues, Pena said. Then on June 30, hours after UNITE
representatives went to the shop to ask Chouhan to recognize the
union, Chouhan dismissed his employees, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena said she worked 40 to 50 hours a week and earned $6.50 an
hour, but was never paid extra for working overtime or holidays.
She said she also did not receive health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Also on June 30, UNITE filed a petition with the National Labor
Relations Board for the factory workers to hold a vote on whether
to form a union. The election is scheduled for Tuesday, but union
officials are asking the government to cancel the vote because they
say that in mid-July, Chouhan rehired only those workers who are
anti-union.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, garment workers and union officials marched outside
the Kate Spade store while a well-dressed man stood inside the
display window and thumbed his nose at them. Minutes later, he
stormed outside and grabbed a stack of pamphlets from one woman and
ran back into the store. Then he rushed back outside, slammed his
elbow into the face of a photographer and walked quickly down the
street, witnesses said. Police officers said the man was a Kate
Spade employee.

WHEN THE BRUTAL TRUTH IS JUST POLITICS IN AN EXOTIC SETTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching Greg, the Ivy League graduate, earnestly pretend a
coconut is his cell phone in the middle of the jungle, or Richard,
the scheming corporate consultant, strip naked in honor of his
birthday; watching Mega, the black nationalist, sarcastically tell
one-legged Eddie that he supports ``cripple rights,'' or Karen, the
troubled housewife, confess her affair with her stepfather's nephew
_ watching these ``real life'' moments from the television shows
``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother'' (or the latter's 24-hour-a-day
live Web site), I felt an all too familiar twinge.
</P>
<P>
   Plato described it as the contradictory feelings of repulsion
and fascination that arise when a dead body is viewed by the
living. Corpses must have caused an ancient form of rubbernecking.
Now television does it. I watch in gruesome embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' of course, stranded 11 people on a South Seas
island, where they have to manage to survive the elements and one
another; ``Big Brother'' stranded 10 people in a bourgeois house,
where they have to survive one another and a very tiny
refrigerator. Once they enter these worlds, they abandon all hope
of privacy; cameramen invisibly stalk the islanders; cameras
noisily swerve throughout the house. And lest everything become too
dull, much effort is expended to ensure discomfort and conflict.
There are limited rations, unpleasant sleeping conditions, contests
to teasingly create group loyalty and others to shatter it.
Presumably the veneer of ordinary public manners will gradually
fall away, revealing the private self in all its unsettling
nakedness.
</P>
<P>
   The concept behind these shows is not unfamiliar. Take a group
of types _ figures who, in their occupations or views, are
recognizably representative personalities _ and throw them together
in an isolating setting. Eugene O'Neill tossed his social emblems
together in a bar for ``The Iceman Cometh.'' Katherine Anne Porter
put them to sea for ``Ship of Fools.'' ``Gilligan's Island'' turned
the gathering into slight farce, Sartre's ``No Exit'' into
pretentious nightmare. All are meant to be microcosms of a society
in which various public roles collide, revealing hypocrisy or
crudity or sterility or venality. Names become irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The types are part of these shows as well. On the island: the
single mother of two, the clueless doctor, the leather-skinned Navy
Seal; in the house: the middle-aged dad, the exotic dancer, the
eccentric virgin, the quiet beauty queen. And much of the drama is
how, once pulled away from the society that defines those roles,
figures like these manage to fend for themselves, supposedly
becoming more ``real'' in their isolation, unveiling private
truths.
</P>
<P>
   But what bizarre truths they are! The real is actually the world
being left behind; the artificial is the world being created. Soap
operas take ``fake'' people and put them in ``real'' situations;
these shows take real people and put them in fake situations.
Despite the trappings of primitivism _ the gongs, torches and
rituals _ the participants in ``Survivor'' are at summer camp, a
``Lord of the Flies'' summer camp to be sure, but one complete with
relay races and obstacle courses. The house of ``Big Brother'' is
unlike any ever designed; the main lights never turn off; the hot
water is rationed; there are weekly activities including
mask-making, domino mazes and jump-rope contests. While creating
supposedly Darwinian struggles, these settings actually infantilize
their inhabitants: like children, if they are good, they get to
play; if uncooperative, their elementary school friends cast them
off into oblivion. And the hosts of these shows are two of the most
smarmy and coy on television, adults who don't really know how to
talk to children. Big Brother isn't frightening; he's creepily
chummy.
</P>
<P>
   The climax of each show is the banishment of one of its
citizens. But what qualities are being bred for success?
``Survivor'' boasts that many of its participants have wilderness
skills; ``Big Brother'' has its share of more domestically oriented
talents. But it isn't the most skillful who survive. Naked
aggression is condemned, not rewarded. Mega, the first to be voted
off ``Big Brother,'' seemed to relish creating conflict and
demonstrating his superiority. Sense and maturity, as demonstrated
by Gretchen on ``Survivor'' may have made her a threat and
accelerated her banishment. I would wager that Rich, the most
scheming of the Survivors, is doomed not to be one. Aggression must
be hidden behind comradely socializing. ``I love her to death,''
says one islander after voting off a friend. ``This is no
reflection on the type of person she is.'' Residents of the house
often say they are voting off their house mates for their own good,
because it would be better for them to head home.
</P>
<P>
   So it isn't the brutal truth that is shown; it is more like
office politics with an exotic setting and bizarre comrades,
complete with alliances and betrayals, friendships and rivalries
and aggression cloaked by phony good feeling. ``Survivor'' even has
a consulting psychologist, Dr. Gene Ondrusek, who provides the
show's moral on CBS's Web site: ``Research overwhelmingly confirms
that success in the workaday jungle depends more on your
interpersonal skills and ability to get along with people than your
technical competence.'' These shows don't break with their social
surroundings; they incorporate them.
</P>
<P>
   In such a confusing universe, which at once resembles ordinary
life while having nothing whatsoever to do with it, the moments of
real emotion become all the more disturbing; it is as if someone's
mask fell in the midst of a drama. Infantilism and adulthood,
fakery and feeling, public and private swirl together in some eerie
melange. The sensation recalls the queasiness caused by seeing
tapes of President Clinton testifying about his sexual activities,
or of Bill Gates squirmily claiming a poor memory in his testimony
in the Microsoft antitrust trial. These public figures failed to
contain their private selves; in the television shows, private
figures eagerly court the public glance.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that at the heart of these shows is a cultural
confusion about just what the private and public realms are.
Culture is, to a great extent, about the relationship between the
public and the private. But here, all coherence is gone. Public
authority is fake ritual and the voice of Big Brother. Private
feeling is pop psychology and confession. It's all very depressing.
But riveting.

man's wallet. Nor does the snapshot of him on her nightstand convey
the weight of her wondering whether he would come home from that
place where the world had gone to war. He gave four years because
he was asked, and because it was his way to honor obligation. She
waited four years because he was handsome and kind and funny.
Theirs is the story of a generation. It is as familiar as the dust
mice that live under the refrigerator at home, and as remarkable as
buried treasure. And now it has become the marketing tool of a
political party with both eyes fixed on the White House.(Shulken,

get used to traveling. No team will fly more miles this season than
the Cowboys, the unofficial ambassadors of the NFL. Including
preseason, the Cowboys will travel 31,020 miles. Seattle is second
with 30,218 and San Francisco third at 29,928. By contrast,
Tennessee travels a league-low 8,498 miles. Dallas will always be
among the NFL leaders in travel miles, partly because they have an
owner who likes to market his team around the world. (Cantu, Austin

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Margaret Cho was a virgin. That was why her friends
gathered Wednesday night in her suite at the Paramount Hotel to
initiate her into the world of those who can spell Gervase _ a
universe that does not include contestants on the television series
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   She needed help, because she was going to appear the next
morning on ``The Early Show'' on CBS to analyze the latest
``Survivor'' episode. She knew nothing about it, not where the
island was (``It's near China?'' she asked), nor any of the players
or rules.
</P>
<P>
   Suite 1526 was fully stocked with viewing aids: Triscuits, Bagel
Chips, salsa, Tostitos, peeled baby carrots, Evian, but no booze.
</P>
<P>
   Cho speaks honestly in her new one-woman film, ``I'm the One
That I Want,'' based on her stage show, about battling her weight
and her overindulgence in alcohol and other mind-altering
substances. In the film, she also explores being a ``fag hag''
(``Thank god for gay men, because if it weren't for gay men, I
wouldn't talk to men at all''), and addresses the question of her
own sexual orientation. (``Am I straight? Am I gay?'' she recalls
wondering in the film. ``Then I realized, I'm just slutty.'')
</P>
<P>
   Friends began arriving and showering her with gifts. Christopher
Schelling, her literary agent (is there a stand-up comic who isn't
writing a book?), offered a bag from Three Dog Bakery for her dog,
home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Chin-a Panaccione, who shares a Korean ancestry with Cho but has
an Italian father (``So my mother would make kim chee and
lasagna,'' Panaccione said), offered Cho some DVD's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality is so much better,'' Panaccione, who works in
film, said. ``Porn looks really good on DVD. The camera angles are
particularly good. Or `Lost in Space,''' she added.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Matrix,' too!'' Evan Greenberg, a New York University
student, interjected.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation turned to ``Survivor.'' One thing her friends
agreed on: the naked gay guy had to go.
</P>
<P>
   Schelling said flatly, ``Every gay man I know just hates him.''
</P>
<P>
   Guests began free-associating. ``Did you know there's a
`Survivor' cow in front of `The Early Show' near FAO Schwarz?''
Jessie Cohen, an office temp, asked.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schulman, a publicist on Cho's movie, tried to get the
star back on track. `` `Survivor' is not about surviving,'' he
offered. ``It's about back-stabbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schelling, who was seated next to Cho on a white Philippe Starck
tall-back bench, which looked about right for King Cole, tried to
fill her in on tactics. (The series will conclude on Aug. 23, with
the voting of the winner of the $1 million purse.) ``At first, it
was the people who were unpopular who got kicked off the island,''
he said. ``But now, they try to figure who is going to win, and
then they vote them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk turned to the contests the castaways compete in to win a
phone call home or temporary immunity from being voted off the
island. ``The challenges are like, how long you can hold your
breath under water, things that guys can win,'' Karen Taussig,
Cho's manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   Panaccione then gave away a big secret. ``If you go to the Web
site, and get under the HTML, there's a little red `x' next to
every name but one,'' she said. ``That's the one who gets the
prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Her Deep Throat on this? Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the winner is Gervase,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The program began. Like golf announcers, the assembled guests
whispered asides to Cho as each castaway came on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard used to be a corporate trainer.'' (Also ``the naked
gay guy.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy _ the old guy _ was a Navy Seal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean is a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gervase has two kids, but he's not married.'' (Almost true.
Gervase has four children, but he's not married.)
</P>
<P>
   After 15 minutes, Cho made her first observation: ``The thing
about human nature is to distrust people who excel. It's why we
worship mediocrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads nodded. So true.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there were commercials to deride. The reaction to a teaser
for ``Autumn in New York,'' a romance with Richard Gere and Winona
Ryder, was unanimous. Eueueuew. One guest, Zekio Dawson, noted that
Ryder was on the cover of Jane magazine. ``There was the cover
line, `Is Your Look Dated?''' he said. ``I wouldn't want to be on a
cover with that on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to ``Survivor,'' a cultural phenomenon that seems to
positively require group viewing. There was universal consternation
when Sue, the truck driver, burst into tears over what she would or
wouldn't do to Kelly, the white-water guide. ``What happened just
now?'' Cho said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we get a replay on that one?'' someone else asked.
</P>
<P>
   Then Rudy, the Navy Seal, began expounding on Gervase's habit of
fathering children out of wedlock. ``There's abortion,'' Rudy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' Cho announced, ``that's Roe vs. Wade-Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   More time passed. Gervase shared his prize, a slice of pizza. No
one made fun. Suddenly, Dawson had a revelation: ``You know what?
They all have tattoos.'' He enumerated the tattoos he had seen,
what they were and where they were located.
</P>
<P>
   Back to ``Survivor.'' Sean, the doctor, was on. ``Look at that
six-pack!'' Schulman said, admiring his abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at strangers in bathing suits has to be one of the
primary attractions of the series, especially for those who do not
yet have their fall catalogs from Victoria's Secret. Cho leaped up
and grabbed a bottle of Evian. Soon, the episode was over and _
consternation! _ it was Gervase who was voted off the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the HTML was wrong,'' Panaccione said weakly.
</P>
<P>
   All assembled tried to sum the experience up for Cho, who was
less than 12 hours away from needing a sound bite.
</P>
<P>
   Schelling said, ``This is `Citizen Kane,' and that other show,
`Big Brother,' is . . .''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Melrose Place?''' Cohen offered.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Big Brother' is `No Exit,''' Schelling finished.
</P>
<P>
   Cho wondered, ``Wouldn't you be sick of the people there after
all that time?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'd vote myself off the island,'' Schulman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cho practiced answers to the obvious questions: Who will win?
Would you eat bugs for $1 million? What personal item would you
bring? ``I'd bring an armoire,'' she said. ``Can't leave home
without that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the series was ``pretty addictive and dramatic,'' at
least judging by the one episode. ``But I don't know if I'd watch
it again,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, when Bryant Gumbel primed his three experts on
the panel to discuss CBS' blockbuster show, Cho jumped right in:
``I hate Rich,'' she said. Welcome Cho. You're now a member of the
tribe.

TALES OF MONEY, GREED AND NAIVETE IN THE GOLD RUSH OF 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 6)  
 By TIMOTHY JACK WARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Our multimillion-dollar dot-com folded, and all I got
was this lousy T-shirt. Everyone at Posh&AMP;Sticks got one, the day
our enigmatic _ let's face it, odd _ name was announced last
January. Now it is a bittersweet souvenir from the rush for the
elusive e-commerce mother lode. Don't get me wrong: I loved the
name and was proud to wear it on my chest. We gave this our best
shot, but we are toast.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of Posh&AMP;Sticks, a home-furnishings Internet business
financed by a group that included Ronald and Leonard Lauder, was
not as splashily public as the recent comeuppance of more deeply
financed sites like Boo.com, which sold clothes until it declared
bankruptcy, or iVillage, whose stock has pancaked. Our experience
is not unique, but it is emblematic of the Great Web Wipeout of
'00, when the capital for e-commerce suddenly dried up and the
dot-com magic carpet ride ended ingloriously.
</P>
<P>
   One day before the scheduled debut in mid-June of our high-style
home furnishings site, we were told that our board had decided to
pull the plug after spending between $14 million and $30 million
(the accepted figures around the office). Since then, the business
has wound down in a painful series of mass layoffs and liquidation
sales. On Monday, we last stragglers packed and moved out of our
offices on far West 26th Street, in what had once seemed the
hippest dot-com building in town.
</P>
<P>
   Plug-pulling doesn't quite capture it. It was more like cutting
the strings that tethered a magnificent kite, moments before its
maiden flight. It seemed like a weird way to toss in the towel. But
perhaps no weirder than the notion of selling furniture, lighting
and accessories, sight unseen, via the Internet, which is what our
business proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Just nine months earlier, I had been startled from my normal
life by a headhunter who read a free &UR; - &LR; lance article I wrote for
The New York Times about buying furnishings on the Web. To research
it I'd spent two months surfing the Web, and that was all it took
to make me a kind of world expert in a brand-new sector of
e-tailing then being promoted as the next great bonanza, a
multibillion-dollar market. By January, I was creative director of
the company, overseeing a creative team that was putting together
the visual design of our Web site, along with the company's logo
and even its gift wrap.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived in November, our competition, sites like
GoodHome.com, HomePortfolio.com and Furniture.com, were already
well out of the gate. But the group of Israeli software developers
who founded the company along with the Lauder brothers, who run the
Estee Lauder Cos &UR; . &LR; , promised that we would eclipse the competition
with superior technology, which they were building. Our Web site
would be chock-full of bells and whistles like streaming video
interviews with famous designers and 3-D tools that would let
customers take their sofas for a virtual spin before purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But our competitors already do this, some of us whispered. Our
proprietary technology is superior, the software developers, who
all seemed to have ties going back to their service as Israeli
military officers, assured us.
</P>
<P>
   We studied our competitors' sites like entomologists. No detail
was left unpinned, untweezed and unitemized. We recruited a staff
of dozens to create images and text for our site that would rival
the glossy shelter magazines we had formerly worked for. We sent
columnists to Milan, Italy, and Tokyo, photographers to shoots in
lovely estates in Bedford, N.Y., and sleek lofts in Manhattan. We
set up our own state-of-the-art digital photo studio in our offices
in the Starrett-Lehigh Building.
</P>
<P>
   Starrett-Lehigh is a 19-story fill-the-block warehouse, stark
and vast with 15-foot-tall lofts. Around every floor are multipane
glass window walls. (Look closely, and you'll see them as a
backdrop in many fashion magazines and catalogs.) The photographers
who enjoyed this once-cheap-to-rent outpost (hence the ubiquitous
J. Crew backdrop) were mostly chased out by the building
management. The new tenants were style-oriented dot-comers like
Screaming Media, ibeauty and Martha Stewart Omnimedia, who made it
the place to be in Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The awesome views jazzed my many late nights. I was surrounded
by the glittering Hudson river-scape from the George Washington
Bridge to the Statue of Liberty. One night I realized I could pick
out most of my resume in the skyline: the statuesque Hachette
Filipacchi offices at Broadway and West 50th Street, the New York
Times Building tucked behind the Disney development on 42nd Street,
and the headquarters of Ian Schrager Hotels, aglow like a
lighthouse in Hell's Kitchen every night till exactly 11.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Our warrens of wobbly Ikea desks were almost always gritty to
the touch from drywall dust that wafted in each night from a
renovation project down the hall. Starrett-Lehigh folklore: the
Marthas (as anyone associated with Martha Stewart was known)
planned to drive golf carts through their vast offices. Martha
herself would drive her Range Rover door to door from her new farm
in Katonah and into the building by way of the truck-size freight
elevators.
</P>
<P>
   I found that I could save time, and have fun, by riding my desk
chair like a skateboard to get around in our 7,000-square-foot
space. The young women down at ibeauty rode those shiny chrome
scooters to the bathrooms, which are a block away down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   The two halting elevators functioned like a vertical Main
Street. As you stopped at a floor, you'd find the citizens to-ing
and fro-ing, as if from central casting: hopped-up and pierced-out
programmers, teams of 27-year-old venture capitalists dolled up in
Prada, everyday-is-casual chief executives, impossibly tall and
dour teen-age girls on their first go-sees, lost Urbanfetch
messengers packing Haagen-Dazs pints (the Breakfast of Champions
after start-up all-nighters).
</P>
<P>
   Where did all that adrenalin in Starrett-Lehigh come from? It
was all about the options. We were all thinking options, the stock
option plans you just cannot get out of your mind, no matter how
hard you try. The hard-knock lesson: options mean nothing if you
crash and burn.
</P>
<P>
   What to call yourself is a big deal for dot-coms. You want
something earthshaking, nothing off the rack. In four months our
name changed three times, from C2Buy to IBELLI to Posh&AMP;Sticks. This
decision was overseen by first the entire staff, then by a blue
ribbon panel that included branding experts and board members. The
time, talent and invention devoted to the name could have launched
a thousand ships. Or maybe one Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One night we had a book party in our photo studio for Marco
Pasanella's ``Living in Style Without Losing Your Mind.'' The
author rode his vintage Vespa in and parked it at the middle of the
room. A Tuscan chef roasted a suckling pig, which was displayed
with Old Testament flair, and Glenfiddich provided a steady stream
of old Scotch. It was a wonderful feast, all lighted with votive
candles that seemed to mirror the glittering Hudson below.
</P>
<P>
   There was trouble on the wind. The Nasdaq had recently gone into
its swoon. The date for our Web coming-out had been pushed back.
That night, colleagues mused about feeling like the roast pig. I
kept my game face. When I saw old friends from the shelter
magazines at the party, I invited them to my desk for a sneak
preview of our site on my monitor, to mostly rave reviews.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   But the ill omens were growing. Our visionary founding chief
executive had been sacked without warning in December, a month
after I was hired. Thereafter our investor-technologists would
surface in New York, jet-lagged after overnight flights from
Israel; they would attend meetings and pick brains, but clearly
they were the ones making the major decisions, not the replacement
chief executive, Vivian Behrens, who had been recruited after 20
successful years with Estee Lauder.
</P>
<P>
   The ad budgets were cut to zero. We'll get the word out with PR,
the technologists said. The site will not work on an Apple, we were
told, as if in an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the day the long-awaited proprietary 3-D software the
technology developers had promised arrived. It looked to us like
off-the-shelf software and was packed in a box marked California
Closets, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Umpteen variations on our business plan were written. Teams of
managers would return from investor pitch meetings empty-handed,
only to grind out another draft of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no one will say how much money has been flushed down the
e-toilet. We do know that scores of thousands of dollars are owed
to free-lancers. Part of the pain of failure is the knowledge that
my enthusiasm for the gold rush brought many of our creative people
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever went wrong wasn't unique to Posh&AMP;Sticks. The whole
home-furnishings sector of the Web has been in free fall, as
entrepreneurs face the cold reality of returned merchandise, the
difficulty of ordering and warehousing inventory and the reluctance
of manufacturers to undercut their longstanding retailers. Today
less than 1 percent of all furniture sales are made on the Web, and
whatever growth is possible will come much more slowly than first
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   We should have listened to our hearts, or common sense, the
instincts that tell you that building a brand from the ground up is
a tough sell when your only medium is a slow-mo, glitched-out home
computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days, colleagues straggled into the office dressed
either in shorts and flip-flops or in their interview best. It was
a decent gesture from management that we were allowed a staging
area for our job searches. Our Web master has joined the Marthas.
Dale, a store designer, is with Calvin Klein. Anita, our talented
style director, has returned to Elle Decor. When a member of my
team lands safely at a next job, I give a little cheer and a silent
thank you.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A pioneer ancestor of mine, Solomon Hockett, was part of a great
wagon train adventure west on the Oregon Trail. His family's wagon
was loaded improbably _ but perhaps no more so than a Web site
stocked with sofas _ with fruit tree seedlings from the Midwest,
which in time provided the orchards for an entire region.
</P>
<P>
   His exploits made for a great 1950s children's book, ``Tree
Wagon,'' which my children have enjoyed growing up with, and we
take a special delight in eating an Oregon apple or pear from the
market.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm old, I'll be able to tell the story of being a pioneer,
too, of the Great Gold Rush of 1999. I'll edit out the unsavory
parts about money, greed and naivete. But I'll remember the
elevators, the Hudson view and this silly T-shirt.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Toot-toot, change the tone
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The morning, after accepting his party's presidential nomination
and pledging to bring a new civility to the country, George W. Bush
and Dick Cheney, with hundreds of Republicans gathered at the
airport to see them off, went to Pittsburgh and began an air and
rail tour of key battleground states. Bush's ``Change the Tone
Tour,'' will take him through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and
Illinois. Bush said he needled his rival Al Gore in his acceptance
speech, but he denied it was unduly critical of the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   DID SOMEBODY SAY BIG OIL?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore ended a vacation week in the shadow of rival George W.
Bush and bounded back onto the campaign trail today. In the
unconditional embrace of 3,400 union firefighters in Chicago, Gore
mocked the Republican convention as a special-interests-sponsored
sham. ``This is Day One of the fight for working families,'' he
declared. Gore derided the confetti and fireworks of the GOP
convention, saying they couldn't mask Bush's allegiance to special
interests: ``Behind the flashing video wall is an agenda of rising
gas prices and smog-filled skies that is of Big Oil, by Big Oil,
and for Big Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   BETTER WITH BETTER HALF
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bush won't be doing much solo flying before the Nov. 7
election. The campaign decided to have George W. and his wife
travel together this fall, rather than separately to cover more
territory. Laura Bush has never been a particularly public person,
and although she dutifully traveled alone during the primaries, she
preferred to be on her husband's plane. In addition _ and perhaps
more importantly _ the governor seems to function better when she's
with him. Said Mark McKinnon, the campaign's media adviser, ``He's
just happier when she's there. ... We think he's better when she's
there.''
</P>
<P>
   FORD _ LIKE A ROCK
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say Gerald Ford is almost back to normal just three days
after a stroke. They said today he's walking and catching up on the
news. But they still don't know what's causing his tongue to swell.
His doctors say it could be trauma, an infection or a tumor. They
also say Ford will recover fully without needing rehabilitation
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   A FORD IN HIS FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Harold Ford Jr. (D-Tenn.) will be among three keynote
speakers at the Democratic convention the week after next. Ford,
30, the youngest member of Congress said that Al Gore asked him to
speak during prime time on Aug. 15, the second day of the gathering
in Los Angeles. Ford, a two-term congressman from Memphis, was a
member of a Democratic ``truth squad'' in Philadelphia this week.
His father, Harold Ford Sr., previously held the seat for 11 terms
and was Tennessee's first black congressman.
</P>
<P>
   BUT IKE ALWAYS SAID `NUCULER'
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has been known to stumble over words on occasion,
but having that happen during his big speech would not do. So the
script he read from a TelePromtTer screen took special care to help
him through one tricky word: nuclear. The script spelled it:
nuke-lee-er. It appeared to be the only word spelled phonetically
in the rolling script. During the New Hampshire primary campaign,
Bush spoke about the need for ``tackuler'' nuclear weapons instead
of tactical ones.
</P>
<P>
   CONVENTION OVER, JAIL TIME NOT
</P>
<P>
   A Philadelphia judge set a $1 million bail today for a protest
leader who police said instigated property damage during
sometimes-violent demonstrations surrounding the convention. John
Sellers, 33, a leader of the Berkeley, Calif.-based Ruckus Society,
was charged with numerous misdemeanors, including conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and disorderly conduct. Police singled out
as many as six leaders of activist groups, many of them
instrumental in disruptions at last fall's World Trade Organization
meetings in Seattle, and said 371 people have been arrested since
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S THE WAY THE CONVENTION BOUNCES
</P>
<P>
   It's crunch time for the Democrats. George W. Bush's lead over
Al Gore grew to 19 points today in a bipartisan Battleground Poll
of likely voters, 50-31 percent, taken Wednesday and Thursday. He
led by 11 points, 47-36 percent, among registered voters in an NBC
poll taken Thursday night. Bush often fares better in polls of
likely voters because of intensity of support and the voting habits
of Republicans. The Battleground Poll had a 3 percentage point
error margin; the NBC poll an error margin of 4.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   INSTANT ANALYSIS TRUE TO FORM
</P>
<P>
   The jury of pundits is still out on the long-term impact of
George W. Bush's acceptance speech, but it was well-received by 500
voters participating in the SpeakOut.com/MSNBC Internet instant
poll, says Democratic polling expert Peter Hart. Republicans
strongly supported the speech, giving Bush a good overall score of
79. Rarely did opinions drop below 75. With Independents, the marks
were mixed. Bush's overall score was 51, reflecting the average of
highs and lows with the group of voters who ultimately will decide
this election. The average score from Democrats was only 37.
</P>
<P>
   PROF SWATS GADFLY IN TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   By fewer than 900 votes, Jeff Clark, a Middle Tennessee State
business professor, squeezed a victory from maverick candidate John
Jay Hooker in the Senate Democratic primary. Only about 190,000
people voted in the race, which many thought would fall to the
political gadfly Hooker because of his name recognition: He has
lost elections in the state since the 1960s. Clark faces incumbent
Republican Bill Frist in November.
</P>
<P>
   NEW BUSH TAKES ROOT
</P>
<P>
   George P. Bush brought tears to the eyes of his father and
grandfather as he gave his first nationally televised campaign
speech at the GOP convention. The 24-year-old nephew of George W.
Bush (the son of Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and his Mexican-born mother,
Columba) spoke in English and Spanish about his mixed heritage,
telling the cheering crowd that if his uncle is elected president
he will look out for ``those of us whose faces look different.''
</P>
<P>
   ALWAYS A WAY TO BUY INFLUENCE
</P>
<P>
   When General Motors became the first corporation to voluntarily
stop writing large checks to political parties in 1997, the
automaker's executives sent a powerful message that they were
disgusted by the political culture of cash and influence. Since
then, GM has stuck to its pledge to forswear soft money. But all
this week, GM demonstrated that it has found other ways to curry
favor. GM provided 400 Cadillacs, sport utility vehicles and
minivans for use by convention organizers, part of a package of
``in-kind contributions'' that the host committee here estimated
was worth $1 million. And GM sponsored two lunch receptions at
different downtown locales.
</P>
<P>
   A GRAND OLD PARTY, LITERALLY
</P>
<P>
   After five days of lavish fund-raisers and corporate-sponsored
entertainment during the Republican convention, some participants
expressed concern that the grand scale of the partying may have
hurt the GOP's image. Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, a reform-minded
lawmaker who introduced Sen. John McCain of Arizona at the podium
on Tuesday, decried what he called ``these gluttonous parties, this
incredible show that we put on that almost forces everyone to
gobble as much shrimp and lobster as you can possibly inhale.''
</P>
<P>
   PART OF THE PARTY NOW
</P>
<P>
   The harsh message to homosexuals at the 1992 GOP convention was
find another party. Unwelcomed, unwanted, and enraged over Pat
Buchanan's vitriolic speech in Houston, a gay Republican
organization refused to endorse President Bush for re-election.
Now, however, the Log Cabin Republicans say Bush's son, George W.,
has lived up to his commitments: no prime-time gay-bashing from the
podium in Philadephia, modified anti-gay language in the party
platform, and a speaking slot at the convention to an openly
homosexual congressman, Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona .
</P>
<P>
   INCLUDE HER OUT, TOO
</P>
<P>
   During the roll call of states, New York Gov. George Pataki got
one of the lustiest cheers of the night when he worked in a dig
while casting his state's votes. He said that when Dick Cheney told
the crowd a night earlier that it was time for them to go, ``He
meant not just Bill Clinton and Al Gore, but Bill Clinton and Al
Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T PULL THAT STUFF IN MY TOWN
</P>
<P>
   Across the country in Los Angeles, the mayor of the city about
to host the Democratic confab broke into an angry tirade when a
reporter asked him about charges from community activists that his
convention plans ignored those living in poor neighborhoods near
the Staples Center convention site. ``For them to suggest that we
care more about people in Brentwood or Bel Air is a damn, damn
lie,'' Richard Riordan, a Republican, shouted, referring to two of
the city's more exclusive districts.
</P>
<P>
   RON JR. MOSTLY TUNES OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention tribute to his father wasn't exactly
required viewing for Ron Reagan Jr. ``I was driving to the market
and flipped on NPR and heard my father's voice coming out of the
radio,'' said Reagan, a Seattle resident who was in Philadelphia
briefly to moderate a panel discussion. He knew the tribute was
coming up, but didn't watch it on TV. ``It hasn't been the most
exciting convention,'' he said. ``I can be forgiven for going to
the market. The frozen food section is more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF SITE, OUT OF MIND?
</P>
<P>
   The GOP convention was wired to the hilt, but a new study
suggests that candidates for Congress still live in an offline
world. The survey, by the University of Pennsylvania's
Netelection.org project, found that 46 percent of congressional
candidates don't have a presence on the Internet. Senate candidates
fared better than their House counterparts, with 80 percent
maintaining campaign sites. House candidates logged in at 51
percent.
</P>
<P>
   AND ALL WE GOT WAS THIS LOUSY T-SHIRT
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution dispatched two political junk
collectors to the Republican convention of political junkies. The
mission of Harry Rubenstein and Larry Bird, curators at the
Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington,
was to procure memorabilia to add to the 90,000 objects already in
the museum's political history collection. Funny hat, catchy
button, screaming poster? You bet. Harry and Larry snagged them.
They left for home loaded with stuff.
</P>
<P>
   EVEN A KID KNOWS IT'S THE ECONOMY, STUPID
</P>
<P>
   Neil Bush, another son of the former president, recalled during
the convention how, four years ago, when his son Pierce was 10, he
asked him to list the greatest presidents.'' Pierce named George
Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. When Neil Bush
reminded the boy that he had left his own grandfather off the list,
the youngster looked up at him and said, ``Dad, what about the
economy?''

 &HT;    Moms believe in the power of prayer
 &HT;    By Khalid Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Just because school prayer has been deep-sixed by
the United States Supreme Court doesn't mean that parents can't
offer up a supplication or two.
</P>
<P>
   Moms in Touch International (MITI) is a group of mothers who
believe that prayer makes a difference. Individual chapters
consisting of of two or more moms meet once a week to pray for
their children and the schools they attend. Members believe that
prayer is a way to surround children with a spiritual presence even
while they're at school.
</P>
<P>
   LaVonna Beerf, Miami Valley coordinator for MITI, says the
campaign began in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organization started in 1985 when a mother with a burden
to pray for her two teen-age sons entering school sought out other
moms,'' Beerf said. ``Clearly the Bible tells us there is power in
numbers in our prayers, so through that burden Moms in Touch was
born. The movement is booming around the country and
internationally as well.''
</P>
<P>
   At their weekly, one-hour sessions, the mothers engage in
conversational prayer _ also called praying in one accord _
focusing their thoughts on their children, teachers, the school and
its administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first joined, my four friends and I agreed to attended
on the condition that we wouldn't be asked to pray out loud,''
Beerf recalled. ``But when we went, the Lord just moved on all of
us. It was never a problem from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   MITI is nondenominational. Meetings are held one hour a week at
members' homes. It's not a social hour so no refreshments are
served and groups are encouraged to start and finish on time.
Beerf's group prays for Beavercreek High School but there are MITI
chapters involving mothers of students at Alter, Fairmont, Dayton
Christian High School and Centerville High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an unsafe pickup procedure at Beavercreek High
School. The doors were open, kids came out and just ran through the
parking lot and jumped in any car,'' Beerf said. ``We prayed about
that and the next year there was a brand-new parking lot with new
procedures and ID tags. You would be amazed at some of the things
God has done through this format.''
</P>
<P>
   MITI is neither evangelical nor political. Networking is done
mostly through word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having a conversation with a friend about the challenges
kids encounter in the high schools today and the kind of support
they need,'' said Oakwood mother Susan Johnston. ``She suggested I
start a Moms in Touch group.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston had never heard of the organization so she did some
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I received the booklet that is given to each new member and I
read the background material. That's how I first became interested
in getting the program started in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston was quick to note that although her kids don't attend
Dayton public schools, that school system is never far from their
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We include the Dayton Public Schools in our prayers every
week,'' she said. ``One of our goals is to see groups evolve in
those schools that can fulfill the same goals that we have in our
community. We can see the need there is enormous and we are
interested in doing everything we can without being intrusive. To
increase the growth of groups in that area, we will come and talk
about what we do and help groups get started.''

FAMILIES THAT ROCK TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 6)  
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a glowing mid-July evening on the floor of Giants Stadium in
New Jersey, Derek Pedersen, 11, was settling in to enjoy his first
rock concert. Waiting for the show to start, he leaned shyly on the
shoulder of his mother, Leslie Pedersen, 43. But later, as the Dave
Matthews Band took the stage and built to a crescendo of rhythmic
guitar and violin, he climbed aboard his 21-year-old sister's
shoulders, threw his arms into the air and swayed rhapsodically
with the rest of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A few rows back, Emily and Glenn Blair, an obstetrician and
podiatrist, from Easton, Conn., were enjoying a similar musical
communion with their daughters, Madeline, 8, and Hillary, 15.
Although dressed as country club stalwarts _ he with linen shorts
and loafers, she with pearls _ they are rock concert regulars. This
was the third Dave Matthews concert the family had attended.
Enjoying the jazzy, soulful improvisations that have made the band
a favorite among today's college undergraduates is a bonding
activity, the Blairs say. ``On the way home in the car, we discuss
our favorite guitar riffs,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   The rock concert, once a raucous and often drug-filled rite of
initiation into American adolescence, is slowly becoming a family
affair. Parents of teen-agers and younger children _ ones who, in
their day, treasured concerts as escapes from the parental clutches
_ now want to share the experience with their own offspring. It is
increasingly easier to do this as the musical tastes of the
generations meld _ the 40-plus group of Americans now buy more rock
albums than those 15 to 24 _ and as concerts have been tamed by
commercial sponsors to be as clean as Broadway musicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely see that there are two generations that come to
see our shows,'' said Paul Tollett, of Golden Voice, a leading West
Coast concert promoter of acts like Rage Against the Machine and
the Red Hot Chili Peppers. ``Parents nowadays understand music that
their kids like, whereas parents 20 years ago would not have gotten
the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Sting, the singer-songwriter, who has been on and off the
touring circuit since 1976, says he has watched his audience grow
older with him, and expand to the next generation. ``I look out and
I see the baby boomers who have been with us since the '70s, and
now they have their kids,'' he said. ``It is very
multigenerational.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own home, he added, he has watched his six children, ages
2 to 24, discover music of previous decades on their own. His
9-year-old daughter, Coco Sumner, who is a budding guitarist, likes
to pick out tunes from Jimi Hendrix's ``Voodoo Child'' album. ``The
idea that music should separate the generations is a new one,''
Sting said. ``Historically, it used to bring everyone together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all bands have a sound that is so convivial or
that makes for family togetherness. Not a lot of moms and dads will
groove this summer to Eminem or the latest edition of Ozzfest, with
its hard-rock headbangers. The acts that the baby boomers grew up
with are the ones that are pulling in the largest mixed crowds.
This year, five of the top 10 largest grossing concert tours were
long-in-the-tooth acts like Bruce Springstein, Tina Turner and
Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash, according to Pollstar, a concert industry
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Kids sometimes attend such outings basically at the behest of
parents, who hope to pass on their own musical tastes. But in just
as many cases. children have been exposed to these favorites on car
trips or home stereos and have acquired a love of the artists all
their own.
</P>
<P>
   At a Santana concert at Jones Beach last week, two generations
of the Ramirez family gathered in the parking lot drinking beers
and blasting ``Supernatural,'' the artist's 1999 smash hit album,
from their van's stereo. Pepe Ramirez, 49, who recalls seeing
Carlos Santana at the Filmore East in 1969, said he and his
brothers played the music at all kinds of family gatherings,
beginning when the children were young.
</P>
<P>
   To prove the point, his niece Laura Benito, 23, hummed hit tunes
off the Abraxas album from 1970. ``This is the first time we've all
been to a concert together,'' said her brother, Antonio Benito Jr.,
``but we grew up listening to this music &UR; , &LR;  and I knew it was going
to be inevitable that this would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The concert industry does not keep records of fans' ages: It is
a business dominated by independent-minded impresarios, who judge
an act's popularity by the gut. Many performers, promoters and
recording executives say they have personally observed that
concerts become more multigenerational every year.
</P>
<P>
   This is not just classic rock nostalgia fueling the graying of
the scene. Although boomers do have a soft spot for the artists of
their youth, many keep current with music through VH-1 and radio,
and they are responsible, in part, for the success of younger
performers like Shania Twain, Macy Gray and Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing category of customers for rock albums is
those 45 and older, according to the Recording Industry Association
of America. This middle-aged group bought 24.7 percent of all CDs
last year, more than double the 11.1 percent they purchased in
1990. Meanwhile, young people from 15 to 24, widely perceived as
the big pop industry drivers, bought a significantly smaller share
of recordings than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Walsh, the vice president of marketing for the recording
association, attributed the shift partly to the Internet, which
allows busy working parents to shop from their desks. The fact that
a larger percentage of the general population is over 40 today than
a decade ago also affects the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who recall how their love of Janis Joplin or Jimi
Hendrix defiantly marked their differences from their own parents
now want to share music with their children, hoping it will bridge
the generation gap. At a Dixie Chicks concert last month at Radio
City Music Hall, none of the three members of the Perrucci family
there could remember whether it was Mary Perrucci, 46, or her
daughter Christine, 18, who first brought home ``Wide Open
Spaces,'' the band's platinum-selling 1998 album. But both parents
and daughter listen to the music at home, and Mary Perrucci said it
brings them closer. ``It gives us something fun to do together,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that parents see concerts as venues for family fun,
sometimes even for very young children, also, of course, speaks
much about the transformation of concerts themselves. ``Concerts
don't have the same rebellious nature,'' said Gary Bongiovanni, the
editor of Pollstar, who has been following the industry for many
years. ``It is a more conservative atmosphere these days. It's not
just that there are less drugs _ I mean, no one smokes
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bongiovanni also said that open concert seating, which was
common two decades ago and added to the anarchic nature of events,
has been replaced almost entirely with reserved seating. ``Before,
it was much more social,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Steen, director of marketing in the Northeast for
Delsner/Slater, the nation's largest concert promoter, says rock
concerts have become so commercialized that some now resemble Las
Vegas floor shows. ``The production of the shows, the lighting, the
sound, the amount of extras and dancers is greater than 10 years
ago,'' he said. ``There is more emphasis on preshow activity. There
is also a different level of expectations, especially from the
upper-scale demo. They want VIP areas and fancy boxes and corporate
suites.''
</P>
<P>
   Most rock concerts may no longer be bacchanalias, but they are
not Disneyland _ not yet. There can be drugs in the audience, or
explicit sexuality from the stage, but parents seem to take these
in stride. At the Dave Matthews Band concert at the Meadowlands, a
marijuana haze perfumed the air almost as soon as the sun went
down. Pedersen said 11-year-old Derek did not really notice.
``Besides, my feeling is that kids are going to be exposed to it
anyway,'' she said. ``I am really strict, and I'd rather be around
to explain what is happening if they have questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the lewd antics and graphic lyrics that bothered
previous generations of parents slide more easily off this
generation's back. At the Dixie Chicks concert, Clare Ryan, 33, and
her husband, Kevin, 34, brought their three sons _ John, 5, Liam,
6{, and Danny, 9 _ each of whom had a Norman Rockwell crew cut and
a clean-scrubbed face. Ryan said the kids loved the music but had
questions about a song called ``Goodbye Earl,'' about an abused
wife who plots to kill her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked why Earl has to die,'' Ryan said. ``And I explained
that if you grow up and hit your wife, you might deserve to get
killed. And they accept that.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most mysterious part of the intergenerational
phenomenon is why teen-agers seem to accept their parents' company
at rock shows so easily. Many used the word ``cool'' to explain
their feelings about their parents' presence at the kind of event
once framed as a pageant of youth rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation: With the average price of concert
tickets skyrocketing _ up 30 percent in the last year, to $43.63,
according to Pollstar _ bringing Mom and Dad means there is always
someone ready with a Visa card.
</P>
<P>
   There are other conveniences, as well. Zoe Reid, 18, and two
teen-age friends didn't seem to mind that Zoe's father, Gerald
Reid, 51, was sitting next to them at the Dave Mathews concert and
passing the time with a hand-held computer. ``What do you think
about Gerald being here?'' Zoe asked her friends. ``He's cool,''
one replied. ``And besides, now we have a ride home.''

NO KIDDING: DOES IRONY ILLUMINATE OR CORRUPT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
 By CHARLES McGRATH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One person who was glad when ``Seinfeld'' ended was Jedediah
Purdy. He is also, no doubt, eagerly awaiting Bart Simpson's
retirement. Purdy is the home-schooled West Virginia wunderkind who
last year, at the age of 25, published ``For Common Things,'' an
earnest, impassioned homily that urged us to rediscover civic
virtue, both in government and in our private lives, and that
blamed for our current malaise nothing less than irony itself.
</P>
<P>
   Irony, he wrote, is a corrosive, world-weary habit of mind, ``a
quiet refusal to believe in the depth of relationships, the
sincerity of motivation, or the truth of speech _ especially
earnest speech.'' He singled out Jerry Seinfeld, ``irony
incarnate,'' as a symbol of all that is wrong with our culture, but
he could have just as easily chosen Bart or, for that matter, Dave
Eggers.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers, of course, is the public-schooled Illinois wunderkind
who this year, at the age of 29, published ``A Heartbreaking Work
of Staggering Genius,'' a memoir about the death of his mother and
father, eight years before, and about how he became, in effect, the
single parent of his 8-year-old brother.
</P>
<P>
   From its title to its cheeky acknowledgments (``The author
wishes first and foremost to acknowledge his friends at NASA and
the United States Marine Corps''), to its own reader's guide to the
book's themes and metaphors, to the very last page, which is a
parody of Molly Bloom's soliloquy, ``AHWSG'' is suffused with
jokeyness and self-awareness _ with a refusal to take its own
enterprise seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is also a deeply affecting work, one that makes a
powerful, if unconventional, case for that most Purdyian of values,
family togetherness; and it succeeds not in spite of its antics _
all the authorial winking and nudging _ but to a large degree
because of them. The ultimate irony, you could say, is that Eggers'
wise-guy approach allows him to invest his book with insight and
genuine feeling.
</P>
<P>
   So is irony a bad thing or a good thing? It depends, in part, on
what you mean by ``irony,'' which has become a critical term of
nearly infinite elasticity. We use it all the time (especially in
the adverbial form) to refer to strange or untoward coincidence, as
in ``Ironically, just hours after rescuing the cat from a tree,
Jedediah ran over it by mistake in the pickup.''
</P>
<P>
   Or we use it, as counseled by The New York Times Manual of Style
and Usage, among other authorities, chiefly to indicate sarcasm, as
in: ``Dave looked down at the mangled, lifeless feline. `Nice cat,'
he said ironically.'' (As the Times manual wisely points out, if
the sarcasm is effective, the adverb is often unnecessary.)
</P>
<P>
   Etymologically, ``irony'' comes from the Greek word for
``dissembling,'' and the ancient Greeks used it in reference to
that abiding preoccupation of theirs, the gap between appearance
and reality, or between truth and belief. What interested them most
was dramatic irony, which is what occurs when the reader or the
audience knows something that a character doesn't (Oedipus was the
favorite example); far from being funny, this was for the Greeks
the stuff of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction between audience and character was also
essential for the critic Northrop Frye, who in his magisterial
``Anatomy of Criticism'' (1957) included irony in his taxonomy of
essential narrative modes: Irony for Frye is what happens when the
character is in some way inferior to the reader, who then looks
down on the work, so to speak, and sees the poor character
embroiled in scenes of bondage, frustration or absurdity. (The
great ironic author in this sense is Kafka.)
</P>
<P>
   Frye comes closer to our everyday understanding of the term in
his discussion of the ironic persona, which is essentially a kind
of literary straight man; the ironist pretends to be ignorant of
everything, Frye says, even of his own irony. The classic example
here is the Swift of ``A Modest Proposal,'' who says one thing and
depends on his audience to conclude the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Irony in this sense is a rhetorical strategy for suggesting
things you don't want to come right out and say directly, and it's
a strategy of particular use in oppressive or censorious
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Irony is what keeps Hamlet going, for example _ he's the Dave
Eggers of medieval Denmark. And irony was for a time the preferred
(and often necessary) method of Eastern European writers like
Vaclav Havel and Milan Kundera. This is the kind of irony that was
in the mind of the Hollywood movie mogul who said, ``Irony is what
goes over the heads of the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   But irony in Purdy's sense is something different _ less a way
of conveying hidden meaning than of undermining meaning altogether.
Irony for him is an attitude _ a bad attitude.
</P>
<P>
   And Purdy is right in suggesting that this particular kind of
attitude has its roots in television and in the political
disillusionment of the 1960s. (Though he doesn't say so, a telling
early example of the Purdy-Eggers split manifested itself during
the 1969 trial of the Chicago Eight. The Jedediahs _ Tom Hayden and
Rennie Davis _ wanted a serious debate on the nature of civil
disobedience; the Daves _ Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin _ wanted to
make fun of the entire proceeding.)
</P>
<P>
   Irony in this latter-day incarnation consists largely of
indicating that you are in fact being ironic. It's a way of putting
invisible quotation marks around speech or action, the way Willis,
the terminally ironic protagonist of David Gates' novel ``Preston
Falls,'' does. (Whenever he mentions his office ``colleagues,'' for
example, he's careful to precede the word with a meaningful
half-beat of hesitation.)
</P>
<P>
   This kind of irony also relies heavily on repetition and
allusion. The first time Chevy Chase fell down, on the original
``Saturday Night Live,'' it was slapstick; every week thereafter it
was ironic.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same is true of Dave Letterman's various shticks; as
Purdy suggests, the joke is at the expense of some hypothetical
audience _ rubes and squares, or maybe people just awakened from a
coma _ that could possibly take late-night television seriously or
expect anything new from it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What troubles Purdy about this kind of irony is that in its
extreme forms it can lead to alienation and indifference; it can
become a substitute for action, and even for thought, and amounts
to a passive acceptance of things as they are. In the view of some
of his critics, though, what's troubling about Purdy's prescription
is that the society he envisions is apparently one that makes very
little room for humor _ for laughing at those things that cannot be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   And earnestness, in its extreme form, requires that language
itself be purified, scrubbed of all its puns and double-entendres
and hackneyed associations _ until, for example, you could use the
phrase ``a heartbreaking work of staggering genius'' with a
straight face.
</P>
<P>
   In Frye's view, irony is a late and somewhat degenerate form.
(It comes after, and is inferior to, myth, romance and both high
and low realism.) But Frye's scheme is also a circular one, in
which irony sometimes comes around to myth again. Clowns, he says,
are just sacrificial gods in another guise. And perhaps this is
where we are headed: to an irony of cosmic, mythic proportion.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we now have Jedediahs and Daves all around us _
in art, in business, even in politics: Anselm Kiefer and Jeff
Koons; Bill Gates and Paul Allen; Al Gore and George W. Bush. One
set of these prophets is telling us to please get serious; the
other to lighten up, dude. They would never admit it, but they
probably need each other.

By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underneath the carnivalistic send-up of the fertility industry
that dominates Lisa Loomer's play ``Expecting Isabel'' is a sweet
and very knowing story about a husband and wife who simply want to
have a child.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. I think I may have that backward. Take 2.
</P>
<P>
   Behind a husband and wife's desperate quest to become parents,
Lisa Loomer's play ``Expecting Isabel'' is a keen satire on the
fertility industry and the extreme lengths to which some people
will go to add the words ``mommy'' and ``daddy'' to their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, that doesn't sound right either.
</P>
<P>
   Satire? Drama? Burlesque? ``Isabel'' doesn't categorize easily.
It often feels like a couple of different plays with conflicting
agendas. Douglas Wager's production at the Mark Taper Forum is very
entertaining yet very puzzling. Are we expected to laugh until it
hurts or ache until we laugh? Both, I suspect. Such is this play.
And such _ Loomer contends _ is parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   That's Nick and Miranda Saracini's quest despite a lot of doubt
from both parties. They're a New York couple in their late 30s _
him a sculptor, her a greeting card writer _ middle class and very
much in love. Their Candide-esque parenting quest leads them
through the labyrinth of infertility treatment, support groups,
therapy and adoption efforts. What should be easy isn't, causing
Miranda's already fragile sense of self to crack. The action takes
place under a blue-gray cut-out New York skyline dotted with
fluorescence and a couple of product placement billboards and
designed by John Arnone.
</P>
<P>
   That Loomer can identify her targets and hit bull's-eyes as
skillfully as she makes us understand her characters is no mean
feat. But in this play, the task is unquestionably a balancing act
since characters are either satiric or real, rarely both. So often,
there seems to be no connection between Nick and Miranda and the
barrage of doctors, counselors, therapists and family members they
encounter. If our heroes are relatively normal people dumped into
extraordinary circumstances, everyone else is from Planet Oddball.
Or Planet Spoof.
</P>
<P>
   Take actor Fred Applegate, one of the six ensemble members who
collectively play something like 30 parts. Taking on Nick's stoic
father, New York's best fertility doctor, a gypsy cab driver and a
participant in a couple of support groups, Applegate is one of
these actors who can make you laugh just by walking on stage but
eventually we're laughing for no real reason. OK, what goofy
character is he this time? Ah, right, the quirky marriage
counselor. Got it.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a little unsettling when a character we've come to
accept as borderline wacky gets to deliver a rational speech, as
Applegate's fertility doc does: ``I view infertility as a human
disorder, just like any other. Why shouldn't we do whatever we can
to correct it?'' Less abrupt is a wonderful turn by Eileen Galindo
as a dignified Puerto Rican woman considering giving up her unborn
child for adoption. It's one of the few instances in this
production where an actor is allowed to play her role almost
completely straight, and Galindo nails it.
</P>
<P>
   So does Julie White, who brings a hint of Lucille Ball to
Miranda. The character starts the play with a monologue that verges
on stand-up patter, fires off most of the play's funny lines, wades
through farce and ultimately has to steer her way around a
breakdown. It's a tricky role, but White doesn't miss a turn, and
she never loses the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Also charismatic in a less well-written role, is Anthony
Crivello's Nick. Nick's a nice guy, an optimist who happens to come
from a loopy _ and somewhat cliched Italian family. He's the
grounded yin to Miranda's hormonal yang, and we're expected to like
him as well. Like White, Crivello's very good with the funny stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And the funny stuff is plentiful, even if director Wager doesn't
always know when to pull back. The temptation is understandable. By
taking on the parenting obsession and setting the action in New
York, Loomer aims for all the easy targets, and, yes, even at a few
that are less obvious. She's working with a great topic, one with
built-in recognition. After all, the play ends with the words ``Oh
my God'' _ a line that any parent _ current or hopeful _ will
recognize.  &QL;

   ARAFAT-ARABS (Cairo, Egypt) _ On the face of it, Arab support
for the Palestinian position has never been so seamless. Or so it
would seem as the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has
crisscrossed the Middle East to garner support from his
counterparts and build a defensive line for his position on a peace
deal with Israel. One after the other, Arab kings and presidents
have said they stand behind Arafat, no questions asked, as he holds
out for Palestinian sovereignty over Arab East Jerusalem and the
right of return for Palestinian refugees. But behind the
uncompromising public statements, more pragmatic approaches are
also being discussed seriously for the first time on those

   MEXICO-EVOCATIVE-SIGNS (Mexico City) _ The map of the world's
largest metropolis is a kind of literary masterpiece. The street
guide reads as if a writer from the school of magical realism had
translated the encyclopedia, cut his work into confetti and
sprinkled it over the city. This is a place where people live on
Heart and on Soul. They live on Forest of Light, Mirror of Water,
Forest of Miracles, Garden of Memories, Tree of Fire, Forest of
Secrets, Sea of Dreams. Surreal street names can reflect hard
realities: Work is long. Love and Happiness are short. Good Luck
crosses Hope, then hits a dead end. Intersections become works of
imagination: the Volga River flows into the Nile, Beethoven meets
Bach, the Himalayas cross the Alps. And Comprehension ends in
Silence. By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SINATRA-STATUE (New York) _ The Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy
got a spot on Times Square in 1936 for his heroics on the
battlefield and the streets of Hell's Kitchen. George M. Cohan
followed in 1959 as a tribute to one of show business' greatest
song and dance men. Mayor Rudy Giuliani says there is room for one
more, Frank Sinatra, whose last big hit, in 1980, was ``New York,
New York.'' But the hushed refrain playing around Times Square is
not so gushing or welcoming. No one really wants to say so, at
least not loudly enough to irk Giuliani or offend the Sinatra
family, but the plan to erect a statue of Ol' Blue Eyes on a
traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway has acquired some
powerful enemies. The local community board, along with some Times
Square developers, isn't crazy about the idea. And theater moguls
say the square's theatrical tradition would be shortchanged by
showcasing a singer and film actor who started in Hoboken, made a
quick splash at the Paramount Theater and then followed fame and
fortune west of the Hudson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When the Chicago Board of Trade opened for trading at
9:30 a.m., Earle Combs IV, known as Chip, was doing what he loves
to do _ jostling for position in the soybean pit with his arms
raised high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sell 200 at a half! Sell 200 at a half!'' he shouted into a
crowd of burly traders, as he tried to sell 200 soybean meal
contracts at $156.50. ``Sell 200 at a half!''
</P>
<P>
   Casting a glance to the left, he spotted a buyer in the crowd, a
man in his 40s wearing a trading jacket decorated with roulette
wheels. Their eyes met, and a nod from Combs completed the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was made virtually the same way that Combs' father,
grandfather and great-grandfather would have been done it _ by two
men winking and nodding across a frenzied trading pit, then
recording the sale on index-sized trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it's been done here for more than 150 years,''
said Combs, 41.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, more efficient and accurate computerized
trading is threatening to wipe out Chicago's 19th-century trading
pits, just as it did in London last year. Some experts say, the
demise of the ``open outcry'' method of trading _ the shouting and
flashing of hand signals into a trading pit _ might doom the
exchange itself.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a century and a half of dominating the sale of
commodities, beginning with corn and soybeans, and expanding to
include products like futures on Treasury bond prices, the Chicago
Board of Trade, the nation's oldest derivatives exchange, can no
longer lay claim to also being the world's largest. That honor
belongs to Eurex, a fast-growing fully electronic market in Germany
that was created only two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Board of Trade remains a force in the United States
futures market, industry experts say the exchange's reluctance to
adopt computer technology and its stubborn defense of face-to-face
pit trading may be its undoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they adapt in the next 18 months, it's over,'' said
Richard L. Sandor, who helped introduce financial futures at the
board in the 1970s. ``This is the endgame; this is not the opening
or middle game. They have to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   New rivals are moving quickly to introduce their own electronic
trading systems. Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs are part of a
group of Wall Street firms that are planning to go head-to-head
with the Board of Trade by creating computerized systems that they
say will sharply reduce trading costs. Independently, Cantor
Fitzgerald, the huge bond-dealing firm, also wants to grab a share
of the electronic futures market.
</P>
<P>
   The rivals' chief target is financial futures, a
multibillion-dollar marketplace where investors buy and sell
futures to hedge against a shift in the value of stocks, bonds and
currencies. Industry experts say screen-based trading is more
efficient and can reduce or eliminate the need for a trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Chicago Board of Trade, which opened a new
60,000-square-foot trading floor three years ago, is facing its
biggest challenge. And because control of the exchange rests
largely with a group of agricultural traders who favor the
auction-like style of open-outcry trading, exchange leaders have
had to confront some difficult choices.
</P>
<P>
   If the exchange adopts a fully electronic trading system _ and
it is inching in that direction, offering experimental computer
trading and starting a joint venture with Eurex _ members fear that
it could doom the open-outcry system, eliminating the jobs of
thousands of people who have staked their careers on face-to-face
buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Board of Trade insists on continuing to do most of
its business through pit trading, the exchange could be outflanked
by a fledgling electronic rival in the United States futures
market.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened in Europe in 1998, after the Eurex
electronic trading system in Germany went head-to-head with LIFFE,
the London financial futures exchange, which operated with a giant
trading floor. The results: business dried up for LIFFE, which just
a few years ago was Europe's biggest futures exchange, and it was
forced to abandon its trading pits in favor of computer trading.
</P>
<P>
   In France, Matif, the derivatives exchange that is a unit of the
Paris bourse, tried to offer both electronic and open-outcry
trading in April 1998. Two months later, most trading migrated to
computers and the trading floor was shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floor trading is dead,'' says Benn Steil, a senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations. ``It's not going to be pretty,
but it's going to happen in a short, sharp shock. That's what
happened in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways echoing Matif's approach, the Board of Trade would
also like to offer both types of trading. The Board plans to split
itself in two: one company offering traditional floor trading and a
competing one devoted to electronic trading. The exact framework of
such a split is unclear, however, and will require a vote of the
membership.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange has also vowed to make its operations more
efficient, by moving orders into the pits via computers, rather
than by using legions of clerks and ``runners'' who have long
crowded the exchange floor.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the floor operates essentially as it did a
century ago. Clerks and runners take orders by phone, dash to
deliver them to traders in the 1,200-square-foot octagonal pits,
return with messages to the brokerage stations. The floor is
littered with paper: orders, erroneous trade tickets, lunch orders.
</P>
<P>
   It is as inefficient as it is colorful. There are more clerks
than traders; many sit around reading papers and gossiping during
trading lulls.
</P>
<P>
   When a trader sells, he might catch an eye, a nod, a tap from
someone agreeing to buy. They record each other's badge acronym and
the size of the trade. But there are frequent mistakes. Every
morning, traders gather in a lobby just off the floor to check
``out trades'' _ transactions that did not match up the previous
day.
</P>
<P>
   The financial trading floor, where futures on interest rates are
traded, is more automated. But no derivatives exchange in the
United States is as paper-heavy as the Chicago Board of Trade, and
none have been as late to the game with technology.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of electronic trading say it ends the need for a
trading floor and all that it requires: clerks, runners, security
officers booths and so on. An electronic system, they note, simply
posts and matches all prices and automatically clears and
distributes the information.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the board's delay in implementing technology is the
membership's longstanding reluctance to change the floor, or to
alter an environment and a trading style that has worked for
generations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Giving up the old way will not be easy for traders, many of whom
are the second, third or even fourth generation of their family in
the pits. Chip Combs' family, for example, is in its third century
of working at the Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Combs' great-grandfather, Earle M. Combs, bought a membership in
1898, when the Board of Trade was largely a marketplace for farmers
to sell their corn and soybeans. His grandfather, the second Earle,
worked through the Great Depression. And his father, Earle III, was
a soybean trader for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other people here, Chip Combs and his father say they
never intended to work the floor. It just sort of happened. Earle
Combs III, now 70 and retired, says he first tried to be a
photographer. But when his father's partner died in 1952, he came
to the floor and immediately fell in love with the business.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, Morse code was used to relay trades, grain
prices were still listed on a chalk board and the exchange was
largely a gentlemen's club, a place where members would enjoy a
cigar on the edge of a pit after completing a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Combs and his younger brother Rick followed their father to
the floor. Rick didn't stay long, though. He left to become a
salesman after a man for whom he was working committed suicide
during a nasty market downturn. Chip, after briefly considering
working as a banker, was eventually bitten by the trading bug and
had a more auspicious start.
</P>
<P>
   He was, after all, Earle IV, the nicknamed ``chip'' off the old
block. And while he says he felt no pressure to come to the Board,
he grew up surrounded by the lore of the industry. As a boy, he saw
images of the Board everywhere. At home, his father kept a large
piece of marble that once rested inside the foyer of the old Board
of Trade building, which was demolished in the 1920s. Later,
vacations were spent at a log cabin in Wisconsin that his father
had built in the shape of a trading pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I'd come down with a big trading jacket with sleeves
down to the floor and my father would put trading cards in my
pocket,'' he recalled. ``Standing by the pit, he seemed to know
everyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chip Combs started trading in the pits, colleagues joked
that he would be a natural. It was all in the genes, they said. He
recalled someone saying: ``Oh, you're Earle Combs' son. All you
have to do is stand next to him in the pit. If he goes this way,
you go that way.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 16 years, he has made a good living on the floor.
He commutes each day from Barrington, Ill., about 40 miles
northwest of Chicago, where he lives with his wife, Karla, and four
children. He gets to the office at 7 each day. Between 9:30 a.m.
and 1:15 p.m., he trades in the soybean meal pit, speculating on
futures in the way that a day trader speculates in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   His edge, he says, is being able to read the market by knowing
the pit: the faces, gestures, positions and idiosyncrasies of
people on the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, he commuted by train with his father, and they
swapped trading stories. But now that his father is retired, he
comes in alone, sometimes pondering whether there will still be a
trading floor when his children come of age.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall in his office is a portrait of Chip with his father
and his 7-year-old son Marty, actually Earle Martin Combs V, now
14. Marty and his brother Matthew have both made the ritual trip to
the floor in long-sleeved trading jackets. Their father and
grandfather have already offered lessons in how to fill out a
trading ticket.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Chip is concerned about the edge he would lose if
the floor closed; if it did, he would probably have to move to the
computer. He loves the energy of the floor, the emotion and the
culture. He loves being part of a daily drama in which billions of
dollars are funneled through a group of frenzied traders. He loves
the rush of making a great trade.
</P>
<P>
   The pit is filled with personality and families. Most of the
agricultural pits are populated by second- and third-generation
traders.
</P>
<P>
   The genealogy of the trading pits even includes David A.
Brennan, 42, the chairman of the Board of Trade _ and the man
charged with moving the exchange forward in these perilous times.
From time to time, Brennan still works the agriculture pits with
his 77-year-old father and three brothers. His grandfather was on
the floor at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The corn pit may have more families than any other. There are
the Murrays, the McBrides and Andrew Flakus, a 23-year-old clerk
who aspires to trade alongside his father and two brothers. There
is John Pietrzak, a 44-year-old man with frayed vocal cords who
followed his father and his grandfather into the pits, after
working as an accountant. There is Ted Dangles. When he retired as
a clerk at another exchange at 76, his son Angelo, a trader in the
agriculture pits, got him a job as a runner; today, at 89, he still
scampers across the trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   The floor, however, is no longer confined to men. Mary Guth, who
has worked at the exchange for 25 years, followed her father and
her brothers there, as did her two sisters. After graduating from
journalism school, Kelly A. King joined her father, Richard King,
known as Whitey, in the corn pit, where they now trade side by
side.
</P>
<P>
   Many traders cannot explain exactly what attracted them. They
mention the adrenaline and the camaraderie _ the sense of community
and family _ and even the danger. Visitors can sense the energy
while watching the scene, hearing the voices in the crowd, the
sounds of friendship that pass beneath the din of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember coming down here as a boy and liking it,''
said Terry Cullerton, a third-generation trader. ``I guess I
thought it was thrilling; this was exciting. It got your blood
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no official figures, people on the floor say
traders' annual earnings often run well into the six figures, and
that many make millions of dollars a year speculating; it's the
kind of money that dazzles the young clerks, many of whom are high
school and college age.
</P>
<P>
   ``My girlfriend works in the bond pits and her boss made $12
million last year,'' said one clerk pacing the agriculture floor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, there are about 100 high-energy traders in the
corn pit. They say they love the crowds and the sounds there,
including the gong that signals the opening of trading. Many also
love the hours, which let them head home by 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Many are skeptics when it comes to electronic trading. There are
some things that a computer cannot do, they say. Chaotic as the
current system appears, they note that it has worked for
generations. ``This is something that cannot be replicated
electronically,'' said Jacob J. Morowitz, a longtime soybean
trader. ``On the computer it's a single file, and the thing is much
more susceptible to being dominated by the bigger players.''
</P>
<P>
   They also worry about the cost. One day a few weeks ago, Whitey
King stepped out of the pit holding a copy of The Chicago
Sun-Times. A small article said the Board of Trade was planning to
spend $100 million over the next decade on trading technology.
</P>
<P>
   Some members are already grousing about higher fees they would
have to pay to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to pay for that?'' King said, pointing to the
article.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, though, many people here know that the computer is
coming. They fear that they will not be able to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have talents, they might be minimized on the screen,''
says Jeff Nicolaus, a trader in the corn pit. ``It might become how
fast you can press a button. Sometimes here, opportunity is
location, location, location. You won't find that on a computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a theory here that these bodies down here are
lubricants; it's a whole different style of trading on computer.
People go upstairs and they miss the feel of the pit; there's
emotion here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned his back and jumped into the pit to execute a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some traders are making the transition. John Pietrzak is
trading overnight on Project A, the Board's modest attempt at
electronic trading. Terry Cullerton's sons, Terry Jr. and Jaime,
both in their '20s, are also trading after-hours on Project A,
preparing for the time when everything may be electronic.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chip Combs, many people here know that something has to
happen. Even if the floor survives, everyone knows that it won't be
the same; it's too antiquated.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure couldn't have come at a worse time. With volume
down 9 percent this year, in part because the federal government is
selling fewer Treasury bonds, the Board of Trade has now fallen
into third place among derivatives exchanges in Chicago, behind the
Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Baldwin, a legendary bond trader here, quit a few months
ago after 20 years on the floor. He earned millions by trading up
to 5 percent of the pit volume. But in recent months, that activity
has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing in the bond pits just wasting my time,'' he
said in a recent interview. ``I'm definitely leaving the bond pits.
I'm trading Nasdaq stocks. I'm staring at a computer screen right
now. This is where it's at now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing bad times ahead, Merrill Lynch decided last January to
close its agricultural futures operation and vacate a prime spot at
the exchange's landmark Art Deco building.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the times, that space is now being rented by
Yestrader.com, a high-technology start-up run by a former pit
trader who is developing trading software for those who want to
make the leap into the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Trade is making its own leap by forming the
alliance with Eurex. The Board will scrap Project A later this
month and use Eurex technology to allow traders to sell futures
online. But some members worry that the exchange is already far
behind. Instead of investing heavily in technology a few years ago,
the board spent $182 million to build the giant trading floor that
opened in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with talk about trading floors around the country being
shuttered, the Board is trying to cut costs and pay down a mounting
debt load.
</P>
<P>
   Les Rosenthal, a former head of the Board of Trade, says the
exchange erred in building the new trading floor and in failing to
develop its own technology. But it made another mistake, he said,
in failing to team up with its sister exchanges in Chicago, a move
that he said would allow the three big exchanges here to share
technology and back-office expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is survival time, and they're doing it all the wrong
way,'' he said. ``The basic plan should be the Merc, the CBOE and
the Board should be united on a single plan. But they'd rather make
alliances with people overseas than across the street. They're
going on these divergent paths and they're all going to end up
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago _ long considered a center of innovation _ still has a
chance, the experts say. After all, it was the city that created
the concept of financial futures and exported it to the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Sandor said Chicago could be saved by a resilient, risk-taking
set of people.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Melamed, the former chairman of the Merc and the man
credited with introducing financial futures, says the members must
wake up to the fact that new opportunities can come from
technology, including a larger pool of investors and online
traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who want open outcry are looking at the back end of
the telescope because they've made money in the past,'' Melamed
said. ``But the past doesn't hold a candle to what's going to be
made in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The message may be getting through to the pits. There was talk
one late July day about more traders taking computer courses. While
few think that the floor will disappear in the next few months,
many are looking ahead by trading online through Project A _
learning the language of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   For Chip Combs, that means getting up at 3:45 a.m. to trade in
the after-hours market. He is beginning to get a sense of a wider
market waiting to be tapped through the keyboard _ albeit
reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   In the office, he and his father agree. The history of the floor
is great, the elder Earl said, but it may just go the way of the
buggy whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses can't succeed on nostalgia,'' he said, pondering
the floor's fate. ``If it's electronic, so be it.''

 &HT;    Fastest pitcher in baseball never made it to the majorsBy Jack
Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fastest pitcher in baseball was Steve Dalkowski.
</P>
<P>
   A Baltimore farmhand phenom, Dalkowski signed with the Orioles
in 1957. He never reached Class AAA but was part of baseball lore
by his release in the mid-'60s.
</P>
<P>
   Dalkowski was stocky, just under six feet tall, and was
nicknamed ''Moon Man'' for the thick, round eyeglasses he wore.
Dalkowski came out of Connecticut with a reputation as a high
school left-hander who routinely struck out 17, 18 batters a game
and walked perhaps as many. In a word, wild.
</P>
<P>
   John Schuerholz, who broke into baseball in 1966 with Baltimore,
remembers hearing tales of a tiny ballpark in Bluefield, W.Va. When
Dalkowski pitched, the fans who usually sat behind home plate moved
to safer seating. Supposedly, Dalkowski once had thrown a pitch
right through the chicken-wire backstop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit a grand slam off of him,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was playing for Reno in the California League in 1960 when
he faced Dalkowski's Stockton team. Reno manager Tom Saffell had
strict rules when Dalkowski pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to take two strikes before we could swing at him,'' Cox
said. ''He had walked the bases loaded and was ready to strike me
out for the fourth time.'' Somehow, Cox homered.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could throw a bullet from one foul line to the other,''
said Cox. ''It was hilarious watching guys trying to catch him,
(to) warm him up in the Cal League where the lights went hiss,
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves bench coach Pat Corrales faced Dalkowski in 1962 in the
Eastern League. ''I didn't want to go to the plate. He was stupid
wild,'' Corrales said. ''I didn't do nothing against him. Didn't
want to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Ted Williams, who stepped into the batter's box one
spring training to get a closeup look at Dalkowski's fastball.
After one heater, Williams put down his bat and announced he would
face Dalkowski only in a real game, when he had to.
</P>
<P>
   Most Orioles wouldn't face him, either. The club could not help
him develop control, but fans still flocked to see Dalkowski pitch,
sometimes approaching after games merely to touch his golden left
arm.
</P>
<P>
   One legend had it that Dalkowski tore off a batter's ear with a
fastball. In another, a heater supposedly broke an umpire's mask
and put the ump into the hospital for three days with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the Orioles tried to measure such speed. Even though
Dalkowski had pitched the night before, gone out afterward to
celebrate and had been throwing for 40 minutes on flat ground, he
clocked at 93.5 mph. The consensus was that if he had been pitching
at peak form and on a mound his fastball would have exceeded 110.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams never had to face him in the majors, and neither
did anyone else. Dalkowski did not make it. After his release, he
drifted to California and wound up a migrant farm worker.

MAJOR REORGANIZATION FOR UNILEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Unilever PLC, the global consumer goods giant that has
been on a buying spree in the United States, announced a major
reorganization of top management Friday. The move would split the
company into two divisions, one focused on food brands like Lipton
Tea and Ragu spaghetti sauce and the other on consumer products
like Dove soap and Elizabeth Arden cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement revived speculation among analysts that the
company, which has this year acquired Bestfoods, Slim-Fast and Ben
&AMP; Jerry's in the United States in a quest for growth, planned a
full split into two companies. But, as it reported a
higher-than-expected 7 percent rise in second-quarter profit, the
company denied that it was taking its reorganization that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a precursor to splitting Unilever, it is a
realignment of the business bringing the strategic and operational
functions closer,'' Mike Haines, a company spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   The split into two divisions capped a relatively fast-moving
series of changes at the sprawling, cumbersome giant. Unilever's
ability to change course has often been compared to that of a
supertanker.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, the company announced a $5 billion program to slash
10 percent of its 250,000 global work force, close 100 factories
and winnow its 1,600 brands down to 400 top sellers.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later it began a series of acquisitions in the
United States, committing a combined $2.6 billion in a single day
in April to acquire Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade and Slim-Fast Foods,
before sealing its $20.3 billion takeover of Bestfoods in June. The
Bestfoods deal was its biggest acquisition ever.
</P>
<P>
   By adding Bestfoods brands like Knorr soups and Hellman's
mayonnaise, Unilever hoped to strengthen profitability to catch up
with rivals like France's Danone SA.
</P>
<P>
   The organizational changes at Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch
corporation with headquarters in both Britain and the Netherlands,
will not affect the positions of Unilever's co-chairmen, Niall
Fitzgerald in London and Anthony Burgmans in Rotterdam, the company
and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But, formalizing a de facto division of responsibilities, they
will oversee two new divisions run by Patrick Cescau, currently
chief financial officer in charge of food, and Keki B. Dadiseth,
former head of Hindustan Lever, a separately traded Indian
division. Dadiseth will head a home and personal-care products
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are putting people in charge of these categories with
much more clout than ever before,'' said David Lang, an analyst
with Investec Henderson Crosthwaite. The division between food and
home and personal care products, he said, is a traditional
``fault-line'' at Unilever, which has tried several experiments in
its management line-up over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts generally welcomed the second-quarter rise in
profitability, some expressed reservations about the company's
ability to absorb a major management shake-up at the same time it
is coping with its cost-saving measures and a string of
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Haines, the company spokesman, said the management
reorganization would begin in January ``and will happen
progressively in the course of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Unilever's changes made a full split of the
company into two new companies less likely, said Lang at Investec.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have got such a huge agenda to put together _ the
acquisitions and then to sort out their brand portfolio _ that
stripping out at this stage seems premature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the acquisitions of Slim-Fast and Ben &AMP; Jerry's
had contributed to increased second-quarter profit, while the
Bestfoods acquisition had yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   It said profit from operations rose to 768 million euros, or
$695 million, compared with 715 million euros one year earlier,
ahead of analysts' forecasts. The company's operating margin, with
one-time costs, grew to 13 percent from 11.8 percent in Europe and
to 9.8 percent from 9 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 3 percent to 10.9 billion euros, but most
significantly, the sales of its top brands _ the 400 on which it
wants to build its future _ rose 6 percent, with much of that
coming from acquisitions, the company said. Some analysts said the
better-than-expected figures reflected one-time circumstances and
would be hard to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   The higher-than-expected profit gain still trailed Danone, which
had recently reported a 12.6 percent increase in first-half profit.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever's share price closed at 4.31 pounds, or about $6.45, on
the London Stock Exchange, up 1 percent.

 &HT;    Garden wears the footprints of many grandkids
 &HT;    By Trish Widdows
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ We didn't know what it was called or
even exactly what we sold, all we knew is we had a flower shop and
it was the best flower shop anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As kids, my older sister Kristi and I ran the shop together out
of our grandparents' back yard of lush green grass, trees of all
kinds, vegetables, berries, and most striking of all _ flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent hours in that garden,'' Kristi remembered. ``Time
stood still when we were out there.''
</P>
<P>
   We spent many afternoons walking along the garden paths talking
to our imaginary customers about the different flowers that were
available.
</P>
<P>
   We would take the longest routes possible, opening and closing
as many gates as possible, pulling our carts behind us full of our
customers' flowers.
</P>
<P>
   One of our favorite places to take customers was into our
freezer _ which was actually the dog kennel _ for the fresh flowers
we carried.
</P>
<P>
   When we tired of walking around, we would ring up our customer
at our cement cash register and send them on their happy way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of our customers were imaginary, except for our
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Gram always had a pitcher of ice-cold lemonade waiting for us,
along with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   I remember drinking lemonade and talking with Gram while
swinging slowly on the big wooden swing that still hangs from an
old ash tree. I can still see her sitting there.
</P>
<P>
   Now I love to sit on that same swing and remember the annual
leaf parties in the fall with my cousins, the massive Easter egg
hunts in the spring, the family barbecues with homemade ice cream
and the badminton games where the cable wires that ran above the
yard were out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This yard has seen many grandchildren's feet,'' said my
granddad, Bill Widdows. ``The grandchildren always had the run of
the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Our 14 feet covered the yard all right, and we all have many
memories contained in the flowers and trees that stood by watching
us grow up.
</P>
<P>
   To Jennifer, the paths along the flowers were her very own
secret garden, where Gram would help her pick pansies for a
bouquet.
</P>
<P>
   Dan remembers Granddad lighting fireworks out of a pipe near the
basement door in hopes of scaring an unsuspecting child,
``regardless of whether it was the Fourth of July or not, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff thinks of the times when he and Granddad would pull carrots
out of the ground on Thanksgiving Day. Granddad would save a second
crop of carrots for the fall and winter, when he would bury them
under the warmth of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   April and Jennifer used to twist the swings around each other
and fly through the air, being careful not to hit the big ash tree
nearby as they unwound.
</P>
<P>
   All of us grandchildren have launched ourselves off the swing
into a pile of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   We have all swung with a push from Gram or Granddad.
</P>
<P>
   I used to swing after a bad day at school. The swing is still
one of my favorite places to regain perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The swing was used, and the grass paid the toll.
</P>
<P>
   For 40 years, the round patch of dirt under the swing was the
only blunder in my grandfather's carefully groomed yard.
</P>
<P>
   By now the grass has long since grown back over the patch.
</P>
<P>
   As the youngest grandchild left in Grand Junction for several
years, I have intentionally tried to drag my feet under the swing
to keep the grass from covering over the patch, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The patch was a part of the yard, just as much as the beds of
flowers, rows of vegetables, the rose garden, the raspberries along
the back fence that were made into jam each summer, the birdbath,
or even the swings themselves. It represented that grandchildren
had been there, family had been together, and all was well because
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comfortable place,'' my aunt Jane said,'' a place for
family.''
</P>
<P>
   The yard may have been the perfect backdrop, but all my cousins
would agree that Gram and Granddad are what made it so special for
each of us.
</P>
<P>
   We were just lucky enough to have the perfect back yard _ and
grandparents _ to grow up with.

AN AMERICAN TAX CONSULTANT IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG _ The two Russian tax inspectors, armed with bad
attitudes and an aging book entitled ``Tax Instructions,'' glared
menacingly across the dimly lit courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Facing them, fresh out of the University of Colorado and
equipped with laptop computers and a database of Russian tax law,
was James Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   For Beatty, who was helping his Russian partners defend a client
fined for tax evasion, it was his first experience before a Russian
judge.
</P>
<P>
   They won the case, and Beatty, now 30 and a six-year veteran of
Russia's turbulent business world, has never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty is considered to be among the top tax consultants in St.
Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, the go-to guy when it is
time to do your books. His is one of the most challenging jobs in
Russia: helping foreign businesses navigate a notoriously corrupt
and complicated tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Among his 50 or so clients have been such corporate giants as
Shell Oil, Caterpillar Inc., and the household goods company SC
Johnson &AMP; Son Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where tax evasion is a national pastime, Beatty not
only helps companies pay their punishingly high taxes without going
broke, he helps them to do so without breaking the law. And if they
have to, Beatty and his legal staff are prepared to defend clients
in court.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls his first court case, against poorly equipped tax
officials, with an easy smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real shock to me,'' Beatty said. ``They were not
really up on the law, and their argument was basically, `We are the
tax inspectors _ and we are right,' sometimes yelling this.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Russian tax law, Beatty's clients say, he is as
good as any Big Five US accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is without a doubt the most informed tax expert among
expatriates working in St. Petersburg,'' said one client, Douglas
Boyce, director of the Lomonosov Porcelain Factory. ``He just knows
the material so well.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of South Haven, Mich., Beatty arrived in Russia in
1994, right after earning a degree in accounting and international
business. He interned with a St. Petersburg-based audit firm called
ALCO, one of the first in Russia. He studied Russian and quickly
mastered the country's complex tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the early, optimistic days of Russian capitalism.
Scores of small Western businesses were setting up shop in St.
Petersburg, hoping to cash in on what was then seen as one of the
world's most promising emerging markets. With his growing knowledge
of Russia's tax system, Beatty spotted a business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that there were a lot of small foreign businesses who
needed help with their Russian taxes,'' he said. ``There was a
niche in the market, and I saw an opportunity to gain experience,
help the development of business in Russia and, of course, make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   He approached ALCO's director, Dmitry Mikhailov, with a business
proposition: Why not form a partnership, with Beatty bringing in
foreign clients? Beatty then founded a tax-consulting firm called
Emerging Markets Group, or EMG, which works with ALCO.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is littered with failed joint ventures between Western
and local partners, but the EMG-ALCO partnership has prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the keys to my success in Russia has been the
partnership with Dima and ALCO,'' Beatty said. ``We completely
trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty said that, contrary to Russia's ``Wild Wild East''
reputation, it is possible to do business honestly _ if you are
smart enough.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he offered one of his methods for helping clients
to circumvent Russia's payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Before recent changes, Russia's income-tax system punished
employers for paying ``high'' salaries. A company paying a worker
$1,000 a month, for example, was liable for a payroll tax of about
40 percent. In addition the employee had to pay 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for an employee to take home $700 a month _ a high salary
by Russian standards _ an employer had to pay out $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   One way around the dilemma, Beatty said, was to exploit a
provision in the Russian tax code _ intended for self-employed
individuals, such as hot dog vendors _ and register a company's
entire payroll as so-called ``private entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of income taxes, registered private entrepreneurs pay a
one-time annual fee of about $500. And since the private
entrepreneurs are technically ``consultants'' and not employees,
companies using them are exempt from payroll taxes. Companies can
also deduct wages paid to consultants, as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in Russian tax law that go into effect next year
establish a flat 13 percent income tax and significantly reduce the
payroll tax. Beatty applauded the changes, and added that he would
continue working to help businesses make money in Russia _
honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to break the law,'' he said. ``You just need to
find the loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty, who has turned down offers from top accounting firms,
declined to say how much money his business makes. Down the road,
he plans to pursue a master's degree in business administration,
but in the short run he is content to develop his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main ambition at this point is to keep growing my
business,'' he said.
</P>

CHINA CRITICIZES U.S. FOR GRANTING VISA TO TAIWAN'S LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China criticized the United States Friday for
giving Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, a visa to stop in Los
Angeles next week on his way to the Caribbean and expressed
indignation at the island's annual effort to join the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing's reaction in both cases was moderate compared to
the diatribes that similar actions by Taiwan have drawn in the
past. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government urged the United States to reverse its
decision to allow Chen the transit stop on Aug. 13, saying the
``comfortable treatment'' sends the wrong signal to
pro-independence forces in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if these transit stops have happened many times before,
it does not mean we like that,'' a spokesman for the Chinese
embassy in Washington said. ``We are sure that this will be used by
the Taiwan side to promote their agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   When former President Lee Teng-hui visited Cornell University in
1995, Beijing broke off semiofficial contacts with the United
States and began conducting war games that culminated in firing
missiles into the sea near Taiwan. Beijing's temper flared again
when the United States granted Lee a transit visa in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman said granting Chen's stopover is
part of a long-standing U.S. policy toward Taiwan's leaders. He
said Chen would not meet any U.S. officials, although he will meet
Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, which
handles unofficial U.S. ties with the island.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan also angered China by making a fresh attempt to join the
United Nations, saying 12 allies had submitted a proposal asking
the world body to grant membership. Taiwan makes the attempt every
year and is each year defeated. Although this is the first such
effort under Chen's administration, there is no reason to expect
this bid to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move constitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter, a distortion of the nature of the
U.N. and a gross interference in China's internal affairs,'' a
spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhu Bangzao, said in a
statement carried by the state-run New China News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine countries recognize the diplomatically isolated
island, mostly poor countries in Africa, Latin America and the
Pacific. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was the
sole country in the world excluded from the United Nations. Taiwan,
formally known as the Republic of China, lost the China seat in the
United Nations to Beijing in 1971.

JOBS SLOWDOWN SEEN AS SIGN OF COOLING ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 108,000 fewer Americans were working in July, the US
Department of Labor reported Friday. It was the first decline in
payrolls in more than four years and strong evidence the nation's
breakneck growth has moderated.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the payroll shrinkage can be explained by last month's
layoffs of temporary workers who were hired to collect US Census
data, a one-time event that bloated the jobs data in preceding
months.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the 2000 Census, however, there was continued
weakness in hiring, beginning in May and continuing into summer.
</P>
<P>
   The private sector added a total of about 138,000 new employees
in July. That was substantially below the 200,000-a-month pace in
the final months of 1999 and early this year, said John Youngdahl,
senior economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The layoff at Census was totally predictable, but the
private-sector employment growth has moderated substantially since
the beginning of the year,'' Youngdahl said. ``That (private-sector
slowdown) is what people need to focus on, in terms of what the
report is telling us.''
</P>
<P>
   A clear downward trend in the pace of job creation calmed
economists' fears that the nation was continuing to experience
blockbuster growth, which the Federal Reserve worries would spark
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Such fears were renewed by a recent report that the economy
posted 5.2 percent growth in the first quarter, an acceleration
from 4.8 percent growth in the prior quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Slower job growth is not necessarily good for workers _ the
jobless rate among blacks and Hispanics is no longer declining, for
instance _ but economists say it eases concerns about the economy
overheating. That virtually eliminates the need for the Federal
Reserve to again raise interest rates to rein in the economy and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has increased rates six times since it began a campaign
in June 1999 to slow the economy. The Fed board that sets monetary
policy meets again Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an unsustainable pace of growth in the economy in
1999,'' said Fred Breimyer, chief economist for State Street Corp.
in Boston. The July jobs report, he said, ``makes it unlikely the
Federal Reserve would tighten'' the money supply by raising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The nation, though, continues to enjoy the spoils of a
record-setting economic expansion that began more than nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not since January 1996 has the Labor Department reported a
shrinking in total nonfarm payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   And in July, the US unemployment rate was unchanged, at 4
percent. The Massachusetts rate was 2.6 percent in June, the most
recent figure available.
</P>
<P>
   But a weaker job market dovetailed with other signs of slowing,
particularly in the housing and retail sectors. Economists
attributed the surge in second-quarter growth in part to higher
inflation, which padded the figures, and to a surge in workers'
productivity, which means the existing labor force can produce more
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the financial markets sighed with relief at the moderate
job gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite index, after a rocky week, rose 27.48, to
3787.36. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of blue chip stocks
posted a fifth day's gain, rising 61.17 to 10,767.75.
</P>
<P>
   After a blockbuster first quarter, job creation slowed sharply
in May and became more sluggish each month. In June, for example,
about 30,000 total nonfarm jobs were created, according to a
revised estimate by the Labor Department, which had reported that
payrolls expanded by only 11,000 in June. In contrast, January
payrolls expanded by 349,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're holding in place,'' Breimyer said. ``The demand and
supply of workers is in balance, so there's no additional
tightening of the labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the private-sector slowdown in hiring was partly
masked by the Census Bureau's hiring, which peaked in May, with
about 618,000 temporary workers on the government's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Job growth in July was tepid or nonexistent in most industries
in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the traditionally strong services sector, which has
driven the economic expansion, shrank by 1,000 jobs in July _ a big
change from gains in service jobs of 97,000 a month, on average,
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other sectors performed slightly better, notably manufacturing,
which added 46,000 jobs last month. The financial industry also
expanded payrolls, the Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time since the begining of the year that
we've seen an increase'' in manufacturers' payrolls, said Walter
Marshall, a senior Labor Department economist. It was largely due
to gains in hiring by makers of electronic components, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Marshall described July's job growth as ``modest.''

KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR THESE OTHER WORTHWHILE INVISIBLE-MAN-THEMED
MOVIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to Hollywood's recent infatuation with
invisibility, there's actually a great deal more than meets the
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Verhoeven's special effects-laden thriller ``Hollow Man,''
which arrives this weekend and stars Kevin Bacon as a brilliant
scientist driven mad by his irreversible invisibility, along with
the Sci-Fi Channel's new ``Invisible Man'' series, starring Vincent
Ventresca, are just the latest in a long line of
now-you-see-him-now-you-don't projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Sci-Fi Channel show is actually the third of its kind,
following a 1958 British series and a short-lived 1975 series from
writer/producer Stephen Bochco starring David McCallum.
</P>
<P>
   Larger screen efforts have been more successful, although widely
varying in quality. Some are terrific _ Universal's original
adaptation of H.G. Wells' novel ``The Invisible Man'' is still the
best. Some are mediocre _ ``Invisible Mom,'' ``Invisible Dad'' and
``Invisible Kid?'' And some are just pathetic. I'm still trying to
forget the unapologetically crass ``The Invisible Maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the transparent titles available on video that
we think are still worth, uh, seeing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Invisible Man'' _ Director James Whale's initial Wells
adaptation remains the best of the invisibility subgenre. Whale's
signature black humor, and dynamite performances from leads Claude
Rains and Gloria Stuart, are enough to make it worth a look, but
John P. Fulton's groundbreaking effects work (this was 1933!) is
dazzling to this day. A new special edition DVD hits shelves Aug.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Invisible sequels: Universal followed the Whale film with four
sequels, none nearly as good, but still fun in their own right.
They were ``The Invisible Man Returns,'' starring Vincent Price in
1940 (the best of the sequels); ``The Invisible Woman'' with John
Barrymore and Virginia Bruce in 1941; the ``Invisible Agent'' with
Jon Hall and Peter Lorre in 1942; and ``The Invisible Man's
Revenge'' with Hall and John Carradine in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man'' (1951) _ This
1951 film was one of the better efforts in the
Bud-and-Lou-Meet-the-Monsters series, with great effects and Arthur
Franz as an invisible prize-fighter. New video edition hits shelves
Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Amazing Transparent Man'' _ This almost forgettable 1960
low-budgeter featuring a mad scientist who turns a convict
invisible to steal materials for him is worth seeing if only
because of its Dallas connection. Much of the film was shot on
location at the Texas State Fair using the futuristic exhibits as
backdrops. It arrives on video Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memoirs of an Invisible Man'' (1992) _ John Carpenter's
predictable spy thriller featuring Chevy Chase as a securities
analyst accidentally rendered invisible is worth seeing only for
its vast amount of special effects. It's disappointing to think
what Carpenter's exceptional horror instincts might have brought to
the picture if he hadn't decided to play it for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Invisible rarities: You probably won't be able to find any of
these titles at local video emporiums, but they might be worth
searching the bootleg bins for. The 1957 Mexican film ``El Hombre
Que Logro Ser Invisible'' (dubbed ``The New Invisible Man'' in the
States) is a loose adaptation of ``The Invisible Man Returns,''
with Arturo de Cordova pulling a disappearing act to solve a murder
he didn't commit. ``The Invisible Dr. Mabuse'' from 1961 stands out
as one of the best of the Mabuse series, with the evil doctor using
an invisibility formula to help take over the WORLD!

AN AMERICAN TAX CONSULTANT IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG _ The two Russian tax inspectors, armed with bad
attitudes and an aging book entitled ``Tax Instructions,'' glared
menacingly across the dimly lit courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Facing them, fresh out of the University of Colorado and
equipped with laptop computers and a database of Russian tax law,
was James Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   For Beatty, who was helping his Russian partners defend a client
fined for tax evasion, it was his first experience before a Russian
judge.
</P>
<P>
   They won the case, and Beatty, now 30 and a six-year veteran of
Russia's turbulent business world, has never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty is considered to be among the top tax consultants in St.
Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, the go-to guy when it is
time to do your books. His is one of the most challenging jobs in
Russia: helping foreign businesses navigate a notoriously corrupt
and complicated tax system.
</P>
<P>
   Among his 50 or so clients have been such corporate giants as
Shell Oil, Caterpillar Inc., and the household goods company SC
Johnson &AMP; Son Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where tax evasion is a national pastime, Beatty not
only helps companies pay their punishingly high taxes without going
broke, he helps them to do so without breaking the law. And if they
have to, Beatty and his legal staff are prepared to defend clients
in court.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls his first court case, against poorly equipped tax
officials, with an easy smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real shock to me,'' Beatty said. ``They were not
really up on the law, and their argument was basically, `We are the
tax inspectors _ and we are right,' sometimes yelling this.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Russian tax law, Beatty's clients say, he is as
good as any Big Five US accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is without a doubt the most informed tax expert among
expatriates working in St. Petersburg,'' said one client, Douglas
Boyce, director of the Lomonosov Porcelain Factory. ``He just knows
the material so well.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of South Haven, Mich., Beatty arrived in Russia in
1994, right after earning a degree in accounting and international
business. He interned with a St. Petersburg-based audit firm called
ALCO, one of the first in Russia. He studied Russian and quickly
mastered the country's complex tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the early, optimistic days of Russian capitalism.
Scores of small Western businesses were setting up shop in St.
Petersburg, hoping to cash in on what was then seen as one of the
world's most promising emerging markets. With his growing knowledge
of Russia's tax system, Beatty spotted a business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that there were a lot of small foreign businesses who
needed help with their Russian taxes,'' he said. ``There was a
niche in the market, and I saw an opportunity to gain experience,
help the development of business in Russia and, of course, make
money.''
</P>
<P>
   He approached ALCO's director, Dmitry Mikhailov, with a business
proposition: Why not form a partnership, with Beatty bringing in
foreign clients? Beatty then founded a tax-consulting firm called
Emerging Markets Group, or EMG, which works with ALCO.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is littered with failed joint ventures between Western
and local partners, but the EMG-ALCO partnership has prospered.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the keys to my success in Russia has been the
partnership with Dima and ALCO,'' Beatty said. ``We completely
trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty said that, contrary to Russia's ``Wild Wild East''
reputation, it is possible to do business honestly _ if you are
smart enough.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he offered one of his methods for helping clients
to circumvent Russia's payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Before recent changes, Russia's income-tax system punished
employers for paying ``high'' salaries. A company paying a worker
$1,000 a month, for example, was liable for a payroll tax of about
40 percent. In addition the employee had to pay 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for an employee to take home $700 a month _ a high salary
by Russian standards _ an employer had to pay out $1,400.
</P>
<P>
   One way around the dilemma, Beatty said, was to exploit a
provision in the Russian tax code _ intended for self-employed
individuals, such as hot dog vendors _ and register a company's
entire payroll as so-called ``private entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   In place of income taxes, registered private entrepreneurs pay a
one-time annual fee of about $500. And since the private
entrepreneurs are technically ``consultants'' and not employees,
companies using them are exempt from payroll taxes. Companies can
also deduct wages paid to consultants, as business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Changes in Russian tax law that go into effect next year
establish a flat 13 percent income tax and significantly reduce the
payroll tax. Beatty applauded the changes, and added that he would
continue working to help businesses make money in Russia _
honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to break the law,'' he said. ``You just need to
find the loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty, who has turned down offers from top accounting firms,
declined to say how much money his business makes. Down the road,
he plans to pursue a master's degree in business administration,
but in the short run he is content to develop his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main ambition at this point is to keep growing my
business,'' he said.

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR MOVES TO REGULAT DOT-COMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHUCK FINNIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, responding to
outcries over gentrification of the city's working-class
neighborhoods, is moving to bring dot-com developments firmly under
stringent growth-control regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's proposal would impose a moratorium on the
developments in the Mission District. Elsewhere, developers wishing
to convert old warehouses and industrial sites for use by
technology companies would need to go through special hearings and
possibly accept extra conditions to receive permits, sources
familiar with the plan said.
</P>
<P>
   It would specify that all dot-com developments be treated as
office construction, ending a loophole through which developers
sought approval for their projects by dubbing them manufacturing,
research and development or business services facilities, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's proposal, therefore, would mean dot-com developers
would have to abide by the city's 950,000-square-foot cap on new
office construction in any given year and compete for approvals
under that limit with builders of conventional office buildings,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a framework for a proposal that is being evaluated by
people who have previously given opinions to the mayor on this
topic,'' said Emilio Cruz, Brown's economic development chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comfortable the proposal will not hamper the ability to
grow economically and create jobs, while at the same time help to
meet community and social goals.''
</P>
<P>
   In various ways, the mayor's proposal borrows from an initiative
that growth-control and affordable-housing advocates hoped to get
on the ballot in November or December as well as from alternatives
recommended to Brown by business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Haaland, a tenant activist working on the initiative
drive, said he didn't think Brown was going far enough to regulate
the economic forces driving up real estate prices and driving out
old-line businesses, nonprofit social services and cultural groups,
and longtime residents.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative being pushed by growth-control and
affordable-housing advocates contains bans on dot-com and other
office development in the Mission, Potrero Hill and South of
Market, and a moratorium for Bayview-Hunters Point pending
completion of a planning study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be extremely surprised, if Potrero Hill, SOMA and
Bayview-Hunters Point are left out, that there would be support
from our coalition,'' Haaland said of the mayor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Romero, of the nonprofit Mission Housing Development
Corp., said it would be a mistake to accept a compromise that
provides only partial relief to one neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rise and fall in coalition,'' he said. ``We won't break
ranks to protect our small corner of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Business representatives, who had been urging Brown to craft an
alternative to the proposed initiative ordinance, applauded the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like an excellent recommendation,'' said Mara
Brazer, president of the San Francisco Partnership, a
business-oriented nonprofit economic development group.
</P>
<P>
   Developers and technology-industry advocates opposed subjecting
dot-com projects across the board to office building growth
controls, saying many software, Internet and digital technology
companies and multimedia firms are similar to manufacturing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe all dot-com is office,'' Brazer said. ``But
as long there's enough room for growth of new business and emerging
technologies, in appropriate neighborhoods, then I could live with
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is application of Proposition M, the city's 1986
voter-approved office building growth-control ordinance, to the
dot-com industry. Prop. M capped new office construction at 950,000
square feet a year.
</P>
<P>
   A reaction to the high-rise construction of the late 1970s and
early 1980s, Prop. M provided for ``banking'' allowable
construction from years of low demand for use in years of high
demand.
</P>
<P>
   In hot markets such as today, office developers compete in
``beauty contests'' for the right to build and can be forced to
shelve their plans until room is available under the Prop. M cap.
</P>
<P>
   Both the initiative ordinance by growth-control and
affordable-housing advocates and the proposals from business
interests called for more office construction by exempting certain
large projects, such as the planned federal government office
building at Seventh and Mission streets, or Lucas Films campus
planned for the Presidio.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's proposal, which sources said is being tweaked,
adopts that approach. In addition, it would exempt from the Prop. M
cap office buildings planned at Catellus Development Corp.'s
Mission Bay and redevelopment proposals before The City for Hunters
Point Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for exempting Mission Bay and the shipyard is that
both projects would include housing - priced at and below market -
as well as schools and other public resources.
</P>
<P>
   The changes being contemplated must go before voters because
they would amend Prop. M, which passed with 51.3 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has until Aug. 9 to draft a final proposal and place it on
the ballot Nov. 7, or he could wait and call a special election in
March.

   COKE-BIASCASE _ Attorneys for plaintiffs in the Coca-Cola racial
discrimination lawsuit will be back before a federal judge Friday.
A legal team headed by Florida attorney Willie Gary is trying to
get the judge in the case to compel another team headed by
Washington attorney Cyrus Mehri to turn over its files on
plaintiffs who left Mehri to be represented by Gary. The judge may
rule. (This battle is unrelated to the $1.5 billion suit Gary has
filed against Coke on behalf of four women employees.) (Rankin,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   HDEPOT-SUIT _ Home Depot has agreed to pay $500,000 to a New

   FBN-COWBOYS-MILES _ TOKYO _ Dave Campo calls it a business trip.
The Dallas Cowboys have not gone to Japan to sample Far East

improving a football team that hardly resembled world-beaters in
their preseason opener. ``This is what I call a real road game,''
Campo said, referring to the American Bowl game against the Atlanta
Falcons Saturday night at the Tokyo Dome. The Cowboys had better
get used to traveling. No team will fly more miles this season than
the Cowboys, the unofficial ambassadors of the NFL. Including
preseason, the Cowboys will travel 31,020 miles. Seattle is second
with 30,218 and San Francisco third at 29,928. By contrast,
Tennessee travels a league-low 8,498 miles. Dallas will always be
among the NFL leaders in travel miles, partly because they have an
owner who likes to market his team around the world. (Cantu, Austin

&HT;     ALASKA AIR GROUNDS 18 MD-80 PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alaska Airlines has grounded 18 Boeing MD-80
airliners to further inspect the planes' jackscrews _ a part
implicated in January's crash of San Francisco-bound Flight 261
that killed 88 people off the Southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   The move forced Alaska to cancel five flights Thursday at San
Francisco International Airport, along with 15 in other airports.
Oakland and San Jose airports were not affected, but they and San
Francisco could experience cancellations or delays Friday and
possibly through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Alaska told the Federal Aviation Administration on
Thursday that it would immediately start to inspect jackscrews on
18 of the 34 MD-80s in its 92-aircraft fleet through Saturday, said
company spokesman Don Conrard.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, like other carriers, has focused on jackscrews
since the crash.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent test, it found that a tool made in a company machine
shop could - if positioned improperly - produce different
measurements than if tools manufactured by Boeing were used.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers are allowed to use manufacturers' tools or an
equivalent, although it is now unclear whether the tool used by
Alaska - called a il,6p6,13l restraining fixture - was an
appropriate substitute, Alaska and the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The jackscrew assembly consists of a nut that rides up and down
a screw. It drives an airplane's horizontal stabilizer up and down
and limits its range of travel.
</P>
<P>
   The restraining fixture unloads the pressure on the horizontal
stabilizer and holds it in place so a measurement of the space
between the thread on the jackscrew and the nut that holds it in
place can be taken, Conrard said.
</P>
<P>
   In side-by-side tests using both company and Boeing restraining
fixtures, no discrepancies were found, Conrard said, but inspectors
saw the possibility for error. He stressed that the difference in
the tools may not have had any impact on the MD-80s.
</P>
<P>
   The machine-shop tool was used on the 18 grounded planes, and
was also used on Flight 261, Conrard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up to the U.S. attorney's office and the (National
Transportation Safety Board) to determine if this tool is a problem
in their investigation,'' Alaska Airlines President Bill Ayer said
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 MD-80s in the Alaska fleet that were not grounded were
tested with the Boeing tool, Conrard said, and thus do not need to
be inspected again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the possibility (of a discrepancy) exists, we're erring
on the side of caution,'' said Conrard, who added that the
company-made tool will no longer be used.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA praised on Thursday the voluntary inspections as ``the
right thing`` and went further, asking that all other airlines that
fly MD-80s determine what fixture tools have been used, and ensure
they made proper measurements.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it was notifying foreign operators, and that DC-9s
are also affected. The NTSB is investigating the issue with the
help of the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no indications of other problems, but in the
interests of safety the FAA will direct that other carriers move
quickly to make certain that is the case,'' the FAA said. The
agency said it would have no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines Flight 261 plunged into the Pacific Ocean off
the California coast on a flight from Mexico on Jan. 31. The plane
was an MD-83 - an MD-80 variant.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal investigation into the crash focused on a mechanic's
decision not to replace a jackscrew assembly. The jackscrew had
been tested repeatedly and found to be nearly worn out, but was put
back into service after a second crew retested it a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the FAA announced that Alaska Airlines had made
sufficient improvements to continue maintaining its planes.
Earlier, the agency had given the airline seven days to make
changes and threatened to strip the airline of the right to perform
maintenance - a step that eventually could have grounded all its
planes.
</P>
<P>
   The Flight Standards Service division of the FAA said then that
regulators had ``serious concerns about critical processes,
including management effectiveness,`` after teams of inspectors in
Oakland and Seattle found almost 150 cases in which maintenance
required on Alaska aircraft couldn't be documented.
</P>
<P>
   Operations at the Oakland hangar have been the subject of a
criminal investigation by a federal grand jury in San Francisco
since 1998. There have been no indictments.
</P>

   Alaska urged travelers to check the status of flights through

   Alaska slowly is phasing out MD-80s, not because of safety

other advantages, Conrard said.

 &HT;    GORE'S STRATEGY: FIGHT THE ``RUSTED WAYS'' OF OLD GUARD
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the Republican National Convention is
history, Vice President Al Gore needs to counter its effects in two
main ways: Deliver an acceptance speech at the Democratic
convention that counters the style and substance of George W.
Bush's, and choose a running mate who compares well with Dick
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, it appears, the Gore campaign will try to
reinforce the vice president's pre-convention message _ that Bush,
the son of former President George H.W. Bush, and Cheney, who
served as defense secretary in the elder Bush's cabinet, represent
``the old guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his first campaign appearance after the conclusion of
the GOP convention, vowed to fight ``the rusted ways of the old
guard.'' He told 3,400 union firefighters in Chicago on Friday that
he would battle ``the big interests'' and ``powerful forces lined
up against'' working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is going to take the campaign straight to the working
people and make it clear whose side he is on in this fight,'' said
campaign aide Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   And campaign spokesman Chris Lehane, in comments about the
upcoming announcement of Gore's running mate, said the choice will
be someone who ``represents the future and not the old guard like
Bush's choice'' of Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to reversing Bush's lead in the polls _ 19
percent in the bi-partisan Voter.com-Battleground poll of 1,000
likely voters taken immediately after the convention _ Gore has the
task of stepping out from the shadow of the president he serves,
Bill Clinton, the man the Bush-Cheney campaign often speaks of as
if he were Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists see the acceptance speech as the time that Gore
becomes his own person, politically _ a point Gore made Friday with
a retooled campaign stump speech that mixed biting criticism of
Bush with warm autobiographical anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the confetti, fireworks and technical wizardry of the GOP
convention, Gore said, was ``an agenda of rising gas prices and
smog-filled skies that is of Big Oil, by Big Oil and for Big Oil.''
</P>
<P>
   And responding to Cheney's convention refrain _ ``It's time for
them to go,'' a line Gore used against the elder Bush in 1992 _
Gore said, ``Let me tell you what time it's not ... It is not
recession time in America like it was back in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   While touting the ``prosperity and progress'' of the last seven
years under Clinton's economic policies, Gore also said he would
offer ``a new vision for the future'' in his acceptance speech.
``I'll be talking about the new heights America can reach if we
stay on the right track and make the right choices today,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And although he has been in public office for nearly a quarter
of a century, Gore wants to use his acceptance speech in much the
way that Bush did his _ to introduce himself to American voters who
are just beginning to pay attention to the presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the American people know him particularly
well,'' said Gore media adviser Bob Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   With wife Tipper and daughter Sarah, one of his four children,
at his side Friday, Gore told the firefighters that he wants the
American people ``to know me for who I am.'' And in an interview
with CNN, he said, ``I'm running on who I am. I'm running as my own
man.''
</P>
<P>
   To further dramatize Gore's independence from Clinton, the Gore
campaign has arranged for Clinton to give his farewell address to
the convention on the day it convenes, then fly to a battleground
state in the Midwest for a symbolic ``passing of the torch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is scheduled to disclose his choice of a running mate
Tuesday in Nashville. The two will then campaign together nonstop
enroute to Los Angeles, where the Democratic National Convention
convenes Aug. 14 and where the party met in 1960 to nominate John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has tried to add drama to the vice
presidential selection process _ and thereby counter the post-GOP
convention ``bounce'' for Bush in the polls _ by floating the idea
of a ``wild card'' possibility, someone who has not been frequently
mentioned in press accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Gore family and his most senior advisers know the vice
president's thinking on who he regards as the best candidate for
the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's mention of a ``wild card'' caused considerable
attention to fall on former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's
lone challenger for the Democratic presidential nomination this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee General Chairman Ed Rendell, the
former mayor of Philadelphia, spent much of the week of the GOP
convention in his hometown promoting Bradley. And Gore strategists
in Nashville spoke glowingly of the amiacable meeting Gore and
Bradley had in Wisconsin last month, when Bradley announced his
endorsement of his former rival.
</P>
<P>
   The other six reportedly on Gore's list of possible running
mates are Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, Evan Bayh of Indiana and John Edwards of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt and New Hampshire Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen round out the list, along with what Gore said was
``an out-of-the-box possibility.''

BELGIUM WANTS TO STUDY SHEEP SUSPECTED OF BEING INFECTED

 (350 sheep is cq; a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA THESING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking a reprieve for more than 350 sheep condemned to death in
Vermont, the Belgian government requested Friday that the flocks be
returned to Belgium for further testing.
</P>
<P>
   The flocks _ containing about 50 animals exported from Belgium
in 1996, and their offspring born in the United States _ were
ordered destroyed in July after four animals tested positive for a
disease resembling bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Adriansens, agriculture consulate at the Belgian Embassy in
Washington, said Belgium and the European Union want the sheep
returned so scientists can conduct further tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The condition is from the European Union that the sheep can
come back for scientific purposes,'' he said. ``The conditions are
to send back the whole flock or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman ordered the flocks'
destruction July 14. A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the sheep
should be killed to prevent the possibility of contaminating
American farm animals or food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the USDA said the agency needed a few days to
review Belgium's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our folks would need some time to look at it and see
what makes the best sense,'' said spokesman Patrick Collins.
``We're continuing to negotiate with the flock owners. We'd like to
resolve this as quickly as possible and hopefully we can do so with
the families.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the agency might respond early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing the sheep slaughter has become something of a cause
celebre in Vermont, where a Save the Sheep campaign active during
court hearings portrayed government officials as thugs protecting
domestic trade interests. Supporters of the sheep have also
travelled to the farm of one sheep owner to feast on his family's
cheese products and visit the condemned animals grazing in nearby
pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The sheeps' owners remain hopeful that their flocks will avoid
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Faillace, daughter of East Warren flock owners Larry and
Linda Falliace, said her parents were unavailable for comment. They
were busy getting their passports renewed for a possible trip to
Belgium, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Faillace said her parents were excited about the idea of sending
the sheep back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would much rather do that than have them killed,'' she
said. ``We're going to try everything we can to have that done.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Freeman, who owns the remainder of the condemned sheep,
said he was partly responsible for the Belgian's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to find some way to prevent the sheep being
slaughtered,'' he said. ``It's in negotiation now. The two
governments are talking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adriansens said he had not been able to contact anyone at
the USDA about the request. He said USDA officials were scheduled
for meetings Friday and did not have time to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that they will have an answer but I don't know when or
what,'' he said. ``We made the request. Now we are waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Adriansens said the Belgians and other European scientists are
interested in the Vermont flocks because they represent the first
known instance of sheep testing positive for the illness without
their parents testing postive as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for scientific purposes, they believe it would be better to
avoid the slaughter of those sheeps at this moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The animals that tested positive for the sheep equivalent of mad
cow disease do not necessarily have the mad cow illness, American
scientists have said. But agriculture officials are concerned about
anything that might spread the feared disease, which killed 53
people in Great Britain in 1995, and nearly destroyed that
country's beef industry.

<P>
   ``When it comes to political pageantry. . .to nice-sounding
slogans and sound bites, I'll give credit where credit is due,''
Gore said. ``But you and I know that slogans never put out a raging
fire, that sound bites never saved a child from a burning building,
and political positioning will never heal sick children who don't
have health care, or help senior citizens afford their medicine,''
Gore added, bringing the boisterous crowd to its feet in raucous
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The Vice President mocked Republican vice presidential nominee
Dick Cheney's use of Gore's 1992 slogan: ``It's time for them to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you what time it's not,'' Gore bellowed. ``It's
not time to give in to the big oil companies. It's not time to go
backwards. It's time to take America forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering a Republican convention message aimed at working
people and minorities, Gore offered a traditional, liberal
Democratic agenda of workers' right to strike, equal pay for woman
workers, and a promise not to give a tax cut to the rich at the
expense of lower-income earners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here today to serve notice: This is day one of the fight
for working people,'' Gore said, repeating a theme he was invoked
many times since his presidential campaign began. ``All my life,
I've been pro-union and pro-working family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore never once mentioned Bush by name, instead focusing his
attack on Bush's party, which he derided as out-of-date and
disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me, the Republican National Convention was kind of
like a masquerade ball for special interests,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``behind the mask, we found the same politics of personal
attacks. Behind the balloons and the buttons is a massive,
budget-busting tax giveaway primarily benefiting the wealthy in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for the powerful, and we're for the people,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   On his first full day of campaigning in a week, Gore got a
predictably strong welcome from the International Association of
Firefighters, a member of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made a brief visit to a local firehouse,
posing for pictures with his wife, Tipper, his daughter, Sarah,
several firefighters and a dalmation. From there, Gore shed his
jacket, rolled up his shirt-sleeves and marched a few blocks to the
hotel where he was to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Led by police cars and Secret Service agents, the hundreds of
firefighters who accompanied him yelled, ``More Gore! More Gore!''
as they marched, although there was no audience for the display on
the empty downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also hinted at the biographical picture he is to present at
the Democrat National Convention in Los Angeles later this month,
describing his family life, his days as a journalist, and his time
in Vietnam as an Army journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that he had volunteered for Vietnam. While Gore made
no reference to the Republican ticket, the remark was a clear jab
at Bush and Cheney. Bush served stateside in the Texas Air National
Guard. Cheney avoided service altogether through a series of
deferments..
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, remained cagey about his choice for a
running-mate, telling reporters on Air Force Two that he had
narrowed the field to six candidates, ``plus one out-of-the-box
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The six are Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards
of North Carolina, Evan Bayh of Indiana, and Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, as well as New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen and
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, a Missouri representative.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the wild-card candidate had been vetted, Gore said,
``Assume that that process is over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is enjoying ``a boomlet'' in the vice-presidential
speculation, said a political consultant close to the Gore
campaign. Edwards is appealing, the consultant said, but is widely
believed to be too young and _ with just two years in the US Senate
_ too inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is considered a strong contender, especially with his
Vietnam war record, the consultant said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources told the Globe Thursday that neither Shaheen nor
Gephardt remain serious possibilities. Gephardt is in line to be
speaker of the House, if Democrats regain control of that body.
Shaheen has said she is simply not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill congressional aides say Bayh does not enjoy a
particularly warm personal relationship with Gore, and has told
colleagues that he is not very interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters at Fridays' convention said they were not united
around one vice presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a personal favorite in Tom Harkin,'' the US Senator from
Iowa and a strong labor proponent, said Terry Stewart, a Dubuque,
Iowa firefighter. ``But now I'd like John Kerry. He's a real
progressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Dick Durbin'' on the ticket, said Illinois
firefighter Dave Defraties, speaking of the Illinois US senator.
``But Gephardt or Lieberman would both be good guys. Anyone (Gore)
picks, we're with him.''

BELGIUM WANTS TO STUDY SHEEP SUSPECTED OF BEING INFECTED

 By ERICA THESING  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking a reprieve for more than 350 sheep condemned to death in
Vermont, the Belgian government requested Friday that the flocks be
returned to Belgium for further testing.
</P>
<P>
   The flocks _ containing about 50 animals exported from Belgium
in 1996, and their offspring born in the United States _ were
ordered destroyed in July after four animals tested positive for a
disease resembling bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Adriansens, agriculture consulate at the Belgian Embassy in
Washington, said Belgium and the European Union want the sheep
returned so scientists can conduct further tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The condition is from the European Union that the sheep can
come back for scientific purposes,'' he said. ``The conditions are
to send back the whole flock or nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman ordered the flocks'
destruction July 14. A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the sheep
should be killed to prevent the possibility of contaminating
American farm animals or food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the USDA said the agency needed a few days to
review Belgium's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our folks would need some time to look at it and see
what makes the best sense,'' said spokesman Patrick Collins.
``We're continuing to negotiate with the flock owners. We'd like to
resolve this as quickly as possible and hopefully we can do so with
the families.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the agency might respond early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing the sheep slaughter has become something of a cause
celebre in Vermont, where a Save the Sheep campaign active during
court hearings portrayed government officials as thugs protecting
domestic trade interests. Supporters of the sheep have also
travelled to the farm of one sheep owner to feast on his family's
cheese products and visit the condemned animals grazing in nearby
pastures.
</P>
<P>
   The sheeps' owners remain hopeful that their flocks will avoid
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Faillace, daughter of East Warren flock owners Larry and
Linda Falliace, said her parents were unavailable for comment. They
were busy getting their passports renewed for a possible trip to
Belgium, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Faillace said her parents were excited about the idea of sending
the sheep back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would much rather do that than have them killed,'' she
said. ``We're going to try everything we can to have that done.''
</P>
<P>
   Houghton Freeman, who owns the remainder of the condemned sheep,
said he was partly responsible for the Belgian's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to find some way to prevent the sheep being
slaughtered,'' he said. ``It's in negotiation now. The two
governments are talking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adriansens said he had not been able to contact anyone at
the USDA about the request. He said USDA officials were scheduled
for meetings Friday and did not have time to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that they will have an answer but I don't know when or
what,'' he said. ``We made the request. Now we are waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Adriansens said the Belgians and other European scientists are
interested in the Vermont flocks because they represent the first
known instance of sheep testing positive for the illness without
their parents testing postive as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for scientific purposes, they believe it would be better to
avoid the slaughter of those sheeps at this moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The animals that tested positive for the sheep equivalent of mad
cow disease do not necessarily have the mad cow illness, American
scientists have said. But agriculture officials are concerned about
anything that might spread the feared disease, which killed 53
people in Great Britain in 1995, and nearly destroyed that
country's beef industry.

DECLINING RATINGS BRING CRITICISM OF HOW CONVENTION WAS COVERED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oftentimes in the past week, network anchors and correspondents
seemed to chafe at the lack of news emanating from the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts argued Friday that the broadcast networks
defined ``news'' so narrowly _ and cut back on coverage so
dramatically _ that they missed the deeper stories behind the GOP
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trapped in a model of reporters on the floor
in-terviewing delegates about their reaction to speeches,'' said
Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism. ``It is an utterly outdated way to cover an event that
is a different event now.''
</P>
<P>
   The big difference from the networks' perspective is the decline
in viewers. Nielsen ratings for Thursday night's speech by
Republican nominee George W. Bush showed declines for NBC, CNN, and
CBS from viewing levels when Bob Dole accepted the GOP nomination
in 1996. Only ABC was up from four years ago, buoyed by a strong
lead-in from ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' For ABC, CBS, and
NBC, however, viewership Thursday represented a drop of at least
one-fifth of the audience compared to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to justify increased coverage of the convention
when clearly viewership is down,'' CBS spokeswoman Kim Akhtar said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ratings, Rosenstiel and others argued that the
networks should have seized the opportunity for in-depth reporting
on nominee George W. Bush, on what the Republican Party stands for,
and on issues such as the role played by key fund-raisers and what
shape Bush's general-election strategy against Democratic nominee
Al Gore will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real news going on, but it's not at the podium,''
Rosenstiel said.
</P>
<P>
   To Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute on Media Studies, part
of the news was that network coverage focused so extensively on the
importance of women and minorities to the GOP. ``This used to be a
white man's game,'' said Tompkins. It's a relatively new
conversation in their convention coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Everette Dennis, a professor of media management at Fordham
University, said CNN and NBC performed ably. But in general, Dennis
said, the networks engaged in a ``search for conflict and a
scramble for meaning where not much was found.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter of Center for Media and Public Affairs in
Washington was among several analysts Friday who criticized the
major broadcast networks _ CBS, NBC, and ABC _ for their relatively
paltry allocation of airtime to the GOP convention. Moreover, he
said, when they were on the air the networks delivered more
commentary than coverage, harvesting opinions rather than
broadcasting such convention moments as the GOP's biographical film
about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks used to regard the nomination of a president as a
momentous event, as newsworthy,'' said Lichter. ``Now, they're more
interested in what they have to say to each other than in what is
being said at the platform. There's really an arrogance here.''
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, which devoted the least airtime to the convention,
spokeswoman Hilary Smith said ``it was very clear to NBC that
viewers were not as interested,'' especially after viewership
dropped 50 percent from the end of ``Dateline'' Tuesday and Senator
John McCain's speech at the convention. Nonetheless, Smith said
that between NBC and its cable outlet, MSNBC, the network covered
many of the stories the analysts believed were vital. NBC plans no
changes in the amount of airtime for the Democratic National
Convention on Aug. 14, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, which led in the ratings this week (followed by NBC and
CBS), spokeswoman Sonya McNair said the network ``made a commitment
to provide the important information in that amount of time as
opposed to showing random highlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Akhtar, of CBS, said reporters struggled to find news in a
convention that was ``choreographed to the nth degree,'' forcing
networks to resort to commentary to provide ``perspective to what's
going on.'' Within the limited airtime networks gave to the
conventions, Akhtar argued that it made sense to focus on major
speeches because ``people want to know who the candidate is and the
speeches provide those kind of answers.''
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats convene in Los Angeles in two weeks, she said,
``our coverage will follow exactly the same lines'' in terms of
time alloted. The network does plan, however, to ensure that the
content of programs like ``48 Hours'' _ into which political
coverage was folded this week _ dovetails better with the
conventions. CBS was criticized for declining to air a speech by
Laura Bush, the nominee's wife, while airing a rerun of a medical
story on ``48 Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of this week, the three broadcast networks devoted no
more than an hour a night in prime time to the convention.
Nonetheless, viewership was generally down. NBC drew 6.1 million
viewers Thursday night, down 23 percent from 1996 levels and 39
percent from 1992. CBS attracted 4.2 million viewers, a decline of
6 percent from 1996 and 42 percent from 1992. ABC was the winner
with 7.6 million, a 28 percent increase from 1996 but still 21
percent fewer viewers than the network garnered eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the cable side, CNN won with 1.6 million viewers Thursday
night, but still drew a rating 35 percent lower than in 1996. Fox
News Channel was second with 1.1 million viewers, followed by MSNBC
with 506,000 viewers. (Fox News Channel did not exist in 1996;
MSNBC was in its infancy that year and was not measured by Nielsen
Media Research).

FOR DEMOCRATICS, CELEB PARTIES WILL BE WHERE IT'S AT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget fun on the convention floor. After hours,
the Democrats plan to put the party back in Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   With no tension over the nomination, the real pressure is to
snag invites to the A-list parties. The hosts are under pressure,
too. They're competing to get Hollywood's top television and movie
stars to turn out for this public gala or that private gathering.
</P>
<P>
   It promises to be the ultimate nexus of entertainment and
politics: Martin Sheen, who plays the president on TV, possibly
mingling with Bill Clinton, who is the president. Hugh Hefner, who
is a playboy, renting out his mansion for a fund-raiser filled with
politicians whose careers depend on not getting caught playing
around. Cher singing for her supper on what is otherwise known as
the rubber chicken circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a spectacle,'' said Hal Dash, president of
Cerrell Associates, a Los Angeles campaign consulting firm. ``There
will be bigger, better parties than ever before. No disrespect to
Philadelphia, but nothing is going to match LA for glitz and
glamour.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did have celebrity fans in Philadelphia, but
their wattage hardly compared. After all, the West Coast
entertainment industry has historically sided with the Democrats,
raising millions of dollars for candidates and now planning to
raise the roof during convention week.
</P>
<P>
   While demonstrators will be stuck on the streets, every big-name
restaurant and club around town seems to be booked. Valet parking
companies are swamped with business requests. Caterers will be
preparing canapes by the thousands. From trendy Spago to the hip
Conga Room, from the normally staid J. Paul Getty Museum to the
back lot of Paramount Pictures, convention-goers will gather
wherever there is a table or a tent for rent. Mansions are being
borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   The city estimates that the week is worth $135 million or more
in revenue, gatherings over breakfast, lunch, and dinner included.
Local officials say that the chance to burnish the city's image
after the recession, the riots, the earthquake, and other disasters
is invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a chance to realy show the city off,'' said
Michael Collins, executive vice president of the LA Convention &AMP;
Visitors Bureau. ``It says the center of the universe is LA, ground
zero for the (Democratic) party's ambitions for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of some party officials, the Hispanic Unity
Caucus is holding its party to promote voter registration at the
Playboy Mansion, although the notorious grotto will hold no
bikini-clad models. The fund-raiser, which starts at 10 p.m., is
expected to sell out, said Playboy Enterprises Inc. spokesman Bill
Farley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's business attire,'' he said. ``If there are any Playmates,
they will only be used as greeters and hostesses. They will be
dressed properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Democratic National Convention doesn't officially
open until Aug. 14, the partying starts Saturday night with some of
the hottest tickets in town. And those are only for the confirmed
events.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are rife of private soirees hosted by hyphenates such as
actress-singer Jennifer Lopez and actor-director-political activist
Rob Reiner. The Terminator himself, Republican Arnold
Schwarzenegger and his Democratic wife, Maria Shriver, are said to
be hosting a dinner after Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Caroline
Kennedy Schlossberg address the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations such as Sony and Chrysler are throwing parties,
too, at Union Station and the Petersen Automotive Museum,
respectively. Not surprisingly, state officials are also in on the
act. Governor Gray Davis is having a ``California Welcome Party''
for 5,000 of his closest friends, as well as the 5,000 or so
delegates, on the Paramount back lot. Like many of the events, the
cost of Davis's more intimate, invitation-only lunch for Democratic
governors later in the week will be covered by sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a party every night, a whole week of politics and
parties,'' said Ronald Nelson, senior sales manager at the House of
Blues, where Herbie Hancock and Mary Wilson will take to the stage
to entertain as many as 1,400 visiting Democrats at a time. ``The
only thing I can say is that we have most of the A parties.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is not an uncommon boast in Los Angeles, even
when Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate,
is not starring in town. But in a development that may not bode
well for his campaign, the ticket that everyone covets is to the
pre-convention party for the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   According to Variety, an entertainment industry trade journal,
scheduled performers at the farewell include Cher, Melissa
Etheridge, Natalie Cole, Stevie Wonder, Michael Bolton, and others.
The proceeds will go to Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign,
with the first couple expected to drop in at several other
exclusive fund-raisers before skipping town as the convention gets
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will also get to bask in the celebrity limelight, on the
convention floor and at an Aug. 17 Shrine Auditorium concert
featuring Barbra Streisand. The top ticket price: reportedly
$50,000 a couple _ money that one political observer called
``pocket change'' in a town known for its big-spending ways. The
price of other events ranges from zero to $100,000 that invitees
are required to raise in donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of ticket trading going on, people
calling and saying, `If you get me into your party, I'll get you
into mine,' '' said Sean Burton, a Warner Bros. executive who is
with a group for young progressive professionals called Democratic
Leadership of the 21st Century. ``In the next couple weeks, people
will really start to focus on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times plans to mix fact and fiction at its bash
for journalists hitting town to cover the convention. Billed as
``Media Insiders: Real and Celluloid,'' the party will throw
together reporters and as-yet unidentified actors who play
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   For one week, at least, the politicians and the delegates who
select the presidential nominee may at times outshine the stars
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   LA Convention 2000, the private-sector host committee, is
expected to spend $4 million just for delegation parties on the eve
of the convention. On Sunday night alone, there will be 25 or more
of them citywide for 56 delegations, including one at the Museum of
Contemporary Art for delegates from Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   As Convention 2000 spokesman Ben Austin put it, ``It's going to
be the State of the Union meets the Academy Awards Sunday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the 7,000 convention volunteers will get a party of their
own, the day after the convention, at the Los Angeles Zoo. About
the only people who won't be celebrating that week are the people
who live in LA but aren't connected to the convention in any way.
The host committee wanted to hold an event open to every Angeleno,
but it couldn't find an appropriate venue.

PLENTY OF AMMUNITION FOR GORE IN THE GOP EXTRAVAGANZA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 6, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention may have done more for Al
Gore and the Democrats than it did for George W. Bush and the
Republicans _ for by trying so hard to appear diverse,
compassionate, and moderate, the GOP only called attention to its
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Having African-Americans, Hispanics, a Chinese-American woman, a
gay Congressman, and a blind mountain climber appear on stage
accentuated the sharp contrast between this showcase of
multicultural diversity and the real makeup of the Republican
Party, as reflected in its delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Even the high-profile role of J.C. Watts, a black congressman
from Oklahoma and co-chair of the convention, served to expose the
lack of African-Americans in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and the news media picked up the contrast between the
staged performance and the convention floor. As New Orleans Mayor
Marc Morial, a Democrat and an African-American, told USA Today,
there were so few black delegates that they all ``could probably
meet under the Liberty Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and others at the Democratic National Convention, which
opens Aug. 14 in Los Angeles, could have as much fun, if not more,
with this GOP disparity as the GOP had jabbing Gore and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press survey of 1,837 of the 2,066 GOP delegates
confirms what one viewer at the convention called the ``illusion of
inclusion'' on stage, while the scene on the convention floor was
far different. The survey showed that 83 percent of the delegates
were white, 3.7 percent were black, and 1 percent was
Asian/Pacific. In addition, 61 percent of the delegates were male,
and 34 percent were female.
</P>
<P>
   Not even George W. Bush's passionate appeal in his acceptance
speech for the party to be more inclusive, more caring for the less
fortunate, could change the reality of these numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The only convention speaker to directly address the GOP's
shortcomings on diversity was retired General Colin S. Powell, who
chided Republicans for fighting affirmative action instead of
embracing it as a much-needed element for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Democrats are going to have on their convention
floor what the GOP created as a cultural fantasy on its convention
stage. The delegates will be 66 percent white (whites are 83
percent of the US population); 20 percent African-American (blacks
are 12.8 percent); 8 percent Hispanic (12 percent); 3 percent
Asian/Pacific Islander and 1 percent Native American.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Republicans, every state delegation attending the
Democratic Convention must be 50 percent male and 50 percent
female, and goals and timetables must be set for proportional
representation of minorities, women, and youth. In California, the
Democratic delegation includes a 5 percent gay male requirement, a
5 percent goal for lesbians, and a 10 percent goal for people with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and other party leaders at the Democratic National
Convention will likely point out the gap between the diversity that
the GOP tried to show, and the reality. And it will offer voters
its own more genuinely diverse alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Look, too, for reminders of what the GOP didn't show. There was,
for example, the absence of the right wing conservatives who led
the impeachment charge against President Clinton, only to suffer an
embarrassing defeat when the Senate voted against conviction. Their
unsuccessful efforts damaged their party more than Clinton, who is
still popular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the conspicuous absence of a well-known name
during the speeches of the civilian and military strategists
involved in the Persian Gulf War. Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, and
Norman Schwarzkopf all spoke highly of former President George Bush
and nominee George W. Bush. But, as some political analysts noted,
there was barely a mention of Saddam Hussein, the target of our
Gulf War efforts. He is still ruling Iraq, while most of the
American leaders involved in the war are no longer in their jobs _
a fact that few GOP speakers wanted to highlight.
</P>
<P>
   These Republican omissions may also be on the agenda for the
Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   By directly attacking Gore during his acceptance speech, Bush
also gave Gore a legitimate reason to counterattack. And, as he has
proved in previous debates and speeches, Gore is very adept at
striking back.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's jab at Gore for reinventing himself rings hollow; after
all, with a speech that often sounded more as though it came from
Clinton or Gore than from a conservative Republican, Bush was
trying to reinvent himself as well as the entire Republican Party
in four nights last week. In doing so, Bush and the GOP gave Gore a
lot of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps during his acceptance speech next week, Gore may find it
in his heart to thank Bush and the Republican Party for their
assistance.

DECLINING RATINGS BRING CRITICISM OF HOW CONVENTION WAS COVERED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oftentimes in the past week, network anchors and correspondents
seemed to chafe at the lack of news emanating from the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts argued Friday that the broadcast networks
defined ``news'' so narrowly _ and cut back on coverage so
dramatically _ that they missed the deeper stories behind the GOP
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trapped in a model of reporters on the floor
in-terviewing delegates about their reaction to speeches,'' said
Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism. ``It is an utterly outdated way to cover an event that
is a different event now.''
</P>
<P>
   The big difference from the networks' perspective is the decline
in viewers. Nielsen ratings for Thursday night's speech by
Republican nominee George W. Bush showed declines for NBC, CNN, and
CBS from viewing levels when Bob Dole accepted the GOP nomination
in 1996. Only ABC was up from four years ago, buoyed by a strong
lead-in from ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' For ABC, CBS, and
NBC, however, viewership Thursday represented a drop of at least
one-fifth of the audience compared to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to justify increased coverage of the convention
when clearly viewership is down,'' CBS spokeswoman Kim Akhtar said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ratings, Rosenstiel and others argued that the
networks should have seized the opportunity for in-depth reporting
on nominee George W. Bush, on what the Republican Party stands for,
and on issues such as the role played by key fund-raisers and what
shape Bush's general-election strategy against Democratic nominee
Al Gore will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's real news going on, but it's not at the podium,''
Rosenstiel said.
</P>
<P>
   To Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute on Media Studies, part
of the news was that network coverage focused so extensively on the
importance of women and minorities to the GOP. ``This used to be a
white man's game,'' said Tompkins. It's a relatively new
conversation in their convention coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Everette Dennis, a professor of media management at Fordham
University, said CNN and NBC performed ably. But in general, Dennis
said, the networks engaged in a ``search for conflict and a
scramble for meaning where not much was found.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter of Center for Media and Public Affairs in
Washington was among several analysts Friday who criticized the
major broadcast networks _ CBS, NBC, and ABC _ for their relatively
paltry allocation of airtime to the GOP convention. Moreover, he
said, when they were on the air the networks delivered more
commentary than coverage, harvesting opinions rather than
broadcasting such convention moments as the GOP's biographical film
about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks used to regard the nomination of a president as a
momentous event, as newsworthy,'' said Lichter. ``Now, they're more
interested in what they have to say to each other than in what is
being said at the platform. There's really an arrogance here.''
</P>
<P>
   At NBC, which devoted the least airtime to the convention,
spokeswoman Hilary Smith said ``it was very clear to NBC that
viewers were not as interested,'' especially after viewership
dropped 50 percent from the end of ``Dateline'' Tuesday and Senator
John McCain's speech at the convention. Nonetheless, Smith said
that between NBC and its cable outlet, MSNBC, the network covered
many of the stories the analysts believed were vital. NBC plans no
changes in the amount of airtime for the Democratic National
Convention on Aug. 14, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, which led in the ratings this week (followed by NBC and
CBS), spokeswoman Sonya McNair said the network ``made a commitment
to provide the important information in that amount of time as
opposed to showing random highlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Akhtar, of CBS, said reporters struggled to find news in a
convention that was ``choreographed to the nth degree,'' forcing
networks to resort to commentary to provide ``perspective to what's
going on.'' Within the limited airtime networks gave to the
conventions, Akhtar argued that it made sense to focus on major
speeches because ``people want to know who the candidate is and the
speeches provide those kind of answers.''
</P>
<P>
   When Democrats convene in Los Angeles in two weeks, she said,
``our coverage will follow exactly the same lines'' in terms of
time alloted. The network does plan, however, to ensure that the
content of programs like ``48 Hours'' _ into which political
coverage was folded this week _ dovetails better with the
conventions. CBS was criticized for declining to air a speech by
Laura Bush, the nominee's wife, while airing a rerun of a medical
story on ``48 Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of this week, the three broadcast networks devoted no
more than an hour a night in prime time to the convention.
Nonetheless, viewership was generally down. NBC drew 6.1 million
viewers Thursday night, down 23 percent from 1996 levels and 39
percent from 1992. CBS attracted 4.2 million viewers, a decline of
6 percent from 1996 and 42 percent from 1992. ABC was the winner
with 7.6 million, a 28 percent increase from 1996 but still 21
percent fewer viewers than the network garnered eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the cable side, CNN won with 1.6 million viewers Thursday
night, but still drew a rating 35 percent lower than in 1996. Fox
News Channel was second with 1.1 million viewers, followed by MSNBC
with 506,000 viewers. (Fox News Channel did not exist in 1996;
MSNBC was in its infancy that year and was not measured by Nielsen
Media Research).

 &HT;    'We are a new Republican Party'
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - Presidential nominee George W. Bush, who promised
a different kind of national convention, succeeded in serving up a
four-day event that was completely atypical for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the parts that weren't.
</P>
<P>
   What was different was night after night of folks and faces you
wouldn't expect to see on a GOP stage, including Hispanic singers
and Chaka Khan, the Delfonics and enough black entertainers to give
the convention a Soul Train look, as long as you didn't pan the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a new Republican Party,'' Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge
told delegates on the closing night Thursday. ``And George W. Bush
is the founding father.''
</P>
<P>
   But while being different was the goal, the parts that were the
same played best on the packed convention floor. For all the talk
of a new era of bipartisan cooperation, nothing _ no song, no star
_ got the crowd rocking like the third verse of the tune the GOP
has been singing for eight years: Bill Clinton and Al Gore are
unfit to serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all of the shouting and all of the scandal. After all of
the bitterness and broken faith, we can begin again,'' Bush said in
his acceptance speech, drawing a wild reaction.
</P>
<P>
   His speech came a night after running mate Dick Cheney _ about
the last guy you would expect to incite a riot _ whipped the crowd
into near-frenzy with his attacks on Clinton-Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a slash-and-burn artist who is somebody
who can get up and give a stirring, tub-thumping stump speech, I'm
not your guy,'' Cheney had said prior to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But it turned out that if you're looking for a guy who can use a
measured, board-room, I-mean-business tone to fire up the troops,
he is your guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in together. Now let us see them off together,''
Cheney said of Clinton and Gore, drawing an impassioned response
from delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Woven into the wild enthusiasm for every negative word about
Clinton-Gore is a Bush campaign dilemma. This was a decidedly home
crowd made up of Republicans who believe the White House was stolen
from them by scoundrels.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is out there among some Americans, and Bush and
Cheney want to play to it. But some of the swing states that will
decide the race, among them the industrial Midwest, include
undecided voters. Those are folks who _ despite the Clinton scandal
_ still have not decided to give up on the president's political
heir.
</P>
<P>
   Survey numbers released after Bush's acceptance speech indicate
the delicate nature of attack politics. Republicans, predictably,
loved the speech. But according to a Hart Research analysis of
responses from viewers who punched in their reactions on
SpeakOut.Com, independents were a bit queasy about the attacks on
Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush lost independents when he attacked Clinton and Gore,''
the analysis said. ``Here, the politics of negativism turned off
these people in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign officials moved quickly to take advantage of that
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took Bush only seven sentences before he first attacked
Vice President Gore,'' they noted. ``Despite all the happy
rhetoric, despite all the smiling faces, despite all the scripted
displays of inclusion, Bush-Cheney is the same old mean-spirited
and divisive Republican ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's top strategist, is aware of the balancing act
that comes with assailing Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will respond if attacked,'' Rove said. ``But I think the
American people, after the last eight years and for a lot of other
reasons, are at a point where they would prefer to learn more about
the candidates and their respective agendas. And trashball politics
is not particularly compelling or effective this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the shots at Clinton and Gore, the GOP ticket managed
to transform its convention into something out of the ordinary for
Republicans. Gone was the usual litany of patriotic music, replaced
this year by up-tempo tunes and toned-down rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion, a GOP hot-button issue, got little mention.
</P>
<P>
   The party platform, especially its more controversial planks,
was not part of the made-for-TV Republican Party offered up for
four nights. Though mostly ignored in the party's prime time hours,
the conservative GOP platform remained generally intact and
Democrats are likely to highlight that in the race to secure
support from minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the convention's most deftly performed double reverse,
retired Gen. Colin Powell got delegates to cheer, sort of, for
affirmative action, a concept he supports but Bush and the party
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, at the GOP convention in San Diego, Powell was
booed when he voiced support for affirmative action. This year, he
packaged it with a can't-miss shot at big-money politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly condemn
affirmative action that helped a few thousand black kids get an
education, but you hardly hear a whimper from them over affirmative
action for lobbyists who load our federal tax code with preferences
for special interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd on the convention floor cheered. There was no way to
know whether the lobbyists and special interests, wining and dining
in the luxury boxes above, reacted similarly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's message of inclusion played in events all around town,
though not always as effectively as he desired. His first
appearance in Philadelphia, a Hispanic rally on the famous steps at
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, was largely populated by
non-Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Down front were the Minnesota Young Republicans, a decidedly
Anglo group holding signs that said ``Latinos for Bush.'' One
Hispanic singer, noting the lack of reaction when he spoke to the
crowd in Spanish, asked, ``There's a few Latinos here, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Bush got the different convention he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen this much dancing at a Republican
convention before,'' noted U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla of San Antonio.

   CBOT-TRADE (Chicago) _ The explosion of computerized trading is
threatening to make century-old pit trading obsolete. Some believe
the ``open outcry'' method of shouting and flashing hand signals
into a trading pit is already doomed. And so too, they say, might
be the United States' oldest derivatives exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade. By David Barboza.

   WORLD-BIZ-POLAND (Legnica, Poland) _ Thousands of Poles, with

   ONLINE-RESERVATIONS (Undated) _ The restaurant industry has been

there are now a growing number of Web sites that allow diners in
major U.S. cities to reserve tables online. By Randy Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ The wave of economic reforms that has
washed over Latin America first touched shore in Chile. That small
nation was the first to tear down import barriers, liberalize
exchange-rate policy, bolster the domestic savings rate and
otherwise whip itself into shape for the new global economy. Now it
wants to go further. By Anthony DePalma.

   ABOUTCARS-MERCEDES (Undated) _ The Mercedes-Benz brochure of the
1980s described the marque's philosophy thus: A Mercedes should not
inspire aggressive driving, but if you find yourself in a bind _
say, roaring into a tight turn too fast _ the car will get you
through. That, at least, was the gist. The Mercedes was an
automotive Clark Kent, serious and sedate, but ready to fling off
its eyeglasses and soar to the rescue. There is nothing
mild-mannered about the Mercedes-Benz of today. By Serge Schmemann.

   POL-CONVENTIONS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ George W. Bush went a
long way at the Republican convention toward casting himself and
his party in a favorable light. But the event was, for the most
part, dull. Bush produced what was in effect an anti-commercial _
Don't Watch This! _ for Al Gore's upcoming Democratic convention.

   TECH-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a business culture that has
long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing
technological revolution in their garages, the backstory to two
digital copyright battles involving Napster and DVDs being waged in
federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring. They are either
tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim
at the establishment. Both cases have underscored the unprecedented
ability of individuals armed with digital technology to upset the
status quo. By Amy Harmon.

the cruelest month for those who cherish international calm and
stable markets. A look at major news events that took place in
August in recent years. By Kurt M. Campbell.

English technology-related words into their vocabulary. The
hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not new; it
has been accelerating for decades, irritating Spanish language
purists as well as Latin American nationalists who see the process
as more cultural infiltration from the United States. What's
different now is that authorities in much of the Latin world appear
to be throwing up their hands in the face of the latest English

pre-World War II Germany. During the war she lived in Berlin under
an assumed name and worked at a Nazi newspaper, feeding information
to the underground resistance. Lilly Wust, the young wife of an SS
soldier, was the mother of four boys, and for her effort in
producing such strapping young specimens of Aryan youth, she was
awarded the Nazi's Maternal Cross in bronze. She had reportedly
once said that she could ``smell Jews,'' a comment that, when it

to arrange a meeting with such a person. ``Aimee and Jaguar'' is

Goethe's youth and maturity, contains the well-known plot _ the
bargain of the learned Doctor Faust with Mephistopheles, the
seduction of the innocent Gretchen _ that has been echoed in
novels, movies, puppet shows and several operas. ``Faust,'' Part 2,
written in Goethe's old age and published shortly after his death
in 1832, is more abstract, disjunct, and hardly ever staged. So
when one of Germany's most celebrated theatrical directors, Peter
Stein, determined to mount a production of the complete uncut
``Faust,'' Parts 1 and 2, it became an event of national magnitude.

A SCIENCE MUSEUM EMBRACES ART THROUGH ANATOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Resending to correct headline)  
 (For release Sunday, August 6)  
 By TESSA DE CARLO    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   SAN FRANCISCO
_ Since the Exploratorium was founded here 31 years ago as an
innovative ``museum of science, art and human perception,'' it has
taken pride in breaking traditional museum rules. Mixing science
exhibits and artworks with little concern about which is which, the
Exploratorium encourages a giddily high level of interactivity,
inviting visitors not just to stand and contemplate but to touch,
pump, spin or otherwise mess around with most of the 600-plus items
on display.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, however, a few distinguished visitors are being
treated with decidedly old-fashioned formality.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the ``Medical Venus,'' a lifesize and alarmingly
lifelike 18th-century Italian wax sculpture of a young beauty who
lies in a swoon on pink damask cushions. It's hardly surprising she
feels faint, since she's not only naked but cut open from stem to
stern to reveal her heart, liver and other viscera, as beautifully
made as the rest of her dainty person.
</P>
<P>
   The Venus, who hails from the Museo La Specola in Florence, is
making her first appearance in the United States as one of the star
turns in ``Revealing Bodies,'' which runs through Sept. 4. The show
uses an array of artifacts and artworks to demonstrate that our
view of human anatomy has always been informed as much by culture
as science.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the Exploratorium's history, this
temporary exhibition has been given a traditional gallery-style
installation off to one side of the museum, acoustically and
visually segregated from the whirling, flashing, wiggling exhibits
on the cavernous main exhibition floor. Moreover, while dozens of
the exhibits in ``Revealing Bodies'' welcome participation, the
Venus and other items are tucked safely under glass _ no
interactivity allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first attempt to do something like this, but
`Revealing Bodies' is where we're headed,'' said Kathleen McLean,
the Exploratorium's director of public programs. While more
traditional museums try to move toward greater interactivity and
livelier, less contemplative exhibitions, she said, for the
Exploratorium, doing something new and different means ``creating
more environments for focus and reflection and slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy isn't sitting well with everyone. ``There's been a
lot of concern here among staff that we're going to slip into being
just another museum,'' McLean said. ``But I don't think very many
museums could have done the `Revealing Bodies' show.''
</P>
<P>
   For while ``Revealing Bodies'' may be straitlaced by
Exploratorium standards, its multicultural, cross-disciplinary
blend of art, science and participatory technologies is very much
in the institution's mold-breaking tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the ``Medical Venus,'' the show includes African
carved figures used in healing rituals, prosthetic legs from a
variety of eras and cultures, Ken Wilkes' elegant, horrifying
photographs of dissections, a screen that displays the heat
emanating from the viewer's body in vivid colors, historic and
contemporary X-rays and copies of astonishingly varied medical
drawings from 17th-century Persia, 16th-century Holland and 1920s
France.
</P>
<P>
   Within the relatively staid ``Revealing Bodies'' environment,
there's also plenty of hard science and a number of the kind of
interactive exhibits that the Exploratorium is famous for. For
example, visitors can draw their own silhouette, peer into the
inside of their own eyes or page through a giant flipbook-style
display of the ``Visible Humans,'' two corpses (one male, one
female) that were frozen, milled from the feet up removing a
paper-thin section at a time, photographed and reassembled as
stacks of digital images that look disturbingly like human-shaped
slices of headcheese.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when so much of contemporary art aims to subvert
rather than investigate the truth, it can be problematic to bring
art into a science museum. So if one source of internal controversy
about the ``Revealing Bodies'' show is its artiness, another is
that some of the artworks look too much like science, while turning
scientific realities topsy-turvy.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the ``Face Value'' machine created by the British
artist Alexa Wright and the computer scientist Alf Linney. ``Face
Value'' compares the viewer's face to a composite portrait of some
200 other visitors, then spits out a ``personal face reading'' that
purports to use that comparison to define character. The readings
are nonsense, of course, a commentary on our naive willingness to
trust both technology and first impressions. But Melissa Alexander,
the show's project director, said some Exploratorium staff worried
that visitors would assume that ``Face Value'' was as real as a
nearby exhibit that lets them hear their lungs at work.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of potential confusion is the New York artist
Scott Serrano's curiosity cabinet of drawings, artifacts and
photographs telling the story of a 19th-century anatomist, Wilson
Quain, a man so ``science-intoxicated'' that he took to dissecting
himself. Quain is a fiction, but on one recent afternoon several
visitors clearly believed he was a historical figure. ``How could
anyone do that to themselves?'' one mother exclaimed as she and her
child stared at a series of animated digital photographs of Quain
(played by Serrano) apparently peeling off his own face. They were
too horrified to notice that the photographs obviously dated from
the 21st rather than the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the show's juxtaposition of the fine and the
medical arts is stimulating on all fronts, highlighting the formal
beauty of the latter and the sometimes grim reality embedded in the
former. An artificial heart made of shiny metal and intricate
swirls of plastic could pass for a sinisterly futuristic sculpture.
Rosamund Purcell's stunning photograph of a dissected hand, which
on a conventional gallery wall might too easily be seen as merely
an arty novelty, becomes a moving reminder of all the ways the
living feed on the dead when it's juxtaposed with a set of three
dissected, mummified hands used as teaching aids a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The distinction between art and science didn't always exist in
our culture,'' Alexander said. ``The Venus is proof that they used
to be much closer together. And the Exploratorium was based on the
idea of not making any distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   That course was set by the museum's founder, Frank Oppenheimer,
a brilliant physicist and teacher who worked with his brother,
Robert, on the development of the atomic bomb. Where most museums
expected people to absorb information passively, like students
sitting in a lecture hall, Oppenheimer sought to create a place
that would emphasize play rather than pretension, where visitors
could do their own experiments and make their own educational
leaps. From the beginning, artists and scientists have worked side
by side in the museum's workshop, using scientific phenomena as the
basis for exhibits that inspire aesthetic delight as well as
curiosity about how the natural world works.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Exploratorium opened in 1969, its innovative ideas
have been adopted by museums all over the world. But Oppenheimer's
vision tended to scant the cultural side of the art-science
partnership, focusing more on science phenomena and less on their
social interpretations and ramifications. Moreover, the
institution's anti-museum environment _ dark, noisy and usually
full of excited children dashing from one activity to the next _
favors the didactic over the contemplative, and sometimes
hyperactivity over either.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the northwest will direct drier air into the
Northeast Saturday as high pressure builds southward from Canada.
After a cool start, abundant sunshine will cause temperatures to
rebound to near seasonal levels. Farther south, patchy clouds and
isolated thundershowers will surround a front stalled over the
Carolinas and in northern Florida. The rest of the Southeast will
be sultry with isolated mainly afternoon thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of thunderstorms will erupt over the northeast Plains
and upper Mississippi Valley as a surge of humid air intercepts a
jet stream disturbance passing overhead. Additional showers and
storms will form in the lower Ohio and Tennessee Valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast will be mainly sunny and warm, though patchy
clouds will shroud the coast. The interior West will stay hot with
isolated afternoon thundershowers.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: OUT OF AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hurricanes that strike the eastern United States are
born in Africa. In the summer and early fall dozens of clusters of
thunderstorms form in the strongly heated air near the Sahel. As
the clusters move westward, the chilly waters near Africa's west
coast are inhospitable territory for the disturbances. But, when
the high-level winds are favorable, the African disturbances can
reach the warmer waters to the west where hurricanes take shape. On
Friday, Tropical Storm Alberto sprang to life 200 miles south of
the Cape Verde Islands.

   TECH-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a business culture that has
long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing
technological revolution in their garages, the backstory to two
digital copyright battles involving Napster and DVDs being waged in
federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring. They are either
tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim

<P>
   THIRD-PARTIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at third-party movements
in the history of U.S. presidential elections. They have seldom
played significant roles, except as occasional issue raisers and
spoilers. In a sense, third parties have played a vital role in
America's political system by expanding it and maybe, in a peculiar
way, preserving it. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-DEREG-REVIEW (Undated) _ Cheap, reliable electricity
was long taken for granted in the United States. Not anymore, at
least not in California. Four years ago, California decided to
deregulate its electric industry to promote competition, lower
prices and better service. This summer, power bills have doubled in
San Diego, blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has been
forced to cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its
power grid. The power supply is near collapse. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ROCK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Republican National Convention
had two things in common with a World Wrestling Federation match:
the event was scripted and the outcome was never in doubt. The
champion known as The Rock was there to deliver unto the
conventioneers a voter registration message and to introduce House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach. By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-DONORS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ It began in 1988 with Team
100, made up of $100,000 contributors, when the elder George Bush
invented the Republicans' first elite donor club. Last week the GOP
convention was overrun by a stampede of 600 Team 100 members, who
were invited to take out those checkbooks and give the party
$250,000, the entry fee to the Republican Regents, the party's
newest and most exclusive donor club. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   KILLER-KID-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Friends and acquaintances of
youths who kill often have heard boasts, plans for mayhem or seen
such warning signs as a fascination with guns. But they did nothing
to stop the crimes. The recently released testimony of teenagers
who knew one such killer, Michael Carneal of West Paducah, Ky.,
provide some insight.

   SPANGLISH-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Spanish speakers around
the world adopt computers and the Internet, they are importing
English technology-related words into their vocabulary. The
hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not new; it
has been accelerating for decades, irritating Spanish language
purists as well as Latin American nationalists who see the process
as more cultural infiltration from the United States. What's
different now is that authorities in much of the Latin world appear
to be throwing up their hands in the face of the latest English
invasion. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ARABS-REVIEW (Cairo) _ At the urging of the
Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have renewed the perennial call
for a summit conference of Arab leaders, this time billed an
emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the failure at Camp
David and to counter the U.S. spin that the breakdown was due
solely to Arab recalcitrance. The chimera of a united Arab front
continues to shimmer on the horizon _ and, suddenly, not just for
the Arabs. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVAR-VENEZUELA-REVIEW (Caracas) _ Throughout South America,
no figure is more revered and quoted than Simon Bolivar, who freed
the region from Spanish rule nearly 200 years ago. But Bolivar said
many different and often contradictory things. That means that
modern leaders like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have a whole
menu of positions from which to choose when they seek to justify
their own actions. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE-MUGABE-REVIEW (Harare) _ In the West, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe is seen as a bloody despot and race-monger
who fuels the violence that churns through the countryside. But in
much of Africa, he is viewed as a hero trying to redress historical
wrongs. To many Westerners, these two conflicting views seem
impossible to reconcile. How can Mugabe be praised for pursuing an
honorable cause if he kills innocents along the way? By Rachel
Swarns.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 6, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   POL-CONVENTIONS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ George W. Bush went a
long way at the Republican convention toward casting himself and
his party in a favorable light. But the event was, for the most
part, dull. Bush produced what was in effect an anti-commercial _
Don't Watch This! _ for Al Gore's upcoming Democratic convention.
Gore is getting much advice about what he should do to get his
candidacy on track, but it's not going to matter much if no one's
watching. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   TECH-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a business culture that has
long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing
technological revolution in their garages, the backstory to two
digital copyright battles involving Napster and DVDs being waged in
federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring. They are either
tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim
at the establishment. Both cases have underscored the unprecedented
ability of individuals armed with digital technology to upset the
status quo. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AUGUST-NEWS-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's August, and things are
supposed to be slow and easy for public officials, business people
and journalists. But if the 1990s are any indication, August can be
the cruelest month for those who cherish international calm and
stable markets. A look at major news events that took place in
August in recent years. By Kurt M. Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD-PARTIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at third-party movements
in the history of U.S. presidential elections. They have seldom
played significant roles, except as occasional issue raisers and
spoilers. In a sense, third parties have played a vital role in
America's political system by expanding it and maybe, in a peculiar
way, preserving it. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-DEREG-REVIEW (Undated) _ Cheap, reliable electricity
was long taken for granted in the United States. Not anymore, at
least not in California. Four years ago, California decided to
deregulate its electric industry to promote competition, lower
prices and better service. This summer, power bills have doubled in
San Diego, blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has been
forced to cut off some big customers to protect the rest of its
power grid. The power supply is near collapse. By Alex Berenson.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-ROCK-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Republican National Convention
had two things in common with a World Wrestling Federation match:
the event was scripted and the outcome was never in doubt. The
champion known as The Rock was there to deliver unto the
conventioneers a voter registration message and to introduce House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach. By Richard
Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   GOP-DONORS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ It began in 1988 with Team
100, made up of $100,000 contributors, when the elder George Bush
invented the Republicans' first elite donor club. Last week the GOP
convention was overrun by a stampede of 600 Team 100 members, who
were invited to take out those checkbooks and give the party
$250,000, the entry fee to the Republican Regents, the party's
newest and most exclusive donor club. By Don Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   KILLER-KID-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Friends and acquaintances of
youths who kill often have heard boasts, plans for mayhem or seen
such warning signs as a fascination with guns. But they did nothing
to stop the crimes. The recently released testimony of teenagers
who knew one such killer, Michael Carneal of West Paducah, Ky.,
provide some insight.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   SPANGLISH-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ As Spanish speakers around
the world adopt computers and the Internet, they are importing
English technology-related words into their vocabulary. The
hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not new; it
has been accelerating for decades, irritating Spanish language
purists as well as Latin American nationalists who see the process
as more cultural infiltration from the United States. What's
different now is that authorities in much of the Latin world appear
to be throwing up their hands in the face of the latest English
invasion. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-ARABS-REVIEW (Cairo) _ At the urging of the
Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have renewed the perennial call
for a summit conference of Arab leaders, this time billed an
emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the failure at Camp
David and to counter the U.S. spin that the breakdown was due
solely to Arab recalcitrance. The chimera of a united Arab front
continues to shimmer on the horizon _ and, suddenly, not just for
the Arabs. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVAR-VENEZUELA-REVIEW (Caracas) _ Throughout South America,
no figure is more revered and quoted than Simon Bolivar, who freed
the region from Spanish rule nearly 200 years ago. But Bolivar said
many different and often contradictory things. That means that
modern leaders like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have a whole
menu of positions from which to choose when they seek to justify
their own actions. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   ZIMBABWE-MUGABE-REVIEW (Harare) _ In the West, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe is seen as a bloody despot and race-monger
who fuels the violence that churns through the countryside. But in
much of Africa, he is viewed as a hero trying to redress historical
wrongs. To many Westerners, these two conflicting views seem
impossible to reconcile. How can Mugabe be praised for pursuing an
honorable cause if he kills innocents along the way? By Rachel
Swarns.

GARDENING: SHRUBS FOR BEAUTY AND HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 6)  
 (EDITORS: optional sidebar at end of article)  
 By TOVAH MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I once disdained cannas, but that was before I met Cleopatra.
And before encountering Aaron, I was among those who looked down on
caladiums.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we've all loosened up a bit, or perhaps summer bulbs have
improved their image. For whatever reason, summer bulbs are way
cool again.
</P>
<P>
   Until fairly recently, it seemed that cannas served mostly as
bull's eyes in the center of Victorian circles, those little
islands of blazing color stranded on the expansive lawn of the town
bank or post office.
</P>
<P>
   You saw them loitering in bedding displays, balancing their
eye-popping blossoms on top of long, spear-shaped green leaves.
But, back then, cannas were in the same category as marigolds,
bright red bedding geraniums and wax begonias.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all that has changed. Cannas are now downright trendy,
filling a new job description: punctuation marks in the perennial
garden. Polite society may still frown on parading cannas in ribbon
borders, but a well-placed canna or two as an accent among more
discreet perennials is usually applauded.
</P>
<P>
   With one little difference. Nowadays, many gardeners snip off
the bright orange, patriotic scarlet or school-bus-yellow blossoms.
Although the Victorians put considerable effort into breeding
low-maintenance orchid-size blossoms that drop off after they
bloom, that trait is no longer the main draw. Instead, it's the
side show that gardeners now find appealing. Somewhere back in the
19th century, one of the orchid-flowering cannas that became known
as Cleopatra had burgundy-striped leaves. It also had harlequin
yellow, red or spotted flowers side by side in the same umbel. The
Victorians liked that sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, breeders have enhanced the leaf colors, resulting
in such popular hybrids as Pretoria (alias Bengal Tiger) with
yellow-striped foliage. If a 6-foot plant is more than you can
handle, there are ``dwarf'' versions, like Striped Beauty and
Striata, with all the visual kicks but condensed to a relatively
compact 4 feet. Alice McGowan of Blue Meadow Farm in Montague
Center, Mass., which specializes in rare annuals and perennials,
said that Striata is a best seller in their catalog, second only to
Panache.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Panache popular? ``Because it has discreet, cream-colored
blossoms,'' she said. ``Some people still retain their longstanding
prejudice, but cannas are rising in popularity, just like coleus.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for several other summer bulbs. Take
colocasias, for example. Brent Heath of Brent &AMP; Becky's Bulbs in
Gloucester, Va., which specializes in bulbs for all seasons, said
colocasias are so popular now that they can't keep them in stock.
Commonly known as elephant's ear because of its enormous foliage,
which is deeply veined and billows in breezes, Colocasia esculenta
was another denizen of shady Victorian circles _ surrounded by
impatiens or ferns, perhaps. It is now used in containers,
especially the Cranberry Taro, with its dark red veins, and Black
Magic, with its lustrous purplish black leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Heath never met a bulb he didn't like. But he ranks caladiums
high on his roster of up-and-comers. Like colocasias, they have
seemed like too much of a good thing for many gardeners. These
shade-loving, heart-leaved plants were splashed, spangled and zoned
with several different colors.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the older varieties scorched easily. Recently,
the Florida series has produced thicker-leaved, light-tolerant
versions. In addition, many quieter hybrids are now on the market,
like the luminous white-veined Aaron and rose-veined Florida
Sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Flashy leaves are part of the lure, but flowers are definitely a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Dahlias, too, have hit their stride again. But they're not quite
as buxom as the versions that were coddled in greenhouses a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lilies never really lagged in popularity, but calla lilies have
been subject to fashion's yo-yo. Perhaps for good reason: in
gardens north of New York, flowers rarely arrive before frost
threatens.
</P>
<P>
   New varieties, however, have intriguing leaves as well as a
blossom or two before the time comes to dig the bulbs up and
transform them into houseplants.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, tuberoses often fail to fit their cycle into our
growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Heath's solution is to start them indoors in April on a
heat mat. ``All summer bulbs like warmth,'' he explained, ``and
most prefer moisture. Given that, they'll thrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Calla lilies and tuberoses aside, however, most bulbs perform
just when you need them to. Indeed, one reason for summer bulbs'
new popularity might be that most of them swing into action
immediately in hot weather, filling the gap when the garden is
mired in midsummer lull.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't mind the chore of digging the bulbs up in autumn
and bringing them into a frost-free place, few plants could be
easier to please than amaryllis-like crinums or spider-shaped
hymenocallis. For a splash of midseason color, just add a
crocosmia, with its long wands of bright tubular blossoms jutting
from iris-like leaves. If you yearn for fragrance as well, opt for
acidanthera, recently redesignated as Gladiolus callianthus, with
white maroon-marked nodding star-shaped blossoms on long spikes, a
19th-century heirloom that has slipped back into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another summer bulb that has yet to be
re-embraced: gladiolus. Tall, elegant, great for cut flowers and
easy to grow if you don't mind staking stately spires dense with
blossoms in all colors of the rainbow, gladioluses have one major
strike against them, which is that many people associate them with
funeral parlors.
</P>
<P>
   But the way I figure it, if cannas overcame the obstructions of
taste, can glads be far behind?
</P>
<P>

   THIS WEEK: Plan Future Blooms &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By PATRICIA JONAS
</P>
<P>
   Bearded iris should be divided every four years after flowering;
this can be done through early August. Cut out and discard any
sections damaged by rot or iris borer. Dip healthy three- to 4-inch
pieces of rhizome in a mild bleach solution or dust with fungicide
and replant so that the top of the rhizome is just covered with
soil.
</P>
<P>
   It is not too late to order Autumn crocus (Colchicum) for fall
bloom: Colchicum speciosum Album, a large weather-resistant white,
and C. Waterlily, with double pinkish lilac flowers that do right
by their name, are two to try.
</P>
<P>
   Autumn crocus also refers to the true crocuses that bloom then,
including Saffron crocus (Crocus sativus). They require full sun
and are generally more persnickety about being well drained than
Colchicum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Todd Wichmann and Richard Owen barreled into the
Procter &AMP; Gamble headquarters last month and were about to head
upstairs when the security guard stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for permission to enter a place where they had worked
almost all their adult lives felt ``bizarre-weird,'' Wichmann
(pronounced WICK-man) said as he fiddled with his red visitor's
badge.
</P>
<P>
   He and Owen had just quit their jobs at P&AMP;G to form Redox Brands
Inc., a company that specializes in buying once-famous laundry and
cleaning brands that giants like their former employer are
discarding. Their first _ and so far only _ purchase was Procter &AMP;
Gamble's Oxydol laundry detergent brand, in a deal that calls for
P&AMP;G to continue to be involved in the product. The financial terms
of the deal have not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Redox's timing could not be better: Behemoths like
P&AMP;G, hoping to assuage Wall Street's anxiety over sagging earnings,
are becoming more aggressive in dropping brands that are no longer
among the market leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But building a strong company out of a collection of jilted
labels is tough going. Other companies, notably in the food
industry, have tried; few have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying an orphaned brand isn't necessarily a challenge,'' said
David A. Goldman, director of equity research at SunTrust Equitable
Securities. ``Consolidating them into one entity that makes sense,
has operational efficiencies, and has critical mass, well, that's
another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, many industry experts say, giants like Procter &AMP; Gamble
do not shed brands unless they have a good reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Although P&AMP;G would not comment on its relationship with Redox or
the specifics of the deal, it said in a prepared statement that
Oxydol, which represented a minute portion of company sales, ``no
longer provided a strategic fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxydol was P&AMP;G's oldest brand of laundry detergent, introduced
in 1927. While it has a long history _ it even sponsored the ``Ma
Perkins'' radio show, the first so-called soap opera, in 1933 _
naysayers doubt that a rich heritage convinces consumers to buy a
detergent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Is Oxydol such an ancient brand that it is
valueless and not worth it to revive it?'' said Clive Chajet of
Chajet Consultancy, a branding consultant in New York. ``As far as
I'm concerned, they're starting from scratch in a category where
it's hard to differentiate one brand from another.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Oxydol have been sinking over the decade and are
dwarfed by those of the market leader, P&AMP;G's Tide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, Wichmann, 30, and Owen, 31, are convinced they
will succeed. Their aim is to increase Oxydol's share of the $6
billion market for liquid and powdered detergent to 2 percent in
the next five years from its current 0.1 percent. (By comparison,
Wichmann said, Tide now has around 35 percent of the market.)
</P>
<P>
   Though they are dealing in an old-economy business, they say,
they are helped by some new-economy factors. The expansion of
contract sales makes it easier for them to hire a company to sell
their products. Internet technology allows them to hold ``virtual''
meetings with business contacts, slashing travel costs.
</P>
<P>
   And as companies like Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever scramble to
shed old brands, Wichmann and Owen have a steady stream of product
offerings from which to choose. In addition to Oxydol, for example,
P&AMP;G recently put Biz, a bleach detergent, up for sale. (Wichmann
and Owen would not comment on whether Redox was considering
acquiring it.)
</P>
<P>
   Wichmann, the Redox president, and Owen, the chief operating
officer, also say they have two distinct tactical advantages.
</P>
<P>
   First, instead of buying the leader in small markets _ a model
exemplified by Aurora Foods Inc., which has bought brands including
Duncan Hines, Log Cabin and Van de Kamp's, with some success _ they
will buy small brands in large markets. That way, they can focus on
competing for customers rather than trying to expand a market.
</P>
<P>
   Second, they can tailor their packaging and pricing to fit the
needs of smaller retailers, something that larger, bureaucratized
companies cannot do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago or even five years ago, there was no way to
do what we're doing,'' Wichmann said. ``We want to be a virtual
organization. We don't want any plants. We don't want any money
going to fixed assets.''
</P>
<P>
   He can make such a bold statement in part because he has P&AMP;G in
his corner.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Procter &AMP; Gamble, arguably the American
consumer-products company with the greatest influence among
retailers, will still take care of the ordering, shipping and
billing systems used for Oxydol, which will continue to be made at
a P&AMP;G plant. It also has an undisclosed minority stake in the
company. Redox, based in the Cincinnati suburb of West Chester,
Ohio, will be making the strategic decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Wichmann and Owen acknowledge that their former employer
influences their decisions. ``Our relationship with P&AMP;G is very
important and we do live by their rules,'' Wichmann said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Though bitten early by the entrepreneurial bug, the two men
were, after all, trained by the company whose employees are widely
known as ``Proctoids,'' distinguished by their efficiency and
obedience.
</P>
<P>
   Owen and Wichmann met as interns at the company in the summer of
1991, both researching laundry detergents. They cemented their
relationship when they returned after graduating the next year.
Though both started at P&AMP;G as chemical engineers, Wichmann, who
worked on Oxydol early, later went into marketing while Owen joined
the sales and finance side.
</P>
<P>
   They started business school together in 1994, attending Xavier
University at night. For their final project, the pair designed
American Detergent Corp., a hypothetical company that bought Oxydol
from Procter &AMP; Gamble _ a brand they said they chose somewhat
randomly.
</P>
<P>
   Their professor, Sandy Eustis, was impressed by their enthusiasm
but did not like their business plan. He voiced concerns that have
since been echoed by Redox's critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Why would you want to go into a business that's
dominated by huge players?''' recalled Eustis, who is now executive
director of the Center for Adaptive Management, a nonprofit
research group in Cincinnati. ``It's a slow-growth, mature industry
dominated by large players who spend huge sums of money on consumer
marketing and advertising, and that presents real difficulties for
a smaller, entrepreneurial company.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were not deterred. When the announcement of the Oxydol
sale popped up on the office intranet in March, Wichmann knew he
had to talk to Owen.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G had long neglected Oxydol; the detergent did not even have
the company's fixture of a brand manager to baby-sit the product.
Though P&AMP;G did not see much of a future for the brand, the two men
did.
</P>
<P>
   While he drove home on the night of the announcement, Wichmann
called Owen from his cell phone. All he needed to say was ``Hey
Rich, American Detergent Corporation might be in business.''
</P>
<P>
   As they hatched their plans over the weekend, Wichmann said,
they found themselves in a chicken-and-egg scenario.
</P>
<P>
   They had to convince P&AMP;G to sell the brand to them instead of to
an established company with deep pockets. ``We knew we needed to
have a big angle for Procter &AMP; Gamble to want to do this,'' Owen
said. ``This thing had to be much bigger than just Oxydol.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they needed to assure P&AMP;G that they had strong
backers. But to get those backers, they had to convince venture
capitalists that P&AMP;G was intent on completing the sale. They also
needed to keep their identity a secret so that if the deal did not
go through, they would still have their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really was this covert operation going on,'' Owen said.
Wichmann decided they needed some outside help, so he called
Eustis, who referred him to Robert Buechner, a childhood basketball
buddy and Cincinnati lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer was intrigued with their idea. He helped them write
an anonymous bid and began introducing them to venture capitalists,
bankers and accountants.
</P>
<P>
   During their lunch breaks and before and after work, Wichmann
and Owen would meet with potential backers. They decided to wear
khakis and shirts, the unofficial Procter &AMP; Gamble uniform, to
those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wear a suit at Procter and Gamble, that's a sign you're
interviewing,'' Wichmann said. ``I didn't want to tip my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   After two months of sub rosa maneuvering they had to reveal that
they were the anonymous bidders for Oxydol at P&AMP;G's demand. The two
made a point of telling their respective bosses on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually had one of my bosses say, `Rich, have you thought
this through?'' Owen said. ```What happens if Procter &AMP; Gamble
considers you a competitor?' I thought, I've got my family and my
resume.''
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G was impressed by their plan. Company officials even spoke to
venture capitalists on their behalf, the pair said, and a group of
investors led by Meriwether Capital Corp. in New York agreed to
finance Redox. The deal for Oxydol was completed in a month, and
both men were allowed to keep their jobs until it was done.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Owen and Wichmann have been busy preparing Oxydol for
the first Redox ship date this September. And in a recent
conference call, they discovered some of the difficulties of being
so closely tied to Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   For every 600 boxes sold, the two men want to give retailers 300
boxes free. P&AMP;G's system is not configured to handle free boxes, so
they have to find another way to distribute them. They are also
working on formulating a liquid detergent, and preparing a radio
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they are trying to establish their own identity,
separate from Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Their first trip back to P&AMP;G went well. Former colleagues kept
dropping by, curious about how Owen and Wichmann were making out in
what they call ``the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   While they were getting ready to leave their meeting, Owen
noticed a small green packet of Oxydol on the shelf. ``You guys
were supposed to turn over all of the product!'' he teased the P&AMP;G

ANARCHISM, THE CREED THAT WON'T STAY DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Karl Marx bested the anarchist leader Mikhail Bakunin in a
struggle to shape world revolution a century and a half ago,
anarchism has undergone a half-dozen resurrections and almost as
many deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It was crushed with the Paris Commune in 1871, suppressed in the
United States after an anarchist shot President William McKinley in
1901, destroyed by Franco in the Spanish Civil War of the late
1930s and it withered away with 1960s student radicalism.
Ideologically opposed to power and ambivalent about organization,
anarchists perpetually live on the fringe of great movements _ and
on the verge of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the very qualities that consign anarchism to obscurity also
endow it with many lives, if only as a prefix:
anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-syndicalism, anarcho-mutualism,
anarcho-individualism, anarcho-ecologism. And at the turn of this
century, it is undergoing a fresh resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   Black-masked anarchists stoned chain stores in Seattle during
global trade talks last year. Protesters with giant A's pasted on
their shirts blocked intersections in Washington during
demonstrations against international lending agencies last spring.
They were in the streets of Philadelphia during the Republican
National Convention this week and have promised to stalk the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles this month.
</P>
<P>
   Self-described anarchists are small in number. But anarchism,
broadly construed, is becoming fashionable. There are hints of it
in the way protesters of diverse loyalties _ labor, environmental
and consumer groups among them _ have sought to become a mass but
leaderless movement, a collection of affinity groups that operate
by consensus. Many of those who oppose the institutions that
enforce rules of international capitalism call for a return to
local decision-making, echoing longtime anarchist objections to the
way nation-states usurped the power of cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have often been condemned in the mainstream news
media as imbecilic and chaotic, all action and no theory. But that
is also an anarchist trait. Its adherents have long been dismissed
as uneducated and unwashed. Anarchism's most memorable slogan,
coined by Enrico Malatesta of Italy, is ``propaganda by deed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the decline of socialism, you have seen anarchism go
through a revival as an easy way to oppose global capitalism,''
said Paul Avrich, a leading historian of anarchism who teaches at
Queens College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Avrich, who has written extensively on early-20th-century
American anarchists, said anarchist cells all but disappeared by
the 1970s as the last of the European immigrants who brought the
creed to the United States died. But anarchist groups are
reappearing in every major city, he says. Today they have their own
bookstores, like Blackout Books on the Lower East Side and Social
Anarchism in Baltimore. They read The Match, a popular magazine
published in Tuscon, Ariz., or Fifth Estate, a Detroit newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was probably the first person to call
himself an anarchist when he wrote ``What Is Property?'' in 1840.
(His answer: theft.) Proudhon advocated free bank credit and
rejected parliamentary politics as hopelessly dominated by the
elite. But anarchism was defined and popularized by Bakunin, a
heavily bearded Russian insurrectionist who helped foment uprisings
across Europe in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   Bakunin's motto was, ``The urge to destroy is a creative urge.''
Unlike Marx, Bakunin did not justify his theory as science. He
described anarchists as people who know what they are fighting
against more than what they are fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchism reached critical mass as a revolutionary movement only
once, during the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. But it has long
touched a political and cultural chord in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Henry David Thoreau was an exemplary anarchist, though he never
called himself one. Emma Goldman, a Russian immigrant who advocated
free love, women's rights and armed insurrection, was the best
known of the immigrant anarchists who helped prompt a red scare
around World War I. (She appears in E.L. Doctorow's novel
``Ragtime'' and in Warren Beatty's movie ``Reds.'') In 1927 the
Italian immigrants Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, both
avowed anarchists, were executed after being convicted of killing a
paymaster and his guard at a shoe factory near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchists consider themselves of the left, not the right. But
antigovernment ideas that sound anarchist themes are common across
the political spectrum. John Wayne in many of his Westerns and Mel
Gibson in ``The Patriot'' play reluctant but violent American
heroes called on to smash evil so they can return to a life of
bucolic isolation. The quest for pure rebellion in some punk rock
lyrics reflects the spread of anarchism, or perhaps nihilism _
anarchism without the utopian impulses _ among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has revived anarchism like globalization. Anarchists
are now battling what they see as a concentration of power in
multinational corporations. Many oppose the proliferation of
corporate investment across national boundaries, which they say
allows companies like Nike and General Electric to evade local laws
covering labor and the environment. They have also attacked the
World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the International
Monetary Fund because these are seen as superseding national
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since the 1960s we are actually putting
thought into action,'' said John Zerzan, a leading anarchist
thinker who lives in Eugene, Ore. He distinguishes anarchists from
traditional labor and environmental groups that oppose many of the
same aspects of globalization, though he's not opposed to sharing
the stage with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are succeeding because the liberals failed. We are less
polite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zerzan, 56, is a leading proponent of anarcho-primitivism, which
combines radical environmentalism with an extreme antitechnology
bent. His essays and his book ``Future Primitive'' espouse a theory
that time and technology are not neutral scientific realities but
carefully constructed ways to enslave people. The computer and the
Internet, for example, atomize society, create new divisions of
labor, demand ever more efficiency and consume ever more leisure
time, he says. To cope with the increasing strains of our
technology-driven society, alienated people by the millions are
resorting to drugs like Ritilin and Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have learned is that our problem is not just control
of capital. It is also science and technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zerzan says that society should return to the Stone Age. He says
that more than 12,000 years ago, before agriculture allowed a class
of people to leave food production to others, hunter-gatherers were
as intelligent and as healthy as people today. And he argues that
an old anthropological conundrum _ why it took man so long to
develop agriculture _ should now be posed in reverse. ``The
question now is why we ever developed agriculture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zerzan writes long hand. He does not use the Internet and owns
no car. He lives in cooperative housing in Eugene, which he has
helped turn into a beehive of anarchist activity. Like Bakunin and
earlier American anarchists, he argues that property damage is a
legitimate tactic, an effective way to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not library theorists,'' he said. ``We are activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other anarchists call anarcho-primitivism a disturbing
trend, and, perhaps not surprisingly, sectarian strife among the
anarchists is rampant. An old-guard supports ethical anarchism, a
type of modified socialism that calls for eliminating the
nation-state while embracing nonauthoritarian local government.
Ethical anarchists reject violence, and some view technology like
the Internet as tools to achieve freedom. Many also say that
anarcho-primitivists tend to be antiwork and antiworker, which
forecloses the possibility of a lasting alliance with labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   The anarcho-primitives ``carry a black flag in one hand and a
welfare check in the other,'' an anarchist named Janet Biehl wrote
in a recent Internet essay. Others have called Zerzan a
``McAnarchist'' who dumbs down anarchism and corrupts ``young
gullibles'' with mystical visions of life before civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Bookchin, an 80-year-old Vermont-based social theorist
who calls himself a communalist, has sharply criticized recent
trends in anarchism, though he claims his own writings have
contributed to the rise of Direct Action Network and other
antiglobalization protest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bookchin wrote ``Post-Scarcity Anarchism'' in the 1960s. In that
book he merged environmentalism and anarchism into a broader theory
of how the state and capitalism are at war with nature. But he says
some anarchist groups have taken the ecological message too far,
becoming misanthropic nihilists who ignore anarchism's core
humanitarian message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when there is rising interest among young people,''
Bookchin said, ``we are shooting ourselves in the foot.''

   GOP CONVENTION FOLLOW-UP
</P>
<P>
   CVN-BUSH _ PHILADELPHIA _ George Bush's convention took great
strides in rewriting the GOP story from the party of status quo to
the party of reform, from the party of protecting wealth to the
party of providing help, from the party of narrow interests to the
party of inclusion. But even as the party's only openly gay
congressional representative was addressing Bush's convention,
Bush's platform committee was voting not to soften anti-gay
language in the platform. This dichotomy has been evident
throughout the campaign, and the question remains: Which is the
real George W. Bush, and which is the real GOP? (Montgomery, Dayton
Daily News).

   CVN-REAL-GOP _ PHILADELPHIA _ George Bush's convention took
pains to portray the Republican Party as one in transition from the
party of narrow interests to the party of inclusion. But even as
the party's only openly gay congressional representative was
addressing Bush's convention, Bush's platform committee was voting
not to soften anti-gay language in the platform. Amid other such
discrepancies, the question remains: which is the real George W.
Bush, which is the real GOP. (Sherman) Moving Friday.

   CVN-GORE _ WASHINGTON _ Now that the Republican National
Convention is history, Vice President Al Gore needs to counter its
effects in two main ways: deliver an acceptance speech in Los
Angeles that counters the style and substance of George W. Bush's,
and choose a running mate who compares well with Dick Cheney.

   VOTER _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Sen. John McCain may have caused Gov.
George W. Bush plenty of headaches in the bitterly contested
Republican presidential primary, but, if Ohio is any indication, he
may have done Bush and all Republican candidates a big favor. The
sparks flying off McCain's Straight Talk Express generated a wave
of interest among voters, particularly Republican voters, that
hasn't been seen in a primary in many years. According to newly
released statewide voter registration figures compiled by the Ohio
secretary of state's office, that wave almost doubled the ranks of
the state's registered Republicans. Democratic registration also
grew, but the registered Republican increase more than doubled the
Democratic gain. (McCall, Dayton Daily News)

CONCORDE BRINGS AIRLINES ADVANTAGES THAT ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: See also CONCORDE-CRASH.)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The crash of the Air France supersonic Concorde brought
down a plane that by common measurements can hardly be profitable,
given its high maintenance costs, daunting fuel bills, little
passenger space, and no cargo. Yet any decision to permanently
ground the Concorde could have deep financial implications for the
two airlines that run it.
</P>
<P>
   Airline industry analysts say the Concorde is part of a sweeping
strategy, particularly by British Airways, to lure high-end
corporate travelers, the favored target of airlines, to the
Concorde's speedy flights between the financial capitals of London
and New York, and to connecting flights on slower aircraft beyond.
Its loss, they say, would divert these customers to other airlines,
notably in the United States, or to corporate jet travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to tie in your very high-end customers,'' said Damien
Horth, an analyst at ABN-Amro in London.
</P>
<P>
   Neither airline has suggested it would quit flying the Concorde
because of the crash, the first deadly accident in the plane's
25-year history. But talk that the Concorde has outlived its
usefulness has persisted, and no other supersonic jetliners are in
development.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris Friday, Air France employees called on the airline to
resume flying the remaining six Concordes, which were grounded by
the French transport ministry until experts can clarify the cause
of the crash July 25 that killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways resumed its Concorde flights the day after the
crash, but its Concordes have been flying half empty since then,
and mechanical and safety issues have haunted nearly every flight.
On Tuesday, for instance, the London-New York flight was delayed 75
minutes because of an engine problem and the passengers had to
board a second Concorde, losing most of the time they would have
gained because of the plane's high speed.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from the Concorde is estimated to account for only 1
percent to 2 percent of the total at Air France, and slightly more
at British Airways. Yet Robin Horne, an analyst at HSBC Securities
in London, says neither airline is entirely open about the
Concorde's financial performance, and he believes that the planes
``don't make much money.''
</P>
<P>
   Depreciation _ the decreased value of something because of wear
and tear _ has never been a factor in accounting for the operating
cost of the Concorde, as it is for other aircraft. The reason is
that the planes were in effect given to the airlines by the British
and French governments, which footed the bill for their
development.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost alone among commercial jetliners, the Concorde
carries a cockpit crew of three instead of two, and it lacks cargo
capacity. Crew members work fewer hours than on subsonic planes,
and their training is almost twice as long as that of other pilots,
and hence more costly.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Concorde is more expensive to maintain. British
Airways says its seven Concordes get up to 57 hours of maintenance
for every hour in the air, far more than what is accorded subsonic
aircraft. Fuel consumption, too, makes them expensive to run. The
Concorde burns about 4,670 gallons of kerosene for every hour of
flight, compared with 2,340 gallons for the Boeing 747-400,
Boeing's biggest aircraft. Yet the 747 carries roughly 400
passengers, four times that of the Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many analysts believe that a modern Boeing 747 or 777,
with several dozen first-class passengers, who pay only about 20
percent less than on the Concorde, easily earns as much as or more
than a Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how profitable they are,'' said Matthew Stainer,
an analyst at SG Securities. Given its gas-guzzling habits, he
added, the Concorde has felt the brunt of recent increases in
airline fuel prices ``more than most of the fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite its marginal profitability, analysts say the
Concorde more than earns its keep, at least for British Airways, by
its ability to draw large numbers of first-class and business-class
travelers, who pay high premiums. Cutting the Concorde out of the
fleet, said Daniel Solon, director of Avmark International, a
London airline consulting firm, would expose the airlines to a
``double hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is hard to quantify, as economies globalized and New
York and London emerged in recent years as the world's principal
financial centers, British Airways has capitalized on increased
traffic between Wall Street and the City, London's financial
district _ effectively using the Concorde to lure what some
analysts refer to as the ``Goldman Sachs crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly on westbound traffic, analysts said, the Concorde
is attractive to corporate executives and investment bankers since
it enables them to cheat the clock, arriving in New York at an
earlier local hour than they left London or Paris.
</P>
<P>
   A further inducement to the premium traveler has been the
Concorde service's preferential treatment of passengers that
expedites them through customs, passport control and baggage
checking, and offers them a traveling environment closer to that of
a corporate jet, yet at supersonic speed.
</P>
<P>
   But both British Airways and Air France have also been able to
attract premium travelers from farther afield, enabling customers
from, say, Dubai or Moscow, to travel to London or Paris, then take
the Concorde on to New York. ``Concorde is a fantastic marketing
tool for BA,'' said HSBC's Horne.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Concorde, to be sure, some of these travelers would
shift to subsonic flights offered by British Airways or Air France.
But experts like Solon believe many would instead use corporate
jets. Others, particularly Americans, would desert British Airways
and Air France, preferring to fly their customary United States
airline, they said.

   ARAFAT-ARABS (Cairo, Egypt) _ On the face of it, Arab support
for the Palestinian position has never been so seamless. Or so it
would seem as the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has
crisscrossed the Middle East to garner support from his
counterparts and build a defensive line for his position on a peace
deal with Israel. One after the other, Arab kings and presidents
have said they stand behind Arafat, no questions asked, as he holds
out for Palestinian sovereignty over Arab East Jerusalem and the
right of return for Palestinian refugees. But behind the
uncompromising public statements, more pragmatic approaches are
also being discussed seriously for the first time on those
thorniest of disputed issues. By Susan Sachs.

   NY-SINATRA-STATUE (New York) _ The Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy
got a spot on Times Square in 1936 for his heroics on the
battlefield and the streets of Hell's Kitchen. George M. Cohan
followed in 1959 as a tribute to one of show business' greatest
song and dance men. Mayor Rudy Giuliani says there is room for one
more, Frank Sinatra, whose last big hit, in 1980, was ``New York,
New York.'' But the hushed refrain playing around Times Square is
not so gushing or welcoming. No one really wants to say so, at
least not loudly enough to irk Giuliani or offend the Sinatra
family, but the plan to erect a statue of Ol' Blue Eyes on a
traffic island at 44th Street and Broadway has acquired some
powerful enemies. The local community board, along with some Times
Square developers, isn't crazy about the idea. And theater moguls
say the square's theatrical tradition would be shortchanged by
showcasing a singer and film actor who started in Hoboken, made a
quick splash at the Paramount Theater and then followed fame and
fortune west of the Hudson.

BRITONS, FETING QUEEN MUM, 100, RECALL THE EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Goodness, what will they do if the Queen Mother makes
it to 101 next year?
</P>
<P>
   Friday, as Britain's beloved Queen Mum turned 100, it seemed as
if the Empire was in full bloom and Queen Victoria was still riding
through London's streets in a horse-drawn carriage.
</P>
<P>
   But those days are gone, so it was left to the Queen Mum, by far
the most popular royal and the first member of her family to reach
the century mark, to wave from her open carriage as she journeyed
from her home at Clarence House down The Mall to Buckingham Palace
for her birthday lunch with her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 40,000 people lined the route, then serenaded the
Queen Mum with a chorus of ``Happy Birthday'' when she stepped onto
the palace balcony, surrounded by four generations of a royal
family that has survived a turbulent century.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hoopla, the most recent polls show that support for
the monarchy is slipping, as Britons become less bound by the
long-held traditions. While the republican ideal of abolishing the
monarchy and installing an elected head of state still seems a long
way off, neither is the monarchy anywhere as secure as when
Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the Queen Mum, was born in the last year of
Queen Victoria's reign.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrations, capping a month of commemorations, seemed as
much about shoring up the monarchy as they were about the birthday
golden girl.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mum embodies many admired qualities of the British:
stoicism in the face of overwhelming circumstances,
straightforwardness, fierce loyalty to king and country. One
brother was killed in World War I; another was taken prisoner. She
never complained.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband had to assume the throne after his brother,
King Edward VIII, abdicated to marry American divorcee Wallis
Simpson, the Queen Mum helped the stuttering new king by holding
his hand and calming him. But, despite her trademark smile, the
Queen Mum was a formidable enemy. It was she who insisted that
Edward and Simpson remain in exile.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mum won the enduring admiration of Britons when she
refused to seek refuge outside London during the Blitz. She also
refused to ship off her two daughters to escape the war's
hardships. Her visits to bombed-out Londoners, standing in high
heels amid the rubble of the East End, were extraordinary
propaganda during the darkest days of World War II. Recognizing
this perhaps, Adolf Hilter once called her ``the most dangerous
woman in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But being so rooted in something that occurred more than a half
century ago also explains why a growing number of Britons don't
care about the Queen Mum, much less the rest of the royals. On
Thursday a 17-year-old who pleaded guilty to trashing a McDonald's
restaurant in London during an anti-capitalism demonstration three
months ago appeared in court wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the
slogan, ``Queen Mum, hurry up and die.'' The teen attended Eton,
the exclusive school that has educated many an aristocrat and whose
current students include Princes William and Harry, the sons of the
late Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Such disrespect would have been unthinkable just a generation
ago, especially from an Eton student. But Britain is changing, even
if, it appears, the Queen Mum never did.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions between traditionalists and reformers is reflected
in how newspapers have handled the Queen Mum's birthday. The
conservative Daily Telegraph has run story after story, and picture
after picture, as part of its exhaustive coverage of the Queen Mum.
It has been rare to pick up a Telegraph over the last year and not
find a photograph or story about the Queen Mum.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Telegraph, the Times, the other conservative
broadsheet, published a supplement with numerous photographs of and
stories about the Queen Mum, who has given only one interview in
her 100 years on earth, in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, The Guardian, the leading liberal newspaper, which
makes no secret of its wish to ditch the monarchy, ran a story to
celebrate the 11 other Britons who turned 100 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Preston, the Guardian's former editor, recently wrote a
novel predicting the demise of the monarchy, suggesting Elizabeth
II will be the last monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Such republican sentiments seemed overly optimistic as the
British, some of whom spent the night in sleeping bags outside
Buckingham Palace to get a good seat, cheered the Queen Mum. She
rewarded them with her trademark wave and smile. That smile reveals
a set of ungainly teeth, untouched by cosmetic dental work,
evidence of the lack of pretense that endears her to millions of
ordinary Britons.
</P>
<P>
   At the Queen's annual garden party at the rear of Buckingham
Palace last summer, the Queen and her husband, Philip, the Duke of
Edinburgh, were politely applauded as they walked through the
assembled masses of guests. But when the Queen Mum, still
recovering from hip surgery, gamely made her way across the great
lawn with a cane, the applause grew louder and everyone smiled. The
applause for the Queen was perfunctory; the applause for her mother
was heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mum has no secret to her longevity, though she is fond
of a gin and Dubonnet before lunch. She is a horse racing fanatic,
and devours the novels of Dick Francis, the jockey-turned-author
who makes sure she gets the first copy of his racetrack thrillers.
She is, according to those who know her, a formidable woman of
considered opinions. With palace approval, the Telegraph recently
ran a collection of those opinions.
</P>
<P>
   On hearing the national anthem on television, she urged a
companion to turn it off, saying, ``So embarrassing unless one is
there. Like hearing the Lord's Prayer when playing canasta.''
</P>
<P>
   She was unimpressed when T.S. Eliot gave her and her family a
private reading of his poem ``The Waste Land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had this rather lugubrious man in a suit, and he read a
poem _ I think it was called The Desert _ and first the girls got
the giggles, and then I did, and then even the king. Such a gloomy
man,'' she said of Eliot. ``Looked as though he worked in a bank,
and we didn't understand a word.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, when she learned that her supper would be late because
the kitchen staff, some of whom are gay, were having an argument,
she icily replied, ``My compliments to the old queens down there,
but this old queen is hungry and wants her dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she was said to never have been overbearing, she remains
a mother as much as a Queen Mum. When the Queen once asked for a
second glass of wine with her lunch, the Queen Mum shot her a look
and a subtle admonishment: ``You know you have to reign all
afternoon.''

WHAT'S A BUS STOP FOR? A WEDDING, OF COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAMAL E. WATSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was standing in the pouring rain at the corner of
Massachusetts Avenue and St. Stephen Street on March 14, 1997
waiting for MBTA bus number one to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   As his eyes wandered in search of his ride home, he spotted her
_ a woman in a dark raincoat with a warm, wide smile and long,
lovely black hair.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, was waiting for the bus. They started talking, mostly
about music, and there was a hint of a spark. So they exchanged
telephone numbers. He called and slowly, over strolls through the
Back Bay and concerts at Symphony Hall, they fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years and five months after a chance encounter on a
gloomy winter's day, Michael Gandolfi, 44, and Maria Martinello,
38, are about to become husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   But when they exchange vows Sunday, it won't be inside a church
or at city hall. No, there is really only one place where it could
happen: The same bus stop in the shadow of Symphony Hall where they
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately after I asked Maria to marry me, I had this crazy
idea that we should get married at the bus stop,'' said Gandolfi, a
music composer and teacher at the New England Conservatory of Music
who also has composed for the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Martinello said she quickly embraced her finace's untraditional
idea for their nuptials, inspired by Gandolfi's passion for the
work of Luis Bunuel, the Spanish-Mexican surrealist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this to be done in the right spirit,'' said
Martinello, a graduate student at Harvard University. ``We wanted
to have fun with what we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of the usual hoity-toity, expensive invitations, the
couple sent computer-generated bus tickets to family and friends
asking them to make their reservations early.
</P>
<P>
   The 45 guests will arrive for the wedding by bus, of course. And
while a real MBTA bus could not be procured, the chartered bus
picking up guests in Watertown, will be decorated to look like the
familiar yellow and white public buses.
</P>
<P>
   The bus company even found an MBTA bus driver who agreed to don
his uniform and transport the bride and groom to the wedding and to
the reception in Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   When the bus arrives at the stop where he met his bride,
Gandolfi will emerge in a tuxedo. Martinello, who will wear a white
wedding dress, will ride to the ceremony in a separate car.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gandolfi's close friends will be by his side as he wraps
a flower around the bus stop sign, signaling to Martinello to begin
the processional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll walk up Massachusetts Avenue, wait for the red light, and
cross at Huntington Avenue,'' Martinello said. ``I'll come up to
the bus stop and Michael will be waiting for me. Everyone on the
bus will be able to see me through the windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Once united at the stop, the two will step on board the faux
number one bus and be united by Osvaldo Golijov
</P>
<P>
   Golijov is neither a preacher nor a judge, but was granted
special authority by Governor Paul Cellucci to preside over the
ceremony under a state policy that allows anyone to perform a
wedding. The policy involves a long application process and gives a
person permission to officiate at a state-sanctioned wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous,'' said Golijov, a composer and a close
friend of Gandolfi. ``This is the first time that I've performed a
wedding, but I think this is so beautiful. It's like giving
significance to something that is very significant to them.''

he said. ``He's so excited.''

<P>
   Magnificent promises are always to be suspected.
</P>
<P>
   So said Theodore Parker, a decorated Army officer from the
mid-20th century. His words are wiser than ever today.
</P>
<P>
   On April 7, James Clark, founder of Netscape, co-founder of
Healtheon/WebMD and all-around Silicon Valley pioneer, astounded
investors by vowing to buy up to $200 million of Healtheon stock.
The shares of the company, an Internet health care concern, had
crashed along with other Web-based stocks from $75.1875 in January
to $21.6875 in April. Even on today's Wall Street, where $200
million may no longer qualify as big money, Clark's was a
magnificent promise. The stock jumped 35 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more confident than ever in Healtheon/WebMD's vision of
connecting physicians, payers and consumers via the Internet,''
Clark said on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the announcement, the company said that Clark and
his family owned 11.7 million shares of Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   Four months have passed. It is time for the promise police to
check on Clark's progress.
</P>
<P>
   According to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Clark bought 450,000 shares in April, at a cost of
$8.78 million. In May, as the stock was falling, Clark's buying
seemed to wane. He bought only 25,000 shares, for $311,000. In
June, the buys stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Filings for July are not yet available. But at the rate Clark is
buying, it will take roughly five and a half years for him to buy
$200 million of stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Clark offered an explanation for why he
didn't buy more Healtheon shares. ``I made all the purchases that I
was allowed to make under rules of the SEC, which restricted me in
a way frankly I was not aware of when we first made the
announcement,'' he said. ``I was restricted to not be on the bid
side and I was only able to respond to offers of stock.''
</P>
<P>
   But an SEC spokesman said that while there were restrictions on
the sale of shares by insiders, there were no prohibitions when
they buy. There is only a so-called safe harbor rule that provides
certain conditions which, if met, will make it clear to regulators
that an executive is not buying shares to manipulate their price.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Clark was exercising great care not to roil regulators
with his purchases. When asked why his buying fell so significantly
in May and ceased in June, he said he was simply following the
direction of Healtheon's corporate lawyer. ``The company told me
when I could and when I could not buy stock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is surely disappointing news to Healtheon shareholders who
bought on Clark's bullish announcement. The stock has fallen 56
percent since then, closing at $12.875 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Clark's intentions were undoubtedly good, Robert Gabele,
director of insider research at First Call/Thomson Financial, said
it was wise for investors to greet all buyback announcements with a
healthy skepticism. ``Don't jump to the conclusion at the
announcement of a buyback that the stock will actually be
purchased,'' he said. ``A lot of times, insiders have emotional
attachments to their stock. When things settle down and common
sense takes over, the buyback may not get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he remained a big believer in the company and would
have bought more Healtheon shares if he could have. Oddly, then,
Healtheon shareholders have only the company to blame for keeping
this well-heeled bull out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But Healtheon should be held accountable for something else.
Sure, Wall Street is all about positive spin today, but where was
the news release announcing that Clark's intent to buy $200 million
in stock had been stopped, if only temporarily? Crowing about a
planned purchase of stock and leaving shareholders in the dark
about its hiatus is just plain cheap.

THE LOSERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 06, 2000)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In handling the GOP's extremists so effectively last week,
George W. Bush set forth a vision of the Republican party as he
wants it to be eight years from now, not the way it is today. It
may gain him the opportunity to try to make it so.
</P>
<P>
   All the bitter divisions that made it possible for Bill Clinton
and the Democrats to govern for eight years were glossed over, for
a time. Tax cranks, culture warriors, isolationsts, Clinton haters:
the tempestuous souls who made such a shambles of Republican
conventions for the last 12 years simply were excluded from a
convention role.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, Jack Kemp, Pete Wilson, Ross Perot, Newt Gingrich,
Henry Hyde, Kenneth Starr, Bill Bennett, Pat Buchanan, Jerry
Falwell, Pat Robertson, were scarcely to be seen. Even campaign
finance-reformer John McCain, accorded a prime-time speaking spot
Tuesday night, was banished on the final day to Washington -- until
Bush staffers called him back.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is elected, he'll get a chance to try to keep his
factions in line. At the very least, he dispelled any lingering
doubts that he is not in charge. Before passing on to the
Democrats, however, let's take a look at how the Losers (at least
the opinion-makers among them) spent the week.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bartley passed the evenings doing on-line chats with
readers of the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal on its new
web site, www.opinionjournal.com. The editor of the page since
1972, Bartley attacked Bill Clinton with implacable fury from the
very first. But this spring the editor-for-life moved on to a
weekly column.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, deputy Daniel Henninger has taken over much daily
management, and the page is adulterating the purity of its views in
some interesting ways. It still permitted itself an outraged wheeze
last week on behalf of ``the missing managers'' -- Henry Hyde and
the other leaders of the impeachment trial, who were forbidden any
role in the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Amity Shlaes, a Journal editorial page alumna who now writes a
column for the Financial Times, attended a rump Republican
convention in a seaside New Jersey town. There, she reported, a
hundred ``furious'' congressmen, local activists, think-tank
authors and donors did ``what Republicans do when no cameras are
around: grumble, roar and plot revolt.''
</P>
<P>
   They also listened to Schlaes' theory of why the party does best
when operating with a bunker mentality. ``The Democrats enjoy
support from America's unions,'' she wrote. ``In contrast,
Republicans have no automatic electoral base, and must convince
voters anew in every campaign. Nothing works better to achieve this
than firebreathing.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for the party of Big Business.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in the conservative ``Weekly Standard,'' executive
editor Fred Barnes explained why ``California Doesn't Matter any
More.'' The short answer is that it's gone Democratic. With one
fifth of the electoral votes necessary to win the presidency, only
a landslide for Bush will put it in the Republican column --in
which case the candidate doesn't need it. The election will be won
in the Midwest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. The longer hypothesis of California's supposed
irrelevance was little less convincing. Barnes has determined that
the future no longer happens in California. ``Until the 1990s, the
state previewed practically everything that happened in America,
both socially and politically,'' he wrote. Urban violence. White
backlash. Tax-cut fever. Term limits. Richard Nixon. Ronald Reagan.
They all began in California.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996 governor Pete Wilson sought to become the third
California Republican to make it to the White House on a new,
cutting-edge platform: anti-affirmative action, anti-immigration,
anti-gay.
</P>
<P>
   He never made it past the first round of primaries, and the
Republican party in California was crushed. From 40 percent of the
Latino vote in 1994, the GOP share of the California vote dropped
to 17 percent in 1998. Blacks and gays similarly turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The California disaster _ Congressional redistricting in 2002
may by itself to return control of the House of Representatives to
the Democrats -- had more to do than any other factor with the
resolutely inclusive tone of last week's Republican convention. The
country's Latino population is skyrocketing. The Republicans cannot
afford to ignore, much less alienate, what had previously been a
relatively conservative bloc of votes.
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, still plenty of radicalism in the mainstream
Republican Party. Its economists have declared war on the mixed
economy, taking aim at Social Security in particular. But that is
another story.
</P>
<P>
   By showing that he can handle his party's zealots, George W.
Bush has given himself a good chance to win the presidency. But the
strategy is not without its risks. As William Safire of the New
York Times _ another of the big Losers _ put it last week, ``If
Bush's smiling-in-lockstep strategy backfires, the next GOP
convention may be much livelier.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But if Gore wins _ or even if the GOP Losers escape
from the purdah to which Bush has sent them _ the next Republican
convention may not matter very much either.
</P>

<P>
   Until recently, Nadja Swarovski wore a bracelet of rose quartz
beads said to bring the wearer luck in love. ``But it was no use at
all,'' she complained. So these days Swarovski, the New York
representative of an Austrian crystal company founded by her
family, puts her faith in a wide mesh cuff that might have come
straight out of ``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   In her arsenal of charms, the outsize bauble is an item of heavy
artillery. ``It makes me think of Wonder Woman _ I find it very
empowering,'' said Swarovski, who wears the cuff in the hope it
will give her an aura of Glamazonian invulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   When Estelle Leeds, a New York photo agent, needs a little boost
from the spirit world, she piles on jade bracelets, whose soothing
green hue is believed in the Far East to possess healing qualities.
The magic of such amulets may be mostly in the wearer's mind, but
don't tell that to Leeds. ``Jade has had a good effect on my
business,'' she insisted. ``Since I've worn it, I seem to get a lot
more work.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women are members of the vastly expanding tribe of New
Yorkers who, trusting nothing to chance, attempt to ward off evil
or beguile the gods by draping themselves in exotic beads and
talismans. Beetles and Buddhas, scarabs, pentagrams and pale pink
quartz _ any of these may function as a symbol of sincere religious
belief. But in the age of Spirituality Lite, they are also likely
to attest to the wearer's inner grooviness, just as her Jimmy Choo
mules speak of her up-to-date chic.
</P>
<P>
   Which might go a way toward explaining why they have lately cast
their spell not just on neo-hippies, religious seekers and the
doggedly contrarian souls who first gave them cachet in the 1960s,
but also on fashion addicts and otherwise conventional types with
no particular New Age creed.
</P>
<P>
   So ubiquitous is the second group that a random survey in Times
Square the other day turned up no fewer than one in four passersby
wearing some interpretation of a charm or amulet _ jewelry believed
by some cultures to be imbued with magic to ward off evil or bring
good luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly see a lot of this jewelry _ everything from
Egyptian ankhs to Celtic and Druid symbols,'' said Richard Leonard,
a vice president at the Zandl Group, a New York youth-marketing
firm, whose clients include the Limited. ``Whether people are
buying them for their aesthetic value or their spiritual heritage
I'm not sure, but talismans and charms have definitely crossed into
the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   At boutiques and gift shops, in airports and on street corners,
charm vendors are springing up like ragweed, selling Mideastern
Hands of Fatima and miniature Chinese turtles, alongside knockoffs
of last year's wildly popular crystal-beaded power bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;M, the cheap-chic emporium on Fifth Avenue, peddles a version
of the power bracelet that is so cheap ($2) that shoppers buy them
by the fistful. The store also offers geometric-beaded chokers and
feathered necklaces that look as if they had been pilfered from a
Native American burial ground.
</P>
<P>
   Kirna Zabete, MZ Wallace and Hedra Prue are among the downtown
Manhattan purveyors of hip who keep reinventing the lucky charm
genre. Their inventory includes crystal drop ``energy'' earrings
and pendants, and the latest twist on the power bracelet, a slender
piece of rawhide or scarlet ribbon meant to stay knotted on the
wrist until the wearer's wish comes true.
</P>
<P>
   Kamuti Kiteme, the president and co-founder of Polyverse, an
Internet company, rarely removes his Buddha pendant, a small gold
charm that was a gift from his kick-boxing partner. ``Call it a
luck charm, if you will,'' he said. ``It keeps bad things from
happening to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Morris, the social anthropologist and author of ``Body
Guards'' (Elements, 1999), a coffee-table book about amulets, said
in an interview that, judging by the masses of New Yorkers and
Londoners he has seen sporting charms, a great many people feel the
world is a menacing place, and they need protection from the spirit
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can laugh, but I blame TV news,'' Morris, said, emitting a
small groan. ``Every time you turn it on, you see another disaster.
You can't escape.''
</P>
<P>
   Amulets can also symbolize an aversion to technology, said
Leonard, the marketing consultant. ``All these new tools that
people are using but don't understand _ that's what's fueling
contemplation of greater powers.''
</P>
<P>
   In an increasingly complex and artificial world, ``people find
comfort in something that is natural,'' said Kazuko, a
first-name-only designer of raw-crystal-and-gold-wire jewelry sold
at Barneys New York (devotees include Bianca Jagger and Sue
Mengers, the Hollywood agent).
</P>
<P>
   Michele Quan and Robin Renzi, who own Me &AMP; Ro, a New
Age-inspired line of jewelry, are offering silver cuffs and bangles
with Sanskrit inscriptions from the Bhagavad-Gita. And when Aurora
Lopez and Steven Alan open Borealis, a jewelry boutique, in NoLIta
this month, they will showcase silver amulets by a Mexican jewelry
designer, Beth Orduna, and handbags by Jade Jagger embroidered with
trident symbols. ``All these things resonate magic,'' Lopez
declared.
</P>
<P>
   For some designers, they also resonate healing powers. Zoe
Metro, the designer for Stella Pace, one of the companies that
spawned last summer's power bracelet mania, is packaging her latest
collection of gold and lapis, bronze and onyx beads in plastic
prescription-drug vials. The labels say things like ``prescribed to
infuse your being with love,'' and ``Career Queen . . . glass
ceilings beware.''
</P>
<P>
   Even fashion and beauty heavyweights like MAC, the cosmetics
maker, and Danskin, of leotard fame, now use charms to promote or
enhance their products. MAC is offering an amulet with a groove
designed to hold its fragrances. And Danskin recently sent fashion
editors samples of its new ``Zen'' yoga togs, packaged with
polished, quarter-size pebbles. The pebbles are meant to be rubbed
between forefinger and thumb _ a Zen-inspired variation on worry
beads.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing amulets, the more outlandish the better, is partly a
legacy of the '60s. During that decade, spiritual and cultural
sampling became the order of the day. Many people took a kind of
supermarket approach to religion, shopping from a variety of
choices before finding a faith that suited them.
</P>
<P>
   The wearing of charms today suggests a similar mind-set. ``Some
people feel that amulets attract or bring forward the power they
represent,'' said Joe Zuchowski, who manages Enchantments, a
Manhattan boutique for aspiring Wiccans, or modern-day witches.
``But,'' he added offhandedly, ``other people might wear them
because they go with their outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, wearing charms attests to nothing more than a gauzy
wishful thinking. On a recent trip to Hawaii, Ally Tomi, a creative
director at Coty International, the cosmetics giant, bought a chain
with a pendant that reads ``Aloha.'' She wears it wherever she
goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps me create my own little aura and gets me through my
New York life,'' Tomi said. ``Sure, the taxi driver is screaming at
me, but I'm thinking `aloha,''' she said, pronouncing the word with
a lilt. ``It creates a sense of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wearing this for myself, not for other people,'' she said.
``Still, when they read `aloha,' their mood might change, too.''

CLINTON TO VISIT COLOMBIA AS PART OF ANTI-DRUG EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTHA'S VINEYARD, Mass. _ President Clinton will make a one-day
trip to Colombia this month to support its struggle against
narcotics and spotlight the $1.3 billion aid package that Congress
approved last month, the White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia's success is profoundly in the interest of the United
States,'' Clinton said in a statement released here Friday after he
had arrived with his wife and daughter for several days of vacation
and political fund-raising events. ``A peaceful, democratic and
economically prosperous Colombia will help promote democracy and
stability throughout the hemisphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The package proposed by Clinton and passed by the House and
Senate will equip and train military units assigned to fight
cocaine traffickers, who supply an estimated 90 percent of the
cocaine that enters the United States. Along with 18 Blackhawk
helicopters and 42 Huey 2 helicopters to ferry anti-drug forces,
the package includes money to promote judicial reform, human rights
protection and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   The money did not clear Congress without controversy. Opponents
complained that much of the money went to the Colombian army, which
has been accused of human rights abuses, and that the United States
might be dragged into an internal conflict in which it is sometimes
difficult to separate drug traffickers from anti-government
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   To highlight the bipartisan nature of the aid, Clinton will
travel with lawmakers of both parties, including House Speaker
Dennis Hastert and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said Clinton's visit on Aug. 30 is
meant to show solidarity with President Andres Pastrana, who is
fighting economic woes as well as drug traffickers, leftist
guerrillas and rightist paramilitary units. The trip will follow a
similar mission to Nigeria to support Olusegun Obasanjo, the first
democratically elected president there in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official involved in the Colombia efforts
said: ``Much of the U.S. assistance money will go to the south of
the country, where the majority of the coca fields are based.
You're going to have counternarcotics battalions of the army going
in and helping to secure these fields, and you're going to have
police going in and helping to dismantle laboratories and to
eradicate the coca production.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said security would be a top priority on the trip.
Clinton will not remain overnight in Colombia but will fly from
Washington and return that evening. In announcing the visit, the
White House noted that Colombia has one of the highest homicide and
kidnapping rates and is a dangerous working environment for U.S.
officials and other citizens.
</P>
<P>
   When President George Bush visited Colombia in 1990, guards
blanketed Cartagena, where he attended a conference of Latin
American leaders. Bush was shuttled to the event in one of a swarm
of helicopters to prevent potential attackers from knowing which
copter he was in.

   PHILADELPHIA _ Just as George W. Bush was moving to accept the
Republican presidential nomination here last week, Bill Clinton,
the lame-duck Democrat who won the presidency by defeating Bush's
father in 1992, derided the younger Bush. Clinton contended Bush's
campaign is much based on the fact his ``daddy was president.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Clinton wanted to more correctly characterize Bush the
Younger's 2000 campaign against Clinton's vice president, Al Gore,
he would have been much more on the money comparing it to his own
campaign in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, the general Democratic view of GWB much more
resembles that which the Democrats had of the elder Bush's
predecessor, Ronald Reagan, than it does of former President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While neither comparison _ particularly the former _ likely
would please Clinton, if he's honest he'll acknowledge its
veracity. So, too, would that be true for the Texas governor, whose
nearly hourlong acceptance speech Thursday night got much _ if not
most _ of its length from interruptions for cheering, standing
ovations and widespread acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination
primarily because American Democrats wanted so desperately to
regain the White House from the Republicans' 12-year-occupancy of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of Bush the Younger's greatest political appeals
to his fellow GOPers is their widespread conviction he can win _
can defeat Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, GWB may have an even greater edge in 2000 than Clinton
had in 1992. On the whole, Bush is far better liked personally by
the vast majority in the activist ranks of his party than Clinton
was in his.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest Clinton was widely disliked back then,
but there was a pretty great clump of Dems _ notably those
officeholders in Washington _ who didn't much like Clinton but
accepted him because he was their best shot at regaining the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, when it was time to start mounting a campaign for the
Dem nomination in 1992, not many Dems were willing to plunge in
against Bush the Elder, who was riding fantastically high
politically after the then-recognized enormous success of Desert
Storm.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of New Hampshire, however, when it became apparent
Bush was prime for a political slide and Clinton's personal life
and veracity were being widely questioned, the so-called Democratic
establishment was about standing on its head trying to come up with
a way and an alternative to oppose Clinton's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true, GOP congressfolk generally would appreciate
less Washington bashing from Bush _ even would like, at the least,
some campaign aid from him _ they also generally like him, as,
certainly, do the assortment of those stretched across the gamut of
GOP conservative philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   It is in this sense that Bush tends far more to resemble former
President Reagan than he does his daddy. Great sort-of down-home
likability in Republicans seems not only a trait Dems, for obvious
reasons, dislike, it is a characteristic they seem compelled to
disdain politically.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Reagan served two terms, thus twice winning the
presidency, there still were Democrats out there who just couldn't
deal with the reality. That some Dems may have been partisan _ and
maybe politically gullible _ enough to have held to the end in 1980
convinced Reagan would do something really dumb and lose is one
thing.
</P>
<P>
   That just as many, if not more, actually believed the same thing
in Reagan's quite successful 1984 re-election campaign is another.
</P>
<P>
   As for those still sure it only was a series of quirks that
explained Reagan's political success, GWB ought to be delighted if
they do _ as many seem _ believe the same of him.
</P>
<P>
   If you're convinced the opponent will lose, then you have far
less inclination to work hard to elect your party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only has a strong element of this working against him
this year, he also is going to be the standard bearer fr a party
that seems to have forgotten the gnawing political hunger that sent
Democrats to campaign hard across the land to win the White House _
not so much for Bill Clinton as for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The GOPers, on the other political hand, not only are suffering
the gnawing political hunger that well could drive GWB to the White
House, they like him. They really like him.
</P>
<P>
   If George W. Bush wins the presidency in November, he, of
course, will be a Bush. But, he also will be a little bit of Bill
Clinton and a good dab of Ronald Reagan.

 &HT;    Home Depot settles suit
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot has agreed to pay $500,000 to a New Jersey
couple whose 6-year-old son was injured in a 1997 store accident,
according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Ryan, then 3, suffered a concussion when at least nine
boxes of vinyl siding fell on him at a store in Mount Laurel, the
newspaper said. At least one of the boxes, which fell from an
8-foot high shelf, hit the toddler in the head.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement includes $100,000 for the father, James Ryan, who
claimed he suffered emotional distress after witnessing the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Atlanta-based Home Depot confirmed the company
had agreed to settle the case but cited a policy not to discuss
details of settlements.

PENTAGON DISPUTES BUSH'S CHARGE THAT 2 ARMY DIVISIONS ARE
UNPREPARED 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pentagon officials Friday rebutted Gov. George W.
Bush's assertion that two of the Army's 10 active divisions were
not able to report for duty.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the Republican presidential nomination in
Philadelphia on Thursday, Bush sharply criticized the Clinton
administration's stewardship of the military and specifically cited
the inability of two Army divisions to be ready for war if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If called on by the commander-in-chief today, two entire
divisions of the Army would have to report, `Not ready for duty,
sir,''' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army released a statement Friday disputing the assertion,
though without citing the governor by name. ``The Army affirmed
today that all 10 of its divisions are combat ready and able to
answer the nation's call,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials acknowledged that last fall two divisions _ the
10th Mountain and the 1st Mechanized Infantry _ were classified in
the war plans as unable to fulfill their missions. They said that
did not reflect shortages in equipment or training, but rather the
fact they were deployed to the peacekeeping operations in Bosnia
and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Pentagon has altered the war plans to give
divisions deployed to operations like those in the Balkans more
time to withdraw and redeploy if war breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen.
Henry H. Shelton, also disputed Bush's assertion. But he went on to
acknowledge, as he has in testimony before Congress, that the armed
services still faced budget shortages in some areas even after the
Clinton administration approved a $112 billion increase in defense
spending over six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't solved all the issues that we've got,'' Shelton
said, speaking at the Town Hall of Los Angeles. ``That was a good
downpayment, so to speak, but we're going to have to continue to
fund the readiness accounts to bring readiness back to where we'd
like to them them.''

DEAD ROBIN CONFIRMS MOSQUITOES   CARRYING WEST NILE VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts officials identified two more birds
infected with the West Nile virus Friday, one day after they
announced that the sometimes-lethal virus had not been detected in
the state in almost two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dead birds, a robin found in a residential
neighborhood in the city's Jamaica Plain section, confirms the
virus is being carried and spread by local mosquitoes, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Staten Island, N.Y. Friday, the first human West
Nile infection this year surfaced: a 78-year-old man who reported
to a New York hospital on July 22 complaining of dizziness and
fever. He was hospitalized for a week and is now at home
recovering, said New York health officals.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday the virus had only been detected here in crows,
which easily could have flown to Boston from New York, where the
virus is most heavily concentrated. But robins don't fly long
distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robins are local and the only way one could've gotten the
virus is by getting bit by an infected mosquito here,'' said state
Department of Public Health spokesperson Roseanne Pawelec. ``That
basically indicates the virus is present in mosquitoes in this
area.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the robin, another West Nile-infected crow found
in a residential Brookline neighborhood was identified Friday,
bringing the total number of diseased birds found in Massachusetts
to four. All but one were found in the area where Jamaica Plain
meets Brookline, not surprising, said state officals, given the
tree and pond-filled parks there.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday state officals told the public that a mass testing of
7,000 mosquitoes and 200 birds turned up no signs of the virus.
Although the newly discovered birds seem to contradict this
reassurance, state officials said they were consistent with earlier
state predictions that sporadic signs of the virus would surface
throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's here, and from now until the cold begins, we're going to
be concerned about people avoiding mosquito exposure,'' said Alfred
DeMaria, director of communicable diseases for the state Department
of Public Health. ``I'm sure we'll eventually find infected
mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 the virus killed 7 elderly people in Queens, N.Y., and
sickened 60. New York officials responded to the report of the
first human case by announcing they would redouble their aggressive
mosquito-spraying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of West Nile virus typically experience flu-like
symptoms. In a small number of cases, the virus can cause fatal
brain swelling. The elderly, infants and those with weakened immune
systems are considered particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Health officals here issued now-familiar suggestions: wear long
clothes when outside, consider using mosquito repellent, avoid
parks around dusk and dawn, and empty containers with stagnant
water in them.
</P>
<P>
   The Culex pipiens mosquito, the type that carries the virus, is
currently in the midst of its annual population explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, officals said they would spray pesticides in a
two-mile radius around where the two new birds were found. Spraying
will occur late at night. They will also continue to lay tiny
poison tablets in thousands of mosquito breeding grounds around the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston prevention effort is dwarfed by the goings on in New
York. Friday night, entire area codes in the Bronx were sprayed
with pesticides, as were massive Central Park and parts of the chic
upper East and West Sides in Manhattan.

 &HT;    Gold, platinum cards are old hat
 &HT;    By Peralte C. Paul
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As president of Business Travel in Norcross, Ga., Bill
Mayes remembers the days when plunking down a gold or platinum
credit card at the lunch table was a conversation stopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you'd go out with clients to business lunches, if they
pulled out a platinum card, you were expected to notice,'' Mayes
said of the early 1990s when such cards began popping up in
American wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they get nary a glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have college students now with platinum cards,'' Mayes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Card issuers did relax credit standards to get more of the cards
into circulation, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 506 million bank cards in circulation in the U.S., about
29 percent, or 150 million, are gold or platinum, according to
Frederick, Md.-based Cardweb.com, which tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   When first introduced in 1983, a consumer typically had to earn
$25,000 to $30,000 in annual income to get a gold Visa or
MasterCard with a minimum credit line of $5,000, said Robert B.
McKinley, Cardweb.com's chief executive officer. Today, a gold
cardholder can earn as little as $10,000 a year to qualify for it,
and the limit is $5,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You introduce it to the high end of the market and it waters
down to the lower end of the market,'' said Frank Martien, a senior
consultant with First Annapolis Consulting in Linthicum, Md. ``The
associations and the issuers just have a factory going.''
</P>
<P>
   Perks got curtailed or cut altogether when banks began
eliminating annual fees to attract high-end credit users, said
Moshe Orenbuch, a research analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the fees went away, the services got cut,''
Orenbuch said. ``Gold and platinum are just colors.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the higher-level cardholders used to enjoy lower
interest rates, that's no longer the case, said Greg McBride, a
financial analyst at Bankrate.com in North Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on a variable platinum card in July
was 16.72 percent, McBride said. That was only 0.58 percentage
points less than the average 17.3 percent consumers were being
charged on regular cards.
</P>
<P>
   But card issuers such as American Express Co., MBNA America and
even Direct Merchants Bank, which specializes in accounts for
consumers who've had past credit issues, say gold and platinum
still has value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all consumers are alike; they want different products and
services,'' said Michelle Shepherd, MBNA's vice chairwoman of
advertising and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   So, banking executives reason, one consumer might be satisfied
with getting the auto collision insurance that comes with their
gold card, but another might want the perks that come with platinum
such as double frequent flier miles or upgrades at posh hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Some card issuers including American Express and MBNA, are now
offering by-invitation-only cards to appeal to upmarket consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The target market for the ``super cards'' are folks with perfect
credit who have minimum annual incomes of $70,000 and travel
frequently, McKinley said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 185 million Americans who carry credit cards,
only about 10 million would qualify for the most exclusive cards,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, MBNA launched the Quantum card, which comes with a
minimum line of $15,000 and a maximum limit of $250,000 to $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, which created the platinum concept in 1984
with its $300-a-year card, unveiled its Centurion card in October.
</P>
<P>
   Designed with such services as free upgrades to British Airways'
Concorde fleet, an assigned personal travel counselor and
complimentary cellular phones anywhere in the world, the
black-colored Centurion has a $1,000 annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really introduced Centurion in response to discussions with
our customers,'' said Judy Tenzer, an American Express spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Both Visa and MasterCard also have established new categories
that are designed to go after the upmarket consumer. Visa has the
Signature level, and MasterCard has the World category.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Shaifer, managing partner at Seyfarth Shaw's law offices
in Atlanta, gets an average of five offers a week from card issuers
touting the power of these upmarket cards and platinum cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them really don't provide anything that's materially
different,'' the American Express gold cardholder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain number of people who will always want to
have the most prestigious thing available. That, for me, frankly,
is not important,'' he said.

JUDAH, MILLETT KO POLITICS WITH FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNCASVILLE, Conn. _ Saturday night, recess will finally be over.
</P>
<P>
   In a scenario that only could happen in boxing, International
Boxing Federation junior welterweight champion Zab Judah will
defend his title against IBF junior welterweight champion Terronn
Millett at the Mohegan Sun casino with the winner declared the IBF
junior welterweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Say boxing politics.
</P>
<P>
   Millett (22-1-1, 17 KO's) won the 140-pound title from Vince
Phillips in five rounds last year and has never lost it. He
successfully defended it once by stopping Virgil McClendon in the
12th round after being knocked down early in that fight. Later,
Millett learned he had broken his right hand and asked for a
postponement of an already scheduled December defense against
Judah, who was then the IBF's No. 1 contender.
</P>
<P>
   IBF president Bob Lee ruled Millett could have an extension so
he could have the hand operated on and the fight would be scheduled
after it had healed. But after Lee was indicted on bribery and
racketeering charges _ he is currently waiting for a federal jury
in Newark to decide if the $300,000 he took from promoters in
exchange for selling out his own ratings was bribery or rental fees
_ and Hiawatha Knight was appointed interim president, the IBF
reversed course. At the behest of Judah's promoters, the IBF ruled
Judah and a stiff named Jan Bergman could fight for the suddenly
``vacant'' title because Millett was ``unavailable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, after the fists flew, the lawsuits flew and
the IBF reversed itself again, declaring Millett ``champion in
recess,'' Judah ``interim'' champion, and mandating the two fight
for the true title, which is what Millett planned to do as soon as
his hand healed.
</P>
<P>
   Judah (23-0, 17 KO's) had one ``title'' defense in June against
Junior Witter, who spent 36 minutes running.
</P>
<P>
   So, finally, the two champions will meet to end a recess period
that has become interminable for Millett. ``At first there was some
kind of animosity toward him. But then I thought about it and said
if they gave me as much as they've given him, I don't think I would
have said anything, either,'' Millett said. ``I would have accepted
it and rolled with it, too. I can't blame Zab. I guess I can say
I'm upset at the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zab's management (Main Events) played a big part in me being
stripped. The IBF changes its rules any time it feels like. They
said I was the champion in recess and the No. 1 contender. I can't
understand that. I refuse to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Millett won't refuse is the opportunity to take his
frustrations out on Judah, a hot 22-year-old prospect from New York
who has been a disciple of Pernell Whitaker since his amateur days.
Because of that style and his often stunning quickness, putting a
fist in Judah's face is complicated by the difficulty of finding
it.
</P>
<P>
   Judah spent his formative years as a professional training with
Whitaker. Judah learned much from that experience, both about
boxing and about the reality of his sport. He brings that to the
ring for what he understands is his first real test as a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking at this fight as being my world title
fight,'' Judah said. ``I'm the best that ever did it and I'm going
to show the world. I never had a problem with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That may include the 32-year-old Millett, who, though a powerful
puncher, was KO'd in the first round in 1995 when he challenged
then WBA champion Sharmba Mitchell and was in trouble against
McClendon before rallying. A fast starter by inclination, Millett
is expected to pressure Judah early to test his mettle. It is a
test Judah seems sure he will pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the heat of battle,'' Judah said. ``I am going to go in
there and handle my business.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does that the way manager Lou Duva expects, recess will be
over for Zab Judah . . . and school will be out for Terronn
Millett.

ARAB NATIONS' VIEW OF PALESTINIANS MAY BE SHIFTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ On the face of it, Arab support for the
Palestinians has never been so unified. One after the other, Arab
kings and presidents have said they stand behind Yasser Arafat's
claim to East Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the uncompromising public statements, more pragmatic
approaches to those thorniest of issues are being discussed
seriously among Arab leaders for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   There have even been signs of subtle shifts in the once
monolithic Arab public opinion that Arab Muslims should have
exclusive sovereignty over East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 days since the Camp David talks broke down, on this
and other previously taboo issues, Arab leaders have been absorbed
in their most intense consultations ever on how to find a swift,
workable deal that would combine both symbol and substance for both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, the Palestinian leader, has shuttled around the region.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has received a string of Arab
leaders at his summer palace in Alexandria, where Prime Minister
Ehud Barak of Israel arrived for talks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And Edward S. Walker Jr., a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt and
Israel and now an assistant secretary of state, has gone to Saudi
Arabia as part of his tour of Arab nations that rely to some degree
on U.S. money or military backing.
</P>
<P>
   A new Arab consensus on these issues could ultimately make an
agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians possible,
analysts and diplomats say, if Israel also compromises at least in
symbolic ways on viewing Jerusalem as its eternal undivided capital
and on Palestinian refugees as a resettlement problem for the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews and Muslims are in a Catholic marriage with no
possibility of divorce,'' said Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian
foreign minister who led the first joint Jordanian-Palestinian
delegation to the Madrid peace conference in 1991. ``Everyone
realizes that the problem now is how to engineer arrangements to
satisfy at least the minimum requirements of both sides to live
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of making ``arrangements'' along the way to peace is
relatively new in the 52-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years since direct talks between the Israelis and the
Palestinians began in earnest, negotiations have focused almost
exclusively on step-by-step arrangements that have allowed most
Arab leaders to remain on the sidelines, talking of a comprehensive
peace settlement in absolute terms.
</P>
<P>
   But with the rush of expectation that came with last month's
15-day Camp David talks, Arab leaders are facing internal and
external pressure to play a role in forging a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that both of the most contentious issues on the
table _ Jerusalem and refugees _ carry implications for leaders
other than Arafat and for peoples other than the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is home to more Palestinian refugees than any other Arab
country. Egypt is a leading U.S. ally in the region and has the
status of the only Arab state to have reached a peace agreement
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And the approval of Saudi Arabia, as the keeper of Islam's
holiest sites outside Jerusalem, is essential to any shift, no
matter how subtle, in the Arab position on the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Arafat is alone negotiating with the Israelis, he is too
weak to make concessions,'' said Labib Kamhawi, a
Palestinian-Jordanian political analyst. ``But if a third party is
involved, the third party is like a facilitator. So I think,
ultimately, an Arab umbrella will be given to Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that most Arab nations, if not impatient for a
settlement, have become at least used to the idea that a settlement
would bring much-needed economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing linkage in the region between having
conditions of peace and the possibility of development,'' said
Abdel Moneim Said, director of the Al Ahram Center for Political
and Strategic Studies in Cairo. ``In addition, there is no one in
the Arab world, except for some fundamentalists, who would deny any
more the legitimacy of Israel. So we are all transferring from an
existential conflict of `us or them' to how we are going to be
living with them.'
</P>
<P>
   Before the Camp David peace negotiations, reflections on how to
finesse issues like Jerusalem were never seriously broached in Arab
countries. But proposals for dividing administrative and religious
control of the city, made at Camp David by Barak and President
Clinton, have lifted a curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways of dealing with it without saying that Israel
is sovereign over East Jerusalem,'' said Said. ``Certain things
could happen de facto, if we have an agreement that settles the
issue of East Jerusalem and left aside the question of the Old
City.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Arab control over the Haram al Sharif, the complex in the Old
City known to Jews as the Temple Mount, which contains two of the
holiest mosques in Islam, remains a fixed demand. It cannot be
relinquished, Arab officials have said, without stirring the wrath
of Muslim militants in the region and Muslims all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of Arab officials and commentators, even in the
most religiously conservative country of Saudi Arabia, have
recently talked of the need to cool tempers over Jerusalem and of
making a distinction between political and religious sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerusalem has a very important religious value, but its
political importance is just as great,'' said a Saudi official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Maybe both sides could agree
on joint administration according to certain arrangements.''
Postponing either Jerusalem or further negotiations is not an
option, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already wasted 52 years and we do not need to waste
more time,'' the official said. ``We have to take what we can now _
anything that is possible or is the remnant of the possible.''
</P>
<P>
   From another quarter, Fahmi Howeidi, an Egyptian commentator
with close ties to the Islamic fundamentalist movement, also
suggested that Arabs are focusing too much attention on the
mosques. Instead, he wrote recently in Al Ahram newspaper, they
should emphasize the issue of right of return for Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of the human being is more important than a
place, even if this place is the Haram al Sharif,'' Howeidi wrote,
adding that God would protect the Jerusalem mosques.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of the return of refugees, a number of Arab
officials have also said that an arrangement is possible if Israel
only accepts the principle that Palestinians have a right to return
if they fled or were forced from their homes in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Israel has said only that it might accept some
100,000 refugees under a family reunification plan. About 3.2
million Palestinians are registered with the United Nations as
refugees who fled or were forced from their homes at the time of
Israel's creation in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Another 300,000 are considered displaced persons from the 1967
Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Some of the more flexible
statements have come from Jordan, where officials and others of
Palestinian descent say they doubt that many people will take
advantage of a right to return, which would mean accepting Israeli
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you agree to theoretical language that refugees have the
possibility of the right of return,'' said Marwan Dudin, a
Jordanian senator who was born in Beersheva, in what is now Israel,
and represented Jordan in multilateral talks with Israel about
Palestinian refugees. ``It could take two to three generations to
implement. But you at least make something that smells like an
acknowledgment of the right of return.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamhawi, the Jordanian political analyst, agreed. ``At a
minimum, Israel should uphold this right and then sit down and see
if it's practical or not,'' he said. ``First the principle; then
the details.''

AETNA CITES 17 PERCENT DROP IN 2ND-QUARTER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, reported a 17
percent drop in second-quarter profits Friday as more people sought
increasingly costly treatment. But it said it was moving along on
sweeping changes aimed at improving business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that we must remake our model to better serve
employers and consumers and improve relationships with physicians
and hospitals,'' said William H. Donaldson, Aetna's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said Aetna had begun increasing prices for managed
care coverage and giving regional managers greater authority in
dealing with costs and pricing. For consumers, he said, Aetna was
trying to make its services easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent,'' Donaldson said, ``is to eliminate those policies
and procedures that may have no positive effect in terms of either
monitoring quality or managing costs _ the so-called hassle
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings for the second quarter, excluding charges, fell to
$134 million, or 94 cents a share, down from $160.9 million or
$1.03 a share in the same quarter a year earlier. Aetna attributed
the decline mainly to higher-than-expected costs for treating
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The results were better than the lowered average profit
predictions by analysts of 88 cents a share, but far worse than the
original consensus estimate of $1.20 before Aetna said in mid-July
that it would not meet that target.
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded by bidding up share prices $1.187, to
$59.50.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But whether Aetna, which last month sold its financial services
and international units, can pull itself together as a purely
health care company and prosper over the long run in an extremely
competitive business is a matter of debate among those who follow
the company closely.
</P>
<P>
   Todd B. Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, says
Aetna is doing too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are starting to do things now that other people in the
business have been doing over a long period of time,'' Richter
said. ``And doing this stuff today is much more difficult than it
was several years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say that Aetna is relying heavily on increases
in prices to turn the company around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business needs to be shrunk and then rebuilt,'' Richter
said. ``Trying to fix a business with price increases is not a
panacea.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, price increases poorly executed can be
self-defeating. ``Unless price increases are implemented with
surgical precision,'' he said, ``they can destroy the risk pool of
an insurer, meaning in any book of insurance business you've got
customers that are very profitable and customers that lose money
for you. If you raise prices too aggressively on those profitable
customers, they will leave and you will be left with only the
unprofitable customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Studying the same data, Tom Burnett, the president of Merger
Insight, a financial research firm in New York, reaches a far
different conclusion. ``The way we see it,'' he said, ``Aetna is
beginning to get is arms around the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem has been the integration of three big
health insurance companies _ U.S. Healthcare, Nylcare and
Prudential Health Care _ into one smoothly running machine. With
investors angry about the company's poor results and lagging share
prices, Richard L. Huber, the architect of the acquisition
strategy, stepped down in last February.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, one of the founding partners of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, has been overseeing the company since. He acknowledges
that is no health care expert. But he negotiated the sale of the
nonhealth care units to the big Dutch banking and insurance
company, ING, and he is leading the search for a chief operating
officer. He has also begun implementing fundamental changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognize their problems,'' Burnett said. And, having
sold off the business that have nothing to do with health
insurance, he said, ``they're going to be able to mount a
dedicated, focused effort toward improving their health care
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts Friday, Aetna said it had
narrowed its search for a new chief executive to a ``short list.''
One person under consideration, according to people close to the
search, is John W. Rowe, the president and chief executive of Mount
Sinai NYU Health. Neither Aetna nor Mount Sinai would comment.
</P>
<P>
   But even a new boss at Aetna would not be enough to cheer some
analysts. ``One guy is not going to fix this,'' Richter said.

7,000 EVANGELISTS GATHER IN THE NETHERLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTRECHT, Netherlands _ In a vast and utilitarian exhibition
center, 7,000 people have assembled in what is probably one of the
most ethnically diverse, but purposefully homogenous, encampments
on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily living inside the Jaarbeurs Exposition Center, a
warehouse-like space within sight of the Utrecht train station, are
people from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, the
South Pacific and the United States. Two hundred nations and
territories are represented, and dozens of languages are spoken.
But everyone here is a Christian evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   They sleep in bunk beds, dine at long tables and form groups
each morning at 7 a.m. to board chartered trains for the half-hour
ride and a conference arranged by the Billy Graham Evangelistic
Association, which _ at the cost of millions of dollars _ is paying
for their transportation and housing here. The nine-day event, also
attended by 3,000 others flush enough to stay in hotels, concludes
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The organizational scope is close to breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building a city inside a building,'' said John Drake,
the Graham association's man in charge here, who works the rest of
the year as an official with the YMCA in England. ``For some people
who come here, we've built a city bigger than their hometown _ and
that includes some of the Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Drake is a crew of 700 volunteers, themselves an
international group, who wear bright blue vests identifying them as
``stewards'' at the event, called Amsterdam 2000, and sometimes
cruise the vast expanse of Jaarbeurs on roller skates.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham organization has divided the evangelists in residence
into five groups, with each assigned a color _ blue, green, gray,
purple or red. That color determines their wristband, dining table,
train for Amsterdam and the color of the carpet that leads to their
bunk beds _ carefully identified by number _ at night. The sleeping
quarters for the overwhelmingly male population of this temporary
global village are strictly segregated by sex.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the measure of the quiet logistical efficiency here is
that the worst problem for the director of security _ Ted Cornell,
a graduate of the Julliard School of Music who directs choirs at
events led by Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's eldest son _ was some
cash that was misplaced until ``the guy found it.''
</P>
<P>
   With security apparently assured and at least seven doctors and
40 nurses on hand to deal with any medical problems, delegates have
been able to concentrate on one of the purposes of the gathering:
meeting other evangelists from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the mingling unites compatriots long
separated by distance. Louis Girardin, 33, an evangelist from the
Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, sat across the breakfast table one
morning from Gregory Toussaint, 26, a Haitian-born resident of New
York City and a student, who was exulting in finding 50 or so
Haitians here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful place,'' Girardin said. ``We are one spirit,
the spirit of the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the sheer internationalism of this gathering impels
them to reach out to any new face and nationality, albeit with
smiles and gestures if a language barrier precludes more intense
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I meet people, I talk,'' said Taher Abu Chowdury, 43, who
came here from Chittagong in his native Bangladesh, and marveled at
being surrounded by hundreds of Europeans, Africans and Americans.
``When I think someone is smiling at me, I try to talk with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Edward Enim, 44, director of an organization called
Coast for Christ Baptist Ministries in Ghana, said that in his
sleeping area alone, he had met people from Madagascar, India and
the United States. ``We've been exchanging ideas, we've been
exchanging strategies for ministries,'' he said, conceding that, at
first, the Jaarbeurs center did not strike him as particularly
impressive. ``But when you're inside, it's like a city. It's
unbelievable!''
</P>
<P>
   Enim was among the few visitors to remark on the Dutch hosts of
the meeting, whom he praised for their efficiency and friendliness,
but admonished for spiritual laxity. Visiting Amsterdam, he said,
``has given me more of a burden to pray for Holland,'' adding,
``people have so much, they don't know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in history, he said, ``the Netherlands were a launching pad
for missions.'' But, Enim said, the country appears since to have
strayed from its historic faith. ``They need to come back,'' he
said. ``But they are lovely people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans spoke of quite specific cross-cultural
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no walls to encase the noise,'' said William Petree,
28, a student at Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in San
Francisco. ``You know, a lot of people sing themselves to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Are they singing hymns? ``It's not in English, so you don't
know,'' he said. ``But this morning, one person was singing, `His
eye is on the sparrow, so I know he watches me,' and people chimed
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kolbert, 43, another student at Golden Gate, noted that
the sense of religious purpose transcended any differences here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not speak the same languages,'' he said, ``but we have
Jesus in our hearts.''

<P>
   KHAYELITSHA, South Africa _ Every day when Oscar Picane heads
off to work, he leaves behind a wife who worries that she will
never see him again. He is not a police officer or a soldier or a
miner, or even a gangster. He is a bus driver here in this
sprawling township south of Cape Town, doing a job that has become,
for the moment at least, the deadliest occupation in a country with
no shortage of dangerous jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Buses like the one Picane drives for Golden Arrow Bus Services
are under fire here in the Cape Flats, as the townships are
collectively known. Stoned, shot at and firebombed, the drivers are
the targets of a campaign of urban terror apparently orchestrated
by criminal elements in the rival minibus taxi industry, who
believe their business is threatened by the big bus company and the
cheaper fares it offers the poor here.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks and acts of intimidation, which began five months
ago and now number nearly 60, have so far killed four drivers and
two passengers, wounded dozens and shaken a community caught
between the brazen violence and the limp response of the local and
national governments.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a share of the scarce resources of a desperate,
long-neglected place that, like so many in South Africa, was
founded to house black workers as far away as possible from the
white people they work for.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the worst violence unfolded late last week with a driver
and a passenger dying in a spate of attacks. This week, under
increasing pressure, the authorities took the most significant
steps so far to curb the violence. More than a dozen suspects were
arrested, and hundreds of police officers drawn from elite units
around the country were sent in.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Picane, 32, who has been a driver for Golden Arrow for
almost four years, has heard all the talk before _ the forceful
denunciations of the violence and the promises of swift, decisive
action.
</P>
<P>
   Little changes, and the attacks continue. Indeed, late Wednesday
night, a disabled bus was firebombed in Nyanga, a neighboring
township. No one was injured, but that is scant comfort to Picane.
</P>
<P>
   When he leaves for work each morning shortly before 5, he does
so driven by the same economic realities that leave his passengers
with little choice but to board his bus, as they begin doing
shortly after 5:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I am scared,'' he said as he guided his 68-seat bus
down the N2 Highway, through the fog-dusted darkness toward
Khayelitsha. ``But I am working for my family, so I have to work.
My mother and father, they don't know why I'm still working. But
I'm the breadwinner. Even my wife, she was crying, `Why are you
still going to work?'''
</P>
<P>
   But in a country where millions are unemployed and the economy
is barely growing, work is work, and a job is not easily
relinquished, even if risking your life is the only way to keep it.
David Tyantsi, a 50-year-old father of five, said that after the
latest violence, his family begged him to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them jobs are scarce,'' he said as he and a few other
drivers huddled in the early morning cold during a break at a
vacant lot that serves as a terminal in one township neighborhood.
``I haven't got anywhere to go to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Konana, as a passenger, is in the same situation. A
factory machinist in Durbanville, north of here, he spends about $5
a week on his bus ticket. Taking a taxi to work would cost him
another $3 to $4, a dear premium for someone like Konana, who makes
about $40 a week. ``I'm scared, but I've got no other choice,
because the buses are cheaper than the taxis,'' he said a few
minutes after boarding Picane's bus, which was northbound for
Bellville.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A seemingly endless sea of shanties southeast of Cape Town,
Khayelitsha lies miles away from the cities and towns where many of
its residents work. Transporting them to Cape Town and the other
urban centers has always been a lucrative and competitive
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely, if ever, has the fare battle between taxis and buses
been so violent _ and part of that could be attributed to a recent
national government effort to reshape the bloated, poorly regulated
taxi industry. Tactics common among rival taxi operators are now in
some instances being turned on the bus company, a convenient target
for taxi drivers' fear and anger with government plans.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi fleets are to be trimmed by tens of thousands, and an aging
collection of vans is to be replaced with larger, more suitable
minibuses. A crackdown is also planned on the unlicensed operators
who have saturated the market.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you ask, the response from the authorities has
been inadequate, inept or both. The provincial government and the
national government have argued about who is ultimately responsible
for controlling the situation, even as the violence persists and
the perpetrators disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations between the bus company and the taxi industry have
been fruitless, and hours after the two most recent killings, they
broke down altogether. The local minister of security quit last
week, saying the national government, which controls the police and
army, had given him little power to act.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The handling of the crisis has left the bus drivers indignant.
``The national government had to intervene long ago,'' said Yaasien
Abrahams, the shop steward for the South African Transport and
Allied Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   A driver for 13 years and shop steward for the last nine,
Abrahams says he is a marked man. He and his family were in hiding
for three weeks, he said, after the authorities learned that an
attempt was likely to be made on his life. He resurfaced a few days
ago and now wears a bulletproof vest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if it's safe for me now, but I don't know how
long a man can run,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, these people
negotiate through the barrel of a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most drivers and passengers, Abrahams is not white, and he
wonders how the crisis might otherwise have been handled here in
the only province where whites have retained control of the local
political machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm positive that if this had happened in Sea Point or the
suburbs,'' he said, referring to the fashionable neighborhood on
Cape Town's waterfront, ``it would have been resolved. But it's
only black people who are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Until something changes, people like Elizabeth Letsie will have
to live with fear. ``We were on the bus that was shot last
Thursday,'' Letsie, a domestic worker, said as she sat with her
13-year-old son, Emmanuel, one row from where they were when shots
rang out last week. ``We were sitting right there. We were both
shaking. We were afraid, but we have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   A man of the townships himself, Picane knows how much his
neighbors depend on him and his colleagues, and that, too, brings
him back each day. Every so often, he pulls his white-faced
wristwatch from his jacket pocket and steals a quick look.
Shootings or no shootings, a schedule is a schedule.

PONDERING JIMYOLOGY

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Come with me to the manager's office. The skipper is
about to start his daily pregame rendition of of ``Meet The
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Got Brogna, sent Burkhart,'' Jimy Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   No need to waste words. He knew we all knew what he's talking
about. Rico Brogna is here, and he will be in the lineup, batting
eighth. Morgan Burkhart, a veteran of the I-95 Shuffle, will be
joining his old friends in Pawtucket once again.
</P>
<P>
   You probably listen to talk radio. You've probably been
listening to people behind the microphone whine about the Jimy
approach to interviews. You've probably heard them say he's
useless, that he's combative and that he absolutely refuses to give
the reporter anything he or she can use.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, people shouldn't deal in absolutes. ``Always'' and
``never'' are two dangerous words to employ. Secondly, just because
a guy isn't 100 percent forthcoming doesn't mean he can't be a
little entertaining. And Jimy Williams at 4 in the afternoon is
nothing if not entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The skipper watches Globe scribe Larry Whiteside walk in and
seat himself. ``Of all the people I know,'' Jimy purrs, ``you're
one of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Dennis Miller, it ain't. But it's a clue that the mentor
is in a playful mood.
</P>
<P>
   The topic shifts back to the new man. ``He's in the lineup,''
Jimy says. ``He's in the lineup. First base tonight.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What about tomorrow?'' someone inquires. ``And will he used as
a DH, too?''
</P>
<P>
   ``First base, tonight,'' Jimy repeats. ``Got a game tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   This is classic Jimy. We are 590 regular season and 14
postseason games into the Jimy Williams era, and we should know the
rules. The day he most regularly acknowledges is today. His
favorite tense is the present. He gets out of bed thinking about
the game he will manage that afternoon or evening, and just about
nothing else. Oh, sure, every manager has certain long-range
considerations he must acknowledge (pitching, certainly), but, more
than most managers, Williams chooses to focus on the here and now.
He doesn't like ``What-Ifs?'' and ``Supposes'' and the like. He
truly is Mr. One Game At A Time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a little more talk about Brogna. ``I haven't seen him
in a while,'' Jimy says. ``I do know he is an outstanding defensive
first baseman, and I've seen him hit very well when he was with the
Mets. That was a long time ago, before he was with the Phillies.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett's name comes up. Yup, he'll be in the lineup
tomorrow, and yup, his wrist is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're going to have some fun. Our beat man Bob Hohler feeds
Jimy a breaking ball. He tells Jimy he's managed 47 players this
season. He asks him how he feels about dealing with such a large
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably wouldn't have met 'em any other way,'' Jimy
deadpans, and I mean deadpans. ``I never would have had a chance to
meet 'em. I like ballplayers.''
</P>
<P>
   C'mon. Is that delibarately fouling off the pitch, or what? That
was classic Nellie Fox or Wade Boggs, right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-seven, huh?'' Jimy says, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   In all probability, this really is news to Jimy. He simply has
not thought about it. All he knows is that he likes to have 25 at
his disposal, and that this is a nightly goal that hasn't always
been met. But of 37 or 47 or 147, Jimy knows not.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to a discussion of chemistry. For some reason, he
bites on this one, even though it is borderline philosophy and Jimy
would prefer to deal with the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won a couple of tough games on the road with people who
haven't been here (long),'' he decides. Jimy then ponders whether
happiness breeds winning or winning breeds happiness. ``When you
win,'' he concludes, ``they say you've got chemistry. When you
don't, they say, well, what do they say? What's the opposite?''
</P>
<P>
   A four-letter word is suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``And re-arrange the letters and you've got `this,' '' he points
out. ``So I guess you can say you've got chemistry or you've got
`this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Have you ever heard any better descriptions of
the phenomenon?
</P>
<P>
   There is a lull in the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saberhagen's still pitching tomorrow in Syracuse,'' Jimy
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, news is news.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of pitchers, the next name introduced into the
conversation is Pedro. Someone wants to know if, given the
circumstances (coming off a tough loss, the bullpen shot, etc.),
and considering the methodology (eschewing strikeouts in favor of a
more pitch-conscious approach), this was as impressive as anything
the amazing No. 45 has done all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the least,'' Jimy concurs. ``Huge. And to have a game
like that offensively, getting four runs in the first. We can talk
about the way he pitched and the defense, but those runs were
important. But what Pedro did was very, very impressive, after what
happened to us in the two previous games and having won the first
game with eight innings of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   He turns his attention back to Mr. Whiteside, who is wearing a
baseball cap proclaiming his alma mater, Drake University. Jimy
grills him on Drake. Where is it? How'd you get there? Etc. And
then he asks who's the best basketball player that ever came out of
Drake. Whiteside throws out the name of Red Murrell. Someone else
references Willie Wise, the ``Dave DeBusschere of the ABA.'' In
case you didn't know, Jimy does love his basketball.
</P>
<P>
   And that's pretty much it. The veteran Jimyologists say it's a
typical pregame session. Some days there's more news than this;
some days there isn't. But the tone, the informality, the slightly
askew, but hardly bumpkinish, flavor is pure Jimy. You can pretty
much count on leaving the office having smiled at least once. You
might even have laughed out loud.
</P>
<P>
   He's not Joe Morgan. No one is, or ever will be. But he's just
as informative as Don Zimmer (in that context only; Zimmy has
always been very good in pure story-telling circumstances) and John
McNamara (not exactly Mr. Belly Laugh) and he is infinitely better
than Butch Hobson, the most obtuse and informationally barren Red
Sox manager in modern history. And let's not even discuss Kevin
Kennedy and his sad I-me discourses.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it's not Bobby Valentine. But it's definitely better
than `this.'

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dave Campo calls it a business trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys have not gone to Japan to sample Far East
cuisine or climb Mount Fuji. The only thing on Campo's mind is
improving a football team that hardly resembled world-beaters in
their preseason opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I call a real road game,'' Campo said, referring
to the American Bowl game against the Atlanta Falcons tonight at
the Tokyo Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had better get used to traveling. No team will fly
more miles this season than the Cowboys, the unofficial ambassadors
of the NFL. Including preseason, the Cowboys will travel 31,020
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is second with 30,218 and San Francisco third at 29,928.
By contrast, Tennessee travels a league-low 8,498 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas will always be among the NFL leaders in travel miles,
partly because they have an owner who likes to market his team
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the team's seventh American Bowl in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are expected to play preseason games in Mexico the
next three seasons, perhaps longer, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling has become an issue with the Dallas coaches, who
figure trips to Tokyo and Mexico City are distracting. In this
case, they will miss six training camp days in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   This marks the eighth time the Cowboys have been chosen to play
in an American Bowl game. Their record: 0-6-1. Atlanta is playing
on foreign turf for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, perhaps knowing that his boss is listening, said this
week's trip is ``positive.'' It enables the 88-player roster, which
has been blistered during two weeks of training camp, will get some
much-needed rest.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman did not looked enthused, saying he's
been on the 12,000-mile round trip to Tokyo three or four times and
has seen everything he's wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   Jones looks at the business side of such trips. By playing in
places like Tokyo, London and Mexico City, the Cowboys play before
fans who might never have an opportunity to see them in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The most important market is Mexico, Jones said. By agreeing to
play in Tokyo this year, Jones said the NFL has assured him that
Dallas will be scheduled to return to Mexico for future games.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been interested in marketing his team to a large
Hispanic audience. The Cowboys already have played three American
Bowls in Mexico and played two exhibitions in El Paso. All five
games drew overflow crowds, including an NFL-record 112,000 in 1994
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Jones would like to move
training camp from Wichita Falls to the Rio Grande Valley, where
the Cowboys likely would draw many fans from across the border.
</P>
<P>
   As for tonight's game, Campo will have his eyes focused on
several positions. After Sunday's 38-10 loss to Pittsburgh, several
questions emerged at several key positions:
</P>
<P>
   Rookie cornerbacks Mario Edwards and Dwayne Goodrich were thrown
into the fire for the first times as pros, _ and got burned. It's
doubtful that either will play significantly during the regular
season, but injuries to Ryan McNeil or Kevin Smith will force them
in.
</P>
<P>
   Campo wants a better look at his tight ends. David LaFleur
(groin) did not play against the Steelers, and Mike Lucky (torn
knee ligaments) suffered a season-ending injury. The Cowboys
promise that the tight ends will have a bigger role in the offense
this season, and it's important to see how LaFleur and newcomer
Jackie Harris respond when the ball is thrown their way.
</P>
<P>
   Third-team quarterback Paul Justin had a horrific showing
against Pittsburgh, throwing three interceptions in the second
quarter. Campo said Justin, who did not have the benefit of playing
with first-team players, deserves another chance. If he does not
improve, No. 4 quarterback Clint Stoerner will take his job.
</P>
<P>
   After rushing for only 78 yards Sunday, it was clear the Cowboys
need work on their running game. Emmitt Smith's return should help,
but it's unclear whether rookies Michael Wiley or Troy Hambrick or
second-year player Michael Black are prepared for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 tonight, some of these questions could be answered.

 &HT;    Depleted defense can still rely on cocky cornerback
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How do you complement a Pig and Pork Chop?
</P>
<P>
   With a hot dog, of course.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Mississippi State has in senior cornerback Fred
Smoot, an All-America candidate. Smoot, offensive tackle Pork Chop
Womack and safety Pig Prather were the only Bulldogs to receive
preseason all-conference honors at last month's SEC Media Days.
</P>
<P>
   Smoot, 6 feet 1 and 179 pounds, tied for second in the SEC last
season with five interceptions. Since transferring from Hinds
(Miss.) Community College, Smoot has started 12 games in a row at
right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell when Smoot is on the field,'' Bulldogs coach
Jackie Sherrill said. ``He is not a normal football player. He's
really a gifted, talented young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, with Smoot and Atlanta native Robert Bean playing
corners, the Bulldogs often pressed receivers in defensive
coordinator Joe Lee Dunn's blitzing scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have cornerbacks that can press and latch onto
receivers, you can do a lot of things up front defensively,''
Sherrill said. ``If you look across the country, any team that's
won a national championship _ Nebraska, Florida, Florida State _
has had two great cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Smoot, who had 57 tackles and nine pass breakups, claims he gave
up only one touchdown in 1999. Auburn's Ronney Daniels beat him in
the Bulldogs' 18-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't do it legally,'' Smoot insisted. ``I got picked.''
This season probably won't be as smooth as last year, when the
Bulldogs finished 10-2 and beat Clemson in the Peach Bowl.
Mississippi State won its first eight games before losing
consecutive road games at Alabama and Arkansas by a total of 13
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs lost 15 starters from last year's team, which
finished 13th in the final Associated Press poll. Worse, only
Prather, Smoot and defensive end Conner Stephens return as starters
on defense, which ranked No. 1 nationally in 1999 by allowing only
222.5 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State returns six offensive starters, including
quarterback Wayne Madkin, who added 20 pounds in the offseason.
Madkin, who threw 10 touchdowns and 11 interceptions last year,
won't have a safety net in part-time starter Matt Wyatt, who
graduated.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs were next to last in the SEC in scoring last
season, averaging only 21.6 points per game. Running back Dontae
Walker rushed for 384 yards while playing most of the season with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs are being picked to finish third in the SEC West,
behind Alabama and Mississippi. The prediction is fine with
Sherrill, who led Mississippi State to its first division title in
1998 and a second-place finish last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who picked us to win in 1998?'' Sherrill asked. ``Nobody. Who
picked us to win in 1999? Nobody. We were extremely close to
perfection (last season) because we found a way to win the close
games, to put ourselves in a position in the fourth quarter.

ANARCHISM, THE CREED THAT WON'T STAY DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Corrects misspelling of Ritalin in 17th graf)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Karl Marx bested the anarchist leader Mikhail Bakunin in a
struggle to shape world revolution a century and a half ago,
anarchism has undergone a half-dozen resurrections and almost as
many deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It was crushed with the Paris Commune in 1871, suppressed in the
United States after an anarchist shot President William McKinley in
1901, destroyed by Franco in the Spanish Civil War of the late
1930s and it withered away with 1960s student radicalism.
Ideologically opposed to power and ambivalent about organization,
anarchists perpetually live on the fringe of great movements _ and
on the verge of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the very qualities that consign anarchism to obscurity also
endow it with many lives, if only as a prefix:
anarcho-collectivism, anarcho-syndicalism, anarcho-mutualism,
anarcho-individualism, anarcho-ecologism. And at the turn of this
century, it is undergoing a fresh resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   Black-masked anarchists stoned chain stores in Seattle during
global trade talks last year. Protesters with giant A's pasted on
their shirts blocked intersections in Washington during
demonstrations against international lending agencies last spring.
They were in the streets of Philadelphia during the Republican
National Convention this week and have promised to stalk the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles this month.
</P>
<P>
   Self-described anarchists are small in number. But anarchism,
broadly construed, is becoming fashionable. There are hints of it
in the way protesters of diverse loyalties _ labor, environmental
and consumer groups among them _ have sought to become a mass but
leaderless movement, a collection of affinity groups that operate
by consensus. Many of those who oppose the institutions that
enforce rules of international capitalism call for a return to
local decision-making, echoing longtime anarchist objections to the
way nation-states usurped the power of cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have often been condemned in the mainstream news
media as imbecilic and chaotic, all action and no theory. But that
is also an anarchist trait. Its adherents have long been dismissed
as uneducated and unwashed. Anarchism's most memorable slogan,
coined by Enrico Malatesta of Italy, is ``propaganda by deed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the decline of socialism, you have seen anarchism go
through a revival as an easy way to oppose global capitalism,''
said Paul Avrich, a leading historian of anarchism who teaches at
Queens College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Avrich, who has written extensively on early-20th-century
American anarchists, said anarchist cells all but disappeared by
the 1970s as the last of the European immigrants who brought the
creed to the United States died. But anarchist groups are
reappearing in every major city, he says. Today they have their own
bookstores, like Blackout Books on the Lower East Side and Social
Anarchism in Baltimore. They read The Match, a popular magazine
published in Tuscon, Ariz., or Fifth Estate, a Detroit newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was probably the first person to call
himself an anarchist when he wrote ``What Is Property?'' in 1840.
(His answer: theft.) Proudhon advocated free bank credit and
rejected parliamentary politics as hopelessly dominated by the
elite. But anarchism was defined and popularized by Bakunin, a
heavily bearded Russian insurrectionist who helped foment uprisings
across Europe in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   Bakunin's motto was, ``The urge to destroy is a creative urge.''
Unlike Marx, Bakunin did not justify his theory as science. He
described anarchists as people who know what they are fighting
against more than what they are fighting for.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchism reached critical mass as a revolutionary movement only
once, during the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. But it has long
touched a political and cultural chord in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Henry David Thoreau was an exemplary anarchist, though he never
called himself one. Emma Goldman, a Russian immigrant who advocated
free love, women's rights and armed insurrection, was the best
known of the immigrant anarchists who helped prompt a red scare
around World War I. (She appears in E.L. Doctorow's novel
``Ragtime'' and in Warren Beatty's movie ``Reds.'') In 1927 the
Italian immigrants Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, both
avowed anarchists, were executed after being convicted of killing a
paymaster and his guard at a shoe factory near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Anarchists consider themselves of the left, not the right. But
antigovernment ideas that sound anarchist themes are common across
the political spectrum. John Wayne in many of his Westerns and Mel
Gibson in ``The Patriot'' play reluctant but violent American
heroes called on to smash evil so they can return to a life of
bucolic isolation. The quest for pure rebellion in some punk rock
lyrics reflects the spread of anarchism, or perhaps nihilism _
anarchism without the utopian impulses _ among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has revived anarchism like globalization. Anarchists
are now battling what they see as a concentration of power in
multinational corporations. Many oppose the proliferation of
corporate investment across national boundaries, which they say
allows companies like Nike and General Electric to evade local laws
covering labor and the environment. They have also attacked the
World Bank, the World Trade Organization and the International
Monetary Fund because these are seen as superseding national
governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since the 1960s we are actually putting
thought into action,'' said John Zerzan, a leading anarchist
thinker who lives in Eugene, Ore. He distinguishes anarchists from
traditional labor and environmental groups that oppose many of the
same aspects of globalization, though he's not opposed to sharing
the stage with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are succeeding because the liberals failed. We are less
polite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zerzan, 56, is a leading proponent of anarcho-primitivism, which
combines radical environmentalism with an extreme antitechnology
bent. His essays and his book ``Future Primitive'' espouse a theory
that time and technology are not neutral scientific realities but
carefully constructed ways to enslave people. The computer and the
Internet, for example, atomize society, create new divisions of
labor, demand ever more efficiency and consume ever more leisure
time, he says. To cope with the increasing strains of our
technology-driven society, alienated people by the millions are
resorting to drugs like Ritalin and Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have learned is that our problem is not just control
of capital. It is also science and technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zerzan says that society should return to the Stone Age. He says
that more than 12,000 years ago, before agriculture allowed a class
of people to leave food production to others, hunter-gatherers were
as intelligent and as healthy as people today. And he argues that
an old anthropological conundrum _ why it took man so long to
develop agriculture _ should now be posed in reverse. ``The
question now is why we ever developed agriculture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zerzan writes long hand. He does not use the Internet and owns
no car. He lives in cooperative housing in Eugene, which he has
helped turn into a beehive of anarchist activity. Like Bakunin and
earlier American anarchists, he argues that property damage is a
legitimate tactic, an effective way to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not library theorists,'' he said. ``We are activists.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other anarchists call anarcho-primitivism a disturbing
trend, and, perhaps not surprisingly, sectarian strife among the
anarchists is rampant. An old-guard supports ethical anarchism, a
type of modified socialism that calls for eliminating the
nation-state while embracing nonauthoritarian local government.
Ethical anarchists reject violence, and some view technology like
the Internet as tools to achieve freedom. Many also say that
anarcho-primitivists tend to be antiwork and antiworker, which
forecloses the possibility of a lasting alliance with labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   The anarcho-primitives ``carry a black flag in one hand and a
welfare check in the other,'' an anarchist named Janet Biehl wrote
in a recent Internet essay. Others have called Zerzan a
``McAnarchist'' who dumbs down anarchism and corrupts ``young
gullibles'' with mystical visions of life before civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Bookchin, an 80-year-old Vermont-based social theorist
who calls himself a communalist, has sharply criticized recent
trends in anarchism, though he claims his own writings have
contributed to the rise of Direct Action Network and other
antiglobalization protest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Bookchin wrote ``Post-Scarcity Anarchism'' in the 1960s. In that
book he merged environmentalism and anarchism into a broader theory
of how the state and capitalism are at war with nature. But he says
some anarchist groups have taken the ecological message too far,
becoming misanthropic nihilists who ignore anarchism's core
humanitarian message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when there is rising interest among young people,''
Bookchin said, ``we are shooting ourselves in the foot.''

   HINES-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ Now for the hard part. George W.
Bush has had a phenomenal post-primary season. Now Bush has

   ELY-COLUMN (Philadelphia) _ Bill Clinton got it wrong when he

father's. By JANE ELY.

<P>
   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ The relationship between the
George W. Bush's Republicans and Bill Clinton is a fascinating
study in contradictions. On the one hand, GOP leaders express their
disgust with the president's behavior and speak longingly of having
a president worthy of their respect. On the other hand, their
decision to transform the GOP's image by opening the party's doors
widely to African Americans, Hispanics and gays copies the type of
strategy that twice won the presidency for Clinton and the
Democrats. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (For release Sunday, Aug 6.)

DEAD ROBIN CONFIRMS MOSQUITOES   CARRYING WEST NILE VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Clarifies, in 4th graf, that robins don't fly long distances in
the summer.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts officials identified two more birds
infected with the West Nile virus Friday, one day after they
announced that the sometimes-lethal virus had not been detected in
the state in almost two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dead birds, a robin found in a residential
neighborhood in the city's Jamaica Plain section, confirms the
virus is being carried and spread by local mosquitoes, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Staten Island, N.Y. Friday, the first human West
Nile infection this year surfaced: a 78-year-old man who reported
to a New York hospital on July 22 complaining of dizziness and
fever. He was hospitalized for a week and is now at home
recovering, said New York health officals.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday the virus had only been detected here in crows,
which easily could have flown to Boston from New York, where the
virus is most heavily concentrated. But robins don't fly long
distances at this time of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robins are local and the only way one could've gotten the
virus is by getting bit by an infected mosquito here,'' said state
Department of Public Health spokesperson Roseanne Pawelec. ``That
basically indicates the virus is present in mosquitoes in this
area.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the robin, another West Nile-infected crow found
in a residential Brookline neighborhood was identified Friday,
bringing the total number of diseased birds found in Massachusetts
to four. All but one were found in the area where Jamaica Plain
meets Brookline, not surprising, said state officals, given the
tree and pond-filled parks there.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday state officals told the public that a mass testing of
7,000 mosquitoes and 200 birds turned up no signs of the virus.
Although the newly discovered birds seem to contradict this
reassurance, state officials said they were consistent with earlier
state predictions that sporadic signs of the virus would surface
throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's here, and from now until the cold begins, we're going to
be concerned about people avoiding mosquito exposure,'' said Alfred
DeMaria, director of communicable diseases for the state Department
of Public Health. ``I'm sure we'll eventually find infected
mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 the virus killed 7 elderly people in Queens, N.Y., and
sickened 60. New York officials responded to the report of the
first human case by announcing they would redouble their aggressive
mosquito-spraying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of West Nile virus typically experience flu-like
symptoms. In a small number of cases, the virus can cause fatal
brain swelling. The elderly, infants and those with weakened immune
systems are considered particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Health officals here issued now-familiar suggestions: wear long
clothes when outside, consider using mosquito repellent, avoid
parks around dusk and dawn, and empty containers with stagnant
water in them.
</P>
<P>
   The Culex pipiens mosquito, the type that carries the virus, is
currently in the midst of its annual population explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, officals said they would spray pesticides in a
two-mile radius around where the two new birds were found. Spraying
will occur late at night. They will also continue to lay tiny
poison tablets in thousands of mosquito breeding grounds around the
city.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston prevention effort is dwarfed by the goings on in New
York. Friday night, entire area codes in the Bronx were sprayed
with pesticides, as were massive Central Park and parts of the chic
upper East and West Sides in Manhattan.

COMMENTARY: FOR GERALD FORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The posturings and hypocrisies of the Republican
Convention were pushed aside, in my mind, by the news that
President Ford had suffered a small stroke. It made all the talk in
Philadelphia seem even emptier.
</P>
<P>
   One of my greatest regrets as a newspaper columnist is how I
underrated Gerald Ford when he was in the White House. It is time,
past time, to say what a model of decency and respect for law he
has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our long national nightmare is over,'' he said when he took
office after Richard Nixon's resignation on Aug. 9, 1974. ``Our
Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and
not of men.''
</P>
<P>
   Those too young to have experienced Watergate may find it hard
to understand how much those few simple words meant. Here was a
president who trusted our system instead of conniving against it.
And not just Ford's words but the plain sincerity of the man who
uttered them. We needed someone we could believe.
</P>
<P>
   Belief was wounded when Ford pardoned Nixon a month later. I was
harshly critical of the pardon. So it is only right to say that I
am less sure now. I believed him in 1998 when he wrote, on The New
York Times Op-Ed page: ``In the end I listened to only one voice,
that of my conscience. I didn't issue the pardon for Nixon's sake,
but for the country's.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, as a former president, Ford took part in one of those
constitutional seminars that Fred Friendly put on, in which
panelists played roles in prickly scenarios. The issue at one point
was whether a president should take an action he deemed vital for
national security even though Congress had forbidden it.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyer, on the panel, urged him to ignore the
congressional restriction. But Ford rejected the advice. A
president, he said, had to follow the law, however inconvenient.
</P>
<P>
   When he entered the White House, two of Nixon's attorneys
general had been sentenced for crimes. The Justice Department,
crucial to the legal climate of the country, was in a terrible
state.
</P>
<P>
   Ford had to choose a new attorney general. He appointed Edward
Levi, president of the University of Chicago, who was revered by
lawyers across the country. When Levi died earlier this year, Ford
spoke at his memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know his politics when I appointed him,'' Ford said.
``All I knew was that he shared my reverence for the Constitution
....
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Ed Levi, American citizens protesting the policies
of their government no longer had to fear illegal surveillance,
improper wiretaps or outright harassment .... In recommending John
Paul Stevens for the Supreme Court, Ed ... promoted one of the
nation's most distinguished jurists ....''
</P>
<P>
   But of course Edward Levi could not have done what he did
without a president secure enough in his own character to have such
an independent-minded attorney general. How many presidents would
appoint an attorney general without knowing his politics, and
resolutely support him whatever the political cost? That takes real
courage.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering what Gerald Ford did as president takes us back to
Philadelphia. For the convention made clear, despite its
papered-over unity, what a hard time George W. Bush would have
dealing with his party if he was elected president _ how much he
would need the courage and independence of Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Bush speaks of wanting to carry on the fight against racism in
this country. But what would he do about the Republican senators
who have refused to confirm a single black nominee to the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which has more black citizens than any
other circuit?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the Republican Party of Colin Powell? Or is it the party
of Sen. Trent Lott and Rep. Tom DeLay? When Republicans push
through environmental ripper bills drafted by polluting companies,
would George W. Bush have the courage to veto them as President
Clinton did?
</P>
<P>
   Most important, would Bush be ready to do what he has not done
as governor of Texas _ think seriously about the American legal
tradition and what it demands? Would he follow Gerald Ford in
putting politics second to respect for law?
</P>

RIDING CONVENTION MOMENTUM, BUSH LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TOUR

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Gov. George W. Bush came roaring out of the Republican
National Convention on Friday by plane, train and automobile,
intent on sustaining whatever momentum he seized from the four-day
political extravaganza in Philadelphia and focused on a group of
swing states that Democrats won in both of the last two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, now officially the Republican presidential
nominee, traveled from Pennsylvania to Michigan, with several stops
in Ohio in between, to reiterate his vow to bring a new harmony and
integrity to Washington, rejoice in the unity that he said the
Republican Party had achieved and just plain grin. It was clear
that Bush had been pleased with the convention, and with his own
performance there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how energized I am,'' Bush told a crowd of
hundreds along a stretch of train tracks near downtown Pittsburgh,
where he began the westward whistlestop tour that consumed the bulk
of his day. In a classic campaign tableau, he stood on a kind of
balcony, draped in red, white and blue bunting, at the back of the
rear car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be long now,'' Bush said, repeating a line from his
convention speech that forecast the ouster of President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore and the arrival of a Republican
administration in their stead. ``Give us a chance to change America
for the better, and it won't be long now.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some portions of his convention speech, this was a clearly
partisan appeal that belied his exhortations for across-the-aisle
amity, and the crowd duly chanted, ``No more Gore! No more Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   And like much of the convention itself, Bush was trying to have
it several ways at once. At a prayer breakfast Friday morning in
Philadelphia, he made a point of saying that ``the gateway to
heaven has many different paths.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also listened politely as one of the invited guests,
Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, explicitly railed
against abortion and implicitly indicted marriage between
homosexuals, saying that ``millions of children have been
slaughtered'' and that society was plagued by ``sexually unbridled
permissiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said repeatedly that he wanted to change the tone in
Washington. But his own voice had vinegar mixed with the honey.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign plane Friday, Bush said that he was not
indulging in negative campaigning, against either Clinton or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say I'm going to bring honor and dignity to the White
House,'' Bush said, ``that's what I'm going to do. And if people
draw conclusions other than that, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to some pointed jokes about Gore in his convention
speech, Bush added: ``The idea of needling the opponent with good
humor _ that's what American politics should be about, as opposed
to trying to tear people down and distort. And I'm going to
continue pointing up differences, and I will do so in a respectful
way and occasionally put a needle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Several polls taken toward the end of the convention suggested
that Bush had latched onto an effective strategy and was enjoying a
better ``bounce'' from the event, and from the attention that it
garnered, than candidates sometimes do.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A bipartisan survey conducted during the convention by Voter.com
found a 10-point bounce for Bush, leaving him with 49 percent and
Gore with 31 percent. Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, had 6
percent, and Pat Buchanan, the likely Reform Party candidate, had 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because those polls were so promising, the Bush campaign
actually sought to soft-pedal them, so that Republicans would not
be lulled into an outsize optimism about Bush's prospects, and so
that the inevitable tightening of the race between Bush and Gore
would not be portrayed as a downturn for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``Listen, there's going to be all kinds of polls and
speculation between now and Election Day and I understand that and
that's why I think it's so important for us to be patient and keep
our eye on the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, ``You've got to wait
a few days, let the bounce settle. Al Gore has much more room to
bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign's confidence was evident in its itinerary:
just as Bush had traveled to the convention by visiting a series of
states that Republicans had not won in a presidential election
since 1988, it was traveling out of the convention in the same
fashion. After stops over the next few days in Ohio, Michigan and
Illinois, the campaign is heading next week to California, Oregon
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To help hold onto the sense of momentousness from the
convention, Bush traveled with his wife, Laura; his running mate,
Dick Cheney; Cheney's wife, Lynne, and a larger group of his senior
advisers than he typically does. And he hit eight cities, nine of
them while on the train, which started in Pittsburgh and ended in
Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The stops came as frequently as every 15 to 20 minutes, and Bush
kept his remarks extremely brief, electing general expressions of
emotion over specific allusions to policy. Time and again, he
reflected that his favorite moment of the convention was the speech
by Laura Bush on Monday night, and he remarked on what a beautiful
smile she had.

HOSPITAL CHAIN'S CRITICS CALL RECOVERY INCOMPLETE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, August 6)

 By KATHLEEN SHARP    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   She built the nation's second-largest hospital chain and
achieved stellar profits in a battered industry, Jeffrey Barbakow,
the chief executive of the Tenet Healthcare Corp., has taken a lot
of heat. Over the last seven years, people from Philadelphia to Los
Angeles have watched Tenet buy their community hospitals,
streamline operations and cut back on staff. Labor relations have
suffered. Union leaders and some public health advocates question
whether Barbakow's economizing will harm patient care, especially
for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Barbakow says the financial skills he honed in a career outside
the hospital business have let him improve Tenet's performance for
shareholders and patients alike. But his mission now is to keep
patients and employees as happy as he has Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   At the least, he has turned Tenet, formerly National Medical
Enterprises, from one of the most scandal-ridden chains into one of
the most admired among its peers and on Wall Street. Since he took
over in 1993, Tenet's revenue has grown fivefold, to $11 billion a
year. After four years of erratic earnings, Tenet reported a 20
percent jump in profits for the year that ended May 31, to $302
million, and its stock price has doubled in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts say they think that its days of draconian cutbacks
are over. ``Tenet's operating performance has been extremely good
in a tough environment,'' said John Hindelong of Donaldson, Lufkin
&AMP; Jenrette. ``It could help undo the damage to the reputation of
for-profit hospitals.''
</P>
<P>
   As hospital reimbursements have shrunk, especially from
Medicare, hospitals have lost either money or integrity. The
nation's largest hospital chain, Columbia/HCA, paid $745 million
this spring to settle the government's charges that it defrauded
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet itself has problems in its history. Its predecessor,
National Medical Enterprises, owned the second-largest chain of
psychiatric hospitals when Barbakow became a company director in
1991. At the time, former patients contended that employees had
routinely restrained and drugged them in order to loot their
insurance funds. In 1993, not long after Barbakow was hired as
chief executive, FBI agents arrived one morning and seized company
records.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, the company paid more than $600 million
in legal settlements, agreed to install a hot line for employees to
report abuses and started ethics training. In 1995, the company
changed its name to Tenet and next year moved from Santa Monica,
Calif., to Santa Barbara, where Barbakow already had a home.
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to rebuild his company, Barbakow faced employees
who already suspected him of being in it only for the money. They
recalled how Barbakow, a former investment banker, spent two years
in the late 1980s helping Kirk Kerkorian, the financier and deal
maker, sell his troubled MGM/UA Studio. Even though the sale
unraveled, Barbakow pocketed $20 million. ``He's a junk-bond
salesman who's interested in fees,'' said Jorge Rodriquez, an
officer of the Service Employees International Union, Local 399, of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over at Tenet, Barbakow shed psychiatric hospitals
and focused on acute care. He also consolidated Tenet's purchasing,
saving millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Then Barbakow acquired weaker chains, like American Medical
International in 1995, and OrNda Healthcorp in 1997. He sold or
closed unprofitable hospitals, some with occupancy rates as low as
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The closings forced some patients to travel farther and required
some urban hospitals to absorb more emergency room visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often lose access to care for the people who need it
most,'' said Dr. Michael Cousineau, a professor of health
administration at the University of Southern California. ``But it's
part of the industry's consolidation trend.'' Tenet, in response,
says it has increased charity care at some hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But cases of business practices run amok continue to recur. In
1998, doctors at two Tenet hospitals in California refused to give
poor women epidurals to relieve their labor pains unless they each
paid $400 in cash. Tenet, which confirmed the episode, reprimanded
the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, an uninsured patient at Lutheran Medical Center, a
Tenet facility, was refused a $1,250 operation in 1997 for
endometriosis, a condition of the uterus that threatens fertility.
Lacking the credit to qualify for even a hospital loan, she
borrowed a down payment from her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   When Tenet tried to buy the prestigious St. Louis University
Medical Center that year, Archbishop Justin Rigali opposed it,
saying, ``The poor will pay the price.'' Likewise, when Tenet
wanted to buy the Queen of Angels/Hollywood Presbyterian Medical
Center in California, Cardinal Roger Mahoney threatened to go to
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Barbakow persevered and bought both hospitals. ``You have to
fight the battle every time you enter a community and show people
that you are going to do the right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Tenet has at times even been seen as a savior. The
Allegheny Health, Education and Research Foundation, with eight
nonprofit hospitals in Philadelphia, had lost $2.5 billion and was
about to fold in 1998. Gov. Tom Ridge lobbied for Tenet's $345
million purchase, which was completed late that year. Tenet
immediately began cutting expenses like golf club memberships for
some Allegheny officers and trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare cutbacks have forced Tenet to reduce costs more broadly
by laying off administrative staff, subcontracting janitorial
services and selling 17 hospitals last year, leaving 110.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve growth, Tenet is looking to the Internet. The company
has invested $37 million in Internet start-ups, mostly related to
health care, and realized $73 million in gains. ``We got lucky in
the beginning,'' Barbakow said.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet was also co-founder of Broadlane.com, which hospitals can
use to buy supplies, compare vendors and track orders. Not yet a
year old, Broadlane, which plans to go public, has contracts with
about 2,500 hospitals that buy $7 billion in supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet employees, however, say the company is not sharing the
wealth. Earlier this year, union negotiations between Tenet and
Massachusetts Nursing Association members in Worcester stalled over
mandatory double shifts two times a quarter. The nurses went on
strike, and Tenet hired expensive replacements.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two months, Gov. Paul Cellucci and Sen. Edward
Kennedy forced the parties back to the bargaining table. In a new
contract, the nurses agreed to work some overtime, but only
voluntarily. ``Now, it seems that Tenet is more interested in
working with us,'' said a union spokesman, David Schildmeier.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the nurses' union in Tenet's hospital in San Luis
Obispo, formed in 1995, struck last year for the third time before
winning its first contract. The nurses' union at Tenet's hospital
in Palm Springs picketed this year and won 3 percent raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tenet consistently prolongs negotiations, provokes nurses into
striking and refuses to have discussions with us about patient
care,'' said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California
Nurses Association. ``It's almost their policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbakow, however, says that keeping his staff satisfied and
productive is his top priority. ``Now we need to make sure that all
of our employees are doing the best possible jobs, that they're
happy and they focus on quality and service,'' he said.
``Everything else flows from that.'' He cites new management
training for supervisors and an online educational system that
employees can use to obtain degrees from Tenet's many academic
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, however, are no longer willing to accept Tenet's
contention that it cannot afford to give them more control and
better pay. Despite the Medicare cutbacks, Tenet is doing so well
that Barbakow, besides receiving $1.8 million in compensation last
year, also received stock options worth $26 million. His pay has
become a target for union leaders and public health advocates. It
is a sensitive topic for Barbakow, who dismisses the required
calculations of his options' value as unfair because they vest over
three years, and adds, ``It's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barbakow works in an industry in which an embarrassment of
riches is hard to find these days.

<P>
   Six Flags amusement parks are best known for their scary roller
coasters that turn riders upside-down, and this summer investors
may well feel that they have been along for the ride. The stock has
had a negative total return of 43.29 percent so far this year, and
its price has fallen to $16.375 from its 52-week high of $39.1875,
set last August.
</P>
<P>
   Even more frightening, much of that slump has happened since the
start of July _ at the height of the parks' season _ and two
leading Wall Street analysts say the cool, rainy summer weather in
the Northeast and Midwest has further dampened the company's
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The company's results for the second quarter are to be released
this week. But investors are much more on edge about the outlook
for the remainder of the summer, particularly after word on July 21
from Six Flags' smaller rival, Cedar Fair L.P., that attendance at
its five parks has been below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are the only publicly traded regional
amusement park operators; they have several parks in the same
geographic regions. Six Flags Inc., which changed its name last
month from Premier Parks, operates 27 amusement and water parks in
the United States, 7 in Europe and 1 in Mexico. Cedar Fair has four
water parks in addition to its five amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's problem, analysts and institutional investors
say, has been the weather. Parts of the New York metropolitan area
had 10 consecutive rainy days extending into last week, putting a
damper on one of Six Flags' largest and most profitable operations,
a cluster of three parks in central New Jersey _ Great Adventure,
Wild Safari and Hurricane Harbor. After that rainy stretch,
analysts at Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney lowered their
estimates for 2000 operating income for the company, as well as
their price targets for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone delayed visiting the park in June, we thought they
would make it up in July because a visit is usually delayed instead
of canceled,'' said Hayley Kissel, the Merrill analyst. ``But the
last week of July was an absolute washout, and that's making it
harder and harder to make it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kissel lowered her estimate for 2000 earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to about
$400 million, or about $2.28 a share, from her earlier one of $435
million, or $2.47 a share. Still, she maintains a buy rating on the
stock, but has lowered her 52-week price target to $27 from $34.
``They've had severe weather, but that doesn't change the
fundamentals or the operating model,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the company has developed a reputation
as an amusement park consolidator, buying older, underperforming
parks cheaply, spending money to add attractions and spruce them up
and branding them with the well-recognized Six Flags name. That has
helped the company increase cash flow steeply, said Cliff
Greenberg, portfolio manager for the Baron Small Cap fund, which
owns about a million shares of Six Flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, they're going to buy additional parks in the U.S. and
do the same thing,'' Greenberg said, adding that there are ``also
opportunities in Mexico and Europe.'' He said that at six to seven
times 2001 Ebitda estimates, the stock was attractive. ``It's not
just about this year, but next year and the prospects beyond,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some large investors are clearly skittish. On July 25, just
after Cedar Fair's warning, 3.77 million shares of Six Flags traded
hands, and the stock fell to a 52-week low of $13.93. And short
interest in the stock, which stood at 5.37 million shares as of
July 10, remains high.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts criticized Six Flags executives for not doing
more to allay investors' fears. But others say that considering the
importance of any given weekend, management could not have done
much before announcing second-quarter numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion is that if Cedar Fair lowered their guidance
then Six Flags will probably do the same,'' said Kathy Styponias,
senior entertainment analyst at Prudential Securities. ``But at
this point, it's unclear if that will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Styponias said she believed that any bad news was priced into
the stock, which she rates as a strong buy with a 52-week target of
$48.

MODEST JOB GROWTH HELPS MAJOR MARKET INDEXES RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks ended higher Friday after the Labor Department
reported that private job growth had been slower than expected in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The data appears to make an interest rate increase by the
Federal Reserve later this month less likely. And the restrained
job growth helps confirm the belief of some analysts that the
central bank will not need any more rate increases later this year
to slow economic growth to a noninflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said one more rate hike,'' Robert J. Barbera, chief
economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. in Rye Brook, N.Y., said. ``These numbers
make me look wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is some concern about corporate
earnings. Second-quarter earnings have been stronger than expected,
increasing 21.2 percent so far, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial. But a lot of companies have announced that they do not
expect to meet earnings forecasts for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in a period of trying to rationalize very high
earnings expectations,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market
strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. ``If you think
that the economy is going to grow at 3.5 percent instead of 4.5
percent, you are too high. You've got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Federal Reserve policy-makers have other important
July economic data to review before they meet on Aug. 22, including
retail sales and the Consumer Price Index. If retail sales are
unexpectedly strong, which would signal a rebound in spending,
rate-increase fears would presumably revive.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices moved up and down all day Friday. Early on, the
Nasdaq composite index was up 87 points, or 2.3 percent. But it
reversed and at one time was down 8 points. The Nasdaq finished the
day up 27.48 points, or 0.73 percent, at 3,787.36.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.17 points, or 0.57
percent, to 10,767.75. Early in the day, the Dow was off 41 points.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 10.37 points, or 0.71
percent, to 1,462.93. Market breadth was positive.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Dow industrial stocks showed how the
optimistic outlook for interest rates versus the concern about
earnings, especially in technology, played out Friday. The Dow was
led higher by financial stocks including J.P. Morgan and American
Express, which would be hurt by higher rates. Drags on the Dow
included the technology giants Intel and Microsoft, as well as
Eastman Kodak, which told investors in July that it was losing
market share.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices and yields also bounced around Friday as investors
tried to understand the import of the new jobs data. By late
afternoon, the price of the 10-year Treasury note had climbed
13/32, to 104 12/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, fell to 5.89 percent from 5.95 percent on Thursday, the
lowest since April. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.71
percent from 5.74 percent. Next week, the Treasury will sell $25
billion in new securities.
</P>
<P>
   The employment data showed that private-sector jobs rose by
138,000 in July, less than in June and less than the 182,000
average for the first six months of the year. Analysts said the
291,000 increase in the pool of available workers indicated there
might be some slack developing in a very tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera of Hoenig said that the most important matter facing
investors is not whether there will be one more interest rate
increase by the Fed. What is more important, he maintained, is that
corporate earnings are probably going to slow more than even
worried investors expect.
</P>
<P>
   The strong earnings growth in the first and second quarters, he
argued, was the peak. He said investors were focusing more on the
positive expectation that the Fed could guide the economy to a soft
landing, avoiding recession, than the effect that a slowdown in
growth would presumably have on corporate earnings.

NAACP PLANS MAJOR VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, seeking to play a more active role in the
presidential elections this year, is planning to mount a
multimillion-dollar campaign to mobilize and register black voters.
</P>
<P>
   The association plans to spend about $7 million on a
wide-ranging campaign that is likely to include television, radio
and newspaper advertising, direct mailings, phone banks, pamphlets,
faxes and other tactics, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The amount earmarked for the effort is relatively small compared
with the costly standards of today's political campaigns. But it is
a significant sum for an organization like the NAACP, with an
annual budget of $19 million. Its previous efforts have been
largely limited to grass-roots voter education and registration,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Pringle, a spokeswoman for the NAACP's National Voter
Fund, said the group would not endorse candidates in its drive to
increase black voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   But she said the effort would highlight the records of
presidential and congressional candidates on issues that are
important to blacks, Hispanics and other racial and ethnic
minorities. Those issues, she said, include education, health care,
civil rights and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot at stake'' in the November elections, Pringle
said, adding: ``This is based on the NAACP's belief that an
informed voter is an empowered voter.'' The drive, she said, will
be kicked off in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP's campaign comes as some of its members have warned
that the outcome of the presidential election in November could
have a major impact on the course of civil rights. In particular,
the members have voiced concern that another conservative member on
the Supreme Court could be a major setback for that cause.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters now make up 15 percent of the electorate, and they
usually provide overwhelming support for Democrats. But Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, has been
campaigning in black and Hispanic communities, in an effort to
underscore his message of inclusiveness.

 &HT;    Macabre `farm' helps solve crimes
 &HT;    By Ken Mink
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ At ``the Body Farm,'' corpses are left lying
in a field for study. And one of the directors thinks it would be
great if medical officials in Atlanta, Miami and elsewhere would
start doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Murray Marks, the associate director of the University
of Tennessee Medical Center's Anthropological Research Facility,
said ``a lot more criminal cases would be solved and victims
identified if there were more such research facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical science needs to know more about how differing
environmental conditions affect the decomposition of bodies,'' he
said. ``The differences in the heat, humidity, cold, rain, snow,
ice and so forth are major factors. We have only the climate in
East Tennessee to guide us right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marks, 44, admits the idea of placing bodies around a field
and chronicling their decomposition is probably too macabre to win
approval anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our facility is the only one in America, and perhaps the only
one in the world, where this kind of study is going on,'' he said.
``I seriously doubt any other locality would ever approve such a
program. In fact, because of the highly-charged political climate,
I don't think we could even get one approved here if we had to
start over.'' Center founder William Bass III and UT medical school
officials have managed to convince legislators of the scientific
value of the program, which provides practical training for
students seeking to become forensic scientists. Law enforcement
agencies, including the FBI, use the facility for training.
</P>
<P>
   The school has turned out more forensic experts than any school
in the country, said Marks, a graduate of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Another graduate, William Rodriguez, is chief deputy in the
Armed Forces Medical Examiner's Office and was co-leader of the
team of U.S. forensic experts that investigated sites of alleged
massacres in Kosovo. Officials from the Body Farm went to Waco,
Texas, at the request of the federal government to identify the
skull of David Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidian group whose
members died in a fire after a standoff with government agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Body Farm name was popularized by author Patricia Cornwell
of Charlottesville, Va., who wrote a 1994 book by that title. In
her story, a crime-fighting forensic doctor ran experiments on dead
bodies for the book's main character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Cornwell
has said the UT Body Farm program inspired her to write the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The research facility has survived several attempts to close it.
Tennessee state Sen. Tommy Haun in 1995-96 led a campaign to cut
state financing for the Body Farm, saying some veterans groups had
complained that veterans might be among the paupers studied at the
site. A Knoxville citizens group, called Solutions to Issues of
Concern to Knoxvillians, once picketed The Body Farm with signs
reading, ``This makes me sick.'' But there have been no citizen
protests in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bass, 71, retired as director of the program a few months ago,
and Richard Jantz and Marks took the reins.
</P>
<P>
   The program began in 1972. ``When I found body decomposition in
Tennessee was a lot different than in Kansas, where I was a teacher
for 11 years before coming to UT,'' Bass said, ``I decided science
needed better knowledge about this for identification and
crime-solving purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some 300 bodies have been studied at the
facility, Marks said. Bodies have been placed in the trunk of an
old car, submerged in water, partly buried and left lying in the
open.
</P>
<P>
   The Body Farm covers about three acres on a hillside near the UT
Medical Center. It is an unmarked area surrounded by two fences,
one with razor wire to keep out curiosity-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies for the facility come from three sources: Unclaimed
paupers (saving the state the $700 cost of burial), people who
donate their bodies for general scientific study, and people who
sign up to have their bodies sent specifically to the Body Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than 200 people who have signed up with us to
take over their bodies when they die,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Bass said he, too, is considering donating his body to the
program. ``I lost two wives to cancer, and now I am married for the
third time. If my current wife agrees, I would like to have my body
made a part of the program. Why waste a perfectly good skeleton.

BUSH BOUNCES OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio _ Without skipping a beat, George W. Bush
parlayed his successful nominating convention into a jubilant
campaign swing, riding a train through two battleground states
Friday and urging supporters at each stop to ``give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence the journey took Bush through three
separate media markets. Billed as a modern version of a
``whistle-stop tour,'' Bush and his entourage rode the train
through Pennsylvania and Ohio for just six hours before reboarding
the campaign plane to fly to Detroit, where he will launch another
train tour Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In both his zig-zag tour and his earnest rhetoric, Bush sought
to portray himself as still working hard to win support, despite
his soaring lead in national polls and the overwhelming belief
among many Republicans that the election is already won. Repeatedly
throughout the day Bush reveled in his post-convention polling
``bounce,'' but insisted he was not taking his frontrunner status
for granted. The tactic seemed to reflect a lesson learned in New
Hampshire, where Bush was seen as arrogantly assuming the primary
was his; he subsequently lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough campaign,'' Bush told a crowd
gathered at a stop in western Pennsylvania. ``That's why we're here
in Wampum, Pennsylvania. We're taking no votes for granted. I want
you to remind your friends and neighbors when voting time comes who
came and asked. We're here asking.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, were campaigning
in industrial states that have historically been major
battlegrounds in presidential elections, several thousand
Republicans were departing Philadelphia, leaving behind a week-long
pall of clouds that hung over the city throughout the convention
but energized by the prospect of victory this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A Voter.com-Battleground tracking poll released Friday showed
that the Bush convention boosted his lead over Vice President Al
Gore to 50-31. The survey was conducted Wednesday and Thursday and
had a margin of error of three points, plus or minus. A quick boost
in support is common following party conventions, and Gore has a
chance to retake the lost ground when the Democrats gather in Los
Angeles in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush entourage was particularly heartened that polling
indicated that GOP nominee had gained significant support among
independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was clearly eager to lock down support in several swing
states before next week, when attention will turn toward the
Democratic gathering. Facing an election that will likely turn on
the mood of centrist Democrats and independents, Bush headed into
Democratic strongholds, repeating the inclusive message that
defined the Republican convention in working class settings such as
Akron and Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   As the train rolled through the countryside, Bush drew small but
eager crowds at local stops. In Lowellville, Ohio, dozens of
supporters stood chanting by the train tracks, holding Bush-Cheney
signs. A Texas flag hung from the side of a tobacco store.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, Bush urged more than 100 gathered at the train
station to ``give us a chance to change America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it won't be long now,'' he said, in a refrain from his
acceptance speech Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was up until 1:30 a.m. on the night of the speech,
sounded tired, and his remarks at each stop were brief. He said he
had stayed up late talking with members of his family. ``I wasn't
partying,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Providing backup was his running mate, Dick Cheney, who also
stuck to brief remarks on his favored themes. Standing at a podium
on the caboose of the 16-car train, Cheney used lines from his own
convention speech: ``Help is on the way,'' he said in a monotone
voice, followed immediately by, ``It's time for them to go,''
</P>
<P>
   But he also underscored the message of the day: Don't assume
victory. ``We're going to have to battle all the way down to
November 7 to be successful,'' he said, ``but we will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush hammered the point home repeatedly, telling reporters just
before departing from Philadelphia that he was uninterested in
polls that showed him ahead. Although he has said so in the past,
Bush seemed especially concerned that he not appear complacent with
three months remaining in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats expressed skepticism at the notion that Bush had
opened up an impressive lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our convention will show'' the people ``that Al is on their
side, ready to be president and he's got the right ideas to build
on our program,'' said Doug Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But the momentum, for the moment, appeared to be on Bush's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be all kinds of polls and speculation
between now and election day,'' Bush said. ``That's why it's so
important for us to be patient and keep our eye on the finish line.
We've got a strategy in place. The key is to remember that the
issues are going to win this campaign. I'm going to keep talking
about issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who joined Bush
for part of Friday's trip, said the show of caution wise.
``Republicans are pretty confident _ overly confident, I think,''
Portman said. ``Politics goes up and down. ... I think complacency
is a perpetual problem coming off a convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the comments were at odds with the aura of supreme
satisfaction surrounding the campaign in the wake of the acceptance
speech Bush delivered the night before. Calling it ``the speech of
his life,'' communications director Karen Hughes said the Texas
governor had succeeded in showing he is ``obviously a very
different person'' than President Clinton and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also defended Bush against criticism that he had broken
his own embargo on personal attacks. Denying his remarks, including
that Clinton ``squandered'' his chance at greatness, could be
construed as negative, Hughes said: ``That was not the language of
attack. It was the language of inspiration that's uniting this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some gentle needles, but the tone ... was one of
missed opportunities,'' she said. ``What were we going to say,
`It's time for them to stay'? ''

VERIZON'S PROPOSAL TO UNIONS NOT LIKELY TO AVERT STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verizon Communications, the nation's largest wireless and local
telephone company, moved to avoid a strike by more than 86,000
telephone workers from Maine to Virginia by submitting a proposal
Friday addressing some of its unions' main contractual concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the possibility of a walkout may have increased after
Verizon skirted other important issues, like its wireless work
force organizing a union, the contracting out of some labor and the
loss or migration of jobs as a result of mergers in the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the company and the unions agree on issues by 12:01 a.m.
Sunday or agree to extend discussions _ 72,000 members of the
Communications Workers of America and 14,700 members of
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers will walk out on
Verizon, the new name of the company formed when Bell Atlantic
acquired GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to win assurances from Verizon making it easier to
organize employees into unions in the wireless division are at the
heart of the dispute. Unlike their counterparts in more traditional
areas of the telecommunications industry, wireless workers are
generally not union members.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few dozen of the 32,000 employees in Verizon's wireless
division are union members, compared with nearly 80 percent of the
120,000 employees in the company's local telephone operations.
Concerned that the wireless division is growing much faster than
the rest of the company, the union membership of Verizon's work
force is threatening to walk out.
</P>
<P>
   If the unions do strike, the telephone network would probably
not be disrupted, the company said. But about 25 million businesses
and households on the East Coast, could be inconvenienced by delays
in requests to repair or install phone service, make
operator-assisted calls and have questions answered about telephone
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency services like 911 would not be disrupted in the event
of a walkout, according to Verizon officials. The company also said
it would give communications for hospitals and other health care
operations priority. The company said it did not yet know if it
would create hotlines or special telephone numbers for customers
inconvenienced by a possible work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid a strike, Verizon made its proposal Friday
morning addressing wage, pension and job security. Representatives
from the two unions and Verizon discussed the proposal at length
Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Verizon would increase wages by 3 percent to
4 percent per year for unionized employees, improve pension plans
for active employees and offer some job security, although details
of this part of the proposal were not clear Friday night, according
to Eric Rabe, a spokesman for Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company plans to offer increased financing for
day care programs, improved medical benefits for new employees and
an adoption reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the communications workers union, the proposal
did not address concerns about forced overtime, the movement of
work locations as a result of the merger, or the contracting out of
some services to nonunion companies in areas, including the
installation of high-speed Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the company would rather farm out work this means one
company installs the line on the outside of the building, which is
us, and another on the inside, which is them,'' said Ed Mcgowan, a
Verizon employee who installs digital service lines in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This results in a big headache for the customer, who has to be
at home for two days instead of one, and a loss of income to a
nonunion company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side appeared optimistic about the chances of reaching
an agreement before the strike deadline Sunday, people close to the
talks said. The involvement of senior company and union officials
in negotiations, which could change their direction, is only
expected on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the talks between the unions and Verizon are
likely to have repercussions throughout the entire wireless
communications industry. Verizon Wireless, which Verizon owns in an
alliance with Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, is the nation's largest
wireless company with 26 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the wireless industry has not organized into unions,
although some companies, like SBC Communications and BellSouth,
which together operate the nation's second-largest wireless
carrier, make organizing efforts easier by allowing employees to
join a union if a majority of employees at a given site agree to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If unions can tap into a key area like wireless, it means much
more than simple wage increases or better pensions,'' said Stanley
Aronowitz, a sociology professor at the City University of New
York. ``This is about questioning who benefits from wealth creation
in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on figures before the company became Verizon last spring,
Bell Atlantic's wireless division outstripped its traditional
land-line operations in generating revenue, according to the
communications workers union.
</P>
<P>
   For example, each wireless employee generates $325,000 a year in
revenue, or 230 percent more than counterparts in regular telephone
operations. And the company's wireless operations generate $532 a
year in revenue from each customer, compared with $324 a year for
each telephone company customer.
</P>
<P>
   A Verizon spokesman said the company was wary of discussing the
organization of its wireless work force into a union because
Verizon Wireless operates as a separate company from Verizon
Communications.

 &HT;    Southern Co. hit by California electricity crisis
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ California's electricity crisis is proving to be one
big headache for Southern Co.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale price caps, imposed this week after prices
skyrocketed, are affecting revenue for the company's San Francisco
Bay Area power plants that sell electricity in wholesale markets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the prospect that regulators might now reverse the
state's landmark electricity deregulation law has raised questions
about the timing, at least, of Southern's plans to build more
generators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought these plants in good faith based on an understanding
of how the market was set up,'' said Randy Harrison, chief
executive officer of Southern Energy California, the company's West
Coast subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the rules are constantly changing, and there's the threat
of re-regulation. We're watching things very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy Inc. became the primary power producer in the
Bay Area in April 1999 after purchasing three power plant complexes
from Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric for $801 million. The San Francisco
utility company divested itself of the units as part of
California's electric utility deregulation, enacted by the state
Legislature in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Co. subsidiary announced plans in September to add
``state of the art'' natural gas-fueled generators in the city of
San Francisco and Contra Costa County at a cost of between $400
million and $600 million, to be completed in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But California's power grid strained to the breaking point this
week when temperatures topped 100 degrees. Monthly power bills for
homes and businesses in Southern California have more than doubled,
in part due to a shortage of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Ramped-up air conditioners sent wholesale prices to the legal
limit of $500 a megawatt hour, and the California Independent
System Operator reduced the cap to $250. Earlier this summer, the
cap was reduced from $750 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said that Southern anticipated a $750 cap this summer,
the most profitable period of the year for power producers. ``We
make our money in hot weather for a few days,'' he said. Southern
had expected price caps to be eliminated entirely in November.
``Now, it's a question mark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison declined to say how much the lower prices are costing
the company. Credit Suisse First Boston estimated last year that
the California power plants, not including any expansion, would add
$50 million in net income this year.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison also said Southern will have to decide during the next
90 days whether to proceed with construction of the San Francisco
plant. In the long run, he expects the problems to be straightened
out and for Southern and other companies to build new generators.

 SLOWER JOB GROWTH FOR JULY EASES FEAR OF FED RATE HIKE  (ART ADV:
Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients. Nonsubscribers can
purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American companies added fewer jobs in July than economists had
expected, reducing the chances that the Federal Reserve will raise
interest rates when it meets later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that economic growth is slowing, the unemployment rate
remained unchanged at 4 percent in July as private-sector payrolls
grew by 138,000, about half the number that most analysts had
predicted. Overall employment fell by 108,000 last month because of
the large number of temporary government workers who finished
collecting census data in June, the Department of Labor reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an economy that has gone from spectacular growth to
steady and solid growth,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing companies and restaurants accounted for more than
two-thirds of the job growth last month, and other sectors _ such
as real estate, construction, and insurance _ hired relatively few
new workers. In what may be a sign that businesses expect sales to
slow, the number of people working for temporary employment and job
placement firms fell, and overall growth in that sector so far this
year is now less than half what it was in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is slowly losing altitude,'' said James Glassman,
a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The employment numbers offered the first broad picture of the
economy's performance in July, and are leading economists to
predict that the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee will
decide on Aug. 22 that it does not need to raise interest rates in
order to slow growth. Last week, Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, told members of Congress that the jobs data, as
well as upcoming reports on inflation and productivity, would have
``a significant effect upon what action the committee chooses to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1999, the Fed has raised its benchmark short-term
interest rate six times to 6.5 percent, from 4.75 percent, in an
attempt to ward off inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The one sign of inflationary pressure in Friday's report was a
mild one: Hourly wages for production employees, who make up about
three-fourths of the work force, rose by 6 cents, to $13.76. Since
the start of the year, wages have risen at an annual rate of 4
percent, up from 3.2 percent in the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Other labor costs, such as benefits and bonuses, appear to be
growing more quickly, said Ken Matheny, a senior economist at
Macroeconomic Advisers, a consulting firm in St. Louis. The
government will report official compensation numbers next week.
</P>
<P>
   Productivity gains also appear to be strong, allowing companies
to increase their workers' pay without raising prices to maintain
profits, analysts said. That, combined with the moderate
private-sector job growth, has left both economists and investors
confident that the Fed let the interest rates stand, just as it did
at its most recent meeting in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report was the final nail in the coffin,'' said William
Dudley, the chief domestic economist at Goldman, Sachs. The
investment bank told clients Friday that it was changing its
forecast and no longer expects a rate climb in August or for the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major stock market indexes closed higher Friday, as
investors' confidence about the stability of the interest rates
outweighed tepid profit announcements in the drug and semiconductor
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists think a rate increase is still possible, if not
in August then at the following meeting of the committee, in
October. Factory orders and consumer confidence have both risen
recently, and the gross domestic product grew at a surprisingly
fast 5.2 percent annual pace in the second quarter. But most
analysts agree the odds of action by the Fed has fallen in recent
weeks. Aside from the spike in gas prices, inflation remains
slight, and recent statistics on consumer spending and home sales
have indicated that the economy is growing more slowly in its 10th
year of expansion.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of June, almost 90 percent of economists surveyed by
Macroeconomic Advisers, thought the Fed would raise interest rates
in August or October. By last week, the number had fallen just
below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's report depicted a job market that has changed little
over the last nine months, as employment growth has slowed.
Private-sectors payrolls did fall significantly in May, but modest
increases during the other months of the year have made up for the
decline. The unemployment rate has stood between 3.9 percent and
4.1 percent since October, and the portion of Americans over the
age of 16 who are working was the same as it had been in July 1999
_ 64.2 percent. Over all, 134.7 million people in the United States
hold jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate for black Americans fell 0.2 percent last
month, to 7.7 percent, but remains slightly higher than it was
earlier in the year. The rate for whites and Hispanics showed
almost no change.

 &HT;    Coke settlement following strict timetable
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Attorneys should be finished with the written version
of the June 14 settlement in the Coca-Cola discrimination suit
within a few weeks and can report on its status by early September,
the court-appointed mediator in the case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But it will still be late October at the earliest before some
2,000 current and former black employees of Coke can expect to see
copies of the proposed final agreement, including details of
monetary awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule that was announced remains in place,'' said
Hunter R. Hughes, an attorney with Rogers &AMP; Hardin, who mediated
the settlement process.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. District Judge Richard Story makes a preliminary
determination that the deal is fair, the proposed settlement would
then be mailed to class members in late October or early November.
</P>
<P>
   Four African-American plaintiffs filed suit against Coke,
alleging that the company treated them and other black employees
unfairly in pay and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Hughes said attorneys for Coke and the
plaintiffs have been ``working diligently to reduce that agreement
to writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is expected that this process will be concluded within the
next few weeks, and that in early September, the parties will be in
a position to provide a further status report on the matter,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Scott Jacobson said that status report may
include a written description of the initial June 14 agreement. He
said the process has not been accelerated. ``There is a federal
court order that does not allow us to step out of the process for
this,'' he said. ``We cannot unilaterally step out of the process
and make it faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes issued his statement about the 51-day-old process on the
same day that Larry Jones, a former Coke manager and founder of the
Committee For Corporate Justice, speculated that the two sides
hadn't actually reached an agreement in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``On June 14, I don't believe that they had much of anything,''
said Jones during a Friday press conference and protest in front of
Coke's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He said releasing the settlement details in September or later
is ``unacceptable,'' and makes it more likely that potential
members of a class-action suit will accept smaller monetary awards
than they might have agreed to earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jones' concerns, Hughes said the two sides ``did reach
an agreement in principle on June 14, and that agreement in
principle reflects the parties' resolution of the material elements
of the dispute.''

RIDING CONVENTION MOMENTUM, BUSH LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TOUR

 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Gov. George W. Bush came roaring out of the Republican
National Convention on Friday by plane, train and automobile,
intent on sustaining whatever momentum he seized from the four-day
political extravaganza in Philadelphia and focused on a group of
swing states that Democrats won in both of the last two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, now officially the Republican presidential
nominee, traveled from Pennsylvania to Michigan, with several stops
in Ohio in between, to reiterate his vow to bring a new harmony and
integrity to Washington, rejoice in the unity that he said the
Republican Party had achieved and just plain grin. It was clear
that Bush had been pleased with the convention, and with his own
performance there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how energized I am,'' Bush told a crowd of
hundreds along a stretch of train tracks near downtown Pittsburgh,
where he began the westward whistlestop tour that consumed the bulk
of his day. In a classic campaign tableau, he stood on a kind of
balcony, draped in red, white and blue bunting, at the back of the
rear car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be long now,'' Bush said, repeating a line from his
convention speech that forecast the ouster of President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore and the arrival of a Republican
administration in their stead. ``Give us a chance to change America
for the better, and it won't be long now.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some portions of his convention speech, this was a clearly
partisan appeal that belied his exhortations for across-the-aisle
amity, and the crowd duly chanted, ``No more Gore! No more Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   And like much of the convention itself, Bush was trying to have
it several ways at once. At a prayer breakfast Friday morning in
Philadelphia, he made a point of saying that ``the gateway to
heaven has many different paths.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also listened politely as one of the invited guests,
Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, explicitly railed
against abortion and implicitly indicted marriage between
homosexuals, saying that ``millions of children have been
slaughtered'' and that society was plagued by ``sexually unbridled
permissiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said repeatedly that he wanted to change the tone in
Washington. But his own voice had vinegar mixed with the honey.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign plane Friday, Bush said that he was not
indulging in negative campaigning, against either Clinton or Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say I'm going to bring honor and dignity to the White
House,'' Bush said, ``that's what I'm going to do. And if people
draw conclusions other than that, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to some pointed jokes about Gore in his convention
speech, Bush added: ``The idea of needling the opponent with good
humor _ that's what American politics should be about, as opposed
to trying to tear people down and distort. And I'm going to
continue pointing up differences, and I will do so in a respectful
way and occasionally put a needle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Several polls taken toward the end of the convention suggested
that Bush had latched onto an effective strategy and was enjoying a
better ``bounce'' from the event, and from the attention that it
garnered, than candidates sometimes do.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A bipartisan survey conducted during the convention by Voter.com
found a 10-point bounce for Bush, leaving him with 49 percent and
Gore with 31 percent. Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, had 6
percent, and Pat Buchanan, the likely Reform Party candidate, had 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because those polls were so promising, the Bush campaign
actually sought to soft-pedal them, so that Republicans would not
be lulled into an outsize optimism about Bush's prospects, and so
that the inevitable tightening of the race between Bush and Gore
would not be portrayed as a downturn for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said, ``Listen, there's going to be all kinds of polls and
speculation between now and Election Day and I understand that and
that's why I think it's so important for us to be patient and keep
our eye on the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, ``You've got to wait
a few days, let the bounce settle. Al Gore has much more room to
bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign's confidence was evident in its itinerary:
just as Bush had traveled to the convention by visiting a series of
states that Republicans had not won in a presidential election
since 1988, it was traveling out of the convention in the same
fashion. After stops over the next few days in Ohio, Michigan and
Illinois, the campaign is heading next week to California, Oregon
and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To help hold onto the sense of momentousness from the
convention, Bush traveled with his wife, Laura; his running mate,
Dick Cheney; Cheney's wife, Lynne, and a larger group of his senior
advisers than he typically does. And he hit eight cities, nine of
them while on the train, which started in Pittsburgh and ended in
Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The stops came as frequently as every 15 to 20 minutes, and Bush
kept his remarks extremely brief, electing general expressions of
emotion over specific allusions to policy. Time and again, he
reflected that his favorite moment of the convention was the speech
by Laura Bush on Monday night, and he remarked on what a beautiful
smile she had.

<P>
   LATIN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Last year was a great year for Latin
music, and by extension Latin culture, in the United States, if one
accepts that the enthusiastic reception of Latin music by
non-Latinos was a true indication of the music's health. By Peter
Watrous.

</P>
<P>
   LATIN-ROCK-MUSIC (Bogota, Colombia) _ Rock may have been born as
American music, but at middle age it is also the music of the
Americas, as quickly becomes apparent during an afternoon spent in
a recording studio here with Aterciopelados, Colombia's most
popular rock band. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   DIESKAU-MUSIC (Undated) _ Who would suspect, this late in the
game, that there were any crucial gaps left to fill in the
discography of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau? Yet here comes Myto
Records, of Milan, advertising the first release ever of
Fischer-Dieskau's first-ever operatic appearance. By Matthew
Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRONIC-MUSIC (Undated) _ The Lincoln Center Festival's
five-concert Electronic Evolution series last month surveyed the
history of electronic music, starting with the 1920 invention of
the theremin, the electronic instrument that looks like a radio
transmitter and was once a staple of sci-fi movie soundtracks.
These rewarding concerts showed where electronic music has come
from. But a free preconcert event in the Low Library at Columbia
University showed where electronic music, maybe music as a whole,
could be going. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AFFAIR-OF-LOVE-FILM (Undated) _ ``I lived a powerful love story,
I understood nothing about it, and I needed to delve into my
questions in a film,'' said the Belgian director Frederic Fonteyne,
by way of explaining his tender, unconventional and emotionally
charged movie about middle-aged romance, ``An Affair of Love.''
Written by his longtime friend and collaborator Philippe Blasband,
it depicts a 40-something woman and a slightly younger man who meet
in Paris through a personals ad that the woman has placed in order
to fulfill a particular sexual fantasy. The characters never tell
each other their names, nor do they (or we) have any information
about their respective backgrounds. By Laura Winters.
</P>
<P>
   AIMEE&AMP;JAGUAR-FILM (Undated) _ Felice Schragenheim was a
high-spirited, educated, sensual, witty and wily young lesbian,
whose dangerous misfortune was to have been born Jewish in
pre-World War II Germany. During the war she lived in Berlin under
an assumed name and worked at a Nazi newspaper, feeding information
to the underground resistance. Lilly Wust, the young wife of an SS
soldier, was the mother of four boys, and for her effort in
producing such strapping young specimens of Aryan youth, she was
awarded the Nazi's Maternal Cross in bronze. She had reportedly
once said that she could ``smell Jews,'' a comment that, when it
reached Felice via a mutual friend, challenged the playful Felice
to arrange a meeting with such a person. ``Aimee and Jaguar,''
which opens August 11, is based on the true story of Felice
Schragenheim and Lilly Wust. By Nancy Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JEWISH-TV (New York) _ You don't get much banter in the four
Hebrew horse operas being screened August 8 at the Jewish Museum in
Manhattan. Billed as ``Wild Wild West: The Jewish Experience,'' the
program is comprised of hourlong TV episodes with Jewish themes,
including a 1963 episode of the historically dubious ``Bonanza.''
``We want audiences to look critically at the way Jewish ethnicity
has been represented on TV,'' said Andrew Ingall, the museum's
broadcasting archivist. ``The Jewish characters on these shows are
basically stereotypes. But then, all four teleplays are products of
their time.'' By Franz Lidz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AFRIQUE-DANCE (Undated) _ ``Le Coq Est Mort,'' an earnest but
problematic production that will open on August 9 at the Jacob's
Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., sheds light on some of the
tensions inherent in working with people from other cultures, a
practice that is gaining favor among performing artists. By
Christopher Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   STREB-DANCE (Undated) _ At a recent dance forum, Elizabeth Streb
introduced herself with considered clarity: ``Ten years ago I
thought of myself as someone who had a dance company. Today I think
of myself as someone who creates wild actions and movement moments
in a show that I sell.'' Streb, artistic director of Streb, has
never been a typical choreographer. For her new show, ``Action
Heroes,'' Streb has pumped up the spectacle with a music-sound
score and at least the semblance of a story. Streb has gone Vegas.
Or, at least, that's where she's headed. By Ann Daly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART-ARCHITECTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EXPLORATORIUM-ART (San Francisco) _ Since the Exploratorium was
founded here 31 years ago as an innovative ``museum of science, art
and human perception,'' it has taken pride in breaking traditional
museum rules. Mixing science exhibits and artworks with little
concern about which is which, the Exploratorium encourages a
giddily high level of interactivity, inviting visitors not just to
stand and contemplate but to touch, pump, spin or otherwise mess
around with most of the 600-plus items on display. This summer,
however, a few distinguished visitors are being treated with
decidedly old-fashioned formality. By Tessa DeCarlo.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SKYSCRAPER-REFORM (Undated) _ In the absence of alternatives,
there may be no more important project under way in New York right
now than David Childs' restoration of Lever House, the
International Style skyscraper on Park Avenue. Designed by Gordon
Bunshaft and completed in 1952, Lever House was the first glass
curtain wall tower to rise in New York. It remains among the 20th
century's major landmarks. By Herbert Muschamp.

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FAUST-THEATER (Hanover, Germany) _ There are also two souls
within ``Faust.'' ``Faust,'' Part 1, published in 1808 and a work
of both Goethe's youth and maturity, contains the well-known plot _
the bargain of the learned Doctor Faust with Mephistopheles, the
seduction of the innocent Gretchen _ that has been echoed in
novels, movies, puppet shows and several operas. ``Faust,'' Part 2,
written in Goethe's old age and published shortly after his death
in 1832, is more abstract, disjunct, and hardly ever staged. So
when one of Germany's most celebrated theatrical directors, Peter
Stein, determined to mount a production of the complete uncut
``Faust,'' Parts 1 and 2, it became an event of national magnitude.

   Editors: The city of Sydney, host of the 2000 Olympic Games, is
featured in this week's travel section:
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-OLY-TICKETS (Undated) _ Time, something that many Olympic
athletes compete against, has turned out to be a friend to
Americans thinking of going to the Summer Games in Sydney next
month. Those who have waited before buying package tours to the
Games, which officially open Sept. 15 and continue to Oct. 1, will
find cheaper plans than were available several months ago. In some
cases, the savings are about 50 percent. By Joseph Siano.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-OLY-SYDNEY-QUEENSTREET-ART (Undated) _ Visitors to the
Olympics who need an antidote to the events and the crowds can
spend a few hours wandering along Queen Street in Woollahra. The
quiet, tree-lined area is filled with antiques stores and a few
smart restaurants. Much of Sydney has become overwhelmed with new
building and brash architecture, but Woollahra, one of the early
settlements of the colonial city, has retained its original terrace
houses, shady trees and village atmosphere. By Jane Perlez.

   TRAVEL-OLY-SYDNEY-ARTS-ART (Undated) _ Australia has
well-deserved credentials as one of the great sporting nations of
the world, but its reputation in the arts is a more recent
phenomenon. For visitors to the Olympic Games, the Sydney Olympic
Arts Festival, with its roster of dance, music, art, theater and
film, offers an enticing bonus, a way to appreciate the rich and
diverse culture of this antipodean nation and place Australia's
artistic achievements in an international context. The
six-week-long festival actually starts a full month before the
Games commence, to set the stage and to showcase the full scope of
arts offerings. By Susan Gough Henly.

   COCA-COLA (Daingerfield, Texas) _ Drive around here in midsummer
and you begin to understand why it turned into prime territory for
the latest skirmish in the cola wars. It was here, in the state
courthouse, that lawyers for nine bottlers and distributors of
Royal Crown Cola squared off this spring against the Coca-Cola Co.
and its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. The trial took
place six years after the Royal Crown group sued Coke and its
bottler. The plaintiffs contended that Coke, working with Coca-Cola
Enterprises, had tried unfairly since the early '90s to keep them
out of supermarkets and convenience stores. By Constance L. Hays.

   CBOT-TRADE (Chicago) _ The explosion of computerized trading is
threatening to make century-old pit trading obsolete. Indeed, some
believe the ``open outcry'' method of shouting and flashing hand
signals into a trading pit is already doomed. And so too, they say,
might be this country's oldest derivatives exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade. By David Barboza.

   TENET-HEALTHCARE (Undated) _ Jeffrey Barbakow of Tenet
Healthcare Corp. has taken a lot of heat for building the nation's
second largest for-profit hospital chain. Over the past seven
years, residents from Philadelphia to Los Angeles have watched
Tenet buy their long-standing community hospitals, streamline
operations, and downsize staff. How long, people wondered, before
Tenet would cut the hospital's traditional role of caring for the
poor? So far that hasn't happened _ despite a $205-billion-gash in
Medicare payments over the past two years. Instead, Barbakow has
managed to lift corporate profits in this battered industry while
maintaining and, sometimes improving, patient care. By Kathleen
Sharpe.

   WORLD-BIZ-POLAND (Legnica, Poland) _ Thousands of Poles, with
government aid, have worked to beat Soviet swords into a share of
post-Communist prosperity, an opportunity they have grabbed with
both hands. By Peter S. Green.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE-RESERVATIONS (Undated) _ The restaurant industry has been
slow to catch on to the electronic reservations revolution, but
there is now a growing number of Web sites that allow diners in
major cities to reserve tables online. By Randy Kennedy.

   &UR; INVESTING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-ENERGY-STOCKS (Houston) _ Will natural gas prices stay
high? Consumers hope not, but the Anadarko Petroleum Corp., for
one, is betting that they will. Prices at the wellhead have leapt
80 percent this year, to more than $4 per million British thermal
units. Further, if colder temperatures return after the
unseasonably warm winters of the last few years, supplies could be
squeezed tighter, sending prices even higher. But that may be just
the start, argue executives at Anadarko, one of the largest
independent oil and gas producers. By Richard A. Oppel Jr.

   INVEST-INSIGHT-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Jay Walker didn't play Kevin
Costner's dad in ``Field of Dreams.'' But Walker, the founder of
Priceline.com, knows all about ``if you build it, they will come.''
Essentially, that is what he has been saying since he started
Priceline. On Wall Street it's called a ``demand collection
system'' that allows people to name their price for things like
plane tickets and hotel rooms. But Walker has more building to do.

   INVEST-SIMPSON-WMGROWTH (Undated) _ Like most people who live in
Seattle, David Simpson is never too far from Mt. Rainier, the
highest peak in the Northwest. But he is often closer than most. On
weekends and vacations, Simpson leads Alpine climbers over Mt.
Rainier's glaciers and rocks; on weekdays, he drives past the

losses and restructurings. Is it a buy? By Michelle Leder.

Bernard Malamud's mythic baseball player, but now it's an obsession
that many of us seem to share about a life we have somehow lost. By
Daniel Akst.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-COLUMN (Undated) _ The wave of economic reforms that has
washed over Latin America first touched shore in Chile. That small
nation, with an economy roughly the size of New Jersey's, was the
first to tear down import barriers, liberalize exchange-rate
policy, bolster the domestic savings rate and otherwise whip itself
into shape for the new global economy. Now it wants to go further.

   STRATEGIES-COLUMN (Undated) _ One the investment world's great
unsolved mysteries has been why the dividend yield model stopped
working about a decade ago. This model, based on stocks'
dividend-to-price ratios, used to be one of Wall Street's
most-respected valuation models. Not any more. Today's investors,
who are fixated on making a quick buck, are likely to wonder how
anyone could ever have been interested in something so obviously
irrelevant as dividends. By Mark Hulbert.

   MONEY&AMP;MEDICINE-COLUMN (Undated) _ It is a familiar sequence of
events to anyone who has spent much time in a doctor's office. You
have blood taken, you call for the results, you get on with your
life _ and then weeks, months or even years later, you receive a
bill from the laboratory or explanation-of-benefits letter from
your insurance company. These missives can be maddening. By

   ABOUTCARS-MERCEDES (Undated) _ The Mercedes-Benz brochure of the
1980s described the marque's philosophy thus: A Mercedes should not
inspire aggressive driving, but if you find yourself in a bind _
say, roaring into a tight turn too fast _ the car will get you
through. That, at least, was the gist. The Mercedes was an
automotive Clark Kent, serious and sedate, but ready to fling off
its eyeglasses and soar to the rescue. There is nothing
mild-mannered about the Mercedes-Benz of today. By Serge Schmemann.

   TALISMAN-CHIC (Undated) ) There is a vastly expanding tribe of
New Yorkers who, trusting nothing to chance, attempt to ward off
evil or beguile the gods by draping themselves in exotic beads and
talismans. Beetles and Buddhas, scarabs, pentagrams and pale pink
quartz _ any of these may function as a symbol of sincere religious
belief. But in the age of Spirituality Lite, they are also likely
to attest to the wearer's inner grooviness, just as her Jimmy Choo
mules speak of her up-to-date chic. By Ruth La Ferla.

   ROCK-FAN-FAMILIES (Undated) _ The rock concert, once a raucous
and often drug-filled rite of initiation into American adolescence,
is slowly becoming a family affair. Parents of teenagers and
younger children _ ones who, in their day, treasured concerts as
escapes from the parental clutches _ now want to share the
experience with their own offspring. It is increasingly easier to
do this as the musical tastes of the generations meld _ the 40-plus
group of Americans now buy more rock albums than those 15 to 24 _
and as concerts have been tamed by commercial sponsors to be as
clean as Broadway musicals. By Leslie Kaufman.

   NITEOUT-ELIZABETH GILBERT (New York) _ On the town with
Elizabeth Gilbert, creator of ``Coyote Ugly.'' The heavily hyped

her experiences tending bar at the real Coyote Ugly in New York's
East Village. By Simon Houpt.

   DOTCOM-BLUES (Undated) _ ``Our multimillion-dollar dot-com
folded'', writes Timothy Jack Ward, ``and all I got was this lousy
T-shirt ... Everyone at Posh&AMP;Sticks got one, the day our enigmatic
_ let's face it, odd _ name was announced last January. Now it is a
bittersweet souvenir from the rush for the elusive e-commerce

whatever reason, summer bulbs are way cool again. By Tovah Martin.

   POL-CONVENTIONS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ George W. Bush went a
long way at the Republican convention toward casting himself and
his party in a favorable light. But the event was, for the most
part, dull. Bush produced what was in effect an anti-commercial _
Don't Watch This! _ for Al Gore's upcoming Democratic convention.
Gore is getting much advice about what he should do to get his

   TECH-SUITS-REVIEW (Undated) _ In a business culture that has
long fixated ambivalently on the image of computer wizards brewing
technological revolution in their garages, the backstory to two
digital copyright battles involving Napster and DVDs being waged in
federal courts on either coast has a familiar ring. They are either
tales of David vs. Goliath or of irresponsible hackers taking aim
at the establishment. Both cases have underscored the unprecedented

   THIRD-PARTIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at third-party movements
in the history of U.S. presidential elections. They have seldom
played significant roles, except as occasional issue raisers and
spoilers. In a sense, third parties have played a vital role in
America's political system by expanding it and maybe, in a peculiar
way, preserving it. By Michael Janofsky.

   ELECTRIC-DEREG-REVIEW (Undated) _ Cheap, reliable electricity
was long taken for granted in the United States. Not anymore, at
least not in California. Four years ago, California decided to
deregulate its electric industry to promote competition, lower
prices and better service. This summer, power bills have doubled in
San Diego, blackouts have hit San Francisco, and the state has been

Speaker Dennis Hastert, a former wrestling coach. By Richard
Sandomir.

<P>
   GOP-DONORS-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ It began in 1988 with Team
100, made up of $100,000 contributors, when the elder George Bush
invented the Republicans' first elite donor club. Last week the GOP
convention was overrun by a stampede of 600 Team 100 members, who
were invited to take out those checkbooks and give the party
$250,000, the entry fee to the Republican Regents, the party's

English technology-related words into their vocabulary. The
hybridization of Spanish and English into Spanglish is not new; it
has been accelerating for decades, irritating Spanish language
purists as well as Latin American nationalists who see the process

   MIDEAST-ARABS-REVIEW (Cairo) _ At the urging of the
Palestinians, a few Arab leaders like Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak and Jordan's King Abdullah have renewed the perennial call
for a summit conference of Arab leaders, this time billed an
emergency meeting for Arabs to regroup after the failure at Camp
David and to counter the U.S. spin that the breakdown was due

   BOLIVAR-VENEZUELA-REVIEW (Caracas) _ Throughout South America,
no figure is more revered and quoted than Simon Bolivar, who freed
the region from Spanish rule nearly 200 years ago. But Bolivar said

modern leaders like Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have a whole
menu of positions from which to choose when they seek to justify
their own actions. By Larry Rohter.

   ZIMBABWE-MUGABE-REVIEW (Harare) _ In the West, Zimbabwe's
President Robert Mugabe is seen as a bloody despot and race-monger
who fuels the violence that churns through the countryside. But in
much of Africa, he is viewed as a hero trying to redress historical
wrongs. To many Westerners, these two conflicting views seem
impossible to reconcile. How can Mugabe be praised for pursuing an
honorable cause if he kills innocents along the way? By Rachel
Swarns.

PLAN FOR TIMES SQUARE SINATRA STATUE GETS UNDER SKIN OF SOME
PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
  By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy got a spot in Times
Square in 1936 for his heroics on the battlefield and the streets
of Hells Kitchen. George M. Cohan followed in 1959 as a tribute to
one of show business' greatest song and dance men.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says there is room for one more famous
bronze guy out there on the crossroads of the world. The mayor and
his office have taken a shine to Frank Sinatra, whose last big hit,
in 1980, was ``New York, New York.'' The late entertainer's
daughter, Nancy Sinatra, has found a sculptor and promises to come
up with the money. There is even talk of an interactive Sinatra,
who would croon on command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy Sinatra is thrilled; this is her dream,'' said Charlotte
Cohen of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, who has been
involved in the plans. ``Everyone would love to see it done
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hushed refrain playing around Times Square is not so
gushing or welcoming. Start spreading the news, it goes. Not Here,
Not Here.
</P>
<P>
   No one really wants to say so, at least not loudly enough to irk
Giuliani or offend the Sinatra family, but the plan to erect a
statue of Ol' Blue Eyes on a traffic island at 44th Street and
Broadway (across the street from the site off the old Paramount
Theater, where Sinatra made his first real splash in 1942) has
acquired some enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The local community board, along with some Times Square
developers, isn't crazy about the idea of a new tourist attraction
in a place where the sidewalks are already overwhelmed by crowds.
And the theater moguls say the square's 100-year-old theatrical
tradition would be shortchanged by showcasing a singer and film
actor who started in Hoboken, N.J., made a quick sensation at the
Paramount Theater and then followed fame and fortune west of the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone bristles at the thought of Giuliani as arbiter of
Broadway celebrity. The community board and other local groups have
written a letter to the mayor asking for a meeting. They hope, at
least, to get the statue moved to a less central location. ``The
real issue for a lot of us is, what is the association with
Broadway?'' said Michael Presser, executive director of Inside
Broadway, the theater industry's educational program with New York
City schools. ``We see an extremely popular artist and legend, a
man of great achievement, but we don't necessarily see someone who
has been closely associated with New York theater. We feel he is
due an honor, but we also question this particular spot in this
particular neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra fancied himself ``atop of the heap'' in the city that
doesn't sleep, but if the grumbling around Times Square is to be
believed, New Yorkers would like less Las Vegas and Hollywood in
their traffic-island idols. Times Square may be the center of the
universe, but it is also a stronghold of Midtown provincialism: On
the Great White Way, Sinatra, real or cast, is regarded as
decidedly off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office won't hear of it. Indeed, Anthony Carbonetti,
Giuliani's chief of staff, says they have not heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   Any opposition to Sinatra?
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't come up,'' Carbonetti replied.
</P>
<P>
   Does Sinatra deserve to be front and center in Times Square?
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think so,'' he said. ``But I am an
Italian-American who grew up listening to Frank Sinatra, and my
father would disown me if I said anything to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Sinatra insurrection is being staged largely in
whispers and behind closed doors is not entirely surprising.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, it is downright embarrassing for naysayers to
confess their misgivings in public. It is not easy to explain
objections to a 10-foot monument to one of America's greatest pop
singers, regardless of his New York pedigree. Times Square is
already home to a pro-wrestling restaurant, curtains of
neon-infused mindless mush and the retailer Toys ``R'' Us plans to
build a 60-foot-tall indoor Ferris wheel across the street.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of City Hall and a mayor who, as one
Times Square community leader put it, is easy to make cranky.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Sinatra went directly to Giuliani with the statue proposal
shortly after her father died in Los Angeles in May 1998, city
officials said. Carbonetti said she had apparently made the
suggestion years earlier, but was encouraged to come back when her
father was no longer living. Statues in New York, unlike street
names in Sinatra's desert haunt of Palm Springs, Calif., are the
exclusive domain of the departed.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani loved the idea and, as he is sometimes inclined to do,
gave the seal of approval without consulting particularly far and
wide.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra initiated a design competition last August, settling in
December on Neil Estern, an accomplished Brooklyn Heights sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinatra-Giuliani plan was cast in stone _ or more precisely,
bronze _ before most anyone around Times Square got wind of it.
Official notice to Times Square businesses came in January as a
fait accompli from the City Department of Transportation, which
owns the concrete swath of Broadway and Seventh Avenue that Sinatra
will share with the armed forces recruiting booth.
</P>
<P>
   A community meeting with city officials, and possibly Nancy
Sinatra, is in the making. The session was proposed in May by the
leaders of three of the area's most influential organizations:
Community Board 5, the Times Square Business Improvement District
and the Mayor's Midtown Citizens Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Giuliani, the three community groups stayed away
from questioning Sinatra's New York bona fides. Instead, they
raised fears that another attraction in Times Square, already the
human equivalent of an overrun ant hill, would lock up the last
piece of open space in the theater district.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the recruiting booth island doubles as Dick
Clark's stage on New Year's Eve, and it is also used to present
Broadway on Broadway and numerous other public events. It amounts
to little more than a Gotham-sized slice of concrete pizza, but
it's all Times Square has got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily think any statue would be appropriate for
Times Square because we probably have enough going on,'' said David
Diamond, executive director of the Stage Directors and
Choreographers Foundation, who heads the community board's
committee on Times Square. ``But I don't want to discount the
possibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's suggestion: Put Sinatra's statue in Hoboken and place
a plaque honoring him at 1501 Broadway, the former Paramount
Theater that is now a World Wrestling Federation restaurant. It was
there that thousands of screaming bobby-soxers _ 30,000 of them on
Oct. 12, 1944 _ turned Sinatra into solo music's greatest pop
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   And who should stand in for Sinatra on the recruiting booth
island?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be quoted on any name,'' Diamond said. ``I
don't want to leave anyone out and offend someone.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't they are all dead anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have estates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office says it has already solved the overcrowding
quandary by instructing Estern to come up with a design that would
allow Sinatra to be carted off for special occasions. The
Department of Transportation also has plans to restrict pedestrian
access to the island to keep fans from spilling into the street and
disrupting traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The city is still undecided about whether the statue should
sing, reserving judgment until the implications for traffic and
nearby office workers can be studied. Estern says no one has talked
to him about adapting his art into ``an elaborate juke box,'' as he
called it, but he is clearly not enamored with the suggestion.
Diamond and others who work in the area share his reluctance,
largely out of fear of overdosing on Sinatra's barreling baritone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to have a public debate, after all this is a
democracy,'' Presser said. ``This is a very public piece of land.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, director of the Percent for Art program in the Department
of Cultural Affairs, said the statue, as a privately financed
project, has not received the intense scrutiny required when public
money is expended. Nonetheless, she said, the statue must still be
reviewed by the City Art Commission for design approval and by the
Department of Transportation for traffic and safety considerations.
It is unclear, however, whether either agency will hold a public
hearing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it is something the mayor wants, then I think there
will be a statue,'' said a Midtown developer unwilling to speak if
he were named. ``Is there support? There is support, I guess,
official support.''
</P>
<P>
   Estern, an avid fan of Sinatra who regards the singer as the
perfect fit for Times Square, also thinks the resilient showman
will prevail. Look no further than Sinatra's own ode to the city,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere,'' Estern
recited. ``It's up to you _ New York, New York.''

GORE SPENT PART OF VACATION WRITING SPEECH, ADVISERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore spent part of his beach vacation writing his own speech
for next week's Democratic convention, according to Gore's Harvard
professor and longtime friend Martin Peretz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been drafted to tell him he should show it to other
people sooner rather than later,'' Peretz, who is better known as
the owner of The New Republic, said. ``And I dread saying it
because I dread his response.''
</P>
<P>
   Peretz declined to say who had drafted him for the job, though
he hinted it was Karenna Gore Schiff, Gore's oldest daughter and
one of his closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff did not say whether she had asked Peretz to prod her
father into involving the professionals, but did confirm that her
father is working on the speech himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been writing his speech all week,'' she said, typing
into a laptop on the porch of the North Carolina beach house where
the Gores were vacationing until Friday. .
</P>
<P>
   One night, Schiff said, the entire family was at the dinner
table until nearly 10 p.m., nibbling on the remains of her dad's
favorite Chinese dish, Szechuan beef, and ``listening to him talk
through some of the paragraphs he had written.''
</P>
<P>
   After returning to New York, Schiff said, she spoke with her
father on the phone on Thursday, while he was still in North
Carolina. ``I could hear the ocean in the background and he was
sitting on the porch writing,'' she said. ``He read me a few new
paragraphs, which I thought were the best yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing a speech of this importance oneself is virtually unheard
of in presidential politics. George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee, put his speechwriters through 17 drafts, but like most
candidates did not do any of the writing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, though, is a former newspaper reporter who by all accounts
wrote every word of his best-selling 1992 book, ``Earth in the
Balance.'' The eulogy he wrote for his father's funeral in 1998was
widely considered the best speech he ever gave.
</P>
<P>
   And it is hardly out of character for Gore, who often rejects
his staff's advice and does things his own way, to have taken on
the speechwriting duties. This is the candidate, after all, who
designed his own ``Gore 2000'' campaign logo.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some aides have complained that Gore relies too
much on his own instincts, and only really listens to his family,
particularly his daughter Karenna, wife Tipper and brother-in-law
Frank Hunger, who tend to support him in his own views.
</P>
<P>
   Because this speech is considered crucial for Gore's election
effort, it is not surprising, either, that there might be concern
about making sure the vice president hears from the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Gore campaign declined to say anything about
the speech or who was involved in writing it.
</P>
<P>
   While still at the beach, Schiff was not only critiquing her
dad's efforts but also working a bit on the nominating speech she
is to give in Los Angeles. ``It feels like a really important toast
at a wedding,'' she said, ``and I have to dig through my head for
anecdotes.''

BUSH GAINS POPULARITY AFTER CONVENTION, AND HOPES IT WILL LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas got a clear bump
upward from his acceptance speech and the Republican convention
generally, but its dimensions and duration were uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians around the nation said Bush had succeeded in his
most immediate task, using his first big-audience national
appearance to begin the task of showing himself to be a serious,
plausible national leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked and sounded like a leader, a potential president,''
said Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican stalwart, former Sen. John Danforth of Missouri,
said after watching the convention on television, ``I feel better
about my party than I have in a long, long time. It had just the
right tone. It's remarkable that Republicans staked out significant
issues that were the preserve of the Democrats, like Social
Security and education.''
</P>
<P>
   One overnight poll, conducted for NBC News, indicated that
Bush's lead over Vice President Al Gore had gone from 6 percentage
points to 11. Candidates almost always gain after a convention, and
Teeter, who conducted this poll with Peter Hart, a Democrat, called
it ``a normal, an average bounce.'' The other poll, by the Tarrance
Group, said the margin had gone from 8 points to 18.
</P>
<P>
   While the Tarrance Poll showed an especially big gain among
independents, there were indications in some focus-group studies
that Bush's attacks on Gore had played badly among such voters.
Frank Luntz, who conducted a convention-long focus group of 36
uncommitted voters for MSNBC, said ``virtually every criticism
received a negative reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a point hit hard for the Gore campaign by Bob Shrum, a
consultant who works on major speeches and television
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the speech will wear well,'' Shrum said,
``because he engaged in the kind of personal attacks that don't
work with independent voters and don't work with undecided
voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrum also struck a major Democratic theme when he said,
``Ultimately, people are going to come to the issues.'' Then, he
said, they will reject Bush's tax plan, which ``gives $50,000 a
year to a millionaire and a dollar a day to the working man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their whole convention was an effort to mention issues
without debating them or explaining their real positions,'' Shrum
said.
</P>
<P>
   That will be a major theme of the Democratic convention,
contending that the Bush proposals on issues like Social Security,
taxes, education and health will not work and will favor only the
rich. Democrats will also strongly criticize his record in Texas on
the environment and health.
</P>
<P>
   But that tack, Luntz warned, carries risks of its own. He said
the universal anti-attack mode of his focus group suggested that
``we live in an age of pleasantry'' when attacks function like an
inward-facing ``circular firing squad'' and wound the attackers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Neither of the polls was able to pinpoint states where the
convention had most helped Bush. G. Terry Madonna, a pollster at
Millersville University, said that in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing
state, said, ``I don't really know that it moved a lot of suburban
voters, and in Pennsylvania, I am absolutely convinced that the
election depends on the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBC poll gave Bush 47 percent compared with 36 percent for
Gore, 6 percent for Ralph Nader and 1 percent for Pat Buchanan.
Before the convention, it had 44 percent for Bush, 38 percent for
Gore, 6 percent for Nader and 2 percent for Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarrance Group poll, a two-day survey that was completed on
Thursday with only a few interviews after the governor's acceptance
speech, gave Bush 49 percent, Gore 31 percent, Nader 6 percent and
Buchanan 2 percent. When the convention began, the numbers were 46
percent for Bush, 38 percent for Gore, 3 percent for Nader and 2
percent for Buchanan. Ed Goeas of the Tarrance Group said that
Bush's gains were widespread among various demographic groups, and
that Gore lost strength among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the extent of the Bush gain uncertain, it is also
unclear whether it will be lasting. Andrew Kohut, a pollster and
director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press,
said, ``Is it a blip or a bounce? There are as many blips in recent
elections as there are booms.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, President Clinton got no spurt in
popularity after his convention and Bob Dole, the Republican
candidate, did gain, but it was brief.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, convention week was the best week of Dole's
campaign, but Republicans in Philadelphia were insisting this week
that they had held out no real hopes then, while this time they
expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania called the 1996 session in San
Diego ``a very respectful convention,'' where delegates loved Dole
and his running mate, Jack Kemp, because of their efforts to
campaign for Republicans over the years. But, he continued, the
delegates knew ``they had one hell of a steep climb'' to defeat
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said the best comparison to a past convention
was with the 1980 gathering in Detroit. Michael Deaver, who worked
on Ronald Reagan's staff, said the task back then was to show the
seriousness of a ``governor from the West with no foreign policy
experience, who seemed maybe a little light, read from speech
cards, maybe didn't have an independent thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's situation in 2000, Deaver said, is similar to Reagan's in
1980. Then there were ``people not wanting to vote for Carter, but
not being quite sure that Reagan was up to the job,'' he said,
adding that Reagan's effective convention speech was a beginning
for that reassurance, which was capped when Reagan debated Carter
in October.
</P>
<P>
   The one convention that no one in Philadelphia wanted to
remember was the last one in that city, where Gov. Thomas E. Dewey
of New York, favored in the polls, strengthened his ticket with a
widely hailed running mate, Gov. Earl Warren of California. Dewey
spoke confidently of unity in an acceptance speech characterized by
his biographer, Richard Norton Smith in ``Thomas E. Dewey and His
Times,'' as short, dignified and ``the speech of a man already
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 25, 1948, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin's
front-page, end-of-convention headline proclaimed, ``Dewey Leaves,
Sure He'll Win.''

 &HT;    Top-10 finishes in past 10 races make Jarrett favorite
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When Dale Jarrett won the Brickyard 400 last
year, he essentially clinched the 1999 Winston Cup championship.
With a repeat performance today, he could return to the top of the
Winston Cup points standings.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett will start fifth in today's event at Indianapolis Motor
Speedway. Ricky Rudd, Jarrett's teammate at Robert Yates Racing, is
the pole sitter and is surprisingly joined on the front row by
53-year old Darrell Waltrip.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jarrett is not starting first at Indy, he has been
mentioned by other drivers as the favorite to finish first today.
Jarrett is a two-time winner at the Brickyard, with the other
victory being in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we have the opportunity to win again, but I think
the competition has caught up (at) a lot of places, particularly
here,'' Jarrett said. ``But I think we have a very good shot at
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past three months, Jarrett has been on a torrid
streak. Beginning with the Fontana, Calif., race on April 30, he
has finished the past ten Winston Cup events in the top 10. Jarrett
had fallen all the way back to eighth in points in the spring but
has rallied with a smooth summer ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked all year about the `New Generation' Goodyear tire,
and that was the biggest factor in what we found early in the year
_ that we just weren't getting a handle on it,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked hard (to) ensure what we are learning and know
what it takes to run with this tire and be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were struggling to be a top-10 car . . . that was like a
victory for us. Now we've got ourselves in the top five battling
for victories and as long as you run there, you're going to be able
to get some wins. So we're back on track, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   After crossing the line in fourth place in the Pennsylvania 500
at Pocono two weeks ago, Jarrett moved past Dale Earnhardt Sr. in
the points standings to second place. He trails leader Bobby
Labonte by 53 points with 15 races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the championship comes down to the team that makes
the fewest mistakes,'' Jarrett said. ``You can't get overly excited
at any race track. You have to be patient and take the
opportunities when they present themselves to you.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jarrett wins today's event _ and Labonte finishes 15th or
higher _ he will become the points leader for the first time since
after the Feb. 27 race at Rockingham. Ironically, Labonte is one of
Jarrett's picks to win at the ``world's most famous track for auto
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   `` ``I hope (Labonte is) in the rearview mirror,'' Jarrett said.
I'm afraid I might be seeing him from my windshield. Bobby and his
team perform really well on flat race tracks. They do extremely
well here. I think he finished second here a couple of times. I
think it's just a matter of time before he's in victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, he and Tony (Stewart) both seem to have a lot of things
figured out on these flatter race tracks that make them both
perform extremely well. So I would look for those guys to be guys
we have to beat in order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In last season's Brickyard 400, Jarrett put on the most dominant
display in the event's seven-year existence. Todd Parrott pulled a
fast one on the rest of the field by calling for only two fresh
tires on the final pit stop, allowing Jarrett to win by the
incredible margin of 3.351 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you can ever have a perfect race, but (last
year) was as close as it could come because we did everything we
needed to do,'' said Jarrett, who will use the same car today.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has a habit at peaking with driving skills at the
biggest races. His only other win was at the season-opening Daytona
500 last February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy the challenge knowing that everybody is here and at
Daytona with their very best equipment,'' Jarrett said.

AS WEST NILE VIRUS SPREADS, A 78-YEAR-OLD MAN IS REPORTED
STRICKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A 78-year-old Staten Island man has the unlucky
distinction of having the nation's first known case of West Nile
encephalitis this year, health officials said Friday. They also
said that birds found dead from the disease from the Atlantic
almost to Lake Erie led the state health commissioner to declare
the first statewide outbreak of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Staten Island patient, whose name was not released, is at
home recovering, after a weeklong hospital stay for treatment, said
Dr. Neal Cohen, the city health commissioner. Cohen said the man
first complained of symptoms on July 20, which means that, taking
into account the five to 15-day incubation period, he was infected
before New York City began spraying pesticides to kill the
mosquitoes that carry the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that we've had this year of a human
case, either in New York City or anywhere else,'' said Dr. Steven
M. Ostroff, the West Nile coordinator for the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, who joined Cohen at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, the state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia
Novello, announced that in the last two days, tests had confirmed
the presence of the virus in dead birds found in nine upstate
counties where it had never been seen before, a region stretching
from the Hudson Valley to the Adirondack Mountains to a suburb of
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Infected birds had already been found in New York City and all
of the downstate suburban counties, and one in central New York
state. She said the findings made it safe to assume that virtually
every part of the state is affected, even where no infected birds
have been found.
</P>
<P>
   This year's outbreak far exceeds the reach of last year's. The
virus has been found as far north and east as Boston, in northern
New Jersey and in western Connecticut. Last year, the outbreak was
limited to New York City and its nearest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 123 infected birds have been found in New
York, almost matching last year's total of 130, with nearly three
months left in the mosquito season.
</P>
<P>
   News of the virus' spread comes at the height of the outdoor
season, when people camp in the woods, tramp through marshes and
spend balmy evenings in their rain-dampened yards, exposing
themselves to mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that New Yorkers, whatever county, and whether
there are positive birds or not, must be taking common-sense
protections,'' Novello said, ``such as wearing long-sleeve shirts,
socks, shoes and, if necessary, try to apply an insect repellant
that contains DEET,'' an insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the disease appeared for the first time in the
Western Hemisphere, 62 people in the metropolitan area were
confirmed to have been sickened by the virus, and seven of them
died. Hundreds of Queens residents tested positive for the virus
but had no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Because the virus survived over the winter _ in mosquitoes
living in storm drains, perhaps, or damp basements _ and has gone
much farther afield this summer, health officials fear that it may
have become a long-term, even permanent, part of the American
landscape of disease.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials stressed that they were calling for vigilance,
not alarm, noting that only a tiny minority of the people infected
become ill enough to require medical care, and most of those who
are treated recover. Indeed, people who are infected may never know
it, because they show no noticeable ill effects, or mild symptoms
that can be mistaken for a flu. The greatest risk is to the
elderly, to very young children and to people whose immune systems
are already suppressed, who can develop high fevers and
encephalitis, a potentially fatal brain inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   Novello pleaded with New Yorkers to take precautions against the
disease, to wear protective clothing when going outside, and, in
particular, to drain the stagnant water where mosquitoes breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dispose of any tin can, plastic container, ceramic pots or
anything similar that holds water on the outside of your house,''
she said at a news conference here. ``Remove old, discarded
property. This is the place most liked by mosquitoes for breeding.
Clean any clogged rain gutters and any wading pool that is not in
use, and turn every wheelbarrow that is in your neighborhood.
Change the water in birdbaths at least twice a week.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the state will broadcast ads carrying that message on
television and radio, and have them shown in movie theaters, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's office said Friday that the governor would
apply to the Clinton administration for disaster relief, to obtain
federal aid to cover the cost of the state's intensive West Nile
monitoring program. A similar request by Pataki for last year's
expenses was denied in January, and state officials complained
Friday that of almost $8 million in federal aid to states for
combating the West Nile outbreak, New York State, where most of the
cases have been located, has received just $355,000.
</P>
<P>
   Novello said the state spent $14 million on the disease last
year, and is likely to exceed that this year.
</P>
<P>
   The virus turned up recently in dead birds near Syracuse. In the
last two days, tests confirmed infections in dead birds in Erie
County; in Washington and Warren counties in the southern
Adirondacks; in Schenectady County; and in Albany, Rensselaer,
Columbia, Putnam and Dutchess counties in the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   It is mosquitoes that carry the virus and infect animals with
it. Birds, especially crows, are particularly susceptible to West
Nile, so sudden die-offs of birds are an important harbinger of the
disease. Birds also appear to play the leading role in transporting
the virus from one region to another.
</P>
<P>
   The state has left it up to counties to decide whether to spray
pesticides, a decision that has proved highly contentious in and
around New York City. Last month, the outbreak struck at the
symbolic heart of the city, with the discovery of infected
mosquitos in Central Park, and the city shut down the park
overnight in order to spray there. Spraying was scheduled in the
park again early Friday morning, as well as in northern Manhattan,
parts of the Bronx and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   While Novello stressed that it is a local decision, she made her
support for spraying plain, saying that the state would grant
permission for it to any county that requests it. ``Good prevention
and good common sense is better than looking back and saying, `I
should have sprayed,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Novello also noted that people should take precautions
throughout the day, not just after dark. Last year, the virus was
found in just one species of mosquito, culex pipiens, which bites
mostly at dusk and during the night. This year, she said, it has
also been detected in another species, aedes japonicus, which bites
during the day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The virus appears to have entered the United States last summer
through New York City, possibly in a mosquito aboard a ship or
airplane, and spread from there. It moved farther afield this year
for two reasons, health officials say.
</P>
<P>
   First, last year's outbreak began in August, with the
mosquito-breeding season half over, while this year it will have
the entire span from May to October to spread. Second, this year's
heavy rains in the Northeast have promoted more mosquito breeding
than usual, although they may have flushed out standing water and
had the opposite effect in some places.

SPARSE DATA ON NORTH KOREAN ARMS LED TO DISPUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Behind the growing debate over whether to build a
new national missile defense against countries like North Korea
lies an old and bitter dispute over how to interpret the
frustratingly limited intelligence on of one of the world's most
secretive nations.
</P>
<P>
   Witness this incident, not previously disclosed: Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright had just completed an upbeat, top-secret
briefing for the House leadership in July 1998 on the Clinton
administration's dealings with North Korea when one lawmaker posed
the question he had been waiting to ask.
</P>
<P>
   What was Albright's assessment of a recent intelligence report
suggesting that North Korea had built a storage installation that
housed components for nuclear warheads? How long had she known
about the report?
</P>
<P>
   Albright, according to several people who were present, replied
that she had learned of the evidence just two weeks earlier. In a
startling departure from the united front that top administration
officials usually present to Congress, Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes,
director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, immediately
contradicted the secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madam secretary, I have to correct the record,'' said Hughes,
whose agency had produced the report, according to others who were
there. ``You were briefed on that intelligence a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That tart exchange offered an unusual glimpse of the depth of
the disagreements between the United States' senior diplomats and
the Pentagon's top intelligence officials over how to interpret the
few hard facts available about North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the dispute spurred them to demand an independent
review of the evidence on North Korea, which the administration
eventually acceded to with the appointment of former Defense
Secretary William Perry as special adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate stems from arcane arguments over photos or
snippets of intelligence from agents. State Department officials
say the Pentagon intelligence agency, well known for its hawkish
outlook, has been painting far too dark a picture, surmising on
sketchy evidence that North Korea has up to 10 new installations
working on a covert nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department officials said their skepticism about the
quality of the Defense Intelligence Agency's work was deepened by a
1999 incident in which U.S. diplomats leaned heavily on the North
Koreans to allow inspections of a site that the intelligence agency
had said was part of the nuclear program. Nothing was found.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, intelligence analysts at DIA are said to believe
the State Department has been far too willing to overlook reports
of suspicious activity. In their view, the failure of a single
inspection does not mean the United States should stop pressing the
North Koreans about suspect facilities, including the intelligence
report about the storage building suspected of housing warhead
components.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis over North Korea's nuclear program began in 1993,
when analysts reviewing evidence captured by U.S. spy satellites
concluded that a North Korean nuclear reprocessing facility at
Yongbyon had gone ``hot'' _ had begun to process plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence analysts then watched as the North Koreans
dumped radioactive nuclear fuel out of the heavy-water reactor into
a cooling pool in order to replace it with fresh fuel rods. The
spent fuel rods contained enough plutonium for 10 nuclear warheads,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The activity at Yongbyon led to a diplomatic showdown, and after
months of talks the Clinton administration won a North Korean
pledge to freeze plutonium production at the site.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the United States, South Korea and Japan agreed to
give the North oil and technical assistance to build a peaceful
nuclear-power program. The agreement called for international
monitoring of the Yongbyon site, and Energy Department experts were
allowed to encase the spent fuel rods at the facility to ensure
that they could not be used for warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Before the production freeze, North Korea was able to produce
about 26 pounds of weapons-grade plutonium, U.S. intelligence
analysts agree. A consensus developed that North Korea could
produce one or two bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Political problems first surfaced when administration officials
began to declare that North Korea had agreed to freeze its entire
nuclear program. Eventually, however, the lawmakers realized that
the agreement covered only Yongbyon and did not preclude nuclear
activity at other sites. Suspicions immediately arose that the
North Koreans were in fact covertly continuing work on their
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   After the administration negotiated the freeze on activity at
Yongbyon, the Defense Intelligence Agency began to report that it
had detected a series of other secret sites, many of them
underground, that analysts suspected were related to an ongoing
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1990s, DIA, working closely with the National
Imagery and Mapping Agency, which processes and analyzes
spy-satellite photographs, compiled a list of at least 10 such
sites.
</P>
<P>
   None, however was a ``smoking gun.'' One official termed them
``enigmas'': They raised suspicions, yet the United States did not
have enough evidence to prove their ties to a nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   DIA analysts were most concerned about one facility that they
suspected of being a storage building for components of nuclear
warheads. The identity and exact location of the suspected storage
center, whose existence has not been previously made public, could
not be learned.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former officials say the intelligence on the storage
facility was obtained at least three years ago, and was based not
only on spy satellite photographs and intercepted communications,
but on ``human intelligence'' _ spies _ reporting to the DIA.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also detected another facility, at Kumchangri, that
was believed to house an underground nuclear reactor and plutonium
reprocessing operation. The existence of that underground facility
was publicly disclosed in The New York Times in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, the United States pressed North Korea to allow an
inspection of the Kumchangri facility. Before that visit, the DIA
provided senior officials with extensive briefings on Kumchangri,
complete with models of what DIA analysts believed the installation
contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kumchangri had all the signatures you would look for if they
were putting a reactor underground,'' said one former U.S.
intelligence official. ``It had vast water supplies, and the belief
was that the reactor would be water-cooled.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the U.S. team arrived, they found nothing but a series
of narrow, empty tunnels, with no large underground chamber capable
of holding a nuclear reactor. The inspection was a bust, and an
``embarrassment'' to the United States, said an official familiar
with the inspection.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sent another inspection team to Kumchangri in
May of this year, but again they found nothing to indicate that it
was involved in a nuclear-weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a joke,'' said one State Department official.
``The North Koreans really must have thought we were idiots.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some officials say that the United States gave North Korea far
too much advance warning of its interest in visiting the Kumchangri
site before inspecting the facility, making it possible for the
North Koreans to hide its purpose. They add that the Kumchangri
facility was still under construction when it was first detected by
U.S. intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best guess is that it was something bad on the nuclear
side, but no one knows,'' said an official familiar with the
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspections of Kumchangri seriously damaged DIA's
credibility with administration officials and analysts at the other
agencies, particularly the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism deepened after U.S. officials discovered that
another installation that had fallen under DIA suspicion turned out
to be an underground storage site for the memorabilia of the North
Korean leadership.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the administration has become extremely reluctant
to pursue leads on other suspected facilities identified by the
DIA. The administration has never asked to inspect the secret
facility believed to be a warhead storage site, several U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a prime example of policy being driven by
intelligence, and at the end of the day it was wrong,'' said one
State Department official critical of the DIA's handling of the
Kumchangri case.
</P>
<P>
   After the failed inspections at Kumchangri, U.S. intelligence
officials debated whether to conduct a thorough review of the
available intelligence on the North Korean nuclear program and
produce what is known as a National Intelligence Estimate,
representing a government-wide consensus on the problem. But there
were so many inter-agency disagreements that no such estimate was
commissioned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the DIA, meanwhile, the agency's inability to provide more
conclusive evidence has prompted it to take a more cautious tone in
its assessments, officials said. Adm. Thomas Wilson, Hughes'
successor, has not been as aggressive in pushing the issue,
officials say. ``DIA was driving this process,'' noted one
intelligence official. ``But there has been a change of leadership
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes retired in July 1999, a year after his showdown with
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that Hughes
eventually apologized to Albright, who still maintains that she had
learned of the secret facility just two weeks before the hearing.
But Hughes said in an interview that while he did apologize to
Albright for ``causing her public embarrassment,'' he did not
apologize for correcting the record, because her testimony was not
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad that I caused the secretary of state some
embarrassment,'' Hughes said. ``But on the other hand, I felt fine
about raising the issue, and still do today. I would have hated
going away from there with Congress thinking we hadn't properly
informed officials about the intelligence.''

COLUMN: ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY SPEAKS AT GRAHAM EVANGELICAL
GATHERING 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ When the Billy Graham Evangelistic
Association planned a conference here this week for evangelists
from around the world, it signed up a raft of prominent speakers,
many of them very well known among evangelical Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone who took the podium came from the sort of
religious background that Graham represents: the itinerant
evangelist of Baptist background. In fact, one of the more
interesting and nuanced speeches came from the leader of a
hierarchical and liturgical church _ the archbishop of Canterbury,
George Carey, spiritual leader of the Church of England and first
among equals among bishops of Anglican churches worldwide, a group
that includes the Episcopal Church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Carey came to talk about effective Christian preaching in a
``broken'' and sinful world. And he began by praising some words of
the French existentialist Albert Camus _ not the sort of figure one
would expect to hear quoted at an evangelists' conference. Yet, the
archbishop said, Camus, in his book ``The Fall,'' which is set in
Amsterdam, had given a moving appraisal of human sinfulness. He
called the book a great one.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop urged that churches preach a ``committed faith in
Christ'' as the singular savior, an argument for the uniqueness of
Christianity's claims in a world increasingly conscious of
religious pluralism. But he also said _ in fact, said twice _ that
he held no brief for fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christ whom we follow is one who allows people to think,
argue, dispute and doubt,'' Carey said. ``Authentic Christian faith
is not afraid of scholarship or the critical study of the
Scriptures.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called on evangelicals to embrace an ecumenical spirit
in the name of presenting a common faith, and to be involved in
society to combat social evils. In supporting ecumenism, he was
endorsing both the example set by Graham, who has long tried to
bring together as many different churches as he can at his
preaching events, and also the various Anglican churches, which
have lately entered into formal alliances with other denominations,
as Episcopalians have with Evangelical Lutherans in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Carey's speech to the conference, which concludes on Sunday, was
reported and favorably commented upon in the British press. But
much of the focus was on a limited part of it, in particular, his
criticism of human attempts to replace religious faith with total
reliance on therapy, education or the pursuit of wealth. He had
good things to say about therapy and education, but indicated that
he worried that too many sermons had adopted a therapeutic message
and missed ``an appeal to a holy God and his call to us to turn to
him in repentance and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   What some reports on his speech overlooked, too, was the note of
optimism he struck, unlike those who would preach doom and gloom.
The archbishop called the world a good place, even wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   ``No true Christian ever despises the world,'' he said. ``We
love it, we exalt it, we cherish it. And we love humanity made in
God's image. Fallen, yes _ but always loved by Almighty God and
therefore loved by us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the conference began, its organizers predicted it would
be attended by 10,000 evangelists from 190 nations and territories.
The estimates turned out to be accurate. After the event began,
Graham's association reported that 10,287 people, representing 209
nations and territories, had registered for it.
</P>
<P>
   Half those attending came from either North America or Africa.
After the United States, with 2,767 people, the largest delegations
came from India (495 people), Ghana (249), Kenya (204) and South
Africa (182).
</P>
<P>
   Many brought pamphlets with them, to spread the word about their
particular efforts. Thus, one information table carried stacks of
fliers describing groups probably little known outside their
immediate regions: India Youth for Christ, the Evangelical Alliance
of Sri Lanka, Christ Total Gospel Ministries International of
Nigeria, and many, many others.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's eldest son and designated
successor as head of the Graham organization, was also among the
conference's speakers, taking the podium Thursday after flying from
Philadelphia, where he had offered a prayer at the Republican
National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   His stated theme was evangelism and compassion, but he seemed
more inclined to offer his audience a lesson about preaching to win
converts. Make sure, he told the crowd, that people know in advance
that you are going to make an altar call, so the unconverted know
they will have the opportunity to come down to the front of the
event and declare a born-again faith in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Like Carey, Graham spoke about sin, but from the perspective of
one who wants to tell people just what it is. ``People today,
especially in Western society, don't even know what sin is,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To clear up the ignorance, he said, he often goes to the 10
Commandments. ``Telling a lie is a sin, sex outside of marriage is
a sin,'' Graham said. ``But I'm very careful to say God loves
you.''

   ATLANTA _ Tamara Allen wanted to like what she saw. She was in
the market for a president. She voted for Bill Clinton in two
elections, and for Ronald Reagan before that. But she reacted to
the Republican National Convention with disappointment and venom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astounded at the falsity, the facade of it all,'' said
Allen, an executive assistant for Hands On Atlanta, a nonprofit
service organization.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from her home in Grant Park, a predominantly black,
gentrifying neighborhood of Atlanta, Allen, who is black, was
heartened at first by the number of women and those belonging to
minorities on stage in Philadelphia. But then, she said, she went
``from being disappointed to being angry.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Republican Party hoped that assembling a festival of
diversity on the convention podium would convince voters that its
party had a grand new diverse face, conversations with voters in
four places in America this week indicated that it was not entirely
succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   Voters interviewed here and in New York, Milwaukee and Los
Angeles had a wide array of reactions to the convention. Some found
things to approve of, like the gathering's patriotic fervor or what
they saw as Gov. George W. Bush's ``presidential stature.''
</P>
<P>
   But the one theme that ran consistently through many of their
observations was that they did not necessarily accept at face value
the rainbow image the Republicans were projecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this mega-infomercial, but not nearly as
entertaining,'' Allen said. ``Give me Ginzu knives.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, over four days of intermittent convention viewing in their
homes, three women undecided about their votes were less than sold
on Bush and were waiting to see whether the Democrats in Los
Angeles would be more captivating.
</P>
<P>
   Another of the women, Latara Jackson, 19, who will vote for
president this year for the first time, was at the end leaning,
however slightly, in the Democrats' direction. An intern with the
U.S. Department of Labor, she is a student who describes herself as
having conservative views. But after watching the convention's
opening night, she found herself leaning away from the Republican
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a last attempt to basically come out as just
very tolerant,'' Jackson said. ``It was like they were trying too
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, an admirer of retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, was
disappointed by his speech, which she found insincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a last-ditch effort, and I was kind of
disappointed that he would be a part of that,'' said Jackson, who,
like Powell, is black.
</P>
<P>
   She did not appreciate what she described as Bush`s rude remarks
about Vice President Al Gore's personality and character: ``He kind
of made personal jabs at him. I think he did that to kind of get
away from the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's vow to prohibit the kind of late-term procedure that
opponents call partial-birth abortion left Jackson feeling his
stance had been watered down. ``In reality, we know he thinks all
abortion is wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole convention dealt with no issues at all,''
she said. ``Any attempt to deal with any issues was very weak, just
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   While she believed Bush appeared presidential, if she had to
vote tomorrow, Jackson would select Gore for what she saw as his
sincerity and his drive to try to do what he thinks is best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would define myself more as a Republican than a Democrat,''
she said. ``But I just couldn't vote for this Republican,'' mostly
because of the remarks he made against his opponent, but also
because of the Philadelphia celebration's efforts to include
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really late, like at the last minute,'' she said. ``It
was a really bad attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jane Kruzan, 72, a retired director of a volunteer
placement agency, said she was beginning to think she could forget
about some of the issues she felt strongly about, in order to vote
Republican, as she often does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment, gun control and campaign finance are
certainly not being answered in these three days, but I'm impressed
with the types of people promoting Governor Bush,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to the debates,'' said Kruzan, who
is white and lives in Decatur, an Atlanta suburb. ``I'm not ready
for the ballot box. I would not feel comfortable going tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt the same after hearing Bush's acceptance speech, which
she found comprehensive and impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he certainly articulated his views very well,'' she
said, ``but I will have to admit that the truth is in the
details.''
</P>
<P>
   She was glad he mentioned the environment, though it was too low
on his priority list for her, and she was not impressed by his plan
to enforce existing gun-control laws rather than push for stronger
ones.
</P>
<P>
   In all, she said, her opinion of the candidate rose during the
convention, particularly after she saw people who might serve in
his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, Allen sat back from the television and
played with her hair pensively. ``Today I'm just sad about my
choices,'' she said. ``I'm concerned now. Yesterday I was still
kind of waffling, but today I'm really sad. I don't know who I'm
going to vote for, and I love voting.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when Bush vowed to support a ban on the abortion
procedure, Allen, who is in her mid-30s, said he lost her vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you go,'' she said. ``OK, so, it's over for me. He just
told me I don't control me. He just told me that I don't count.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll wait and I'll see what Gore has to say,'' Allen
said Thursday. ``He better be honest. I mean just real stuff, not
all of this kind of `rockets' red glare,' lyrics from the anthem,
fields of waving grass and grain.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the convention had pushed her away from voting for
Ralph Nader, whom she admires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have voted for Nader before I saw this, but seeing
Cheney made me so afraid,'' she said. ``He doesn't represent half
the people or a quarter, he represents the upper echelon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I came out of this with anything, it's that I want a
debate. Bad. I can taste it I want it so bad,'' she said.
</P>

   &UR; Milwaukee &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Republican National Convention from his living
room, James Greer, a 54-year-old lawyer and an independent, found
himself awash in pleasantness.
</P>
<P>
   It was Laura Bush, the wife of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who
set the tone. ``She has a softer way,'' Greer said. ``She's really
a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Like movie critics, or perhaps Olympic judges, Greer and six
other Milwaukee residents watched the Republican convention this
week, giving marks for style and substance, ready to catch any
stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all of them _ a die-hard Republican, a devoted
Democrat and varying shades of independents _ agreed that while the
convention was lacking in suspense, it was also free of missteps.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, one resident, Brian Colon, 27, a computer
programmer, found comfort in retired Gen. Colin L. Powell's message
that many Americans deserved help.
</P>
<P>
   Another resident, Chiquita Lee, a 63-year-old homemaker and a
Republican, who is black, found it pleasing to watch Republicans
``of different colors _ this convention was really reaching out.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris Wright, a 36-year-old computer systems analyst, also
expressed approval that Republicans ``realize that demographics are
changing, and that they need to widen the umbrella.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Kathleen Wyman, a 59-year-old real estate
agent, found the Republican efforts at racial diversity a bit
forced. ``Are these people really representative of the new
Republicans?'' Wyman said, muffling a chuckle. ``Of course they're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Carolyn Castore, 47, the feel-good tenor of the opening
night was lacking in substance. ``It's like baby food,'' Castore
said, ``no flavor, no texture and designed to be easily
swallowed.''
</P>
<P>
   On the convention's second night, Greer offered praise as he
listened to speeches by Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Condoleezza
Rice, Bush's chief international affairs adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Republicans do well is patriotism,'' he said. ``They
have a knack for waving the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon, so impressed by McCain, exclaimed: ``I wish I had this on
tape!''
</P>
<P>
   But others were not convinced that McCain was speaking from his
heart. ``McCain gives a very good speech,'' Wyman said, ``but I
would bet that in his heart of hearts, he doesn't believe what he
says about Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was taken with Lynne Cheney, the wife of Dick Cheney, the
vice-presidential candidate. ``She showed her devotion and love for
her husband,'' she said, ``while still showing that she was her own
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wright, it was the videotape of past presidents, especially
Ronald Reagan, that rang bells. ``It was really very moving,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, when Cheney introduced himself to voters,
the reviews from the Milwaukee residents were mostly favorable but
hardly inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Lee found Cheney's speech to be a bit heavy on cliches. ``I
think he has to grow on you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon said, ``It was just a speech, not so good, not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wyman found Cheney's talk to be ``rational and to the
point.'' ``I can see this ticket being very attractive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Castore said Cheney's role was to shore up the conservative
base. ``Until he spoke, the messages had been so progressive, that
I was starting to feel sorry for the Republicans,'' she said. ``But
Cheney, with the whole morality issue, seemed to be bringing back
the base.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee residents paid most attention, not surprisingly,
to the speech by Bush on Thursday night. Most of them considered
the speech a success.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``looked presidential,'' Wyman said, and he ``comes across
better than his father ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   In some places, she said, it was almost Reaganesque, ``the way
he talked about real people and made things very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer noted that Bush ``didn't have his smirk,'' and said the
candidate scored points by presenting himself ``as a human,''
especially when making references to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lee remarked on Bush's ``charisma, the friend-next-door
appeal,'' and applauded his plans on education.
</P>
<P>
   For Castore, the praise was grudging. ``As a speech it was OK,
but I thought his attacks on Gore fell flat,'' she said, referring
to Vice President Al Gore. ``A lot of what he said, it sounded
good. But I don't know what it means. It lacked so many
specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Colon, who had started the week not certain whether he
would vote for Bush or not, the speech was a clincher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just loved it,'' Colon said. ``I'm ready to march right out
and vote for him.''

</P>
<P>
   Maurice Vanegas is precisely the kind of person George W. Bush
has been straining to speak to this past week. He is a Latino and a
small-business owner, he hews to the political center, and he is
undecided about his vote this November. But after watching the
Republican convention, Vanegas is also a skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mr. Bush is very noble and he wants to do the right
thing,'' said Vanegas, who is 31 and operates transportation and
real estate businesses. ``But as far as making me want to vote for
him, I'm still not there. As a Latino immigrant, being a bigger
superpower isn't something that appeals to me, and I don't mind
paying taxes or worry about a big tax cut. We just want opportunity
and a country with a big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   When Condoleezza Rice, a foreign policy expert, spoke on Tuesday
night, Vanegas said, he found her engaging but peripheral. ``How
much stronger do we need to be as a superpower?'' he asked. ``As a
Latino and an immigrant, that isn't something that appeals to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dick Cheney was introduced by his wife, Lynne, who
mentioned his interest in fly fishing, Vanegas was turned off.
``How many of us even thought about going fly fishing?'' he asked.
``I don't think many of us have the luxury of thinking about that.
I'm interested in work.''
</P>
<P>
   Another immigrant, Mario Matute, 40, who is voting in his first
presidential election, said he was impressed that Bush spoke some
Spanish and was at least interested in wooing Latinos. Matute
emigrated from El Salvador and runs a job development program.
</P>
<P>
   But after the convention appearances of two black speakers,
retired Gen. Colin Powell on Tuesday and Rice on Wednesday, Matute
said, he paid more attention to the color of the faces of the
delegates. ``Powell sounded mainly on the side of the Democrats by
addressing education and the racism that still exists in the
country,'' Matute said. ``They scored high with that. I think he
spoke from the heart, but if you looked at the faces there, it
didn't match. That was a disappointment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the convention, which he described as generally
impressive, he said: ``I want to believe that they are a new party
and more inclusive, but it didn't look real to me, especially when
it came to policies. I wanted to hear more about immigration policy
and jobs, not tax cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   With its white majority long gone, a soaring immigrant
population and a heavy reliance on small businesses, Los Angeles is
the kind of nascent metropolis of the future that both parties need
to capture to win the White House. Conversations with a handful of
residents found that most of them, even ardent Democrats, had been
impressed by Bush's sense of optimism. But there were also
questions about how new the party could be with its conservative
core intact _ a core that is still perceived by many people here to
be less sympathetic than the Democrats to immigrants and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Inouye, a mortgage banker, said that she had been turned off
by what she perceived to be a lack of moral rectitude in the
Clinton White House and that she had found much to like in the
Republican platform, even though she supports abortion rights. But
in response to Cheney's sometimes harsh speech, she said that some
of the attacks had been inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics shouldn't be so polarized,'' she said. ``Bush was
confident and optimistic, not negative. That may be his edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention itself was a spectacle that left many cold. Some
people who work in Hollywood, of course, saw it as a cynical act of
manipulation, and they had their own suggestions for appealing to a
broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should lock everybody in the convention hall like
`Survivor,''' said Robin Schiff, a television producer and
screenwriter. ``The last person alive is the candidate. It's
Republican `Survivor.' Now that's a convention I would watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim O'Doherty, a television producer, is that rarity in
Hollywood, an avowed Republican. His views evolved throughout the
week. Early on, he expressed concerns about his party's chances. He
said he had been very impressed by Sen. John McCain's speech, but
that it had only emphasized what he perceived as a lack of talent
elsewhere in the party. ``I'm very frustrated because we have some
real problems with our image,'' he said. ``There's a charisma
problem. We don't have the most exciting A-list talent pool.''
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, however, O'Doherty expressed enthusiasm for the
convention as a successful show. He said he felt that Cheney's
speech had energized the convention for the first time. He
applauded Bush as a leader with good ideas in his speech, and he
said the party had focused on the positive with a high moral tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did exactly what his mission was,'' O'Doherty said of
Bush's speech on Thursday night. ``He had to convince the swing
voters to come over, and that's what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Doherty's writing partner, David Israel, is a Democrat, but he
found some common ground. ``I think the biggest thing he had to do
was to not appear smug, and he did that,'' Israel said. ``I think
he's a likable guy, and he didn't say anything you could disagree
with. But I still don't know what he's really going to do.''

   &UR; New York &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Political science students at New York University recognize
obscure de Toqueville quotations and argue the merits of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty vs. the Strategic Defense Initiative.
So when the Republican Convention rolled around they were an astute
audience, eager to analyze what George W. Bush set out to
accomplish and how well he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The students _ four from the undergraduate honors program and
three doctoral candidates _ differed on whether the convention was
``brilliant marketing,'' in the words of one, or ``insulting
propaganda,'' in the words of another. But all agreed it was a
textbook example of ``median voter theory'' and ``triangulation,''
insider jargon for capturing swing voters by show-casing the
popular issues of the opposition and burying the unpopular issues
of its own fringe, as Bill Clinton's Democrats did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the theme of inclusion is a blatant plea to
nontraditional Republican voters,'' said Ramsey J. Green, 20, as he
watched a rainbow coalition of speakers cross the podium in
Philadelphia. ``It seems as though they have finally realized that
their reputation as white, wealthy and Christian will not appeal to
socially liberal suburban voters and therefore prevent them from
enjoying the policies of a Republican president.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who will vote in his first presidential election, most
likely for Al Gore, veered between calling the tactic a ``sick
Republican scheme'' and saying that the convention had ``gone
extremely well'' for the party. Green argued with himself about
whether the Republicans were ``trying to pull the wool over my
eyes'' or ``making a serious attempt to change the party's
traditional ethnic and financial makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted, as Gov. Bush completed his acceptance speech to a
hail of confetti, that the candidate had probably ``cajoled'' many
non-Republicans to vote for him in November. But he said they would
probably ``be let down come the implementation of the real policies
of a Bush administration,'' which would revert to form. But Green
said that the tone of the convention was a healthy development for
the party and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side of the political aisle, Costas Panagopolous,
a doctoral student who ran unsuccessfully for the Massachusetts
Legislature while a Harvard undergraduate, also saw the Republican
show of inclusion as a plus.
</P>
<P>
   Panagopolous, 28, who ran as a Republican but has since
re-registered as an Independent, said that ``I do think it's a
strategy _ for now. But if they win the election, they'll know it
works and this will have been a first step. It has to start
somewhere. And there comes a point where perception becomes
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Panagopolous, with his experience as a candidate and a resume
filled with jobs in marketing, seemed to unnerve other students
with his unabashed admiration for the ``rebranding'' by the
Republican party. ``It's no different than repositioning Hush Puppy
shoes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sona Nadenicheck, a doctoral candidate devoted to academic
research, not the hurly-burly of politics, gasped: ``But that's not
who they really are!''
</P>
<P>
   Nadenicheck's husband and fellow student, Matt Golder, jumped
in. ``The goal is to get elected,'' he said, soothingly, comparing
the Republicans to the Labor Party in his British homeland. ``It
took the Labor Party 10 years to change their image,'' Golder said,
declaring by the end of the convention that the Republicans had
surely ``been effective at winning over some undecided voters.''
</P>
<P>
   The students were not equally engaged by the four-day
proceedings. Alissa Elliott, a 20-year-old with a bent for
international relations, watched hours of C-Span each night, as she
cooked dinner, ironed and answered e-mail and took detailed
exception to the foreign policy positions of several speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Panagopolous, also a nightly devotee, dissected the
ramifications of Bush's proposed tax cuts and lamented the
candidate's silence on international trade and domestic economic
indicators. Green seemed to have seen virtually every speaker,
Republican National Committee video and mariachi or Motown band.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Martin Wolf, 19, skipped the first night because a
broken fish tank had shorted out his television set, and he
considered Bush's speech, which he grudgingly watched, a ``waste of
my time.'' Nadenichek, 28, said she would have ignored the Bush
speech and worked on a conference paper were it not for her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt had the TV on and we have a small one-bedroom
apartment,'' Nadenichek said. She was scornful of the Republican
performance throughout, but said it was more interesting than it
might have been because Golder brought a fresh eye to this American
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   All of the students noted, admiringly, the Republicans finesse
at highlighting the improprieties, sexual and otherwise, of the
Clinton White House and tarnishing Gore in the process. They also
thought it deft to call attention to the nation's prosperity, the
Democrat's crowning achievement in the past eight years, while
characterizing it as an opportunity wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush tried to point out what is morally wrong with the
executive administration today while pointing out what is right
with the economy,'' Green said. ``Theoretically, I guess this means
all Bush has to do is win the election, move into the White House,
do no harm to the economy and remain faithful to his wife. Sounds
like a pretty easy job.''

BLACKLISTED SCREENWRITERS GET CREDITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The Writers Guild has announced that the writing
credits on 14 films released from 1951 to 1964 will be corrected to
include the names of several screenwriters blacklisted by Hollywood
studios. The current credits on the films either omitted a
blacklisted writer's name or used a pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Writers Guild of America, West, has
corrected the writing credits on 95 such films.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of writers as well as actors, directors, agents and
producers found themselves blacklisted in the 1950s following
efforts by the House Committee on Un-American Activities to find
suspected Communists in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those on the blacklist refused to name names, declined
to discuss their political beliefs, were singled out by informers
or were simply liberals who were friendly with Communists. Many of
the blacklisted writers started using ``fronts'' or pseudonyms,
while others fled to Europe to find work. Careers were damaged, if
not shattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hollywood blacklist destroyed the careers and lives of
numerous Americans _ not only artists but also those in government,
in academia and the unions,'' the Writers Guild said on Thursday.
The Guild said that ``because of the unchecked zealousness of HUAC,
the list also managed to include non-Communist liberals and even
victims of mistaken identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the films whose credits will be revised are ``He Ran All
the Way,'' a 1951 drama. The corrected credit reads Dalton Trumbo
and Hugh Butler, both blacklisted writers.
</P>
<P>
   Other blacklisted writers whose names have been added to films
included Carl Foreman (``Born for Trouble,'' 1955), Ben Barzman
(``Stranger on the Prowl,'' 1952, and ``It Happened in Paris,''
1953), Cyril Endfield (``The Master Plan,'' 1954), Bernard Gordon
(``Circus World,'' 1964) and Paul Jarrico (``The Man Who Watched
Trains Go By,'' 1952).
</P>
<P>
   Trumbo, a well-known screenwriter in the 1950s, whose films
included ``Exodus'' and ``Spartacus,'' was given new credits on a
handful of others, the Writers Guild said.
</P>
<P>
   These included ``The Green-Eyed Blonde,'' 1958; ``Terror in a
Texas Town,'' 1958; ``The Brave One,'' 1956, in which Trumbo shared
credit with Harry S. Franklin and Merrill G. White; ``The Boss,''
1956; ``Cowboy,'' 1958, sharing credit with Edmond H. North, and
``The Prowler,'' 1951. That film, also known as ``The High Cost of
Living,'' is also credited to Hugo Butler.

   CHICAGO _ After suffering days of Republican barbs in silence,
Vice President Al Gore returned from vacation Friday swinging back
hard, accusing the Republicans of running a showy, but
insubstantial convention and strongly claiming credit for having
helped create the nation's roaring economy.

   Gore had spent the week with his family on a North Carolina
beach while the newly minted Republican ticket of Gov. George W.
Bush, the presidential nominee, and his running mate, Dick Cheney,
used center stage in Philadelphia to portray the Clinton
administration as timid, ineffectual and lacking vision.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republican nominees zoomed out of the convention city in
a day filled by campaign trips by plane, train and car to stops in
Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio, as Bush continued his own
synthesis of conservative policies described in words likely to
appeal to swing voters. But he also showed a lift of his own after
the convention. Bush told a crowd of hundreds along downtown train
tracks in Pittsburgh, ``I can't tell you how energized I am.'' In
Chicago, Gore answered the Republican criticisms Friday by slinging
arrows of his own, without mentioning Bush or Cheney by name while
accusing the Republicans of trying to paper over empty promises and
harsh policies with a feel-good, slickly choreographed convention
that offered little more than ``confetti and klieg lights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to political pageantry, I've got to hand it to
the other side,'' Gore told a cheering throng of more than 3,000
representatives of the International Association of Fire Fighters.
``But you and I both know that a slogan never put out a raging
fire. A sound bite never saved a child from a burning building. And
political positioning will never heal sick children who don't have
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the role he seems most comfortable with, the
counterpuncher, Gore seemed to relish reusing a line of his own
from the 1992 campaign that Cheney had appropriated in
Philadelphia: ``It's time for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two nights ago at the convention, we heard their view of what
time it is,'' Gore told the firefighters. ``That was a familiar
line wasn't it? I remember that one. Well let me tell you what time
it's not. It's not time to give in to the big drug companies. It is
not time to give in to big insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And our opponents may not like to hear it, but it is not
recession time in America like it was back in 1992,'' he continued
to loud cheers. ``It's not deficit time in America like it was in
1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore entered the Chicago hotel Friday morning looking like a
gladiator on an adrenaline high, pumping his fists as he led a
march of chanting firefighters dressed in yellow T-shirts
emblazoned with the words, ``Fire Fighters for Gore.'' Inside the
ballroom, he spent nearly 10 minutes wending his way through the
crowded aisle toward the stage, slapping high-fives, grabbing every
outstretched hand and cradling an infant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we're starting out behind,'' he said. ``I'm here today
to serve notice: This is Day 1 of the fight for working families.
And with your help, we're going to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers are hoping to fill the coming 10 days with
events like the one Friday, first to dampen any post-convention
bounce in the polls the Republicans are likely to receive, and then
to build enthusiasm for Gore's own triumphal entrance into the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Gore spoke here before more than 8,000 letter
carriers, and on Saturday he will address a convention of the
National Association of Police Organizations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's speeches offered a preview of the themes Gore will
emphasize in the coming week and at the convention. He fired
populist attacks against the Republicans, describing their
convention as ``a masquerade ball for special interests'' and
repeating the refrain, ``They're for the powerful, and we're for
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to oppose tax cuts for the rich, bolster Social
Security, improve public schools, provide targeted tax breaks for
the middle class, raise the minimum wage by a dollar and make it
easier for workers to form unions.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if to answer critics within his own party who contend he
has not done enough to reveal his personal side to voters, he
salted his speech Friday with more biography than usual, saying,
``I also want the American people to know me for who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   He then dwelt heavily on his time in Vietnam as an army
journalist, offering an implicit contrast to Bush, who served in
the Texas Air National Guard during the war, never leaving the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Vietnam, I didn't do the most or run the
greatest danger,'' Gore said. ``But I volunteered and enlisted
because I loved my country, and I knew that if I didn't go, I knew
that someone else from my home town of Carthage, Tennessee, would
have to go in my place.''
</P>
<P>
   Left out of that explanation are two other possible reasons for
his decision to volunteer: His desire to help insulate his father,
an anti-war senator from Tennessee at the time, from Republican
criticism, and his own interest in broadening his resume for a
future political campaign.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The vice president was accompanied by his wife, Tipper, who
aides said was likely to spend significantly more time campaigning
for her husband in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to one of Bush's harsher attacks _ that the Clinton
administration had coasted through eight years of prosperity,
choosing ``the path of least resistance'' _ Gore said: ``What
planet have they been on?''
</P>
<P>
   He then claimed partial credit for starting the nation's
economic recovery by casting a tie-breaking vote in the Senate for
the president's 1993 economic stimulus plan. And he recalled the
efforts of the Republican-controlled Congress, led by Speaker Newt
Gingrich, to shut down the government in 1995, which polls showed
to be highly unpopular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish there had been less resistance,'' he said. ``I broke
the tie when every Republican voted no on the economic change that
has brought about this prosperity. I wish there had been less
resistance and that they didn't shut down the government twice.''

TV AUDIENCE FOR BUSH'S SPEECH SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN DOLE'S IN '96 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 18 million people watched the coverage of George W.
Bush's acceptance speech on ABC, CBS and NBC on Thursday night,
compared with the 17.8 million who watched the coverage of Bob
Dole's on those networks on the final night of the 1996 Republican
convention, according to Nielsen Media Research data.
</P>
<P>
   Viewership was bolstered by a particularly strong showing by
ABC, which ran an episode of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
before its coverage began and scored the highest ratings of the
night among the major broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   On cable television, CNN, with 2.3 million viewers, saw its
final-night audience drop 22 percent from the level of 1996. Some
of those viewers clearly went to its new competitors. Fox News
Channel, which was not in existence during the last convention, was
watched by 1.7 million viewers. MSNBC, which was too small to be
rated in the summer of 1996, was watched by 579,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stronger showing on its last night, the average
television audience over the convention's four nights was down,
compared with the audience in 1996, statisticians say. Nielsen
experts said that it is difficult to compare the size of the
audience for the two conventions because of the varying amounts of
coverage and the new 24-hour cable channels. But, based on a rough
analysis, they believe the audience possibly dropped by as much as
12 percent.

<P>
   Magnificent promises are always to be suspected.
</P>
<P>
   So said Theodore Parker, a decorated Army officer from the
mid-20th century. His words are wiser than ever today.
</P>
<P>
   On April 7, James Clark, founder of Netscape, co-founder of
Healtheon/WebMD and all-around Silicon Valley pioneer, astounded
investors by vowing to buy up to $200 million of Healtheon stock.
The shares of the company, an Internet health care concern, had
crashed along with other Web-based stocks from $75.1875 in January
to $21.6875 in April. Even on today's Wall Street, where $200
million may no longer qualify as big money, Clark's was a
magnificent promise. The stock jumped 35 percent on the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am more confident than ever in Healtheon/WebMD's vision of
connecting physicians, payers and consumers via the Internet,''
Clark said on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the announcement, the company said that Clark and
his family owned 11.7 million shares of Healtheon.
</P>
<P>
   Four months have passed. It is time for the promise police to
check on Clark's progress.
</P>
<P>
   According to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Clark bought 450,000 shares in April, at a cost of
$8.78 million. In May, as the stock was falling, Clark's buying
seemed to wane. He bought only 25,000 shares, for $311,000. In
June, the buys stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Filings for July are not yet available. But at the rate Clark is
buying, it will take roughly five and a half years for him to buy
$200 million of stock.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, Clark offered an explanation for why he
didn't buy more Healtheon shares. ``I made all the purchases that I
was allowed to make under rules of the SEC, which restricted me in
a way frankly I was not aware of when we first made the
announcement,'' he said. ``I was restricted to not be on the bid
side and I was only able to respond to offers of stock.''
</P>
<P>
   But an SEC spokesman said that while there were restrictions on
the sale of shares by insiders, there were no prohibitions when
they buy. There is only a so-called safe harbor rule that provides
certain conditions which, if met, will make it clear to regulators
that an executive is not buying shares to manipulate their price.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Clark was exercising great care not to roil regulators
with his purchases. When asked why his buying fell so significantly
in May and ceased in June, he said he was simply following the
direction of Healtheon's corporate lawyer. ``The company told me
when I could and when I could not buy stock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is surely disappointing news to Healtheon shareholders who
bought on Clark's bullish announcement. The stock has fallen 56
percent since then, closing at $12.875 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Clark's intentions were undoubtedly good, Robert Gabele,
director of insider research at First Call/Thomson Financial, said
it was wise for investors to greet all buyback announcements with a
healthy skepticism. ``Don't jump to the conclusion at the
announcement of a buyback that the stock will actually be
purchased,'' he said. ``A lot of times, insiders have emotional
attachments to their stock. When things settle down and common
sense takes over, the buyback may not get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he remained a big believer in the company and would
have bought more Healtheon shares if he could have. Oddly, then,
Healtheon shareholders have only the company to blame for keeping
this well-heeled bull out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   But Healtheon should be held accountable for something else.
Sure, Wall Street is all about positive spin today, but where was
the news release announcing that Clark's intent to buy $200 million
in stock had been stopped, if only temporarily? Crowing about a
planned purchase of stock and leaving shareholders in the dark
about its hiatus is just plain lame.

TURNAROUND EXPERT MAY NOT HAVE SPUN GOLD AT BARNEY'S 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When troubled retailer J.C. Penney announced last
week that Allen L. Questrom would be its new chief executive, Wall
Street was euphoric.
</P>
<P>
   Penney, which has been dogged by disappointing sales at its
department stores, saw its stock rise 16.5 percent on the day. And
Questrom's credentials led four of the 12 analysts that cover the
company to upgrade the stock, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be a huge improvement at J.C. Penney,'' said
George Strachan, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, who raised his rating
to market outperform from market perform. ``He's got a lot of
charisma and is very decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Investor enthusiasm stems in large part from the work that
Questrom did reviving ailing public companies like Federated
Department Stores and Macy's, which Federated acquired under his
leadership. But in the most recent chapter of his career, as
chairman and chief executive of Barney's New York Inc., it is less
clear that the veteran turnaround man has spun straw into gold.
</P>
<P>
   While Barney's has seen robust sales growth, its cash flow and
earnings have not been nearly as strong as the company had
predicted they would be in documents filed with the court to emerge
from bankruptcy protection and to entice investors. This combined
with a less forgiving investor environment has dashed any chance of
a quick return to public ownership. In addition, the glitzy
retailer has been hemorrhaging staff at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
   Questrom, a flawlessly groomed executive, arrived in May 1999 at
Barney's, famous for dressing men in the finest suits and their
social X-ray wives in the newest European designs. The company had
come out of bankruptcy in January, and Questrom was not responsible
for the earlier plan, filed with the court in November 1998. That
was done by Barney's majority owners, two vulture funds, Bar
Harbour Management and Whipporwill Associates Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Teitlebaum of Bar Harbour and David Strumwasser of
Whipporwill Associates Inc. say that the numbers in the filing were
based on the projections of previous management, under the
leadership of chief executive Tom Shull. When Questrom came aboard,
they formulated a more conservative plan, the owners say, and the
company is exceeding its new targets, though they declined to
disclose those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrival, Questrom was heralded as an
executive who could generate dynamic growth _ growth essential for
Barney's to pay off its looming and substantial debts.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Tarkenton, a bankruptcy lawyer at Womble, Carylyle,
Sandridge &AMP; Rice in Washington, D.C., said he had not studied the
Barney's situation, but added, ``like any company that misses
projections significantly, it is a sign that reorganization might
be failing.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that his yearlong tenure at Barney's has been anything
less than spectacular makes Questrom's eyes flash. He says what
really matters for a retailer just out of bankruptcy is to earn the
trust of vendors, and there he surpassed expectations. When he took
Barney's helm, 80 percent of vendors were asking to be prepaid, he
says, and today less than 8 percent do _ and those are mostly small
suppliers who have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Barney's stores have experienced double-digit sales growth since
Questrom arrived. In fact, much of the luxury market, including
Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, has benefited from a strong
economy. Questrom, though, takes credit for helping Barney's
partake in the boom by training the notoriously snooty sales force
to be more friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these solid accomplishments, there have been troubling
signs at the retailer, most notably staff turnover at Barney's
flagship Madison Avenue store since Questrom arrived. In just the
last three months, the company has lost six executives at the level
of divisional vice president and above, a creative director, a vice
president of communications and the Madison Avenue store manager,
or roughly nine out of 16 senior staff members.
</P>
<P>
   The turnover would not be a concern at a large chain of stores.
At a small, high-end operation like Barney's, though, experienced
service people and discerning fashion buyers are vital.
</P>
<P>
   A common theme among departing employees was that they did not
like the change to Questrom's more corporate manner from the
family-style management dating back to the Pressman clan that owned
Barney's before bankruptcy. The executive was repeatedly described
as ``cold.'' He earned ill will by demanding that his staff pass
basic retail math tests _ an exercise one former staffer described
as ``degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Questrom's effort could justly be defended as needed
professionalism for a famously high-flying, high-spending
operation, staffers felt his bottom-line emphasis was not in line
with Barney's overall luxury shopping experience.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he shifted Barney's away from its traditional
emphasis on the most cutting-edge designers. ``He was focused on
business volume makers, not on nurturing the young and upcoming
designers,'' said Emilia Fabricant, formerly the senior vice
president responsible for the women's co-op and outlet division,
who said she left because she was looking for a new creative
environment. ``I thought he was maybe losing the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Another possible reason for staff departures is that Barney's is
in no position to make a public offering of stock anytime soon.
Since Barney's emerged from bankruptcy with an estimated value of
$240 million, the market valuations of public retailers have
collapsed. Most now trade at less than their annual sales. Neiman
Marcus Group, a luxury retailer on solid footing, had 1999 sales of
$2.6 billion and sports a market cap of roughly 60 percent of that
amount. Given sales last year of $385 million and its distressed
history, Barney's public value might be less than $200 million in
the current environment.
</P>
<P>
   Even Questrom's decision to move on may relate to the fact that
there was probably little short-term upside in his staying. When he
joined, his employment agreement called for him to be paid entirely
in stock. The company now says that Questrom will get an
undisclosed sum of stock as well as a salary for the year he was
the top executive. He will remain chairman after joining Penney.
</P>
<P>
   Barney's majority owners say they don't pay attention to
short-term valuations and that theirs is a long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   Back in its 1998 filing with the court, the company projected a
net loss of $614,000 for the fiscal year ended January 2000 and net
income of $5 million for the year ending in January 2001. Instead,
the company posted a $5.3 million loss last year and expects just
to break even this year.
</P>
<P>
   The shortfall is significant because Barney's has two important
pools of debt coming due in 2003. A person very familiar with the
company's balance sheet says that the shortfall already endangers
the company's ability to meet these obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Teitlebaum and Strumwasser vigorously deny that they will have
any trouble meeting their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Shull, who saw Barney's through bankruptcy and helped build its
cash flow from negative $2 million to positive $20 million, and who
knows the company well, says that if the retailer does not start
meeting plan it will not be able to pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for them to make their financial commitments in two
years the company would have to achieve an EBITDA of over $70
million,'' he said, using the term that refers to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. ``At this stage,
barring significant additional investment, that would seem to be
virtually impossible.''

 &HT;    Gay couple followed a policy of selective disclosure
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They're not going to Vermont in
September for a quick ceremony in front of a justice of the peace
to make it ``official.'' They're not throwing a huge party _ or
even a small one _ to mark the day. There will be no invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nolan and Bob Pingpank are not flashy men. They're
pragmatic, salt-of-the-earth New Englanders; Connecticut Yankees
through and through. So next month when they celebrate the 45th
anniversary of the day they met during their freshman orientation
at Trinity College in Connecticut, they will do it with the reserve
that has marked their lives. They will celebrate at home, with
their two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and maybe a bottle of
wine.
</P>
<P>
   If their names were Rich and Barbara or Bob and Renee this story
might end here, with a hearty Happy Anniversary and a piece of
cake. But these are two men, a retired Episcopal priest and a
retired high school math teacher. And to some, their carefully
ordered world, filled with concerts at the Kravis and movies on
HBO, represents the breakdown of American society and a
disintegration of the church as the country's moral compass.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the civil rights era in the 1950s and '60s have
America's religious communities struggled so mightily with a single
issue as they have with gay rights. In the past five months, five
of the country's largest denominations have taken crucial votes on
policies toward homosexuality and gay marriages. The United
Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church voted to maintain bans
on same-sex ceremonies. The Episcopal Church and the Reform branch
of Judaism voted to open the door wider to gay unions. And the
Southern Baptist Convention in June condemned homosexuality as
immoral.
</P>
<P>
   The feared consequence of normalizing the status of
homosexuality? A slippery slope ``to Sodom and Gomorrah where fire
fell out of heaven and (the cities) burnt to ashes,'' says the Rev.
Gene Walton of Grace Christian Fellowship Church in West Palm
Beach. ``The acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle will trigger
God's judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   NOT MUCH CONTROVERSY HERE
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us back to Nolan and Pingpank _ aka, the triggers.
Somehow all this high-octane controversy swirling around them seems
a touch displaced because by any standard other than their
sexuality there's nothing controversial about them. They are two
button-down 63-year-olds with button-down concerns and button-down
lives. They read a lot, take their dogs on walks, confer on what to
eat for dinner and occasionally say to hell with their cholesterol
count and splurge on Kentucky Fried Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other longtime pair they have divided the chores:
Pingpank takes care of household maintenance and dog walking. Nolan
takes care of cooking and shopping. Need directions to their
suburban West Palm Beach home? ``Hold the phone a second,'' Nolan
says. ``That's Bob's department.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty boring,'' Pingpank says.
</P>
<P>
   And that, Nolan says, is the point: We blend in. We are your
neighbors, your friends, your teachers, even your priests.
</P>
<P>
   In half a century, a gay ``married'' minister may not raise
eyebrows in some denominations, but that's not today. This article,
for instance, was held for a week so Nolan could finish a series of
sermons at a church in Wellington where he has been a guest
speaker. He thinks some congregants are going to be pretty ticked
off when his relationship with Pingpank is known and the
congregation realizes they were being preached to about morality by
a homosexual. The rest of his career as a substitute minister will
be over as well, he suspects. If that's the case, so be it, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is 25 to 50 years behind Connecticut,'' he says.
``This is a don't-rock-the-boat diocese. . . One rector said they
pretty much wish the issue would just go away and I think that's
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   ONCE DEEMED A MENTAL ILLNESS
</P>
<P>
   A little adversity is nothing new. A quarter century ago Nolan
and Pingpank consistently ``fine tuned'' their lives so they could
live as they pleased without making waves. They came of age at a
time when homosexuality was considered a mental illness by the
medical establishment, a sin by the church and a perversion by
society.
</P>
<P>
   Their house in Connecticut, for instance, was divided into two
apartments with two kitchens, two bedrooms and two mailing
addresses in case the neighbors thought it odd that two grown men
were living together. It was all a ruse. They shared the same
bedroom, the rest was kept strictly for appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never hugged in front of the picture window, but OK, we can
live with that,'' Nolan says.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, Pingpank would drive to church in a separate car in
case anybody wondered why he and the pastor were always together.
When the principal's job came open while Pingpank was head of the
math department at the public high school where he taught, he
didn't apply in case his sexuality _ known to just a handful of
people in the community _ was used against him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they hold no grudges against the society that pressured
them to keep the closet door mostly shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long, long way in a very short time,'' Nolan
says. ``These things take time.''
</P>
<P>
   NOLAN A CRADLE EPISCOPALIAN
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps patience is part of the bargain when you're gay and you
want to serve God. Nolan knew from the third grade he wanted to be
a minister. About the same time he realized he was ``different.''
Being a cradle Episcopalian, there was no question what kind of
minister he would be.
</P>
<P>
   And he was ahead of his time as far as liberal theology goes.
While the Episcopal Church had a ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy
in effect, Nolan never believed that his sexual orientation was
sinful _ as conservative Christians believed _ because he never
thought of the church as infallible. ``If homosexuality is a sin
then someone's saying God made a mistake,'' Nolan said. ``And I
don't think he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Nolan's first vocational interview when he was a
sophomore in college. After driving to Boston with Pingpank and
being interviewed in the morning, the now inseparable pair saw the
priest who conducted the interview at a gay bar later that same
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he saw me I think he could sense I was nervous because he
said, `Don't worry, Richard, I'm going to recommend you very
highly,' '' Nolan laughs. ``He was probably nervous too.''
</P>
<P>
   That was four decades ago. It was just last month that the
Episcopal Church endorsed a new policy acknowledging that there are
Episcopal couples ``acting in good conscience,'' in lifelong
committed relationships outside of marriage that should receive
``prayerful support, encouragement and pastoral care.'' They don't
specify whether those ``couples'' are homosexual or heterosexual,
leaving some to believe the language is a purposefully vague
endorsement of long-standing homosexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   FINALLY, THE CHURCH'S BLESSING
</P>
<P>
   At this point does the church's blessing even matter? ``Not
really,'' Nolan says. ``It effects us only in the sense that it's
affirming. It's admitting that we've been right all along. Now,
that can sound awfully smug and arrogant, but I can't help it if
sounds that way. The church has caught up to what we had already
known and experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career as a professor of philosophy and a priest
Nolan has been ``out'' to varying degrees within the church and
community. ``It's been a selective sharing, where we thought it was
appropriate,'' Nolan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to live as gay people but just as people,''
Pingpank said.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent that meant overt omissions. Though at different
times they took care of all four of their parents in their old age
(''Every parent should be so lucky to have a gay son,'' Nolan
says), none of their parents ever discussed their son's sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know at the level they are capable of knowing,'' Nolan
says. ``Besides, by then my father had Alzheimer's and my mother,
well, my mother was from Boston.'' All four of their parents are
now dead, enabling them to speak publicly about their lives
together.
</P>
<P>
   CRITICISM FROM GAY GROUPS
</P>
<P>
   That sort of compromised openness about their sexuality has
occasionally prompted the younger generation of gays to consider
them Uncle Toms. They can live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been several times when we have been considered not
gay enough for different groups and we weren't asked to speak,''
Nolan said. ``Times change.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all of that _ the denominational votes, the social
attitudes, the severed speaking engagements _ mean little to either
of them. In the end, theirs is a love story. ``I know my
relationship with Bob has fueled my capacity to be a pastor,''
Nolan says. ``People ask, if I could have pushed a button and
become straight, would I? And what flashes into my life is not
straight or gay, but Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask us, wouldn't we like to get married in a church and
have God bless our relationship,'' Pingpank says. ``The answer is,
he already did, 45 years ago, the day we met.''

COMMENTARY: THE GOP'S AGE OF AQUARIUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: please replace double parentheses (( )) with single
brackets)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Who says the GOP is against welfare? The show it
put on here was nothing if not a bountiful assistance program,
providing food, drink and shelter for 15,000 journalists who found
themselves seriously underemployed at a political convention
without fisticuffs. In keeping with Republican orthodoxy, the bill
for this welfare program was picked up by the private sector _ the
journalists' employers _ and not the taxpayer. What is
compassionate conservatism if not life on an expense account?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, not all the recipients of this largess were grateful. Some
journalists drifted into a kind of catatonia in which they said
over and over to anyone who would listen how boring the GOP
infomercial was and how they longed for that happy time when Pat
Buchanan would give a Nazi speech and all three major networks
would leap to broadcast it. But not many were listening to this
nostalgic reverie _ or anything else emanating from the city of
brotherly inclusion. On Tuesday night, lowest-rated MSNBC had only
390,000 viewers _ a national audience slightly exceeding the
population of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   As such grim reports from the outside world infiltrated the
media bubble, there was much public and private soul-searching. Are
the political parties killing democracy by staging canned pageants
that TV networks don't want to broadcast and Americans don't want
to watch? Or is the press itself the culprit? Should the
underemployed masses of journalists at a convention be forced to
work no matter what _ call it welfare reform _ and provide
prime-time wall-to-wall coverage like the good old days, even if
nothing is happening and no one is tuning in?
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News, found himself almost
pilloried for cutting back his convention programming to a bare
minimum, anticipating the day when the networks cover the
presidential candidates' acceptance speeches and little else.
</P>
<P>
   I'm with Heyward. The political parties have the right to stage
any kind of convention they choose to sell their candidate, and the
networks have every right not to broadcast it in its entirety. As
this Republican convention illustrated more clearly than any other
to date, political parties are in step with the rest of the
branding-crazed American corporate culture. They roll out their
homogenized products just as The Gap introduces its new line of
khakis or Hollywood its summer blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Elections _ the primaries and the general _ are still
spontaneous and do demand full journalistic employment. But as long
as conventions are tightly scripted exercises in friction-free
salesmanship, they no more merit a full media army than an auto
show. They are chapters in the history of American merchandising,
not democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there were some real stories here that, for all the
excessive size of the press contingent, did not always get the
attention lavished on George P.'s looks, Gerald Ford's health, the
rise of Internet journalism and the latest image makeover of
Arianna Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   The true shadow convention in Philadelphia (as it will be at the
Democratic convention) was the one almost impossible for the media
to penetrate _ the one put on by big money. ``Democracy is now
lobbyists and fund-raisers,'' as a Republican operative put it to
me. Instead of providing wall-to-wall coverage of the official
doings in the First Union Center, some enterprising cable network
or Web site might have more aptly set up a hidden 24/7 camera in
the lobby of the new Ritz-Carlton Hotel, situated in what used to
be the Girard-Mellon Bank buildings, if only to keep track of the
fat cats hoping to buy influence.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of ABC News' Brian Ross to infiltrate corporate
festivities here _ which usually led to his and his cameraman's
being body-blocked _ were more revealing than anything that
happened on the convention floor. A front-page New York Times story
by Don Van Natta and John Broder reporting that a mere 739
contributors are responsible for two-thirds of the $137 million in
soft-money contributions to the GOP gave new, if unsavory, meaning
to the heretofore empty slogan ``prosperity with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Another shadow convention _ or perhaps more correctly, closet
convention _ began when Dick Cheney's perennially angry wife,
Lynne, predictably became the only big-name Republican in the
entire convention to go off-script. That moment occurred last
Sunday morning when, in an interview on ABC, Cokie Roberts said to
her, ``You have a daughter who has now declared that she is openly
gay.'' Lynne Cheney snapped back, ``Mary has never declared such a
thing,'' and then chastised Roberts for bringing the subject up.
``I simply am not going to talk about ((my daughters')) personal
lives,'' Cheney barked, cowing Roberts into retreat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In tone and language, Cheney thus conveyed that (a) her daughter
is not openly gay; (b) to be gay is a frightful ``thing''; and (c)
Roberts was revealing a Cheney family secret.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mary Cheney, who is 31, has by many media accounts been
openly gay for close to a decade, lives with a partner, and until
this spring worked as the corporate-relations representative from
Coors Brewing Co. to the gay and lesbian market, often appearing as
Coors' spokeswoman on its gay philanthropy and promotional events.
</P>
<P>
   So it was preposterous to insinuate, as Lynne Cheney did, that
Roberts had outed Mary Cheney. It was equally preposterous for
Lynne Cheney to claim that she would not be talking about her
family in the campaign. She dragged her daughters into her speech
introducing her husband to the convention just three days later,
and throughout the week here wielded her heterosexual daughter's
young child as a political prop.
</P>
<P>
   So what made Lynne Cheney lose it? The fact is that for all the
minorities paraded across the convention stage, homosexuals are
still at best seen and not heard in the GOP. At a reception for gay
Republicans here, the honoree was Mary Matalin, an honorary
lesbian, in the words of her jokey introducer, rather than, God
forbid, an actual lesbian. The obligatory AIDS speaker at the
convention itself was not gay, while the one openly gay speaker to
appear, Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, was permitted to talk about
anything except being gay.
</P>
<P>
   Though George W. Bush was able to soften or remove the
traditional hard-line GOP platform boilerplate on almost every
issue _ he even got rid of the plank calling for the abolition of
the National Endowment for the Arts _ he let stand the party's
draconian positions on both gay civil rights and abortion rights.
Had he really wanted those stances altered, they certainly would
have been.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the most important story here _ the political
prowess of Bush. For all the ridicule lavished on this
touchy-feely, pseudo-multicultural, neo-Clintonesque convention _
exactly the lockstep exercise in political correctness that the
political right professes to abhor _ the medium really was the
message. That message is not the official one, that the GOP has
overnight transformed itself into a haven for minorities. It
hasn't. The real message is simply that Bush had the iron-fist
skills, the team and the imagination to persuade his party to
convey that benign image, however synthetic some of it was.
Everyone from pro-choice Republican women in pearls to Pat
Robertson devotees to the most rabid Clinton-haters bit their
tongues rather than frighten any of those few independents or
Democrats watching. There were no mentions of impeachment; no ``it
takes a village'' cracks about Hillary Clinton. Republican heavies
from Richard Nixon to Newt Gingrich to Henry Hyde were erased from
history with Stalinist efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   It was all so lulling _ except for Bush's ingeniously crafted
acceptance speech _ that it looked easy. But it couldn't have been.
The big news here, and it's far from boring, is that the GOP
nominee proved, as neither his father nor Bob Dole could, that he
is capable of taming, uniting and, if you will, leading what has
been for a decade a notoriously unruly and obstreperous party.
Democrats are kidding themselves if they deny that Bush is far
closer than he was a week ago to making the sale that he can govern
the country as well.

   Growth in Employment Less than Forecast
</P>
<P>
   U.S. companies added fewer jobs in July than economists had
expected, further reducing the chances that the Federal Reserve
will raise interest rates when it meets later this month. In the
latest sign that economic growth is slowing, the unemployment rate
remained unchanged at 4 percent in July as private-sector payrolls
grew by 138,000, about half the number that most analysts had
predicted. Overall unemployment fell by 108,000 last month because
of the large number of temporary government workers who finished
collecting census data in June, the Department of Labor reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Major Market Indexes Rise on Slower Job Growth Data
</P>
<P>
   After an early morning decline, the Dow Jones industrial average
rose 61.17 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,767.75. The Dow is down
6.3 percent so far this year. Other markets also rose with the
Nasdaq composite index rising 27.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to
3,787.36 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbing 10.37
points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,462.93. Stocks ended higher after the
Department of Labor reported that private job growth had been
slower than expected last month. The data appears to make an
interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this month less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Tries to Stave Off Strike
</P>
<P>
   Verizon Communications moved to avoid a strike by more than
86,000 telephone workers by submitting a proposal on Friday
addressing concerns over issues including wages, benefits and job
security. Still, the company avoided unions' central concern of
unionizing the wireless work force, increasing the possibility of a
walkout. Unless the company and unions agree on several issues by
12:01 a.m. Sunday or agree to extend discussions, 72,000 members of
the Communications Workers of America and 14,700 members of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers will walk out on
Verizon.

   Aetna Reports 17 Percent Drop in Profits

increasingly costlier treatment. But it said it was moving along on
sweeping changes aimed at improving business.

   8 Wall St. Firms Settle Charges
</P>

   Unilever to Split Into 2 Divisions
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, the global consumer goods giant that has been on a
buying spree in the United States, announced a major reorganization
of top management. The move would reorganize the company into two
divisions, one focused on food brands like Lipton Tea and Ragu
spaghetti sauce and the other on consumer products like Dove soap
and Elizabeth Arden cosmetics. The news revived speculation that
the company planned a full split in two.

unidentified people on charges of impersonating its chairman and
chief executive, Richard A. Grasso, on a popular Internet message
board. In the suit, lodged in Federal District Court in Manhattan,
the exchange contends that the John Does, using aliases like
RichAGrasso, impersonated Grasso on the Ragingbull.com Web site.

<P>
   Role Seems to Remain for Concorde
</P>
<P>
   The July 25 crash of the Air France supersonic Concorde brought
down a plane that by common measurements can hardly be profitable,
given its high maintenance costs, daunting fuel bills, little
passenger space and no cargo. Yet any decision to ground the
Concorde permanently could have deep financial implications for Air
France and British Airways, the two airlines that run it. Its loss
would divert high-end corporate travelers to other airlines,
notably in the United States, or to corporate jet travel.

 &HT;    N.C. senator on Gore's list
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Republican politician John Blust would love
to see North Carolina's first-term senator, John Edwards, tapped
Tuesday as Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore's running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say he'd be like Dan Quayle,'' Blust said
referring to the President George Bush's little-known running mate
in 1988. ``But I don't think Edwards has the experience in
government and politics to become president if Gore were to die in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   But in eastern North Carolina, state Sen. R.C. Soles, a Democrat
from Tabor City, said Edwards as the party's vice presidential
candidate ``may be a stroke of genius.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the 47-year-old millionaire trial lawyer from
Raleigh as ``bright and competent and hard working'' and
``certainly more charismatic than Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only criticism they might say about him is he has not had
a lot of experience on Capitol Hill,'' Soles said. ``From a
political standpoint, I'm not sure that is too negative.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gore, campaigning Friday in Chicago, kept people guessing
about his running mate, and Edwards, visiting Raleigh, dodged the
topic, North Carolinians debated the prospect of two Southern
Democrats winning the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has emerged out of the blue as the only Southerner on
Gore's short list. In his 17 months in the Senate, Edwards has
impressed some important Capitol Hill Democrats, including Senate
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, who have touted him to Gore's
campaign advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gore's closest advisers _ political consultant Robert
Shrum and pollster Harrison Hickman _ were involved in Edwards'
upset win against incumbent Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth two
years ago. Also reportedly touting Edwards is Charlotte banker
Erskine Bowles, who served as President Clinton's White House chief
of staff.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was among the people who called Edwards in 1998 on the
night of his victory over Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the speculation that Edwards might be Gore's choice is
the fact that Gore spent last week at the home of Greenville, N.C.,
businessman Park Overton on Figure Eight Island, where Edwards also
has a home. However, one of the guests at Edwards' house was Sen.
Evan Bayh of Indiana, another name mentioned prominently as a
possible Gore choice.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Edwards returned to Washington from Raleigh, where he
hosted an Internet privacy forum. A day earlier, in a visit to
Greenville and Rocky Mount, where he viewed areas still recovering
from Hurricane Floyd, Edwards characterized the sudden interest in
him as ``a real compliment to the people of North Carolina. I think
it shows how important North Carolina is to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although North Carolina has a relatively small number of
electoral votes _ 14 _ Edwards could help the Democrat ticket win
the state for the first time since Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale
took it in 1976. Edwards also might influence votes in other
Southern states that, according to polls, have been leaning toward
Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who served as President George Bush's
secretary of defense, is the Texas governor's running mate. Gore,
from Tennessee, on Friday numbered his contenders as ``six, plus an
out-of-the-box possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles a week
away, Gore has said he will announce his choice for running mate on
Tuesday in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The leading prospects are all from the Senate: John Kerry of
Massachusetts, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, Bayh and Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Edwards) would give a further youthful,
forward-looking image to the ticket, and I think that might work
against the Bush-Cheney ticket,'' said East Carolina University
political science professor Tinsley Yarbrough.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was a political novice in 1998 when he defeated
incumbent Faircloth, an Eastern North Carolina farmer and ally of
North Carolina's senior senator, Republican Jesse Helms.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the bruising race relatively late and survived
Faircloth ads attacking him as a Clinton clone.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards refused to take money from PACs or Washington lobbyists.
Rather, spending $3.2 million of his own money, he ran ads about
his views and background. He drew criticism for suggesting that he
was born in North Carolina, when he was actually born in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a textile mill supervisor, he was the first in his
family to go to college, attending North Carolina State University
and then the University of North Carolina Law School.
</P>
<P>
   He became a successful plaintiffs' personal injury lawyer,
gaining attention with cases that included North Carolina's largest
personal-injury verdict. He won $25 million in compensatory damages
in 1997 when he represented a 9-year-old girl from Cary who was
badly injured by the suction of a faulty swimming pool drain. He
showed that another 13 children had suffered similar injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In all, he won verdicts totaling $152 million, allowing him to
build a fortune estimated as high as $50 million, according to the
Almanac of American Politics 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Faircloth seemed to be cruising to re-election until
Edwards stepped forward, some Democrats expressed reservations
about Edwards, saying at that time that he had not paid his
political dues. Even now, some long-time Democrats aren't quite
sure what to make of Edwards, or his vice presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know enough about Edwards to say what the truth
is,'' said R.V. Owens, campaign finance chairman for state Attorney
General Mike Easley, the Democratic candidate for governor of North
Carolina. In 1998, Owens supported Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards made two admissions in the 1998 campaign that Blust, a
former state senator from Greensboro who is seeking a state House
seat, said could haunt him if he becomes the vice presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards conceded that he had not voted in every election and
that he didn't remember whether he had first registered as a
Republican or a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am sitting back as a Republican strategist, here is a guy
who has not been in the political process for even two years,''
Blust said. ``He didn't even vote in some elections.''
</P>
<P>
   But political analyst Yarbrough said Edwards' imperfect voting
record might actually appeal to independent voters and ``people
whose party leanings are marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   Soles, the state senator who likes Edwards chances, said, ``I
have serious doubts that everybody has voted in every election.''

 &HT;    Episcopalians honor non-married couples
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The proverbial Wisdom of Solomon is
often needed for the Church to honor its traditions and do the
right thing.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting hairs, but not their church, Episcopalians have done
just that.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates meeting at the national convention of their church in
July decided to honor matrimony and also recognize couples who are
not married, including same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   After years of bitter struggle, it seems so simple.
Episcopalians acknowledged that the hand of God might figure in
evolving human relationships. The church could both honor ancient
beliefs and remain open to the next thing God might be up to.
</P>
<P>
   That's the tricky part of the Christian faith. Many churches try
to be obedient to a God they know from his past activities and
teaching. But their obedience often prevents them from seeing what
God is doing now.
</P>
<P>
   That keeps them from serving a God who could be about radically
new things.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that many churches behave like dusty museums
preserving a glorious past when they are called to be partners with
God in making all things new.
</P>
<P>
   Still, honoring the past and building the future with such a God
means walking a tightrope between obedience and risk.
</P>
<P>
   Episcopalians took the risk. Delegates voted to affirm the
church's traditional teaching on the sanctity of marriage and
respectfully recognize lifelong, committed, non-married
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The convention denounced promiscuity, exploitation and
abusiveness in all relationships, thereby honoring the teaching of
God.
</P>
<P>
   But delegates recognized that some couples disagree with the
church's traditional teaching on sexual behavior and act in
contradiction to it. That courageous admission accepts the risk
that God may be helping us understand another form of intimacy for
some of his children.
</P>
<P>
   The convention decided, for the time being, not to prepare
liturgical services to bless unmarried couples. A majority of
delegates feared that some parishes might leave the Episcopal fold
in protest and that schism was possible were the church to bless
such unions.
</P>
<P>
   Others argued that blessing same-sex unions would enhance the
church's deplorable practice of blessing virtually anything. The
church blesses yachts, tanks, animals, houses and countless other
things.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal bishop of Maryland, Robert Ihlof, reminded
delegates that the church blesses the hunt in his state, including
a divine nod to the hounds whose duty is to harass and terrify the
fox.
</P>
<P>
   One day the church will bless same-sex unions. But already, the
Episcopal Church recognizes that God may be involved in new forms
of human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests the church rightly believes that God has more to
teach us than has heretofore been found in the pages of Scripture.

 &HT;    Trip to Japan expanding Falcons' horizons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Morten Andersen has seen a lot of things in a lot of
places, but Friday afternoon was special.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 11 million people in this city, but for a
few minutes on Friday afternoon, nobody stood out like his Atlanta
Falcons teammate, Adriano Belli, the rookie free-agent Italian
defensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Nevermind that there were Japanese people in every direction.
For Belli, there was something liberating about travel that made it
feel like, well, like 'Karaoke night' back in his native Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a guy with a megaphone advertising, and (Belli) says,
`Can I borrow your megaphone?' `` said Andersen, the Falcons'
kicker/world traveller, who was born in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy was reluctant, but he finally gives it up, and Belli
starts singing, `Copa Cobana.' That was beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of minutes, a small portion of the population in
one of the world's biggest cities might have other opinions.
</P>
<P>
   This is a culture of staid people, and while karaoke is big
here, folks aren't used to it next to the subway, being performed
by a 6-foot-5, 290-pound Caucasian.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have made a dent on Tokyo, however, small, and the
city has made a dent on them.
</P>
<P>
   Having never played on international soil, team president Taylor
Smith said at an official NFL gathering Friday night that he was
honored to represent the league, the Falcons, and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' he said, addressing the crowd. ``It's just
two good ol' Southern boys (he and Dallas owner Jerry Jones of
Arkansas), getting together playing . . . like the Hatfields and
McCoys.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Tim Dwight, who grew up in Iowa City, as a blur in
massive Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' he said. ``I started liking sushi when I
came to Atlanta, and it sort of brought me up on a bigger city.
Now, you come here and we're such a minority. I'm into this bowing
thing . . . it's cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from Iowa, and being half way around the world . . .
you see if you can apply what you've learned out in the real world.
Just using the bathroom, you've got to figure out what all these
buttons are.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the toilets.
</P>
<P>
   If you hit the wrong button, or the right button, you'll get
sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK.
</P>
<P>
   For all the grumbling players might have done before their
21-hour bus ride-flight-and-bus ride from training camp in
Greenville, S.C., just to play a preseason game against the Dallas
Cowboys tonight, things are pretty cool.
</P>
<P>
   That's other than the effects of sake that will hit some this
morning, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia linebackers Whit Marshall, a Falcon, and Brandon
Tolbert, the Villa Rica native who was briefly with the Falcons in
1998 and now is on the Dallas roster, were shooting the breeze on
one side of the room.
</P>
<P>
   On the other, the world famous Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders were
strolling down the stairs, with locals videotaping every minute of
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons finally got past their jet lag late Friday, being 13
hours ahead of Atlanta and Greenville, and started having a good
time. The game will be at 10 p.m. tonight, 11 a.m. Sunday morning
in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time, I never even left Georgia,'' said coach
Dan Reeves, a native of Americus who has been overseas now for five
NFL preseason games in Tokyo, Berlin and London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I went to college (at South Carolina) and my horizons
expanded. Then, in the NFL they expanded more. And now the NFL is
going around the globe. It's really amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Shane Dronett, an Orange, Texas, native, got
over the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are incredibly nice,'' he said. ``The hardest
thing, always, is the flight. But it's amazing how safe the city
is. You go to a lot of countries where they have a lot of turmoil,
and then you look at how thin the newspaper is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they use crime to sell newspapers in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson, who's coming back from surgery on
his right knee, isn't expected to play tonight, but he's here,
practicing.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, of course, believes he's international, like the NFL's
Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Furman University, when Japanese media visited to
cover temporary Falcons player Nachi Abe of Japan, Anderson told
them he was, ''Larger than Godzilla in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving here, he was given a Godzilla doll.
</P>
<P>
   His role in Saturday afternoon's fan festival, in which he
signed more autographs than he might back in the U.S., was unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going overseas is great, especially a game of this magnitude,
the first game overseas for our organization,'' he said. ``You work
this hard, and prepare, and you really want to play. But at the
same time, what's best for me and my knee is the most important.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is all good for the NFL and the Atlanta Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumping around Friday afternoon in Akibahara, Tokyo's,
``Electric City,'' players were buying scads of electronic goods in
what looked like a giant, very colorful arcade of multiple stores.
</P>
<P>
   It was all part of an experience that will broaden horizons.
</P>
<P>
   These guys might have BMWs, Mercedes and expensive SUVs back in
the U.S. , but in Tokyo, they were relegated to the subway, with
millions of Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   For some, in a way, it was a trip back to their roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travel purifies you,'' Andersen said. ``It humbles you,
purifies you, and makes you realize how fortunate we are to live in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're jaded by material goods, the way we sometimes greet each
other and act. When you travel, you're totally exposed. It's an
away game of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It educates me more than any book I could read. My phrase has
always been, 'To travel is to live.' ''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a high-tech dirty trick that experts say could
happen to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Needham, 51, of Mableton, Ga., was stunned when he arrived
at work two days after Christmas at ING Investment Management,
where he was a technology operations manager making six figures. He
was told he would be fired for a stinging e-mail that maligned his
supervisor's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What . . . are you talking about?' '' Needham
recalled. ``I hadn't even had my first cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say this is what happened: Needham didn't write the
e-mail that carried his name. Instead, a co-worker created an
e-mail account on the free service Hotmail.com using Needham's
name. On Dec. 26, the co-worker used the account to send the
inflammatory e-mail to his supervisor's boss.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, police issued an arrest warrant for Mark Cohen on a
computer fraud charge.
</P>
<P>
   This type of fraud, combining the relative anonymity of the
Internet with the politics of the corporate world, has become
common with the growth of the Internet, experts say. But while the
medium is new, the tactics are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this had been 25 years ago, it's possible he would have
typed a letter or sent a note on his personal stationery,''
speculated Frank Prince of Forrester Research. The Massachusetts
firm studies the impact of technology on business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology aside, all the good and evil, beauty and ugliness
we see in everyday life gets played out on the Internet,'' Prince
said.
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, the lengthy e-mail sent to the
supervisor's boss uses professional language to criticize the
supervisor's performance and to suggest that Needham could do his
job better without him. ``I am very concerned that he is on the
verge . . . of destroying everything I have strived to build,'' the
e-mail said.
</P>
<P>
   After Needham got fired, he went to the police, who had created
a high-tech crime unit in November to combat Internet fraud and
other computer-related crimes. Using phone records and information
provided by Hotmail, Detective Joel Horne was led to Cohen, who
worked with a consulting firm at Needham's company.
</P>
<P>
   Police speculate Cohen sent the e-mail because Needham was
critical of Cohen's firm's performance. Needham says he doesn't
know the reason.
</P>
<P>
   Needham, whose wife left him after he was fired, is now working
in a similar job earning six figures for another company. Even
though his name has been cleared, he says, he doesn't want his old
job back. He has retained a lawyer and wants ING to pay him for the
three months he was out of work. Attempts to reach the company
Friday for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Prince said there is little one can do to protect against such a
cyber attack. But as employers become more familiar with the
Internet, they may not make such quick judgments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Needham hopes employers take heed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a pretty tech-savvy engineer. If it can happen to me, the
poor guy out there who has no knowledge is really in trouble,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Bush takes message to key swing states
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A triumphant Gov. George W. Bush headed for
Pittsburgh Friday where he kicked off a whistle stop train tour
through four key swing states fresh off his speech before the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Standing with running mate Dick Cheney at the back of the
Victory 2,000 Express, Bush asked a crowd of cheering supporters
for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party has a message. It says give us a chance,'' Bush
said, echoing the refrain of his Thursday speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be long now. Give us a chance. Give us a chance to
change America for the better. It won't be long now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney promised the crowd: ``We will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a meeting in Philadelphia of the Republican National
Committee, Cheney cautioned against taking the race for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a tough campaign . . .,'' he said. ``We're going to
take our campaign right to the heart of the key swing states,
battleground states.''
</P>
<P>
   The information technology company Electronic Data Systems
Corp., announced Friday that Cheney has left its board to pursue
the vice presidency. There are no immediate plans for his
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Secure with GOP base voters, Bush and Cheney are traveling with
their wives, Laura and Lynne, to towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan and Illinois _ states packed with the Democrats and
independents they will need to win the White House in November.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a 16-car train with American flags waving at the front,
they launched the trip in Pittsburgh and traveled through a handful
of Pennsylvania towns before arriving in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough campaign, it is,'' Bush told about
100 people at one stop. ``That's why we're here in Wampum,
Pennsylvania. We're taking no votes for granted. I want you to
remind your friends and neighbors when voting time comes who came
and asked. We're here asking.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bush told reporters aboard his campaign plane that
delivering the speech was a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt different yesterday when I went on the stage and I
became the official nominee of the party,'' Bush said. ``I've got a
responsibility to uphold and I'm going to uphold it and I think
we've got a good chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, there's going to be all kinds of polls and speculation
between now and Election Day and I understand that. That's why . .
. it's so important for us to be patient and keep our eye on the
finish line. We've got a strategy in place the entire time.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Bush's lead over Gore had reached 19 points _ 50
percent to 31 percent _ in a bipartisan Voter.com-Battleground
tracking poll of 1,000 likely voters taken Wednesday and Thursday.
The poll has a 3 percentage point error margin. Bush had a 20-point
lead among independents and a slight lead among women, two groups
where he and Gore previously had been tied. Bush led in every
region of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was not trying to provoke Vice President Al Gore
with the speech, but to, ``speak to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush accused Gore and President Clinton of
squandering their eight years leading the nation. He mocked Gore as
a fearful naysayer who labels Bush's proposals, ``risky schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of needling the opponent with good humor, that's what
American politics should be about ...,'' he said. ``I'm going to
continue pointing up differences and I will do so in a respectful
way and occasionally put a needle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was the most negative speech he has given as a
candidate, Bush said: ``I don't feel that was the case at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to draw the distinction and I need to make the case
that this is a wasted moment in American history,'' he said.

BUSH MUST SUBSTANTIATE HIS ATTACKS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drawing morning-after praise, even from Democrats, for his GOP
acceptance speech, George W. Bush now must substantiate his attacks
on his opponent and convince more voters that he's equipped for the
presidency, political experts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, however, wasted no time in belittling
the Texas governor's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know our opponents put on quite a show in Philadelphia,
but political positioning will never heal sick children or give
senior citizens the medications they need,'' Gore said in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an NBC News poll conducted in the final hours of the
four-day convention said the upbeat GOP gathering sent Bush's
approval numbers up considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly he helped himself on a personal front,'' said
Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart of Washington, D.C., who
conducted the survey for NBC and the Wall Street Journal in
conjunction with GOP pollster Robert Teeter.
</P>
<P>
   Before the convention, the pollsters said Bush drew favorable
ratings from 52 percent of the public, but as it closed, the number
was 58 percent. Meanwhile, Bush's negative rating, which was 32
percent before the gathering, dropped to 24 percent, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, with a 4.4 percent margin of error, placed Bush ahead
of Gore by 11 percentage points (47 to 36 percent) up from a
six-point spread before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I would call a conventional convention bump. It's
perfectly normal and understandable. This falls right in the
mid-range of what one expects from a good convention,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is, personal attitudes toward Bush climbed
considerably,'' Hart said, even among people who didn't follow the
convention and missed Bush's acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight tracking polls taken Wednesday and Thursday showed
Bush had gained a convention bounce of 10 percentage points among
likely voters, almost twice the historical average for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBC poll of 511 registered voters, Bush picked up support
with older voters in the Midwest and with independents nationwide,
the pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush bolstered perceptions that he is the ``compassionate
conservative'' he claims and has more of a vision for the future
than Gore, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the central question that people had going in, they still
have going out: Is he knowledgeable and experienced enough to
handle the presidency? Going in, Gore had an advantage of 36-30 on
that quality; coming out, it's 41-37,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in a good Bush week, he still has something to prove to
the voters,'' Hart said. For example, on the subject of the tax
cuts proposed by Bush, ``it's not a question of how big your tax
cut is, it's how responsible it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond satisfying those types of concerns, Bush also must be
prepared to answer harsh Democratic attacks in answer to his own
verbal salvos, said University of Texas at Arlington political
scientist Allen Saxe.
</P>
<P>
   He described Bush's address as ``the smoothest speech I've ever
heard him make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now the Democrats are going to come out swinging and the
Republicans know it,'' Saxe said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will Bush's federal policies be assailed when the
Democrats meet in Los Angeles on Aug. 14, but Bush's Texas record
is in for unrelenting scrutiny, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, quoting his friend, the late Democratic Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock, warned critics, ``Don't mess with Texas.'' Saxe said it
isn't likely the Democrats will heed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to mess with Texas. That's what the
Democratic party is going to do now _ show that it's really not the
compassionate conservative party that Bush talked about in his
speech. It's really the same old conservative party that we've
always known,'' Saxe said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Jano Cabrera downplayed the NBC poll, saying it
reflect the ``wild'' fluctuations common during the convention
season. More telling, he claimed, was Bush's attack on the
Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that he promised to have an attack-free convention
and then broke his word to the American people, his whole speech
was offensive,'' Cabrera said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of having a substantive discussion on the issues, he
attacked Al Gore,'' Cabrera said. &QL;

 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The major Latin American stock markets are losing their highest
volume stocks. Brazil's Bovespa has lost former telecom holding
Telebras shares, and, if Telefonica's bold stock purchase plans go
through, Brazil, Argentina and Peru will lose the highly traded
shares of the Spanish company's subsidiaries.
 &HT;    ``You certainly have to be aware of the delisting in the
markets,'' says Geoffrey Dennis, Latin American Equity Strategist
at Salomon Smith Barney, referring to this trend of taking stocks
off a market. ``Many of these companies simply would rather list in
New York.''
 &HT;    Indeed, until the recent tanking of the high-tech markets, many
Latin American Internet start-ups hoped to go straight to Nasdaq,
bypassing any local listings. And it's no big secret why: easy
access for global investors, protection for minority shareholders,
dollar denominated trading and high volumes mean increased share
prices.
 &HT;    The delisting drive in Latin America is not entirely due to New
York's hostile takeover of Latin stocks. In many cases,
international buyers simply want full ownership of their targets,
which often means taking them off the market.
 &HT;    But, certainly, poor protection of minority shareholder rights
has helped fuel the exodus. In the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais,
for example, Gov. Itamar Franco recently ousted the management team
of U.S. energy company AES Corp. from the board of Cemig, an energy
company jointly run by the state government and AES. The U.S.
company's protests fell largely on deaf ears.
 &HT;    The Latin stock markets or bolsas are feeling the heat of
increased competition for high profile stocks. Bovespa, the Sao
Paulo stock exchange, recently absorbed the much smaller Rio de
Janeiro exchange. Brazilian authorities are also now taking belated
actions to make the market more investor friendly and beef up
minority shareholder rights _ long a concern for market investors.
Analysts say those changes could make quite a difference in keeping
companies in the bolsas andtracting other businesses there.
 &HT;    The Central Bank has agreed to permit pension funds to invest up
to 10 percent of their stock portfolio in foreign companies trading
in Brazil. The funds control about US$64.3 billion, half of which
they can invest in equities. ``There's been a growing amount of
pension fund assets being funneled into the market,'' Dennis says,
adding this could prompt companies to list shares or to remain on
the market.
 &HT;    Marcia Tarter, a Latin American analyst for Warburg Dillon Read,
adds, ``People have more money to put to work. There are some
start-ups making their first forays in the market.''
 &HT;    There were expected to be even more forays in June, when the
Brazilian government was slated to change investing laws to better
protect minority shareholders by giving investors more power to
influence company management and protect their interests in cases
of mergers and acquisitions. Among other things, the proposal would
force companies to sell voting and non-voting stock in the same
proportion, increasing the quantity of common shares in the market
and diluting the power of the majority holders.
 &HT;    The Central Bank has also been considering cutting trader fees,
making business dealings and ownership more transparent and easing
regulations for investment funds.

 &HT;    Las principales bolsas latinoamericanas estan perdiendo sus
acciones de mayor volumen. Bovespa, de Brasil, ha perdido los
titulos de Telebras, y si los audaces planes de compra de valores
de Telefonica marchan bien, Brasil, Argentina y Peru perderan las
valiosas acciones de las filiales de la compania espanola.
 &HT;    ``Hay que estar consciente de la retirada de las acciones en los
mercados,'' dice Geoffrey Dennis, estratega de valores
latinoamericanos de Salomon Smith Barney, refiriendose a esta
tendencia de sacar acciones de los mercados bursatiles. ``Muchas de
estas companias preferirian cotizarse en Nueva York.''
 &HT;    Hasta la reciente caida de los mercados de alta tecnologia,
muchas nuevas empresas latinoamericanas de Internet esperaban ir
directamente al Nasdaq. La razon: el facil acceso a los
inversionistas internacionales, la proteccion para los accionistas
minoritarios, los negocios en dolares y los altos volumenes de
negociacion significan un aumento en el precio de las acciones.
 &HT;    La tendencia de retirar acciones del mercado en America Latina
no se debe completamente a la absorcion hostil de los valores
latinoamericanos por parte de Nueva York. En muchos casos, los
compradores internacionales sencillamente quieren la propiedad
total de sus objetivos, lo que implica sacarlos de la bolsa.
 &HT;    Pero la deficiente proteccion de los derechos de los accionistas
minoritarios ha impulsado el exodo. En el estado brasileno de Minas
Gerais, por ejemplo, el gobernador Itamar Franco expulso
recientemente al equipo gerencial de la empresa electrica
norteamericana AES Corp. de la junta directiva de Cemig, compania
electrica operada conjuntamente por el gobierno del estado y AES.
 &HT;    Las bolsas latinoamericanas sienten la presion de la fuerte
competencia por acciones de gran demanda. Bovespa, la bolsa de
valores de Sao Paulo, absorbio recientemente a la bolsa mucho menor
de Rio de Janeiro. Las autoridades brasilenas tambien toman medidas
tardias para atraer mas inversionistas al mercado y fortalecer los
derechos de los accionistas minoritarios. Los analistas dicen que
esos cambios podrian ser decisivos para mantener a las companias en
las bolsas y atraer a otros negocios.
 &HT;    El Banco Central permitira que los fondos de pension inviertan
hasta el 10 por ciento de su cartera en empresas extranjeras que
operan en Brasil. Los fondos controlan unos US$64.300 millones, y
la mitad de esa suma la pueden invertir. ``Ha habido una
canalizacion de activos de fondos de pension hacia el mercado,''
dice Dennis, lo que podria llevar a muchas firmas a cotizarse o
permanecer en el mercado.
 &HT;    Marcia Tarter, analista latinoamericana de Warburg Dillon Read,
anade: ``La gente tiene mas dinero para invertir. Hay varias
empresas nuevas haciendo sus primeras incursiones en el mercado.''
 &HT;    Se esperaban mas incursiones en junio, cuando el gobierno
brasileno debia cambiar las leyes de inversion. La propuesta
obligaria a las companias a vender acciones con y sin derecho a
voto en la misma proporcion, lo que aumentaria la cantidad de
acciones ordinarias en el mercado y diluiria el poder de los
accionistas mayoritarios. El Banco Central tambien ha estudiado
reducir las comisiones de los corredores, hacer mas transparentes
los negocios y aliviar las regulaciones a los fondos de inversion.

BUSH TAKES WINNERS LAP THROUGH 4 KEY STATES 
 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Enjoying a post-convention campaign bounce and a
bumpy railway ride, newly anointed Republican presidential nominee
George W. Bush boarded the ``Victory 2000 Express'' train Friday
for a three-day winner's lap through four battleground states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party has a message: It says give us a chance. It won't be
long now. Give us a chance to change America for the better,'' Bush
said while standing on the rear platform of a red Norfolk Southern
railway car, addressing a crowd of about 3,000 supporters in
Station Square.
</P>
<P>
   The train of 16 antique cars, pulled by two engines bearing two
wind-whipped American flags, carried Bush away from the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia and the most triumphant moment
in his quest for the White House. Bush's railroad tour had stops
scheduled in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois between
Friday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight tracking polls taken Wednesday and Thursday showed
Bush had gained a convention bounce of 10 percentage points among
likely voters, almost twice the historical average for candidates.
The largest convention bounce was the 13 percentage points gained
by Ronald Reagan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Battleground 2000 poll for Voter.com ended before Bush had
delivered his nationally televised acceptance speech Thursday
night. A final day of polling Friday is expected to measure the
impact of Bush's speech.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by Democratic pollster Celinda Lake and
Republican pollster Ed Goeas. It surveyed 1,000 likely voters
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can expect his own bounce from the Democratic National
Convention that begins Aug. 14, but Bush's lead puts Gore in the
position of having to make up ground with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be all kinds of polls and speculation between
now and Election Day and I understand that,'' Bush said. ``That's
why it's so important for us to be patient and keep our eye on the
finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said issues are ``going to win this campaign and I'm going
to keep talking about issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed Democratic criticism that he and other convention
speakers had masqueraded as moderates for national television to
hide a conservative record that is out of the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he will keep hitting on the themes of his acceptance
speech: tax relief, strengthening the military, reforming Social
Security and improving education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep saying it over and over again, so should I
become the president, I will be able to stand up in front of the
Congress and say, `The American people heard what I said. They've
endorsed the platform. Now, let's get it done,' '' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended the aggressive tone of his convention speech,
saying it was not too harsh against Gore or President Clinton.
Denying that his deadpan joke about Gore inventing the Internet was
a personal attack, Bush said, ``I'm sure he's used to that by now.
I doubt he even watched it, would be my guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said there is nothing wrong with teasing an
opponent or drawing a distinction between records or political
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of needling the opponent with good humor, that's what
American politics should be about as opposed to the kind where you
tear people down and distort,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm going to continue pointing up differences, and I'm
going to do so in a respectful way. And occasionally put a needle
out there. But as some of you may know by now, I like to needle.
Right, Pancho?'' Bush said, teasing a reporter for The New York
Times by using his nickname.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he enjoyed delivering his convention speech and was
not nervous. The toughest moment, he said, was when he was talking
about his family, including his father, the former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got through those paragraphs, I knew I was in pretty
good shape,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The best audience response, Bush said, came from the refrain,
``They had their chance. They haven't led. We will.'' He said the
delegates began to understand that he was laying out a case that
Clinton's legacy should not be continued through Gore.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Bush said he returned to his room at the
Marriott Hotel in Philadelphia and celebrated with his sister and
two of his three brothers.
</P>
<P>
   He said his bedtime probably ``set a modern-day record for me,
1:30 in the morning.'' Bush's usual bedtime is 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The nominee and his running mate, Dick Cheney, began Friday at a
prayer breakfast, followed by a visit to the Republican National
Committee. Cheney told the RNC not to become complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the polls look great. The opposition is obviously
shell-shocked. It will be a tough campaign. This crew is not likely
to steal off into the sunset,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   At an airport rally attended by about 500 people, Bush praised
Philadelphia and the convention that nominated him for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sure glad we came to Philadelphia,'' Bush said. ``We
leave this city of brotherly love energized and united and focused
on victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes and the Cheneys rode a pair of 1928 sister train cars
on their whistle-stop tour, the Virginia and the Carolina. One is
an office car, and the other is a sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   The train trip was not constant; the entourage planned to get
off and fly to the next state every day while a train crew
deadheaded to the next day's starting point.
</P>
<P>
   At stops along his train trip, Bush greeted small groups of 100
to 300 well-wishers in western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough campaign. That's why we're here in
Wampum, Pa.,'' Bush told one crowd of about 100 people. ``We're
taking no votes for granted. I want you to remind your friends and
neighbors when voting time comes who came and asked. We're here
asking.''

CRASH INVESTIGATORS FIND UNIDENTIFIED STRIP OF METAL ON RUNWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Rewrites 4th graf to identify investigating agency. Changes
``Concordes'' to ``the French Concordes'' in 2nd-last graf.)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Investigators looking into last week's crash of the Air
France Concorde said Friday that they had found a 16-inch strip of
metal on the runway that did not belong to the plane, and that they
have also found a ``large gash'' in a piece of tire debris.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have so far been unable to explain why the jet
caught fire on take off and crashed into a small wooden hotel, just
north of Paris, killing 114.
</P>
<P>
   Without any theories, French transportation officials have
continued to keep Air France's remaining Concorde planes out of
service.
</P>
<P>
   But a statement released Friday by the BEA, the French agency
that investigates air crashes, suggested that investigators might
be considering the possibility that a problem that had nothing to
do with the plane's mechanics had caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Since the disaster on July 25, speculation has largely focused
on the possibility that a tire suffered a blow out and debris from
it or a wheel sliced through fuel lines or fuel tanks, triggering a
fire. But investigators have yet to offer their opinion. The metal
strip could explain how the tire was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   But in their statement, the investigators continued to steer
clear of theories. They offered a smattering of new facts without
explaining how any of them might fit together. They have said that
a preliminary report will not be ready before the end of the month,
and a final report could take 18 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said that one of the plane's left side tires
was changed before take off and survived the crash intact. Debris
from another tire on the left side was found on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Tire marks on the runway also showed that the plane had veered
to the left before taking off. Traces of soot, pieces of water
deflectors above the tire and debris from a fuel tank were also on
the runway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, a water deflector on a British Airways Concorde broke
off and punctured a fuel tank. The British airline later modified
the deflector so that could not happen again. But Air France
officials have said they did not install the same modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Some Air France employees on Friday sent an open letter to the
airline to organize a special Concorde test flight to show that
they still have confidence in the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to keep it on the ground,'' said Gilles
Belliard, spokesman for the National Union of Civil Aviation
Mechanics. Belliard said mechanics and other employees would
volunteer to board the special flight.
</P>
<P>
   But Air France officials said no such flight would take place
before the Transportation Ministry ruled that the French Concordes
could fly again.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways briefly suspended its Concorde flights but went
back to regular service the day after the crash, which killed all
100 passengers and nine crew members and five people who were on
the ground in the town of Gonesse, where the plane crashed in a
ball of fire.

IN PHILADELPHIA, CONVENTION PROTESTERS HELD ON BAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As bail was set as high as $1 million for
protesters accused of blocking streets during the Republican
National Convention, defense and civil liberties lawyers on Friday
questioned whether the city court action was a punitive measure
intended to discourage the next round of civil disobedience,
planned for the Democratic convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The bail of $1 million was set for John Sellers, identified as a
33-year-old leader of the Ruckus Society of California, which says
it trains demonstrators in nonviolent civil disobedience. Larry
Frankel, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Pennsylvania, said the bail seemed extraordinary since Sellers
had been charged only with eight misdemeanors and no felony
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Bail for three other defendants whom the police considered
ringleaders of the street protests was set at $400,000 to $500,000,
with only one of them, 20-year-old Darby Landy, accused of a
felony. The charge came after an alleged street fracas with biker
police officers led by police Commissioner John P. Timoney.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel questioned whether the city's intention was to keep
protest leaders ``in detention until their date of trial'' sometime
after the Democratic National Convention's opening on Aug. 14,
rather than serving bail's basic purpose of guaranteeing a
defendant's appearance for trial. Other defense lawyers noted that
defendants charged with misdemeanors are typically released on
their own recognizance and that bail as high as $1 million was
unprecedented for misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing for the high bail, Assistant District Attorney Cindy
Martelli contended on Thursday that Sellers was one of the key
leaders of Tuesday's illegal street demonstrations in which more
than 200 protesters were arrested. ``He facilitates the more
radical elements to accomplish their objective of violence and
mayhem,'' Martelli said of the street incidents, in which there
were few reports of major property damage or serious personal
injury.
</P>
<P>
   In the bail argument, prosecutors referred repeatedly to the
coming Democratic convention and to street protests earlier in
Washington and Seattle. Defense lawyers said the simple misdemeanor
charges at issue were being inflated into ominous-sounding national
conspiracies to draw the high bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Philadelphia, Ala.,'' said Lawrence S. Krasner,
Sellers' defense lawyer, who contended that the city was using bail
as a tool of preventive detention and punishment. ``Bail of $1
million for a misdemeanor is absolutely ludicrous,'' Krasner said,
adding that he would appeal it on Monday to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
   After 371 arrests made during the convention week, most of them
on misdemeanor charges, only about a third of the defendants were
free as of Friday morning, according to an unofficial count. The
police and demonstrators accused each other of deliberately slowing
the arraignment process. Civil liberties lawyers said a number of
protesters were refusing cooperation and withholding their
identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting parents calling us up asking if we know what
happened to their kids,'' Frankel said, emphasizing that he was
urging cooperation and proper identification.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers was arrested as he engaged in a cell phone conversation
on the street. Amy Kwasnicki, organizer for the protest group
Philadelphia Direct Action, accused the police of pre-emptively
arresting people they considered protest leaders even though she
said Sellers had only trained others in methods of nonviolent civil
disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy of the defendants were arrested on Tuesday in a
puppet-making factory that the police raided with a search warrant,
contending they would uncover hard evidence of criminal plans to
disrupt the city during the GOP convention. Demonstrators said the
factory contained only street-theater puppets and agitprop
paraphernalia intended for nonviolent civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   As defense lawyers awaited details of the evidence that the
police considered likely to be found, a judge ordered the warrant's
contents sealed at the request of city prosecutors. ``Highly
suspicious,'' said Stefan Presser, legal director for the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   The police denied accusations that the factory raid was a
pre-emptive undercutting of the planned demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can prove they've engaged in criminal activity,''
Timoney insisted on Thursday. He raised the question of whether
there should be a federal investigation into the activities of
protest groups moving lately from one city to another to stage
street demonstrations during major, media-heavy conferences.
``Somebody's got to look into these groups,'' Timoney said.
</P>
<P>
   The police were widely praised by city residents for their
restraint in dealing with the demonstrations. But leaders of the
protest groups said that defendants were being abused in jail. The
police denied this, and Presser of the ACLU said legal monitors
inside the detention area had received no complaints of brutality.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ So how does a physicist who expanded on Einstein's
theory of relativity with a treatise called Supersymmetric Flipped
SU (5) find himself running for president?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a quantum leap,'' John Hagelin said with a deadpan
expression.
</P>
<P>
   But then he explains the transition, and it sort of makes sense,
a progression of curiosity, from science to public policy to public
service, in which he has always embraced a common sense approach to
problem solving.
</P>
<P>
   What might appear to make less sense is why someone with his
academic background and soaring IQ, 165, would seek to put his
ideas in play as the presidential candidate of the Reform Party, an
utterly chaotic political organization that is mounting yet another
charge this year against the Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, 46, who received his master's and doctorate from
Harvard University and spent nearly 20 years as a research
scientist, is immersed in a nasty primary fight with Pat Buchanan,
the loquacious former television commentator, to win the party
nomination at its convention next week in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the primary has focused more on arguments, conflicts
and accusations of election fraud against Buchanan than any
discussion of ideas or issues. Hagelin, who remains virtually
unknown to voters, visited Denver this week, as part of a campaign
trip from Washington to Long Beach, to call attention to his own
charges, that Buchanan has corrupted the primary process by
submitting the names of people ineligible to vote in the Reform
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting he has done nothing improper, Buchanan has grown so
sure of winning the nomination that he has dismissed Hagelin as a
minor annoyance, to the point of alerting reporters this week to
the time and place of his victory party next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But his opponent's bold confidence has hardly discouraged
Hagelin, a soft-spoken man who is hardly the political neophyte
that his background and easy demeanor suggest.
</P>
<P>
   This is his third run for president, following largely symbolic
campaigns in 1992 and 1996 as the nominee of a party he helped
found, the Natural Law party, to apply principles a scientist uses
every day through common sense, to national political problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always about solutions that work, and I was very
intrigued by a party founded on the concept of natural law,'' said
Hagelin, who was born in Pittsburgh and grew up in a succession of
towns in Connecticut. ``That was, after all, how nature governs the
earth's complex ecosystem. The idea of a political party dedicated
to harnessing up-to-date scientific knowledge of natural law made
profound sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning only 39,179 votes in 1992 and 113,668 four years
later, he realized this year that by adding his base to the Reform
Party, founded eight years ago and represented twice in
presidential elections by Ross Perot, he could achieve a bigger
platform and a stronger voice in the 2000 general election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Hagelin's ideas and positions are born less from years in
politics than from years of scientific research that focused on
brain development and, later, the application of scientific
principles to public policy. It led him from Harvard to the
European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva to Stanford and
finally, in 1985, to Maharishi University of Management, a private
institution in Fairfield, Iowa, where he established a research
institute that explores issues like health care, education, crime
prevention and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in Fairfield, a rural town of 10,000 where he now
lives, divorced from his wife of eight years, Margaret, Hagelin
spent considerable time studying how to change the nation's health
care system, which he calls ``a disease care system'' because of
its emphasis on problems rather than prevention. He consulted
dozens of House members and even helped write a single paragraph in
the comprehensive but ill-fated plan that Hillary Rodham Clinton
proposed shortly after her husband became president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only paragraph in a 10,000-page document that had
anything to do with health,'' he said, recalling its focus on
cost-effective preventive care.
</P>
<P>
   He also favors fair trade, campaign finance reform, a flat tax,
reduced American military involvement overseas, abandoning efforts
to build a missile shield system, gun ownership rights and abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   But years of working with Republicans and Democrats, he said,
convinced him that the parties are tied too closely to corporate
donors to enact fundamental changes in major areas like trade,
health care and military spending.
</P>
<P>
   So he increased his efforts in building a third-party
alternative, convinced ``that we had to do what the government did
with Microsoft, force competition through a vibrant third party.''
</P>
<P>
   His task at hand is a prodigious one. Buchanan has worked
aggressively to assure himself the nomination through a complex
process that could include the nullification of the popular vote in
favor of a vote of the convention delegates. Buchanan claims to
have the two-thirds majority he would need.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters for Hagelin is Buchanan's longstanding
presence in American politics and on American television. On
Sunday, for example, Buchanan is scheduled to appear on four
morning talk shows. Hagelin was not invited to any of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Hagelin said Buchanan might be surprised at the convention,
and if his years at Maharishi, where meditation was part of the
daily routine, taught him anything, it was patience _ Hagelin said
he meditates 15 minutes every day.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, he said, interest in him and the party would
instantly increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if I lose, I won't lose in a key respect,'' he said.
``As long as we have reached the marketplace of ideas and the
Republicans and Democrats are scrambling to co-opt them, as they
always have, we've won. No question about it.''

   SEATTLE _ Alaska Airlines said Friday that it had canceled 48
flights in the past two days after grounding 17 of its 34 MD-80
aircraft for inspections. Those planes are the same model as the
one that crashed off the Southern California coast in January,
killing 88 people, when a part in the tail section malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska said it acted after finding that a measurement tool made
by the airline to monitor wear on the tail part had produced
inconsistent readings, meaning that it might have failed to detect
unacceptable wear in a control mechanism called a jackscrew. A
factor in the January crash is believed to have been problems with
the plane's jackscrew, which had been checked with a tool made by
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Alaska, Dave Marriott, said that as of late
Friday afternoon, the airline had checked all 17 of the grounded
planes with a measurement tool made by Boeing, the plane's
manufacturer, and had found the tail parts to be within acceptable
tolerances. The planes were returned to service by Friday evening,
Marriott said.
</P>
<P>
   The airline canceled 19 flights on Thursday night and 29 Friday,
and rebooked passengers on other flights or other airlines. Alaska,
based in Seattle, averages 500 flights a day and is a major carrier
between the Pacific Northwest and cities in California.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has 92 aircraft, 34 of which are MD-80s. Another
Alaska spokesman, Jack Evans, said half of the MD-80s had been
recently inspected using tools made by Boeing, and were not
grounded. The MD-80 maintenance manual says that motion in the
jackscrew should be measured using a tool made by the aircraft
manufacturer or an ``equivalent substitute.'' Alaska mechanics had
inspected several of the other MD-80s using a tool made in the
carrier's machine shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline found that the measurements could vary if the
carrier's tool was improperly positioned,'' Alaska said Friday in a
news release. The airline said it had notified the Federal Aviation
Administration and had begun ``reinspecting the jackscrews on the
affected aircraft using the tool made by the aircraft
manufacturer.'' The airline suggested there was uncertainty as to
whether its tool was considered an ``equivalent substitute.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the FAA, Diane Spitalieri, said that checks had
determined that other airlines were using a mix of tools, some
built by the McDonnell Douglas division of Boeing, and others made
by the airlines. Spitalieri said the agency had not found any tools
that produced inconsistent results, but more tools remained to be
checked.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing assumed production of the MD-80, which is a more recent
variant of the DC-9, after it took over McDonnell Douglas three
years ago in a $16.3 billion merger. There are roughly 2,000 MD-80s
and DC-9s in service around the world.

U.S. COURT VOIDS N.Y. STATE'S AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE KOSHER RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A ruling by a federal judge that New York state's
kosher food laws are unconstitutional highlights the intersection
of centuries-old biblical and rabbinical strictures with modern
state sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the laws, state inspectors would visit supermarkets to
ensure that kosher meat and dairy products were not mingled, would
step into the kitchens of kosher restaurants that serve meat to
make sure that vegetable dips did not contain cheese or other dairy
products, and would even stick their hands into the water used to
defeather chickens in poultry plants to determine whether it was
too hot to permit the birds' blood to fully drain.
</P>
<P>
   If the inspectors discovered forbidden activities the violators
could be fined or, in the case where intentional deception was
charged, could face criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in declaring the laws unconstitutional, Judge Nina
Gershon of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn held that they ``foster
excessive entanglements'' between religion and the state, in
violation of the First Amendment. The ruling came in a suit in
which the owners of a kosher butcher shop in Commack on Long Island
challenged the laws after being cited for numerous violations under
them.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Gov. George Pataki said he had directed the state's
Department of Agriculture and Markets, which enforces the laws, to
appeal Gershon's decision as well as to seek a stay of the decision
pending the outcome of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``These laws protect New Yorkers from consumer fraud,'' Pataki
said, adding that such protection was necessary to make sure that
``food represented as kosher'' really was.
</P>
<P>
   But in her ruling, Gershon said that the laws in question, first
written in the late 19th century, ``advance religion because they
require the state to affirmatively assume ongoing obligations of
enforcement of purely religious laws, inevitably requiring the
state to rely on religious authority and interpretation to properly
enforce them.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats had also argued
that in defining kosher food as ``prepared in accordance with
Orthodox Hebrew religious requirements'' the laws impermissibly
violated the rights of Jews who were not Orthodox and often had
different standards of kosher. The suit further claimed that the
laws were too vague because they failed to define ``orthodox Hebrew
religious requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say that a major deficiency of the state laws is
their failure to take into account varying views among Jews of what
kosher means in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
   One Conservative Jewish leader who said he thought Gershon had
made the right decision said that the differences were not only
between Orthodox and other Jews, but often within the Orthodox
branch itself.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why there are ``so many different rabbis who
certify what is kosher'' within that branch, said the Conservative
leader, Rabbi Jerome Epstein, executive vice president of the
United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, which represents nearly
800 congregations in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wiesenfeld, a former member of Pataki's staff who served as
his liaison on Jewish matters, contended Friday that the reason the
laws had run into trouble was that for a time in recent years they
were being improperly enforced under the ``higher level'' of kosher
``required by the Orthodox.''

TACOMA JOURNAL : AIR CLEANED, TECH HIGH, A CITY REBOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TACOMA, Wash. _ When EssentialMarkets.com was looking for a
place to establish headquarters a year and a half ago, executives
at the Internet start-up thought first of the better-known software
capitals of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down and the general feeling was, I guess we should
look in Seattle, or maybe Bellevue or Redmond,'' recalled David M.
Boitano, chief operating officer of the company, which helps
businesses sell their products online. ``But the more we talked
about Tacoma, the more we thought, Well, why not Tacoma? I mean,
we're an Internet company. We can be anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's decision to locate here is just one piece in the
much larger story of a renaissance for Tacoma, which long suffered
from image problems as a gritty mill town living very much in the
shadow of Seattle, its more glamorous sister 30 miles to the north.
For years the noxious fumes from pulp plants here were so powerful
that people in the region spoke of the ``Tacoma aroma.'' The city
even seemed a bit of an afterthought in the name of the region's
major point of entry, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   But, lured by office rents and housing prices roughly half
Seattle's, 100 high-technology companies have started up, relocated
or expanded in the downtown area in the last two years, according
to the city's Economic Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma's revival is evident not just in the new companies coming
here. The Tacoma Art Museum is expanding into a new building, and a
convention center three times the size of the existing one is
rising downtown. The famous smell is gone, a result of mill
closings and cleanups, and the air is much cleaner, yielding
spectacular views of Mount Rainier, the Olympic Mountains and Puget
Sound that rival those in Seattle. Traffic congestion, a major
complaint in Seattle and its high-tech suburbs to the east, is not
a big problem here in this city of 187,000 people _ not yet,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in Tacoma, you can still choose whether you want to
live in an urban, suburban or rural area, and it simply doesn't
take long to get around,'' said Eric Cederstrand, a developer here
who has built or renovated several downtown buildings that are now
home to high-tech companies. ``You can be out in the countryside in
half an hour. In Seattle these days, it can take you half an hour
to drive three blocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The revival can be traced in part to municipal officials'
decision a few years ago to invest $100 million to stretch
fiber-optic lines through much of the city, offering a high-speed
data network attractive to technology companies. Tacoma's is one of
the largest publicly owned telecommunications infrastructures in
the nation, prompting the city to market itself with the theme
``America's No. 1 Wired City.''
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma also has an impressive stock of turn-of-the-century and
Art Deco buildings that were largely in disrepair or even abandoned
in recent decades, lending a ghost-town air to parts of downtown.
Many of those are being renovated, offering the kind of ``fun,
creative space,'' in Cederstrand's description, that lots of
technology companies crave.
</P>
<P>
   One of his clients, Y3K Inc., a sort of Internet mall that helps
small businesses sell products over the World Wide Web, is taking a
floor and a half in a 1910 building downtown that has exposed brick
walls, high ceilings, sandblasted beams and impressive views.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cox, chief operating officer at Y3K, which will move from
another Tacoma location to the renovated building this fall, said
he discerned no problems in being a bit outside the Seattle-Redmond
orbit that is home to giants like the Microsoft Corp. and
Amazon.com, and to many lesser-known high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are advantages here,'' Cox said. ``In Seattle, I
think, there's a danger that a new company can feel lost in the
shuffle. The feeling is, Well, it's just another Internet company.
Here, it's a bigger deal. And there's a lot of support from the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Grenley, chief executive of IDmicro, a 25-employee
company based here that designs several kinds of wireless tracking
devices, also said he saw advantages to being a ``bigger fish in a
smaller pond.''
</P>
<P>
   Grenley, who grew up in the area, said he would have ``laughed
out loud'' if he had heard someone predict Tacoma's resurgence 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown was decayed, empty, bombed-out,'' he said. ``Parts of
it looked like Dresden or something. You were scared to be
downtown. And it physically smelled bad. Today it's completely
different. It's amazing what's happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Boitano, at EssentialMarkets, which is planning to grow from 105
employees &UR;  &LR; to 250 over the next eight months and is leasing new
office space downtown, said attracting people to the area was not a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put them in a car and drive them around,'' he said, ``show
them the mountains, the water, the quality of housing that's
available, the recreation. It's not a hard sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Juli Wilkerson, the city's director of economic development,
said there was plenty of talent available locally, noting that 22
percent of the work force from Tacoma and surrounding Pierce County
still commuted to jobs in the Seattle area. ``They would love to
avoid that commute if they could,'' Wilkerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan A. Wright, marketing director at IDmicro, moved from
Seattle in February with some trepidation, but was pleasantly
surprised. ``Now I'd say, Why put up with the hassle? Here I've got
a seven-minute commute. The views are great, there's a lot going
on, but Tacoma's still got a small-town feel to it, too. I'd take
this any day of the week.''

   DAINGERFIELD, Texas _ Drive around this exceptionally hot and
thirsty place in midsummer, when the mercury regularly tops 100 but
people still have to sell watermelons from their trucks and take
their places on the production lines at Lone Star Steel and get
their chores done along the plain-looking downtown streets, and you
begin to understand why it turned into prime territory for the
latest skirmish in the cola wars.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, in the state courthouse off Route 259, that lawyers
for nine bottlers and distributors of Royal Crown Cola squared off
this spring against the Coca-Cola Co. and its largest bottler,
Coca-Cola Enterprises. The trial took place six years after the
Royal Crown group sued Coke and its bottler.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contended that Coke, working with Coca-Cola
Enterprises, had tried unfairly since the early '90s to keep them
out of supermarkets and convenience stores. Coke, they said, had
exhorted store owners to sign increasingly restrictive marketing
agreements that benefited it at the expense of other brands. The
carrot for the store owners was the prospect of making money from
popular Coke products. The stick: the fear of having to pay higher
wholesale prices than the store down the road.
</P>
<P>
   One supermarket chain got a $2 million signing bonus from
Coca-Cola Enterprises, a publicly traded company of which Coke owns
40 percent. The chain promised, among other concessions, that Coke
products would usually be advertised exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, after a six-week trial that detailed the intense
competition along the front lines of the soft-drink business, the
jury found Coke and Coca-Cola Enterprises guilty of breaking Texas
antitrust laws through their demands for exclusive advertising,
displays, signs and vending machines. The Coke companies were
ordered to pay a total of $15.6 million, and plaintiffs' lawyers
want the judge to force Coca-Cola Enterprises to sell its Dr.
Pepper franchises _ a stiff penalty indeed.
</P>
<P>
   (PepsiCo and its local bottler had been named as co-defendants,
but they settled earlier this year under undisclosed terms.)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola, Polly Howes, called the verdict,
which Coke may appeal, ``incorrect.'' She added: ``I don't think
they presented a case that there was a lack of competition. There
was too much competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The case provides a vivid glimpse at the way Coke, already the
world's best-known brand, battles for an ever bigger slice of the
market. To keep growing, court documents show, it has developed a
variety of tactics intended to make sure that rival brands remain
all but invisible. Coke says the deals it makes with stores are
typical in the industry. Plaintiffs counter that they keep rivals
from having a fair shot. For consumers, it can mean limited
variety, and in some cases, higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in and around Daingerfield is repeated around the
country, other bottlers say. In Worcester, Mass., a pizza
restaurant is in the middle of a five-year contract that gives Coke
exclusive soft-drink rights in exchange for a discount on the
wholesale soda price. In Tucson, a 7Up bottler says he routinely
has trouble advertising his products through stores that have
signed marketing agreements that favor Coke.
</P>
<P>
   The Daingerfield case began small in 1992 with a complaint from
one Louisiana distributor, but by 1994, when the suit was filed, it
had widened to include Royal Crown dealers in Texas, Oklahoma and
Arkansas. The plaintiffs were people like Bruce Hackett, who left a
job with the local Coke bottler after nine years in 1994 to start
Hackett Beverages in Monticello, Ark. By 1997, he said, he had been
squeezed out of store after store.
</P>
<P>
   As Hackett drove around to check on his accounts, he would find
that his ice barrels _ which he had left near the cash register,
packed with ice and RC Colas to attract impulse buyers _ had been
turned upside down and left at the side of the road. In 1996, he
had 52 ice barrels throughout southern Arkansas; he now has two.
One after another, he said, store owners told him that he could not
put up signs advertising his drinks; the signs now sit in his
basement. Abig refrigerated case he bought for a store in Eudora,
Ark., and filled with Royal Crown products, traditionally priced
lower than Coke or Pepsi, vanished one day. When he asked the
manager about it, ``he told me Coke emptied it and took it around
to the back of the store,'' Hackett recalled. ``He told me to come
pick it up.'' A new marketing agreement with Coke had gone into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   What puzzled Hackett was that the actions appeared to contradict
the training that Coke had given him as an employee of the local
bottler, Ouachita Coca-Cola Bottling. ``When I worked at Coke, I
was told that you couldn't ask for exclusive anything,'' said
Hackett, whose sales at the Eudora store dwindled from 35 cases a
week to less than one a month. ``It was considered predatory. You
could ask for first position'' _ the display space closest to the
cash register, for example _ ``but you couldn't ask for the only
display in the store.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a consolidation drive that has made it the largest
Coke bottler in the world, Coca-Cola Enterprises, based in Atlanta,
acquired Ouachita in 1996. Now, Hackett said, ``I can be selling my
products for 39 cents, and there is no way for a customer walking
into the store to know that, because I am not allowed to put a sign
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Royal Crown, part of the Snapple unit of Triarc
Inc., say Coke demands preferential treatment in areas where its
bottlers also handle Dr Pepper. That can give the bottler 70
percent of the soft-drink market in many areas. Dr Pepper
concentrate is made by a unit of Cadbury Schweppes, but in many
areas, the drinks are packaged and distributed by a Coke bottler.
To level the playing field, the lawyers say, Coca-Cola Enterprises
must give up those franchise rights. In November, the Texas judge
will hold a hearing on the request, and Coke says it may file an
appeal after that.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing a bottler to give up a franchise is highly unusual, and
not what Cadbury wants. ``Our preference is to retain our Coca-Cola
bottling relationships in that part of the country,'' said John
Brock, Cadbury's chief operating officer. ``The Coca-Cola system
there is very strong and Dr Pepper does very well in that system.''
</P>
<P>
   The root of the Royal Crown case is the quest for profits in a
sluggish industry. Over all, domestic soft-drink sales grew just
0.5 percent last year, according to Beverage Digest/Maxwell, which
tracks the industry. But Coke has a perennial goal of 7 to 8
percent annual volume growth; last year, volume grew just 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Coca-Cola and its archrival, Pepsico, have suffered
declining margins for years in supermarkets, where soda prices had
changed little in a decade. Then, in the last year alone, Coke,
Pepsi and their bottlers increased supermarket prices by 5 percent,
which slowed sales.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, soft-drink companies have long enjoyed higher
profits from convenience stores and other places where consumers
make impulse buys and are usually willing to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   Convenience stores _ there are nearly 120,000 nationwide _
typically get about half their sales from beverages, according to
the National Association of Convenience Stores. Profits on single
bottles or cans average about 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One Coca-Cola Enterprises document introduced into evidence at
the trial indicated that Coke aimed to be the prime soft drink
available at convenience stores in Texas, Louisiana and beyond. In
1997, Coke started a program in northern Texas known as ``Operation
Red,'' with ``Red'' being short for ``Retail Execution to Drive
Volume.'' The objective, the document said, was to increase volume
and profit for store owners.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, a 1998 agreement with an Arkansas store
called Monster Mart gave Coke half the nonrefrigerated display
space, plus 75 percent of the refrigerated space. Coke also got
``the highest quality and the greatest number'' of items like ice
barrels and promotional signs, the document said. A year later,
Coke wanted, and received, 75 percent of nonrefrigerated display
space as well. If sales rose and all the requirements were met
during 1999, the store owner would get a bonus of at least 25 cents
a case, the document stated.
</P>
<P>
   Such deals, known as calendar marketing agreements, were
originally made between manufacturers and store owners to arrange
promotions, like advertising and special displays.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, bottlers say, marketing agreements
have grown unusually aggressive: Coke now insists on exclusive
rights to advertising, display space, cold-drink equipment and
sometimes even the signs that dangle from the ceiling. The pacts
are signed yearly with stores large and small, but the impact has
been most pronounced in convenience stores. Rebates to the store
owner range from pennies a case to as much as $2.
</P>
<P>
   One agreement, signed in 1998 between Coca-Cola Enterprises and
an Arkansas drugstore chain, USA Drug, specified truly exclusive
terms. Submitted as evidence in the trial, the document states:
``Coca-Cola products will occupy a minimum of 100 percent of total
soft-drink space.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Asman, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Enterprises, said the
company had done nothing unusual. ``We have always tried to conduct
our business operations with the highest integrity and compliance
with all laws and regulations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lower-priced competitors like Royal Crown say they are having
trouble getting the minimum shelf space they need. As bargain
brands are squeezed out, Coke's prices can rise _ as can those of
Pepsi and Dr Pepper. Where Coca-Cola Enterprises controls Dr
Pepper, marketing agreements seem more demanding, documents show.
At Nu-Way, a convenience store in Daingerfield, a 20-ounce bottle
of RC Cola is 69 cents, while 20-ounce bottles of Coke, Pepsi and
Dr Pepper are 92 cents. At EZ Mart, a short distance away, there is
no RC Cola _ and Coke, Pepsi and Dr Pepper each cost $1.09.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements cover supermarkets, too. The $2 million signing bonus
was paid to Brookshire's, a regional chain, testimony shows. And
when a Coca-Cola Enterprises employee, Scott Holloway, was asked by
a Royal Crown lawyer if the bonus was paid ``so that CCE could
promote the products the way CCE wanted to promote them,'' he
replied ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke's position is that exclusivity makes the most sense _ for
Coke, and for the retailer. ``We are spending a lot of money with
retailers on marketing,'' Howes said, ``and it doesn't make a whole
lot of sense to provide retailers with money to promote our
products if, when the consumer goes into the store, it doesn't look
like you are the featured product.'' She added: ``The research
we've done says it doesn't help the retailers' business either.
Promoting a whole bunch of soft drinks at the same time means you
are discounting the product to people who would have paid a higher
price if it wasn't on promotion. It sort of devalues the
category.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, a convenience-store owner from Atlanta, Texas,
testified that he was not pressured by Coke into signing a
marketing agreement. ``Nobody tells us how to run our operation,''
said the owner, Jim McClure. When asked on cross-examination what
he would do if competitors received lower wholesale prices from the
Coke bottler that allowed them to charge their customers less, he
replied that he would have to match those prices.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer asked him: ``And so you would have to make a choice of
either having higher prices and risk losing customers or cut your
prices and make little or no profit?''
</P>
<P>
   McClure responded, ``Those are the two choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say marketing agreements are getting too elaborate for
their own good. ``For the last decade, it has been intensifying in
supermarkets every year,'' said William Trebilcock, who retired as
vice chairman of Beverage America, a Michigan-based bottler bought
by Cadbury Schweppes in 1998. ``They have gone from a simple
agreement to a complex 15- or 20-page document, and from a 20-cent
rebate to a $1.50 or $2 rebate.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle is waged most intensely in the display cases of
convenience stores. ``Coke will take brands that represent a small
part of their portfolio, like Fruitopia and Pibb, and tell the
store owners, if you will give us a full door for them, we will pay
you a $4-per-case rebate, and if you want to get a 50-cent rebate
on Coke, you've got to take that program,'' Trebilcock said. The
introduction of the 20-ounce bottle in 1992 fueled such efforts, he
added, because store owners saw them as more profitable, for the
same effort, than 12-ounce cans.
</P>
<P>
   Coke rivals say they don't want to play by those rules. ``We
don't believe you should have to pay people to put your product in
the store,'' said Leslie Dudley, whose Har-Mar Beverages in Paris,
Texas, bottles RC Cola, 7Up, A &AMP; W, Snapple and other brands.
Har-Mar, with about $3 million a year in sales, was a plaintiff.
``Consumers should be able to choose what they want to drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke's payments to store owners fall under a broad category
called marketing support, which has grown substantially in recent
years. In 1997, Coke paid $604 million to Coca-Cola Enterprises for
marketing support. In 1998, the figure rose 49 percent, to $899
million. Last year, one of Coke's worst ever, it slipped to $767
million.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's annual reports provide no details about marketing
agreements. But, court documents show, some deals barred
supermarket chains from advertising non-Coke brands in newspapers
during certain weeks. Also, two of three vending machines outside
supermarkets and gas stations often had to be devoted to Coke,
which usually meant that Coke got the only machines, said Jeffrey
Angelovich, a Royal Crown lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In some convenience stores, the pacts dictated that products not
made by Coke, like RC Cola, could amount to only a couple of
bottles visible on bottom shelves, out of sight for all but the
most determined shoppers, witnesses said. To drive home how
difficult it would be to find soft drinks displayed that way,
Nelson W. Roach, a Royal Crown lawyer, questioned one witness while
on his hands and knees.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Coke's defense was that the stores themselves wanted the
marketing agreements. Experts say there is nothing inherently
illegal about the agreements, unless they interfere with fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hauled in retailers, and they hauled in retailers, and all
of them agreed that they had to be able to sell the No. 1 and No. 2
soft drinks at prices that were competitive,'' Roach said. ``And
the only way they could get these prices was to sign the
agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   George Kalil, a Tucson bottler of 7-Up, Dr Pepper, RC Cola and
other soft drinks, said: ``Is this Texas case the first time Coke
has been forced to look at what they are doing to this industry?
The reality is, what they are doing in this country is worse than
anything I've read about them doing in any other part of the world.
Some of their people at different levels have been applying
manipulative pressures that I believe are a violation of federal
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Kalil told of a deal known as a ``clean
agreement'' that Coca-Cola Enterprises made last year with grocery
stores in Phoenix. If the stores' weekly newspaper ads did not show
Kalil's brands when Coke ads were running, the bottler would give
the stores an extra 40 cents off each case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are occasions when the grocer has to bump us out because
he doesn't want to run ads for Pepsi, us and his store brand all in
the same week,'' Kalil said. ``They call it clean. Clean us out is
what they did.'' (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't consumers just shop elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana, as well as other parts of the
country where convenience stores are often separated by long
stretches of highway, ``the overwhelming majority of consumers
aren't going to do that,'' said Thomas Stanley, a Houston lawyer
who has been on the plaintiffs' side since the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to buy what's available,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A Federal Trade Commission study, released in December,
concluded that the acquisition of other soft-drink brands by the
big industry powers often resulted in higher prices and lower
volume, and that when concentrate companies controlled their
bottlers, prices were 4.3 percent lower. Still, ``further study of
these types of bottler acquisitions may be warranted,'' the study
added.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Texas case unfold, many people in the industry say
it is time for the government to take a closer look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the FTC felt that as long as the price of soda
was cheap, it didn't matter who was left.'' Kalil said. ``Now we
get into a situation where the margins are coming back,'' which
might spur the trade commission to act, he added. ``I just wish the
competition would get back to the basics of service, price and fair
play.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FTC said, ``We are not currently looking
into this issue, and have no plans to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke and its bottlers have faced similar allegations in other
parts of the world. In Italy, a government investigation found that
Coke had unfairly used its dominance to muscle out competitors. In
December, the government ordered Coke to pay $16 million. Coke's
efforts to buy the Cadbury Schweppes brands in most countries ran
afoul of regulators in Mexico, Australia and the European Union,
who said Coke would get too much market share.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft, has said
he wants the company to become a better corporate citizen, and play
by the ``house rules'' in all of the countries where it does
business.
</P>
<P>
   Selling more high-margin soft drinks is a cornerstone of Coke's
strategy worldwide. It is particularly intense in the United
States, considered a mature market where people already consume so
many soft drinks that it takes work to get them to guzzle more.
</P>
<P>
   Investing in equipment that dispenses ice-cold drinks, ranging
from refrigerators to vending machines to ice barrels, has been
crucial to Coke's efforts. The company has committed hundreds of
millions of dollars to buying such equipment over the last four
years, exhorting its bottlers to do the same and spending more to
support their efforts. This year in supermarkets, the company began
a ``Shop Refreshed'' program, installing hundreds of vending
machines and refrigerator cases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, according to Coke's annual report, the company paid
$120 million to Coca-Cola Enterprises to promote investment in
cold-drink equipment by the bottler. By last year, the amount had
almost tripled, to $338 million. In its own 1996 annual report,
Coca-Cola Enterprises said half of its $622 million
capital-expenditure budget would be used for ``the high-margin cold
drink, or immediate consumption, channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the company had focused its spending on this area
for the last three years, the report added: ``This investment has
contributed to our success in recent years by increasing our share
of this high-margin channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett sees it in starker terms. ``The guy with the biggest
checkbook is the one that wins,'' he said. ``Once they become the
only one in the stores, you'll pay whatever they want you to pay.
It will be $3 a can.''

 &HT;    Dragnet locates 1,015 high-level drug fugitives
 &HT;    By Monika Gonzalez Mesa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A police task force formed to corral ``the highest
level'' of drug organization fugitives has made 1,015 arrests,
including a Fort Pierce, Fla., man suspected in the slaying of a
government witness, federal authorities announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Marshals, working with state and local police
agencies, also seized more than $1 million in property in the
four-month effort to round up felons on the run, federal
authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,015 arrested internationally, 532 were wanted under
indictments linking them to the organized drug crime industry. And
119 were high-level drug dealers from Florida and the Caribbean who
had been indicted but never were arrested, and ones who had jumped
bail.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. marshals estimated the task force, dubbed Operation Sort 1,
arrested about 25 people in Palm Beach, Martin, St. Lucie,
Highlands, Indian River and Okeechobee counties.
</P>
<P>
   Edner St. Louis, 36, a suspected lieutenant in a Haitian crack
cocaine ring, was arrested April 5 in Fort Pierce on charges of
distributing crack cocaine, said U.S. Marshals Warrant Coordinator
Lou Vega. St. Louis also is a suspect in the shooting of two
government witnesses, but has not been charged with those crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Vega said the drug investigation of St. Louis began in 1994 when
the Florida Highway patrol stopped him in Indian River County.
There were three people in the car and 10 ounces of cocaine
obtained in Fort Pierce, Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Pierce police later informed the Drug Enforcement Agency
that they were investigating the May 1994 death of Brian Wright,
who had died after being shot multiple times at the house where the
men allegedly had been storing the drugs. Federal agents considered
Wright a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Another Fort Pierce man, Tim White, was shot five times but
survived, as did two bystanders who were injured, Vega said. The
triggermen in that shooting told investigators they were hired to
shoot Wright for stealing from a drug house.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Agency later indicted six people in the
drug ring for conspiracy to distribute crack, including St. Louis.
Several months later, in January 1999, Tim White, a witness in the
case was shot again and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Vega said that when St. Louis was arrested in April, he had
three knives by his bed, a Colt .357 in the oven, and a Haitian
passport and a driver license bearing his photo and a false name.
</P>
<P>
   The federal officials used the announcement to ask for more
money from Congress for similar operations.
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Armentrout, director of the U.S. Justice Department's
Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, said the seizures from
the arrests had added up to nearly twice as much as was spent to
conduct the roundup. Armentrout emphasized that the average cost of
each arrest was $623.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to show we need more money to go find them,''
Deputy U.S. Marshal John Amat said. ``Unfortunately, informants are
a major part of investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation also led to the May 5 capture of Felix Fermin, 36,
who U.S. Marshals said led a major Colombian heroin smuggling
organization operating in South Florida, New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   And it led to the arrest of Santiago Mendoza who was arrested in
May in connection with a first degree murder indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Elias, 37, had been wanted since DEA agents raided a
marijuana grow house in 1997. Deputy U.S. Marshals from the West
Palm Beach office arrested him in La Jolla, Calif., in April along
with former Palm Beach County residents Stanley Hough and uncle
Larry Hough, Vega said. Vega said their search for Elias also led
to the search of a home in Alpine, Calif., where deputies
discovered an elaborate indoor marijuana growing operation in a
detatched garage big enough for two motorhomes. The garage was
double-walled so that air-conditioned air shielded the building
from heat sensors used by police . It was capable of growing more
than $2.5 million in marijuana a year, Vega said, adding he saw
nearly 1,000 plants. The home had been bought for nearly $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Michael Salnick, who is defending Elias, said the
government is overstating their effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They happened to stumble upon Mr. Elias,'' Salnick said. ``Law
enforcement has made it much larger than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Salnick said Elias left Boca Raton before he was indicted and
wasn't trying to evade authorities. He also denied that Elias is a
high-level drug trafficker; a trial date is pending.

ANALYSIS: BUSH CREATES NEW SYNTHESIS TO APPEAL TO MODERATES  

</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ With his speech at the GOP convention Thursday,
Gov. George W. Bush created a synthesis new to Republican politics:
conservative policies described in ways that his campaign believes
swing voters will love.
</P>
<P>
   So his $1.3 trillion, 10-year tax cut _ more sweeping than
congressional Republicans ever tried _ became an effort to bring
``common sense and fairness to the tax code.'' His plan to divert
some Social Security payroll taxes to private investment accounts
amounts, he said, to giving ``American workers security and
independence that no politician can ever take away.''
</P>
<P>
   The language was positively Clintonian, but as many
conservatives were quick to note, Bush had not actually changed any
of the Republican Party's core principles _ from its opposition to
abortion, to its support for large tax cuts, to its backing of a
vast missile defense system, to its search for conservative Supreme
Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has packaged the traditional conservative positions with
completely new covering,'' said Marshall Wittmann, a policy analyst
at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group in
Washington. ``It's not necessarily a new Republicanism in quite the
way that Clinton was a new Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   This synthesis is central to Bush's effort to assemble a winning
coalition. The Bush campaign wants to hold its conservative base
through its policy proposals, and then pick up the moderate middle
through Bush's conciliatory language and willingness to speak about
issues that Democrats long dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the fall campaign is whether Bush can
convincingly keep up his balancing act as the Democrats try to home
in on the details of policy proposals and his record back in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bush describes a tax cut that helps people at the bottom
of the economic ladder, the Democrats see a tax cut that helps the
rich. While Bush promises to strengthen Social Security, the
Democrats say he could reduce retirement benefits. For all the time
Bush spent delivering policy addresses this spring, a number of his
proposals lack specifics.
</P>
<P>
   And for some, Bush's record does not always square with his
rhetoric. ``An informed voter is their worst nightmare,'' said
Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for presumed Democratic nominee Vice
President Al Gore, referring to the Bush campaign. The Democrats
have already begun a barrage of ads trying to challenge Bush's
commitment on issues like the environment.
</P>
<P>
   With the Democrats running against the high cost of prescription
drugs, Bush's aides say they are already debating whether the Texas
governor needs to draw up a plan to show how he would pay for
prescription drug coverage. In his nomination speech, Bush said he
would ``make prescription drugs available and affordable for every
senior who needs them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has never said how he would do that and has never devoted
a major address to the issue. He has spoken approvingly of one
bipartisan plan floated in Congress that would allow Medicare
recipients to choose a plan with a prescription drug benefit. And
when House Republicans passed their own prescription drug plan,
Bush avoided taking a position on it.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Social Security Thursday night in his speech at the
GOP convention accepting the nomination, Bush sought credit for his
willingness to take a stand on the issue. He promised that he would
strengthen the program ``for the greatest generation and
generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he has called for some portion of the Social Security
payroll tax to be diverted to individual investment accounts for
young workers, he has not said what percentage, and has been silent
on many related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not said whether he would raise the retirement age, or
specified how he would deal with the diminished payroll tax that
would come into Social Security if a portion were diverted into
individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The New Century Foundation, which characterizes itself as a
nonpartisan and nonprofit research foundation based in New York,
published a study _ disputed by the Bush campaign _ that has said a
plan like Bush's could result in retirement incomes 20 percent
lower than the levels projected under the current Social Security
system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tax cut can also be portrayed in different ways. Bush
focused on how he would help the people at the bottom of the
economic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``On principle, those in the greatest need should receive the
greatest help,'' he said Thursday night. ``So we will lower the
bottom rate from 15 percent to 10 percent and double the child tax
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contend, like all tax cuts that sweeping, Bush's plan
helps people at the top of the economic ladder the most. The Gore
campaign, in a statement, calls Bush ``compassionate for the rich
and conservative for everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case on Thursday night, Bush's language was designed to
keep conservatives from becoming alarmed over one area of policy
where he is directly breaking with his party's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One size does not fit all when it comes to educating our
children,'' Bush said, ``so local people should control local
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a version of one of his biggest applause lines on the
campaign trail _ his insistence that he does not want to be the
federal superintendent of education.
</P>
<P>
   But, he has proposed using federal funds as a lever to encourage
states to give standardized tests in reading and math to all
students in grades three through eight. Any state that refused
would lose 5 percent of its federal education money.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers seem to acknowledge that to some extent Bush is
using issues to create the impression that he is a bold leader. The
fact, they say, that Bush has been willing to take stands that
challenge the status quo makes voters think he is up to the job of
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues form a composite of the candidate that's bigger
than the issues themselves,'' said one senior adviser to Bush. ``We
have and want to be seen as confronting the hard issues, not
avoiding them, and doing so in ways that are innovative for a
Republican to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said that in recent focus
groups he had run, ``people did not feel that on the level of
issues there is a lot at stake in this election.'' He found that
the voters are focusing much more on the character of the
candidates and their moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, the Republicans are confident that Bush has
made conservatism attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that Al Gore can win this election,'' said Gov.
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. ``I think George Bush can lose it.''

GORE BELITTLES GOP CONVENTION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Smarting from the drubbing he took in his opponent's
convention speech, Democratic presidential hopeful Al Gore returned
to the campaign trail Friday to belittle the Republican National
Convention as a ``masquerade ball,'' with hosts that would return
the United States to recession and high deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that our opposition put on quite a show in
Philadelphia,'' Gore told about 3,400 cheering members of the
International Association of Firefighters. ``When it comes to
political pageantry, I've got to hand it to the other side. When it
comes to nice sounding slogans and sound bites, I'll give credit
where credit is due.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you and I know political positioning will never heal sick
children who don't have health care, or help senior citizens afford
the medicines they need,'' Gore said. ``If you ask me, the
Republican National Convention was kind of like a masquerade ball
for special interests, with a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent the last week vacationing on the coast of North
Carolina, following the tradition of laying low during the
opposition party's convention. But he used the Democrat stronghold
of Chicago to stage a downtown-marching, placard-waving,
high-fiving return to the fray.
</P>
<P>
   GOP nominee George W. Bush's acceptance speech Thursday before
the Republican National Convention painted the Clinton-Gore
administration as an embarrassment _ a failed partnership that
squandered its opportunity to lead. His attacks on Gore were his
sharpest and most personal to date, suggesting the vice president
was afraid to take risks and willing to retool himself to fit his
pollsters' image of what Americans want.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not need to take your pulse before I know my own mind,''
Bush said. ``I know my own mind. I do not reinvent myself at every
turn. I am not running in borrowed clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore described the GOP's televised embrace of traditionally
Democratic themes as an act _ albeit a clever one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind the balloons and bunting is a massive, budget busting,
tax giveaway primarily benefiting the wealthy in this country,''
Gore said. ``Behind the flashing video wall is an agenda of rising
gas prices and smog-filled skies that is of big oil, by big oil and
for big oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're for the powerful, we're for the people,'' Gore
repeated as punctuation to a litany of complaints against the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   A large share of Gore's message was aimed at debunking the GOP
convention message of a failed Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to get real,'' Gore said. ``I heard our opposition
in Philadelphia talking about the past eight years. They said it
was a time of lost opportunity, that we were just coasting, taking
the path of least resistance. I have to ask what planet have they
been on?''
</P>
<P>
   Citing GOP budget stalemates that shut down the government twice
and Republican opposition to campaign finance reform, Gore said,
``I wish there had been less resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   When they turned out a Republican administration in 1992, Gore
reminded his audience, they inherited a recession and large
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen in last eight years is leadership to stand
with American families,'' Gore said. ``Instead of the biggest
deficit, we have the biggest surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Countering the GOP message that the Clinton administration was
marred by moral failures, Tipper Gore introduced the vice president
as ``a man who continues to be a terrific husband. A man who's
always been there for every member of our family, and what that
says is he'll be there for your family.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore, too, sought to underscore a certain distance from
Clinton, mentioning his service as an Army correspondent in Vietnam
as a contrast to Clinton's efforts to avoid the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Vietnam, I didn't do the most, or suffer the
most danger,'' Gore said.``But I knew if I didn't go, someone else
from my hometown of Carthage would have to go in my place.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he ultimately decided he could no more turn away from
public service at home, ``than I could turn away from service in
Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also spoke to letter carriers in Chicago before flying back
to Washington for two fund-raising events. He will travel to upper
New York state today before heading to Tennessee, where he plans to
announce his running mate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign has leaked a short list of those potential running
mates, including Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, John Edwards of North Carolina and Evan
Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Rep. Richard Gephardt
of Missouri also are on the short list, though they have said they
do not want the job.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gore said there is a ``wild card'' on his short
list _ an individual he described to reporters Friday morning as
``an out-of-the-box possibility.'' &QL;

PLAN FOR TIMES SQUARE SINATRA STATUE GETS UNDER SKIN OF SOME
PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS to Hell's in 1st graf; DELETES ``curtains of neon-infused
mindless mush'' in 16th graf) 
By DEAN E. MURPHY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy got a spot in Times
Square in 1936 for his heroics on the battlefield and the streets
of Hell's Kitchen. George M. Cohan followed in 1959 as a tribute to
one of show business' greatest song and dance men.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says there is room for one more famous
bronze guy out there on the crossroads of the world. The mayor and
his office have taken a shine to Frank Sinatra, whose last big hit,
in 1980, was ``New York, New York.'' The late entertainer's
daughter, Nancy Sinatra, has found a sculptor and promises to come
up with the money. There is even talk of an interactive Sinatra,
who would croon on command.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nancy Sinatra is thrilled; this is her dream,'' said Charlotte
Cohen of the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, who has been
involved in the plans. ``Everyone would love to see it done
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hushed refrain playing around Times Square is not so
gushing or welcoming. Start spreading the news, it goes. Not Here,
Not Here.
</P>
<P>
   No one really wants to say so, at least not loudly enough to irk
Giuliani or offend the Sinatra family, but the plan to erect a
statue of Ol' Blue Eyes on a traffic island at 44th Street and
Broadway (across the street from the site off the old Paramount
Theater, where Sinatra made his first real splash in 1942) has
acquired some enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The local community board, along with some Times Square
developers, isn't crazy about the idea of a new tourist attraction
in a place where the sidewalks are already overwhelmed by crowds.
And the theater moguls say the square's 100-year-old theatrical
tradition would be shortchanged by showcasing a singer and film
actor who started in Hoboken, N.J., made a quick sensation at the
Paramount Theater and then followed fame and fortune west of the
Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone bristles at the thought of Giuliani as arbiter of
Broadway celebrity. The community board and other local groups have
written a letter to the mayor asking for a meeting. They hope, at
least, to get the statue moved to a less central location.
</P>
<P>
   `The real issue for a lot of us is, what is the association with
Broadway?'' said Michael Presser, executive director of Inside
Broadway, the theater industry's educational program with New York
City schools. ``We see an extremely popular artist and legend, a
man of great achievement, but we don't necessarily see someone who
has been closely associated with New York theater. We feel he is
due an honor, but we also question this particular spot in this
particular neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra fancied himself ``atop of the heap'' in the city that
doesn't sleep, but if the grumbling around Times Square is to be
believed, New Yorkers would like less Las Vegas and Hollywood in
their traffic-island idols. Times Square may be the center of the
universe, but it is also a stronghold of Midtown provincialism: On
the Great White Way, Sinatra, real or cast, is regarded as
decidedly off-Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office won't hear of it. Indeed, Anthony Carbonetti,
Giuliani's chief of staff, says they have not heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   Any opposition to Sinatra?
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't come up,'' Carbonetti replied.
</P>
<P>
   Does Sinatra deserve to be front and center in Times Square?
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think so,'' he said. ``But I am an
Italian-American who grew up listening to Frank Sinatra, and my
father would disown me if I said anything to the contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Sinatra insurrection is being staged largely in
whispers and behind closed doors is not entirely surprising.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, it is downright embarrassing for naysayers to
confess their misgivings in public. It is not easy to explain
objections to a 10-foot monument to one of America's greatest pop
singers, regardless of his New York pedigree. Times Square is
already home to a pro-wrestling restaurant and the retailer Toys
``R'' Us plans to build a 60-foot-tall indoor Ferris wheel across
the street.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem of City Hall and a mayor who, as one
Times Square community leader put it, is easy to make cranky.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Sinatra went directly to Giuliani with the statue proposal
shortly after her father died in Los Angeles in May 1998, city
officials said. Carbonetti said she had apparently made the
suggestion years earlier, but was encouraged to come back when her
father was no longer living. Statues in New York, unlike street
names in Sinatra's desert haunt of Palm Springs, Calif., are the
exclusive domain of the departed.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani loved the idea and, as he is sometimes inclined to do,
gave the seal of approval without consulting particularly far and
wide.
</P>
<P>
   Sinatra initiated a design competition last August, settling in
December on Neil Estern, an accomplished Brooklyn Heights sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinatra-Giuliani plan was cast in stone _ or more precisely,
bronze _ before most anyone around Times Square got wind of it.
Official notice to Times Square businesses came in January as a
fait accompli from the City Department of Transportation, which
owns the concrete swath of Broadway and Seventh Avenue that Sinatra
will share with the armed forces recruiting booth.
</P>
<P>
   A community meeting with city officials, and possibly Nancy
Sinatra, is in the making. The session was proposed in May by the
leaders of three of the area's most influential organizations:
Community Board 5, the Times Square Business Improvement District
and the Mayor's Midtown Citizens Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Giuliani, the three community groups stayed away
from questioning Sinatra's New York bona fides. Instead, they
raised fears that another attraction in Times Square, already the
human equivalent of an overrun ant hill, would lock up the last
piece of open space in the theater district.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the recruiting booth island doubles as Dick
Clark's stage on New Year's Eve, and it is also used to present
Broadway on Broadway and numerous other public events. It amounts
to little more than a Gotham-sized slice of concrete pizza, but
it's all Times Square has got.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily think any statue would be appropriate for
Times Square because we probably have enough going on,'' said David
Diamond, executive director of the Stage Directors and
Choreographers Foundation, who heads the community board's
committee on Times Square. ``But I don't want to discount the
possibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diamond's suggestion: Put Sinatra's statue in Hoboken and place
a plaque honoring him at 1501 Broadway, the former Paramount
Theater that is now a World Wrestling Federation restaurant. It was
there that thousands of screaming bobby-soxers _ 30,000 of them on
Oct. 12, 1944 _ turned Sinatra into solo music's greatest pop
sensation.
</P>
<P>
   And who should stand in for Sinatra on the recruiting booth
island?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be quoted on any name,'' Diamond said. ``I
don't want to leave anyone out and offend someone.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't they are all dead anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have estates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office says it has already solved the overcrowding
quandary by instructing Estern to come up with a design that would
allow Sinatra to be carted off for special occasions. The
Department of Transportation also has plans to restrict pedestrian
access to the island to keep fans from spilling into the street and
disrupting traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The city is still undecided about whether the statue should
sing, reserving judgment until the implications for traffic and
nearby office workers can be studied. Estern says no one has talked
to him about adapting his art into ``an elaborate juke box,'' as he
called it, but he is clearly not enamored with the suggestion.
Diamond and others who work in the area share his reluctance,
largely out of fear of overdosing on Sinatra's barreling baritone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to have a public debate, after all this is a
democracy,'' Presser said. ``This is a very public piece of land.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, director of the Percent for Art program in the Department
of Cultural Affairs, said the statue, as a privately financed
project, has not received the intense scrutiny required when public
money is expended. Nonetheless, she said, the statue must still be
reviewed by the City Art Commission for design approval and by the
Department of Transportation for traffic and safety considerations.
It is unclear, however, whether either agency will hold a public
hearing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it is something the mayor wants, then I think there
will be a statue,'' said a Midtown developer unwilling to speak if
he were named. ``Is there support? There is support, I guess,
official support.''
</P>
<P>
   Estern, an avid fan of Sinatra who regards the singer as the
perfect fit for Times Square, also thinks the resilient showman
will prevail. Look no further than Sinatra's own ode to the city,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere,'' Estern
recited. ``It's up to you _ New York, New York.''

 &HT;    The son also rises; both Earnhardts on a roll
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Dale Earnhardt was holding court in a room off
Gasoline Alley at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway when the door
opened and in walked Dale Jr. _ the one they call Little E.
</P>
<P>
   As his son joined him, Earnhardt leaned back from the microphone
and said quietly, ``So, you decided to take a little vacation?''
</P>
<P>
   Little E nodded sheepishly about his absence during the two-week
break since the last Winston Cup race: ``Yeah, I just forgot to
tell you. Went to Cancun.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt sized up the kid everyone says is a chip off the old
engine block and quickly focused on Little E's two-tone hairstyle.
Naturally dark and clipped close on the sides, it exploded into a
parted-down-the-middle top thatch that was bleached the blondest of
blondes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Cancun sun do that to your hair?'' Earnhardt smirked.
</P>
<P>
   Little E grinned: ``Nope . . . from a bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying hard to hide his own smile, Earnhardt got up, shook his
head and said, ``It's your turn. Enjoy yourself in here, but be
careful of these (media) guys.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 49-year-old Earnhardt _ who has worked so hard to
cultivate his image of The Intimidator, a no-nonsense enforcer who
dressed in black, drove a black car and wore a perpetual scowl
beneath his ever-present black shades _ peroxide progeny was a
little unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in their lives, Earnhardt and his 25-year-old
son are spending their weekends together. But instead of
arm-around-the-shoulders embrace, this bond has been built
bumper-to-bumper at 190 mph. Today, Little E will start the
Brickyard 400 on the outside of Row 3. His dad will start directly
behind him on the outside of Row 4.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt _ a come-to-life character from one of those rowdy
Hank Jr. songs _ is a certified legend in Winston Cup racing. He's
won 75 races _ including the Brickyard 400 in 1995 _ and seven
driving titles, a mark that ties him with stock car icon Richard
Petty. Little E _ a Winston Cup rookie who has the driving style of
his give-no-quarter dad and his NASCAR pioneering grandfather _ is
seen both as Winston Cup's future and a vibrant link to the sport's
past.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think this season is simply about passing the torch,
you better think again. ``If someone tells you I'm riding my years
out,'' Earnhardt spit, ``they're not payin' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Earnhardt won the Cracker Barrel 500 in Atlanta, has
15 top 10 finishes in 21 races and stands third in Winston Cup
points standings. Little E has won at Texas Motor Speedway,
Richmond and the non-points Winston all-star race at Charlotte and
is 14th in the points standings.
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers are bull-headed competitors and for the rest of us,
it's made for a family affair that's been fun to watch. While they
are father and son, they also are Felix and Oscar _ the Odd Couple.
</P>
<P>
   Little E wears baggy jeans that hang from his hips, boxy polo
shirts and shades propped atop his head. He's into music big time,
with a massive collection of CDs and stereos in every room of his
house. His tastes run from Pearl Jam to the Foo Fighters and he
financially backs his friends' band called Bridge. He's played the
drums with them on stage and written lyrics for one of their songs.
He also pens poetry about love and has said one day he might like
to be a disc jockey or a music critic.
</P>
<P>
   His dad _ don't call him Dale Sr., he hates that _ is into
Loretta Lynn and Brooks and Dunn. Not much for rhyme, he is, at
times, even more adverse to reason. He's made a career out of good
ol' boy crankiness, but that unyielding nature and honest grit have
made him endearing to blue collar dreamers fighting the bosses and
bureaucracy of life.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt earned his hard-edged stripes. He was the son of Ralph
Earnhardt, the hard-scrabble short track racer who was nicknamed
Ironheart for his undaunted approach _ right up to the day he died
of heart failure at age 45.
</P>
<P>
   Having quit school after the eighth grade to go racing,
Earnhardt struggled. By 17 he was married, had a son and ``probably
should've been on welfare.'' He'd race on the weekend, so he could
buy groceries on Monday. Soon after he was divorced and after that
allowed his ex-wife and her new husband to adopt his son, Kerry,
because, as he once told writer Ed Hinton, ``I couldn't afford to
make child support payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr. and daughter Kelly were the products of his second
marriage and soon after he was married a third time, to current
wife Teresa, who has given him a fourth child and with whom he has
forged a business empire _ Dale Earnhardt Inc. _ that a couple of
years ago had an estimated net worth of $20 million in annual
endorsements and souvenir sales.
</P>
<P>
   With the means came new methods, including sending Dale Jr. off
to military school during his teen years. After that, he gave him a
job changing oil at his massive race shop, now known as ``The
Garage Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   While Little E talks of earning his way, his dad is quick to add
a qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent my money until I was broke,'' Earnhardt said recently.
``I didn't have nothing. It's a little different for him. Things
are there for him. His team, his sponsors, things like that I
didn't have that when I started. He always says he had to work for
it. He worked for it in the driving department and the paying
attention department, but he hasn't had to WORK for it and get it
like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is _ and the Earnhardt fans who have embraced the son
as the Second Coming would be loathe to admit it _ Little E
probably has more in common with Jeff Gordon than his dad.
</P>
<P>
   He's another GenX driver who _ after proving himself in the
Busch Series, where he won two driving titles _ came into Winston
Cup with top equipment provided by his dad and a 5-year, $50
million sponsorship by Budweiser. Little E also got a built-in fan
base. Earnhardt followers hope he is the guy who will finally put
Gordon in his place and NASCAR brass prays that becomes the perfect
marque match-up for the future.
</P>
<P>
   As much as he grumbles, Earnhardt wants to take care ofr this
month at Michigan International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the kids get carte blanche. Earnhardt expects
them to drive to a standard and when Little E didn't hook up with
him to draft toward the front of the pack at this year's Daytona
500, Earnhardt pulled behind the kid and gave him a corrective
high-speed bump.
</P>
<P>
   When Little E crashed early this year in an IROC race _ the
series Earnhardt won Friday at IMS with a second place finish to
Mark Martin _ his dad minced no words afterward: ``It looked to me
like his plan was to run wide open 'til he hit something.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say that in private Earnhardt is relishing his son's
success and, at times, has literally gushed, but publicly _ as he
did again Friday _ he doesn't mind occasionally chiding his
namesake: ``He listens OK, but he's still a little hard-headed.
It's harder to give him advice since he's won a race and a couple
of titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Little E just laughed at such talk: ``Yeah, well he's no easier
to get along with either.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually that's not true and Little E should know it.
</P>
<P>
   When he was just six, his dad decided to teach him to water ski
by tying a rope to his pick-up truck and then driving along the
bank pulling his son. And the better the kid did, the more enthused
the old man got _ until he drove too fast on one run, yanked Little
E out of the water and straight into a boat house.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt shrugged off that story with a grin: ``Yeah, but he
learned how to ski.''

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND NATO FEAR MILOSEVIC MAY MOVE AGAINST
MONTENEGRO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is increasingly worried the
Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, will move militarily against
Montenegro, the junior republic in Yugoslavia, forcing Washington
and NATO into the awkward position of deciding how to react,
Clinton administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's possible use of his Yugoslav army troops and special
forces stationed in Montenegro to undermine Montenegro's president,
Milo Djukanovic, or even strike against him, was discussed at a
White House meeting this week and at NATO headquarters 10 days ago,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fears about Milosevic's intentions toward Montenegro have
become more acute since he unilaterally changed the constitution to
arrange presidential, parliamentary and local elections for Sept.
24.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, who for more than a year has forged a path in
opposition to Milosevic, has refused to take part in the elections
and has rebuffed pleas from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
to participate in them.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has called the elections in an effort to remain in
power for another eight years. Albright has been eager for
Djukanovic's Democratic Party of Socialists to participate in the
elections, partly to increase the chances of Milosevic's defeat and
partly to minimize the risk of Milosevic's using force. Montenegro
has been receiving American financial assistance for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   If Djukanovic refuses to participate _ and both he and the
United States have called the elections illegal _ then Milosevic
will be more tempted to move against him, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 soldiers of the Yugoslav army are based in
Montenegro, along with about 1,000 men of the seventh military
police battalion. Arrayed against these forces are 15,000
Montenegro police officers reportedly loyal to Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic put the Yugoslav army units on ``high alert'' last
month while he was changing the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a reminder of their ability to act with little or no
warning,'' a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as timing a move, the Yugoslav leader has several
options, all potentially embarrassing to the Clinton administration
during the fall presidential campaign. Some kind of military action
against Djukanovic after the Sept. 24 elections would be most
likely, administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   At the North Atlantic Council last week, Milosevic's designs on
Montenegro were discussed at length, a NATO official said. However,
none of the 19 alliance members had much enthusiasm for any sort of
action against Milosevic if he acted against Montenegro, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members said they saw few parallels between Montenegro
today and Kosovo last year. They could not cite a legal basis for
intervention, officials said, unlike NATO action on Kosovo, where
the humanitarian crisis was used as the rationale.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said Friday
that he would not speculate about what the Clinton administration
or NATO would do if Milosevic moved against Djukanovic in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support Djukanovic, we believe he has broad support in
NATO,'' Berger said, adding that ``it would be another mistake for
Milosevic'' to move against Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Berger stressed that he believed it was important for the
opposition parties in Serbia to run as effective a campaign as
possible against Milosevic. Then, if Milosevic stole the election,
the opposition would have a reason to mobilize street
demonstrations against him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remind you of Marcos, that was the beginning of the end,''
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Ferdinand Marcos, the authoritarian leader of the
Philippines, claimed victory in rigged elections and was eventually
toppled through street protests.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has tried to enlist the help of
Russia, which traditionally has close ties with Serbia, the main
republic in Yugoslavia, to dampen Milosevic's ambitions in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was
persuaded last month at the G-8 conference in Okinawa, Japan, to
sign a communique expressing concern about the legality of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the secretary-general of NATO, Lord Robertson, wrote
to Putin asking him to dissuade Milosevic from moving against
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Russians have not been cooperative. A NATO official
said Friday that the Russian ambassador to NATO, Sergei Kislyak,
told Lord Robertson that Putin's agreement to the communique in
Okinawa did not guarantee Russian support for it.

SPORTS COLUMN: A SWIMMER REMEMBERS DER FUEHRER

 (ATTN: Ill.)   By IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZION, Ill. _ There had been a commotion, Adolph Kiefer
remembers, and everyone stopped what he was doing and looked
around. There were German soldiers and an entourage surrounding
Adolf Hitler entering the training-pool area in the Olympic village
in Berlin. This was shortly before the start of the Games in 1936.
Kiefer recalls Hitler taking a seat at poolside and watching some
of the training session, and then the German fuehrer asked to meet
him and two other swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer, then 17, was already a record-holding backstroke
champion and a cover boy on many magazines. At 6 feet 1 inch, 175
pounds, he was strong and, with dark hair and blue eyes, handsome
enough to have later been asked to audition to play Tarzan in a
movie. But now Kiefer climbed out of the Olympic pool, soaking wet,
and shook hands with Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him being a small man with a small hand,'' Kiefer
said, ``and his handshake wasn't a firm one. Then he spoke to the
interpreter, and I was told he said something like, `This young man
is the perfect example of the true Aryan.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer wasn't sure, at that time, what Hitler was referring to.
After all, he was an American _ born and raised in Chicago. Yes,
his parents, Otto and Emma, had immigrated to the United States
from Germany some 20 years earlier, but there were no other ties to
their homeland, or its new theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I was honored to meet this important head of
state,'' Kiefer said. ``But if I knew then what I know now about
Hitler, I should have thrown him into the pool and drowned him. I
even can't stand the name Adolph now. But I'm stuck with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer continued to make a name for himself. He won the gold
medal in the 100-meter backstroke in the Berlin Games, setting the
Olympic record of 1 minute 5.9 seconds, though he didn't break his
own world record of 1:04.8. The Olympic record stood for 20 years
and the world record for 25. In his career, racing the backstroke
from 50 feet to 1,500 meters, Kiefer lost just two races in 2,000
meets from 1935 to 1944, setting 17 world records. Last January, he
was voted one of the 25 greatest male swimmers of the 20th century
by a panel for Swimming World Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Navy in World War II. When he learned that more
sailors died from drowning _ because they couldn't swim _ than from
enemy fire, he was allowed to implement new safety guidelines and a
training program to teach seamen how to stay alive in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer now sits about 40 miles north of Chicago in a crowded,
unpretentious office in the expansive setting of Adolph Kiefer &AMP;
Associates, an aquatic supply company that he founded in 1947 and
which bears the motto: ``We supply everything but the water.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 82 years old, bespectacled, broad-chested, the father of
four and the grandfather of 14. Though he still swims every day in
the pool in his home, he uses a walker since a nerve affliction
several years ago left his feet with no feeling. He remains
committed to the Olympic ideal, he said, though he laments the
``politics, the profiteering, the professionalism'' that much of it
has turned into.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought things began to change from amateurism to something
else in Berlin, which was called the first `big' Olympics,'' he
said. ``It was Hitler trying to show through sports that his nation
could create a superior athlete, a superior being. And from this
tried to show the world how mighty his nation was. It was
appalling. Then the Russians and East Europeans followed to take
the Olympics to another level of professionalism. And it became a
race to see which country wins the most medals, which ones break
the most records.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on a '90s development, he added: ``I didn't even like
those Dream Team basketball players we had. They lived separately
from the Olympic Village, rode around with chauffeurs. The Olympics
should be athletes from different countries getting to know each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiefer has often attended the Summer Olympic Games. But it's
getting harder for him to get around, and he won't be in Sydney,
Australia, for the 2000 Games. ``I still enjoy the athletic
performances,'' he said, ``but I think the Olympics movement has
lost its way. There has to be a way to return to a purer form of
amateurism, to sports for the sake of promoting fitness and health
_ not just money.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, is it not odd that so rich a life was built on
swimming upside down and without looking where you're going? ``Not
really,'' Kiefer said. ``It began when I was a kid. I didn't like
to get water up my nose.'' &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ Surrounded by three generations of the royal family,
Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother celebrated her 100th birthday
Friday, waving to cheering well-wishers from the Buckingham Palace
balcony where she had marked the end of World War II and helped
lead national rejoicing on other occasions.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 people thronged the Mall as she rode by in a
horse-drawn carriage garlanded with flowers in the gold and blue
colors of her stable. Clutching small Union Jacks, many of them
took up vantage points on the pedestal of the Victoria Memorial,
which honors the woman who was queen on Aug. 4, 1900, when
Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was born in Glamis Castle in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandson, Charles, the Prince of Wales, 51, sat by her side
as the coach entered the palace grounds to the sound of a 41-gun
salute and the strains of ``God Save the Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later the band of the Coldstream Guards struck up
``Happy Birthday to You,'' and she emerged from the darkness of the
curtained doorway onto the sunny balcony hung with gold and
burgundy draping with her daughters Queen Elizabeth II, 74, and
Princess Margaret, 69, and 25 other members of her immediate
family, including her two great-grandsons, Princes William, 18, and
Harry, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Her day had begun with the arrival of a royal postman at her
Clarence House residence just off the Mall, bearing a ceremonial
card that the queen daily sends to her subjects who are turning
100. One of 12 such cards delivered across the country Friday, the
queen mother's was the only one to carry a personal greeting and to
be signed not with the formal ``Elizabeth R'' but with ``Lilibet,''
the queen's family name since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities capped weeks of commemorations that have
included full-dress parades, Royal Air Force flyovers and ``God
Bless You Ma'am'' tabloid headlines. Editorials have credited her
with saving the monarchy from perils ranging from the abdication of
her brother-in-law Edward VIII in 1936 to the bombing of Buckingham
Palace during World War II to the dysfunctional family behavior of
modern-day Windsors.
</P>
<P>
   Her first duty as queen was taming the stammering rages of her
husband, the newly crowned King George VI, and it set the tone for
her job ever since _ steadying the pulse of the crisis-prone royal
family.
</P>
<P>
   She is generally regarded as the most popular royal, and it is
difficult to imagine the image-makers who have been hard at work
combating the declining popularity of the other family members
spinning any better presentation of the queen mother than the one
she herself created over 75 years of being in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   There is no more endearing sight to tradition-minded Britons
than her tilted head, ready smile and girlish waves. She is seen as
a favorite grandmother, surrounded by her pet corgis, open and
approachable, with a love of the blustery British outdoors, a
knowing eye for the daily racing form and a famous fancy for gin
and mischievous chatter.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in high style in Clarence House with a staff of 50,
and while her spending habits have provoked some grousing, they
have continued unchecked. ``Who would want to be the Coutts bank
manager who forecloses on a centenarian national institution?''
explained Andrew Roberts, an author of political histories.
</P>
<P>
   While she never gave interviews or otherwise let the outside
world into her life, she became a figure the public embraced,
particularly during the blitz when she visited London's East End to
observe the damage for herself and to try to lift the spirits of
besieged Londoners. In an oft-cited comment, she inspected the
debris of some Buckingham Palace buildings that had been hit by
Nazi planes and said: ``I'm glad we have been bombed. It makes me
feel I can look the East End in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The king and queen became symbols of the resistance, she
negotiating the rubble in high heels and pearls, and he dauntingly
military in his navy officer's uniform. She proclaimed the family's
intention to ride out the war in Britain, and she let the palace
information minister put out word that she was practicing shooting
a revolver. Today she remains a living link to a time that is
legendary in British history.
</P>
<P>
   George VI died of lung cancer in 1952 at age 56, and Elizabeth,
then 51, had to adjust to becoming the mother of a monarch rather
than the wife of one. A steely traditionalist, she forcefully moved
to end the love affair between Princess Margaret and Group Capt.
Peter Townsend, a palace equerry who was in the process of divorce.
More recently, she sided with Charles in his marital dispute with
Princess Diana. Diana retaliated for the queen mother's disdain by
telling a biographer that she was ``the chief leper in the leper
colony.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth was born to wealth and privilege, daughter of the 14th
Earl of Strathmore, and the medieval family castle in Scotland was
the setting for much of Macbeth. She was married in 1923 to Albert,
known as ``Bertie,'' and the couple became the Duke and Duchess of
York. His older brother David was the heir to the throne and would
become the future Edward VIII. Though the brothers lived strikingly
different lives _ one at home with his wife and two daughters, the
other out on the town in silken evening wear _ they were close
friends until the arrival of Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee
who was to cause the soon-to-be King Edward to abdicate 11 months
into his reign in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth was never to forgive Wallis Simpson, years later
frostily referring to her as ``the lowest of the low,'' and
insisting that she and her husband, by then the Duke of Windsor,
spend the rest of their lives in exile. But her primary
preoccupation was restoring the good name of the monarchy and
shoring up her husband after he became king, helping him overcome
his crippling stutter and gain the confidence to make public
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The queen mother is credited with trying to associate the royal
family with the common British family, laying the foundation for
the current effort to make the monarchy less remote and more
personable. She was the first royal to stroll up to crowd barriers
and greet the public in what has now become the common practice
called ``walkabout.''
</P>
<P>
   She moved gingerly through Friday's ceremonies, helping herself
along with two walking sticks, beaming her signature smile and
continually waving at the festive crowds.
</P>
<P>
   As at so many occasions involving British royalty, many of the
most enthusiastic celebrators Friday were Americans. One of them,
Connie Missinger, 47, a librarian from St. Louis, said: ``I came
here especially for the birthday. I came here last year and had
such a wonderful time that I thought I would love to come again.
She is a very special person.''

LEARNING THE HARD WAY TO OBEY SNAKE ALERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nathan A. Schomber probably learned a lesson at a wilderness
park last month, when he picked up a rattlesnake and was bitten.
And a further lesson when he had an allergic reaction to the
antivenin and spent several days in an intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Park Service is driving the lesson home: It is
fining Schomber $50 for picking up the snake to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Schomber, 26, who is from Alloway in southern New Jersey, picked
up the snake on July 18 in the Delaware Water Gap National
Recreation Area, even though signs and park officials warn visitors
not to.
</P>
<P>
   He was attending the Appalachian Mountain Club wilderness
awareness school, and had taught wilderness classes himself,
officials say he told them. But after finding the four-foot-long
timber rattlesnake, which is on the endangered species list, he
picked it up with his bare hands, showed it to others in his group
and played with it for almost an hour, officials said. As he
released it, it bit him on a finger of his left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Schomber was taken to a hospital and was given the antivenin
meant to combat the snake's poison, but he turned out to be
allergic to it and wound up critically ill.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials investigated the incident and waited until
Schomber recovered before taking action. Wayne Valentine, New
Jersey district ranger at the park, sent Schomber a letter this
week informing him that he was being fined $50 for violating rules
prohibiting ``feeding, touching, teasing, frightening or
intentionally disturbing'' the wildlife at the 70,000-acre park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say that Nathan got his just rewards,''
Valentine said, adding that visitors to the camp were informed in
signs and brochures that such snakes were dangerous and should not
be handled and that they would more than likely slither back into
the brush if they came in contact with a human being, unless they
felt threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk with this snake didn't come until they fiddled and
fooled with it,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Schomber could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The rules against disturbing the wildlife, Valentine said, are
meant to protect both the animals and visitors. He said the maximum
fine was $5,000 or six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people might say, `Well, why are you bothering this poor
fellow after he's already been in the hospital?''' Valentine said,
adding that the fine could have been a great deal more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went with the bare minimum,'' Valentine said. ``There was no
way I was going to ignore it with all the public education we've
done about why you don't disturb these snakes. He was creating a
hazard for others. What happens if somebody else had been bitten
and succumbed to the venom and died? I'm sure we'd be dealing with
a lot of litigation by now.''

EDITORIAL: RAW DEAL FOR DOCTORS IN POOR AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 5: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The federal program that pays doctors saddled with huge student
loans a bonus to practice in poor rural and urban areas needs a
major redesign or millions more dollars. What Congress should not
tolerate is a repeat of this year, when more than 90 percent of the
doctors who joined understaffed clinics were told in midyear,
without warning, that the program had run out of money and that
they would receive nothing beyond their meager salaries. The
administrative blunder threatens to undermine the worthy program by
driving away future applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Last year 771 doctors took new positions in underserved areas
and applied for a federal bonus of up to $50,000 to repay student
loans. The program awarded 469 bonuses to new applicants at a cost
of about $37 million. But this year the authorities changed the
rules and awarded bonuses to only 48 new applicants, less than 10
percent of the 715 new applicants. The decision traps hundreds of
doctors who would otherwise have received a bonus in lower-paying
jobs they cannot afford to keep. Many of these doctors rejected
higher-paying positions in the expectation, based on recent
experience, that the government would help them pay off their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration did not crack down out of malice or
callousness. But neither was it adroit in handling the program's
financial problems. Without notice, the authorities shifted $7
million out of the bonus program into a program that provides
scholarships to medical students who agree to practice in medically
underserved areas after they graduate. The shift was made because
the administration had allowed spending on the scholarships to fall
below Congressionally mandated levels. Then the administration
decided to spend the shrunken pool of bonus money in a way that
gave priority to doctors who started work at approved clinics last
year rather than the doctors who started this year. These two
decisions explain the fall from 469 new bonuses last year to 48
this year.
</P>
<P>
   A program that rejects 93 percent of its applicants will not
draw many applicants in the future. Congress could address the
problem by spending an extra $7 million or more. The money would be
well spent because the approved clinics are woefully understaffed.
The administration also plans to switch its priority to new
applicants, making this year's losers permanent. But the
administration might also fix the core problem. It should be
possible for doctors to learn before they pick up and move to a
clinic whether they will in fact receive a bonus to repay their
loans. The certainty would not only make the program fairer to the
doctors, but also attract more high-quality applicants. &QL;

FRED W. HOOPER, 102, OWNER AND BREEDER IN THOROUGHBRED RACING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., Ala.)   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred W. Hooper, who became one of the giants of horse racing
after he won the Kentucky Derby in 1945 with his first
thoroughbred, Hoop Jr., died Friday in Ocala, Fla. He was 102 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   In a half-century as an owner and a breeder, Hooper bred or
raced the winners of more than 100 stakes. In 1992 he won the Award
of Merit, the highest honor in the thoroughbred business. He was 95
years old at the time, the master of the 1,100-acre Circle H farm
in Ocala and still a tall, somewhat stooped but imposing figure at
the races, nearly 50 years after he spotted Hoop Jr. in the auction
ring in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of rags-to-riches success, it would be difficult
to surpass the story of Fred William Hooper. He was born on Oct. 6,
1897, on a farm in Georgia. He quit school in the eighth grade, he
raised cotton, he broke horses, he even went to barber school and
cut hair for a living. He worked as a schoolteacher, a carpenter, a
riveter, a prizefighter by night and a potato farmer by day. And
after a blight ruined his potato crop, he borrowed money to get a
job building a road, and became rich.
</P>
<P>
   By 1937, when he moved his base of operations to Montgomery,
Ala., he was the head of Hooper Construction Co. and was one of the
major contractors in the Southeast. He built roads, oceanfront
highways, dams and bridges, and he moved three million cubic yards
of dirt in five months to build the Jacksonville airport in
Florida. Later, he looked back on his building days and said, ``I'm
sure we moved more dirt by truck per day than has ever been moved
in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   But his greatest success came with racehorses after he bought
5,000 acres near Montgomery and started breeding champion Hereford
cattle and eventually horses. His star was a half-bred named Royal
Prince, who raced for eight years at half-mile tracks in
Jacksonville; Orlando, Fla.; St. Augustine, Fla.; Savannah, Ga.;
and other cities in the South, winning 49 of 55 starts, often in
match races, sometimes twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as the game grew,'' Hooper remembered in an interview
several years ago, ``the pots became smaller. Each owner would put
up his own money, there were all kinds of side bets and competition
was furnished by farmers and cattle people who'd bring in horses
they thought could run. In the old days, you rarely saw a
thoroughbred at the fairs. But trying to beat Royal Prince got them
to buying better horses, and it wasn't long before they all became
interested in thoroughbreds.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Fred Hooper, who decided to do something about it in the
summer of 1943. He went to Kentucky to attend the yearling sales at
Keeneland in Lexington, although he later observed, ``I didn't know
a soul in Kentucky, and they didn't know me.'' But he did know
bloodlines, and he bought three yearlings at auction, including a
colt sired by Sir Gallahad III. The colt cost $10,000 and was
promptly named Hoop Jr. for Hooper's young son, Fred Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the way he looked, the way he walked, everything,''
Hooper recalled. ``And I said, `I'm going to own you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Hoop Jr., trained by Ivan Parke and ridden by
Eddie Arcaro, outran 15 colts to win the Kentucky Derby. Two weeks
later, he got pinched along the rail on the first turn in the
Preakness and finished second. He also suffered a bowed tendon in a
leg that day and, in the twisting fortunes of the horse business,
never raced again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best racehorse I ever owned,'' Hooper said. ``He
could run as far as races are laid out and as fast as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite filly, Susan's Girl, won 29 of her 63 starts and
$1.2 million in purses, and also won the Eclipse Award as the filly
champion of 1972, 1973 and 1975. His great colt Precisionist won
the 1984 Swaps Stakes, the 1985 Breeders' Cup Sprint and the 1986
Woodward, and was voted the champion sprinter of 1985. He earned
more than $3.4 million. And Hooper's star juvenile Copelan won the
Sanford, the Hopeful, the Futurity and the Champagne in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper was one of the founders of the Thoroughbred Owners and
Breeders Association and one of its first presidents. And he was
one of the first horsemen to import jockeys from Latin America,
notably Braulio Baeza, Jorge Valasquez and Laffit Pincay Jr., all
of whom were later elected to the Racing Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 he turned 100 with fanfare when he was honored with
three parties that drew racing friends from all over the country
and a telephoned greeting from President Clinton. He was a 6-footer
who stooped under a nagging back, a dapper man somewhat limited in
his ability to walk but helped by a cane or a walker or, when he
visited racetracks, a wheelchair. He was alert and lucid, as he
peered back into the deep past with clarity and wit.
</P>
<P>
   How does a man who has lived a century explain it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work,'' he replied. ``And always look ahead. Don't look
back.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Wanda, a onetime airline attendant who was his
constant companion for three decades, remembered that he had once
suffered a broken neck in a car crash but survived after nine
months in the hospital. She also remembered that he played
excellent golf into his 80s despite many other injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like the cat,'' she said. ``He's got nine lives. And he's
always planning ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hooper still walked to his box at Gulfstream Park
racetrack in Florida with the aid of a walker as recently as last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Hooper is survived by three daughters:
Kay Wheeler of Ormond Beach, Fla.; Robin Phillips of Richmond, Va.;
and Betty Green of Montgomery, Ala. He lost his only son less than
two weeks ago when Fred Jr. died on July 23 at the age of 61.
</P>
<P>
   In his later years Hooper was troubled by the murky future that
he envisioned for thoroughbred racing, although he lived in the
heart of the Florida horse country in Ocala, where his neighbors
included George Steinbrenner of the Yankees and Charlotte Weber of
Live Oak Stud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the future of racing,'' he said. ``There's
too much off-track betting. They used to get big crowds at Belmont
Park; now, they get a few thousand. Racing has turned into a
numbers game: trifecta and other exotic bets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they've got to do,'' Fred Hooper said, with all the
assurance of a man who has lived a full century, ``is educate
people to the beauty of racing.''

HOT SPARKS IN PHOENIX
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sparks can win at least a share of the Western Conference
title today when they play Phoenix at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first for the Sparks, who already have set a
number of franchise records this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (26-3) set a league record with 10 consecutive road
wins after holding off the Detroit Shock on Wednesday, narrowly
escaping with an 84-81 victory. L.A. has won 10 games in a row
overall, two short of their previous franchise high before a loss
to Portland last month.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks center Lisa Leslie, a leading candidate for league most
valuable player along with Houston's Sheryl Swoopes, had 27 points
against the Shock before fouling out with a minute to play. She is
leading the team with 17.8 points and 9.4 rebounds. Tamecka Dixon
had 17 points. The Sparks won despite being outrebounded 38-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks begin the playoffs on the road Friday and might again
play the Mercury (19-10), which is jostling with Sacramento for the
third and fourth Western Conference berths. The Sparks will host
the next two playoff games at the Forum on Aug. 13 and Aug. 15, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury is coming off a hot shooting night. They set a
league record Thursday with a 63.6 percent field-goal effort in
their 85-63 victory over the Seattle Storm. Phoenix got balanced
scoring from Jennifer Gillom (14 points) and Brandy Reed (11
points).
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks have beaten the Mercury in the previous meetings
between the teams, 76-57 in Los Angeles and 74-68 in Phoenix. &QL;

TO SOME SHE'S A GIVER, TO OTHERS A THIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fidela Caparas, 54, was driven to generosity. She was
the head bookkeeper for a Manhattan magazine publisher, and she
managed to wire millions to her native land, the Philippines, to
help hospitals, churches and others in need. But prosecutors say
she was most generous to herself, using phony paychecks to steal
over $10 million from her employer.
</P>
<P>
   Caparas worked 30 years for Harris Publications, a publisher of
magazines on hunting and weaponry. At some point, she began to
write herself a few company checks, a habit that escalated in
recent years, according to Manhattan prosecutors and Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Since she stopped collecting paychecks in April, when she was
fired, her luck has gone steadily downhill. She was indicted in May
for grand larceny, and she is being held on Rikers Island without
bail.
</P>
<P>
   And worse, while she is a beloved figure in her hometown of
Cavitenos, prosecutors contend that her generosity was simply a
quick way to dispose of ill-gotten gain.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a Manhattan judge refused to reconsider her bail
application, even though she surrendered her U.S. passport and
argued that despite a ``palatial home'' that prosecutors say she is
building in the Philippines, her ties are now here. She denies the
charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   Her bail was initially set at $750,000 after her arrest in May.
But the judge withdrew the bail offer after prosecutors said that
she had a Philippine passport that she had failed to mention, and
that she might have stolen $9 million more than they had originally
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Caparas' lawyer, Stephen Zissou, said that prosecutors had
grossly exaggerated the amount of money she gave away. He argued
that the court had been unfair in its refusal to release her on
bail, pointing out that she had been charged with a nonviolent
offense and had no prior criminal record. And as for the contention
that Caparas was a flight risk because she had ties to a foreign
country, he said, ``Like 180 million Americans do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hers was an immigrant success story. With only a college degree
in commerce from Far Eastern University in Manila, she made her way
to New Jersey, became a citizen and worked her way up in classic
fashion, her two sons attending college here.
</P>
<P>
   By 1970 she had joined Harris Publications. There she eventually
oversaw the payroll and expenses for all employees. She earned
$150,000 a year and was soon dabbling in philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fair to say that she has engaged in substantial
philanthropic endeavors,'' said her lawyer, Zissou.
</P>
<P>
   But according to prosecutors, a preliminary audit found that she
had inserted her name on the payee line of more than 50 checks that
ranged from $15,000 to $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   She spent the money on cars, antiques and expensive homes in New
Jersey, California and Florida, as well as real estate in the
Philippines, prosecutors said. She also used it for an
entertainment and production company that she headed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   When her employer confronted her, she admitted to stealing
$800,000, prosecutors said. But the day after she was arrested,
they said, she diverted $120,000 from her bank account through wire
transfers to relatives in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI helped assess the damage to Harris, and the first
estimate that $800,000 had been stolen was soon revised.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Llambelis, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan,
told a judge that bank records that had been subpoenaed ``reveal
that the amount of theft is far, far greater than was previously
estimated.''

   Harris executives could not be reached for comment, but
prosecutors said it was very unlikely that the company could
recover its money. Llambelis told a judge: ``She knows what she
stole. She knows where she's hidden it.''

   Some 100 community members wrote letters to the judge, pleading
for leniency. Most cited Caparas' outstanding generosity.

   Her son Jeremy Jason Caparas wrote: ``One time, she even rented
out a whole church and hall on Christmas for the mentally disabled

and made them feel loved. No matter the cost, she was there for
anyone.''

   Three stand out in Winston race
</P>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It is down to the stretch run now, which may be
the toughest 16 weeks in auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Winston Cup drivers will race in 15 events across 14
states, from Loudon, N.H., to Miami, from Watkins Glen, N.Y., to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   It is a grueling schedule that includes races on 12 consecutive
weekends, starting today with the prestigious and lucrative
Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   Seven drivers are within 300 points of front-runner Bobby
Labonte, but realistically, it is a three-man battle for the 2000
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, seeking his first Winston Cup title, is trying to hold
off two veteran drivers who know what it takes to win a
championship _ Dale Jarrett and Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett is the defending champion, and Earnhardt hopes to become
the first man to win eight titles. That would be enough to
intimidate any driver, but Labonte believes he is up to the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of racing to do, but we're happy where we are,''
Labonte said. ``We've been leading the points for a long time, but
I have two fierce competitors right behind me. We just have to keep
plugging along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about the points situation. The only time I
really think about it is when people bring it up to me. We have
some races coming up that have been good for us, so we're looking
forward with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has won at five of the tracks remaining on the schedule,
including four last year _ Michigan, Dover, Talladega and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis is one of the places where he hasn't won, but
Labonte has been painfully close the last three years. He was
second in 1997 and 1999 and third in 1998 at the Brickyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had great runs here, but we just can't seem to break
through and win it,'' Labonte said. ``We ran up front with the
leaders, but when it came down to the late stages of the race, we
weren't the best car on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could look at it two ways. I could be discouraged that we
haven't won and find things to blame it on, or I can be optimistic
that we've been very good here in the past. I choose to be
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is only 53 points ahead of Jarrett, who has moved up
four positions in the standings in the last seven races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some problems early getting adjusted to the new
Goodyear tires,'' Jarrett said. ``But we gradually have started to
figure things out and have put ourselves in position to battle
Bobby and Dale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about our chances. We're not going to be
conservative. That's not the way to catch up. We've learned a lot,
but we are going to have to win a couple of races to get to the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Indy would be a likely place to start, since Jarrett is a
two-time winner of the Brickyard 400. He also was third in 1995 and
'97 and was leading the race in 1998 when his crew miscalculated on
fuel, and he had to coast into the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a track where you need a lot of horsepower, and that's
why the Robert Yates teams have done well here,'' Jarrett said.
``But you have to be able to get through the corners to utilize
that horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always test here because we work very hard to get our cars
to go through the corners as fast as we can to use the two long
straightaways. That's the key to this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt knows that as well as anyone. He won the event in
1995, when he finished second to Jeff Gordon in the Winston Cup
championship. This is the closest Earnhardt has been to a title
since that season. He is only 107 points behind Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep chipping away at them,'' Earnhardt said.
``We have the team to race for it. I'm 49, but I'm healthier than
I've been in years. If someone tells you I'm just riding out my
time, they aren't paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has been paying attention all season to Earnhardt's
resurgence in the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as feisty as ever,'' Jarrett said. ``Obviously, Dale has
a lot more experience at this stuff than Bobby or myself.''
</P>
<P>
   All three contenders will be starting close to the front today.
Jarrett will start fifth in the No. 88 Quality Care Ford, and
Earnhardt will start eighth _ directly behind his son, Dale
Earnhardt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough track, and you have to know your way around,''
the elder Earnhardt said. ``But (starting position) really doesn't
matter to me that much because I know I have a great race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte will start on the inside of row 2 in the No. 18
Interstate Batteries Pontiac, which he hopes is a sign of good
things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best starting spot we've had here,'' Labonte said.
``Maybe that's an omen. Maybe luck is on our side this time.''

DOROTHY WALKER BEGAN A FAMILY RACING LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Walker name is tied closely to auto racing
history in Los Angeles. A.J. Walker gained fame by helping Troy
Ruttman on his road to winning the Indianapolis 500 in 1952. On the
way, Walker helped Ruttman win a handful of Midget class races at
the old Gilmore Stadium in 1948 and 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's great-grandsons, Tyler and Ben, have started successful
racing careers of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Tyler has three wins on the World of Outlaws
series and 19-year-old Ben has become a serious contender for the
NASCAR Super Late Model crown at Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one Walker whose name and accomplishments have much
more significance than that of local legend and history.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Walker's wife, Dorothy Walker, might have been the first
American woman driver to compete in an open-wheel race.
</P>
<P>
   She is more than likely the first American woman driver to die
during open-wheel competition. But the facts surrounding Dorothy's
career in auto racing are sketchy _ mainly because it wasn't until
almost 50 years after her death that women were even allowed in the
track pit areas, let alone in the drivers' seats of open-wheel race
cars.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, women drivers may have disguised themselves, as
Dorothy did during a Memorial Day race at Overland Park in Colorado
in 1926, in order to compete. The Denver Post dubbed Dorothy the
``Masked Marvel'' in a front-page story reporting the crash that
took her life. According to the article, Dorothy's identity was
only known to her husband, her sister and A. Carbone, president of
the Overland Park Auto Racing association. The fans in the stands
and the other drivers in the race were unaware that she was a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   The track held a special 5-mile exhibition race against time in
which Dorothy participated.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Denver Post article, Dorothy had turned a lap
of 52 seconds in her husband's Big Car which later evolved into
something similar to a modern Sprint car and was the same type of
car used to race in the Indianapolis 500 at the time _ on the
one-mile dirt track the Saturday before the fatal race. Her
performance impressed Carbone enough to let her compete, in
disguise, in the Monday race.
</P>
<P>
   On race day, Dorothy completed one lap in 56 seconds, reaching
speeds ``at a better than 60 mile an hour clip,'' the Post
reported, before losing control in the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the first curve she came to grief. The car bounded; skidded
in a cloud of dust and crashed against the fence. With miraculous
skill she brought the speeding machine back onto the track. A sigh
of relief went up from the terrified spectators. They thought she
had regained control. But just then the car swerved again and the
masked figure of the driver shot headlong from behind the wheel
into the air and against a fence post,'' the Post reported. She was
23 when she died.
</P>
<P>
   Documents and records show that the first woman to officially
compete in an Indy car race was Arlene Hiss, who competed in the
Phoenix 150 on March 14, 1976. Janet Guthrie made her debut in Indy
car racing less than two months later in the Trenton 200 on May 2.
As for women racers before 1976, the Hall of Fame Museum at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway has no other records. The National
Sprint Car Hall of Fame in Knoxville, Iowa, has done little
research into the history of women in auto racing. Neither have
documented accounts of women drivers in Indy or Sprint cars racing
before 1976. But that does not mean that women were not competing
in Indy, Sprint car or other forms of open-wheel racing before
then.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Brown, a Michigan author who wrote ``The History of
America's Speedways'' and the annual ``National Speedway
Directory,'' said finding a woman auto racer in the 1920s was
``very rare.'' Donald Davidson of the Hall of Fame Museum at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway said it would have been ``unusual'' for
an American woman to have competed in open-wheel dirt track racing
in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it was considered ``bad luck'' to have women in the
pits and that the segregation practices that existed with the
Automobile Association of America, the sanctioning body of auto
racing in the United States from 1904 to 1955, continued with the
United States Automobile Club until the early 1970s, when a woman
reporter from Philadelphia fought to cover a race in New Jersey
from the pit area.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Singer, a reporter from Philadelphia, wanted to cover a race
in Flemington, N.J., according to Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the track officials wouldn't let her in the pits until she
brought them a note from her doctor saying she wasn't pregnant,''
Brown said. ``After that, more and more tracks started loosening
their restrictions on women.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson has a different story. A group of women, including a
reporter from New York named Denise McCluggage, were issued pit and
garage access credentials to cover the Indianapolis 500 in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Two names come to Brown's mind when he thinks of women pioneers
in open-wheel racing: Guthrie and Cheryl Glass, both of whom
started competing in the 1970s. But Brown only refers to them
because they were competitive. There may have been others before
them, Brown said, but none were as good.
</P>
<P>
   While Dorothy Walker's story rings a familiar chord with Brown,
he was unable to recall any particular details surrounding her
career.
</P>
<P>
   Other auto racing historians, such as Leroy Byers of Denver,
Harold Osmer of Los Angeles and Craig Agen of the National Sprint
Car Hall of Fame, say they know something of Dorothy Walker's
career as the ``Masked Marvel,'' but can recall little else of her
racing achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Osmer, author of ``Where They Raced'' and ``Real Road Racing,''
has a record of an all-women's open-wheel event that took place in
1918 at Ascot Park in Los Angeles. He says it is the first recorded
open-wheel auto racing event in which women competed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they weren't real, official racers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven women, dubbed speederettes, competed in three events at
Ascot Park on Feb. 3, 1918. They were the only all-women auto
racing events held at Ascot Park. Officials and support staff were
all women as well. Ruth Wightman won the first race of the day, a
three-cornered event pitting her against Mrs. P.H. Harmon and Nina
Vitigliano, according to Osmer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. C.H. Wolflet was named the Women's International Champion
after winning the Katherine Stinson Trophy race that day, but
Wightman was by far the fastest woman driver competing. She turned
an exhibition lap in 51 seconds, or at 70 mph, on the one-mile dirt
track that opened in 1906. Competitive men were running laps at
Ascot Park in the 75-80 mph range.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hill, an auto racing historian from Las Vegas, says Dorothy
Walker is more than the first woman to compete in open-wheel
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think Walker could very well have been the first,''
Hill said, adding that she was probably the first woman to have
competed in any level of auto racing, since NASCAR wasn't formed
until 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Post reported that the Memorial Day race was Dorothy
Walker's debut. But Bob Walker, Dorothy's grandson and owner of San
Fernando Valley-based Walker Engineering, says she raced numerous
times before that day. When she started and how good she was, Bob
Walker did not know.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the details, Dorothy's career is significant
enough that Agen said he is putting together a display at the
National Sprint Car Hall of Fame recognizing her achievements in
open-wheel auto racing. It is scheduled to open this summer. &QL;

HINGIS TOP SEED FOR ESTYLE.COM CLASSC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Martina Hingis received the top seed
and a first-round bye when the singles draw for next week's
estyle.com Classic was announced Friday at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis headlines a strong field which also features four former
tournament champions _ Lindsay Davenport, Conchita Martinez, Monica
Seles and Serena Williams _ and a total of seven players ranked in
the world top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-player tournament will begin on Monday with first-round
matches and conclude Sunday, Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a very tough field,'' said Barbara Schett,
who drew seventh-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in the first round.
``Every round is a challenge. You could win a couple rounds, but
you could also lose in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, Davenport, Seles and Martinez, the top four seeds,
respectively, each received a first-round bye. Fifth-seeded
Williams will face Ruxandra Dragomir, sixth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat
will meet one of the weekend qualifiers and Sandrine Testud will
face Elena Likhovtseva in other first-round matches.
</P>
<P>
   The draw sets up possible semifinals of Hingis against Williams
or Martinez and Davenport against Seles, but Hingis' half of the
draw also includes last year's surprise Wimbledon standout,
Alexandra Stevenson, who received a wild-card berth, and Amy
Frazier, who stunned Hingis on Thursday in the quarterfinals of the
Acura Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Anke Huber, who would have been the seventh seed in the
tournament, withdrew Friday because of tendinitis in her elbow.
</P>
<P>
   First-round matches will begin Monday at 10 a.m. PDT, and the
schedule will be determined on Sunday. Single-day tickets cost
$12-$75 and series passes can be purchased for $120-$350. &QL;

LAZIO SAYS IF MRS. CLINTON REFUSES SOFT MONEY, HE WOULD, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELVILLE, N.Y. _ With Sen. John McCain at his side, Rep. Rick
Lazio pledged on Friday that he would pick up the senator's
signature issue, campaign finance reform, and refuse the largely
unregulated campaign contributions known as soft money _ if Hillary
Rodham Clinton, his opponent, made the same pledge beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, took particular issue with
soft money used by independent groups to finance attack advertising
against him, but found himself accused of hypocrisy by Democrats
because similar groups have sponsored advertising for him.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio called on Clinton to abolish four financial accounts that
he said had raised millions of dollars in soft money contributions.
Such contributions have been criticized because it is often
difficult to detect their sources and because they effectively
allow candidates to circumvent legal limits on contributions by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign, which laid claim to only two such accounts,
immediately responded by noting that Clinton had extended a similar
pledge to Lazio months ago, but was rebuffed. She also accused
Lazio of hypocrisy by complaining of soft money while deriving
benefit from it through independent groups supporting his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money by law is not supposed to be used to advocate a
candidacy directly; the funds are to be used for such things as
party building and voter registration drives. But critics, notably
McCain, have criticized the limitations as so loosely interpreted
that organizations do manage to influence campaigns and promote
candidates. Congress recently passed legislation _ sponsored by
McCain and backed by Lazio _ requiring certain political
organizations employing soft money to disclose their donors.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he was loath to refuse the help of soft money
unilaterally because Clinton and her supporters have raised much
more of it than he could hope to. He said his campaign had not
directly accepted any such contributions but would not refuse them,
either, until Clinton made the pledge.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who joined Lazio at a hotel here for a fund-raiser for
Joan Johnson, a Republican candidate for Lazio's congressional seat
in Suffolk County, backed up the congressman's position. ``You
can't expect him to unilaterally disarm,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's spokesman, said only two of the four
accounts Lazio named accept soft money in a joint fund-raising
account the campaign maintains with independent organizations. Of
the other two, one is an account under the control of the state
Democratic Party and not the campaign, and the other is a campaign
account that does not accept soft money contributions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson ridiculed Lazio for not disavowing independent groups
that have benefited his campaign with advertising. ``Just because
you don't have a joint account,'' Wolfson said, ``does not mean an
organization is not spending on your behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   De Blasio cited one group, the Republican Leadership Council,
which is running an advertisement featuring, against his wishes,
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who called it ``soft money fakery.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he had no control over the advertisement because
it was produced by an unrelated political group, but on Friday he
said he saw no contradiction in calling on Clinton to pull attack
advertising against him sponsored by a third party, the state
Democratic Party, using soft money. By law, neither candidate is
supposed to have involvement in the spending of such money.

NO. 2 SPOT FOR POSADA PAYS OFF FOR YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The idea formed inside the timeworn skull of the
bench coach Don Zimmer as he and manager Joe Torre and the hitting
coach Chris Chambliss discussed the framework of the New York
Yankees' lineup Friday night. They determined that Derek Jeter
would lead off and, standing outside Torre's office, they were not
sure who would bat second.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer suggested Jorge Posada _ something the catcher had not
done since he was in Triple-A _ and they all nodded and smiled,
figuring that maybe the change would help him out of his slump.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer owns bragging rights now, for Posada had four hits and
four RBIs, inciting a couple of early rallies before driving in the
go-ahead run in the bottom of the seventh as the Yankees dumped the
Seattle Mariners, 13-6.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams hammered a three-run homer, leaving him one RBI
short of 100 for the season, and 31 shy of a switch-hitters' record
shared by Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   If the playoffs were to begin Saturday, the Yankees (59-45) and
the Mariners (62-46) would play in the first round. Posada would
probably not bat second. Chuck Knoblauch usually serves as the
lead-off hitter and Jeter bats second, but Knoblauch's sore right
elbow is not improving and Torre wants him to be able to throw
pain-free before he restores him as his regular second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   But Posada climbed high in the lineup _ so high, in fact, that
when he first glanced at the batting order posted in the Yankees'
clubhouse, he did not think he was playing at all. Posada looked at
the bottom half of the order, could not find his name in its usual
place and thought he had been benched.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually discovered his name almost at the top, however.
Other than a 4-for-4 outburst against Baltimore on July 28, Posada
had only two hits in his last 35 at-bats coming into Friday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle scored three runs in the top of the first inning against
Andy Pettitte (12-6), but after Jeter flied out in the bottom of
the first, Posada pulled a double to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill lined a single off the glove of third baseman
Carlos Guillen, Posada scampering to third when he saw the ball
roll. Bernie Williams was next, a big-time problem for Jamie Moyer,
Seattle's starting pitcher. Williams came into the game with 25
hits in 52 at-bats in his career against the left-hander, a .481
average.
</P>
<P>
   With a three-run lead, Moyer was obligated to throw strikes to
Williams, and when the count reached three balls and two strikes,
Williams drove one of those strikes into the left-field stands to
tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had two on and two out in the second inning, and
Posada dumped a single to score Tino Martinez; the Yankees led by a
run, and then two, after O'Neill doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Posada's working relationship with Pettitte has been imperfect,
with occasional disagreements over pitch selection, but never more
animated than in the fifth inning Friday night. After John Olerud
fouled off a ball in the fifth inning, with runners at second and
third and one out, Posada jogged to the mound to talk to Pettitte,
who subsequently shook off the next sign Posada flashed.
</P>
<P>
   After the inning ended, Posada moved toward Pettitte in front of
the dugout and raised both arms, as if to question him, and as
Pettitte pulled on his jacket, he appeared to snap back at the
catcher, jawing as he passed. Posada offered some retort. The
Mariners cut the lead to 5-4 in the third and tied the score at 5-5
in the seventh, when Olerud singled home Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Bellinger hit an easy roller to shortstop to open the
bottom of the seventh, but the Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez
fumbled the ball. One out later, Posada smashed a line drive to
left-center field, far out of the reach of Rickey Henderson, and
Bellinger got a good jump and scored easily, the Yankees moving
ahead, 6-5. The Yankees would add four more runs in the inning, the

<P>
   Guerrero has superstar credentials despite limited Exposure
</P>
<P>
   By SCOTT KAISER
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After Vladimir Guerrero was signed by the Montreal
Expos in 1994, the 17-year-old was asked to fill out a routine
questionnaire. When reading the responses, the Expos should have
known they had a future superstar in their midst.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero wrote, among other things, that his winter occupation
was ``practicing baseball'' and his hobby was ``being a
ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Expos right fielder is a throwback to when players had
a passion for their profession. The 6-3, 205-pounder doesn't wear
batting gloves or jewelry, and he politely refuses most interview
requests. About the most you can get out of the shy Dominican
Republic native is his favorite quote: ``What I do is see the ball,
hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When you ask others, one thing constantly mentioned about
Guerrero, 24, is he's a ``five-tool player.'' In other words, he
can hit, hit with power, run, field and throw, which makes him
arguably the best player in the game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anybody with his kind of talent,'' Expos
manager Felipe Alou said. ``And not just the physical talent, but
also the mental toughness. He's dedicated to all-out hustle for
nine innings and is one of the best late-inning hitters I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker was asked to vote for the most
exciting player in the National League by a sports publication, and
he didn't have to think twice before naming Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays with a lot of enthusiasm and aggressiveness at the
plate, and I think he's going to be a superstar if he's not one
already,'' Dierker said. ``The scary thing is he's still young and
can get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Friday's game against the Astros, Guerrero ranked
seventh or better in the National League in batting average (.351),
hits (130), total bases (245), triples (seven), RBIs (86),
intentional walks (17), slugging percentage (.662), on-base
percentage (.425) and multihit games (39). In addition, his 26 home
runs are ahead of last year's pace. He had 42 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One team that didn't project those numbers is Los Angeles. The
Dodgers had Guerrero in camp for an extended tryout when he was 16,
but they decided against signing him. That surprised Astros
righthander Jose Lima, who pitched against the teen-ager in winter
ball in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the big stud that he is now, but I knew he was going
to be very good,'' Lima said. ``You know when a guy has the tools
to be a major-league player, and he's showing them now.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season Guerrero drove in 131 runs, had 84 extra-base hits,
a slugging percentage of .600, and a 31-game hitting streak. He is
the first player in major-league history to average .300, 40 home
runs and 120 RBIs over two seasons at the age of 23 or under.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a kid out there,'' Expos first baseman Lee Stevens
said. ``He has a great attitude every day, and every time you see
him he's smiling, but he plays hard. He's playing hurt right now
(with a hip flexor), and you don't see young kids with his talent
and potential who are willing to play hurt. Even the older players
around here can learn something from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his reputation among his peers and baseball personnel,
Guerrero isn't well known in the United States. One reason might be
his trouble speaking English, which limits his interview
opportunities. But Guerrero prefers to spend his pre-game time
playing video baseball games while listening to merengue music
through headphones than talking about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to know about him because nobody does know
about him,'' Stevens said. ``He's up in Montreal, and the exposure
is not there, so people are intrigued about him because they're
always curious about the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quiet and not controversial, and he's not in the papers
every day saying something or doing something. He just quietly goes
about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field, Guerrero sports a Dave Parker-like arm (seven
assists this season) and incredible range. But his prowess with the
bat earns Guerrero the most respect. If men are on base and
Guerrero is coming to the plate, a trip to the mound by the
opposing pitching coach or manager is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a scouting report and try to come up with a plan
of how to pitch him, there really isn't one,'' Dierker said.
``There really isn't. You just say, `Throw it in and out and up and
down, and don't throw too many strikes, and hope he hits it to
somebody.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who will face Guerrero in today's 7:05 p.m. game at Enron
Field, admits it's a waste of time trying to fool a player who has
power to all fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go out there and challenge him,'' Lima said. ``If
he hits you, he hits you, and if you get him out, you say, `Thank
you very much.' Like any big hitter, you're not allowed to make a
mistake, because he can hurt you. He swings at everything, so you
better be careful out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Guerrero is from Latin America, he is often compared to
former Pirates great Roberto Clemente. But Dierker says Guerrero
reminds him of another outstanding Expo, Andre Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those guys are great players, but physically he's more
like Dawson,'' Dierker said. ``Clemente was an aggressive hitter,
but I'm not sure he was as aggressive as Dawson or Guerrero. With
Dawson and Guerrero, you practically have to intentionally walk
them to walk them. Clemente did take at least a few walks.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point of his career, Guerrero's numbers are ahead of
those posted by Clemente, Dawson and Ken Griffey Jr. at a similar
stage in their careers. And they are close to Joe DiMaggio's.
Unless hit by a serious injury, a plaque in the Hall of Fame seems
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he can still get better and probably will,''
Stevens said. ``I don't know if the sky's the limit, but the
consistency's there already, and that's the important thing for a
guy who's only 24 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how much higher his numbers will go, but you
know what you're going to get from him.''

THE REALM OF MEDICARE IS KAFKAESQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just because Medicare's regulatory enforcers
say you're a crook doesn't mean that you're really a crook.
</P>
<P>
   This must be kept in mind when following the misfortunes of
members of the Kansas City health-care community whose lives and
careers are being devastated by questionable criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Unless these otherwise respectable citizens gain appellate
relief from their convictions, they face extensive prison time for
alleged crimes that many familiar with health-care business
relationships would contend aren't crimes at all.
</P>
<P>
   The charges essentially involve payments that prosecutors say
were bribes made to doctors by hospital executives in return for
referrals of Medicare patients. In a business in which referrals
are a cornerstone of relationships, those in the industry might say
what happened was merely business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this case remarkable, though, was how it brings to
light the Kafkaesque world created by byzantine Medicare
regulations, which are estimated to be more voluminous and complex
than the Internal Revenue Code.
</P>
<P>
   Only the defendants, of course, know in their heart of hearts
whether they set out to cut legal corners. Given the world in which
they operate, however, they deserve the benefit of the doubt.
Moreover, media coverage of the case certainly raises honest
questions about its merits.
</P>
<P>
   Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton University political economist and
prominent expert on health-care economics, says the critical
problem isn't so much criminality or malfeasance as it is Medicare
regulations having become too complicated to understand.
</P>
<P>
   The necessary compromise, he explained in a recent analysis in
The Wall Street Journal, falls between two extremes: ``rules so
crude as to tolerate widespread abuse, and rules so finely honed as
to become impenetrable.''
</P>
<P>
   It can be argued that Medicare's system has gone too far in
evolving the impenetrable. As a result anyone can be transformed
into a crook because it's impossible to obey all the laws with
precision. Reinhardt noted that health-industry audit committees
often spend more time on compliance with ``ever-burgeoning Medicare
rules than on their own financial reports.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the way totalitarian regimes operate. Create enough laws
and it means everyone is always in violation of some law, which is
the source of all autocratic and authoritarian power.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the medical profession itself frowns on commission
payments to referring physicians as a matter of ethics, there is no
doubt that professional relationships over time produce positive
economic outcomes for those involved. Medicare makes out-and-out
kickbacks illegal, which leaves the door open to liberal
interpretation of what constitutes referral arrangements that may
violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   An important aspect of one defendant's appeal, in fact, has
turned on conflicting judicial interpretations of an arcane rule.
If the defendant loses his freedom, it probably will result more
from a subjective judgment than commission of an act most
reasonable minds would agree is criminal.
</P>
<P>
   For a society in which consistent application of the rule of law
is supposed to protect basic rights, this is an unsettling thing to
contemplate.

<P>
   Like other people who live in Seattle, David W. Simpson is never
too far from Mount Rainier, the highest peak in the Northwest. But
he is often closer than most. On weekends and during vacations,
Simpson leads climbers over the Mount Rainier's glaciers and rocks;
on weekdays, he drives past the mountain on his way to work
managing the $721.1 million WM Growth Fund of the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   The mountain is also the polestar of the portfolio, whose
prospectus requires it to be at least 65 percent invested in
companies with headquarters in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana
and Alaska. The remainder must be in companies doing business in
that region. The geographic area may be small, but it has been
fertile territory for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quite diversified in terms of industries, and we've
become something of a hotbed of technology,'' Simpson said from his
office overlooking Puget Sound. ``Many executives leave Microsoft
with enormous amounts of wealth that they use to finance new
businesses, seeding the region with start-ups.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund returned 26.8 percent a year, on average, for the three
years through Thursday, versus 7.4 percent for its peers among
small blend funds, according to Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, 41, can pluck almost any of the roughly 300 public
companies in those five states. He can find long-term capital
growth in start-ups or choose behemoths like Starbucks, Microsoft
and Nike. Small fry make up 60 percent of the portfolio; the
balance is split between midsize and large-cap companies.
</P>
<P>
   His style could be called eclectic. The fund may hold basic
materials companies in forestry and steel as well as red-hot
technology concerns. Unprofitable biotech businesses rub shoulders
with value plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception that regional funds are dependent on the
local economy,'' he said. ``But that's not true. What drives the
companies we buy are national and global markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson works with three equity analysts to pick the fund's 70
or so holdings. He aims to keep shares at least three to five
years; the turnover rate is 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He does not use computer screens to scout out purchases. ``I
keep a hit list of new companies that I look at every day,'' he
said, ``and I pay attention to the local news and investment
analysts.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he wants companies to have relatively low debt
and adequate working capital. Although working-capital needs vary
by industry, as a rule of thumb he wants companies with current
assets that exceed current liabilities, and the bigger the margin,
the better. He also checks a company's ``quick ratio,'' which
compares cash and accounts receivable to current liabilities;
again, bigger is better.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, he wants a company to have a price-to-earnings
multiple that is lower than its growth rate, although he will pay
more for technology companies and less for consumer cyclicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to identify a competitive advantage and make sure that
it is protected,'' he said. That advantage may be a brand name
(Starbucks), a technology (Intel or Microsoft) or domination of a
small market niche (Electro Scientific Industries).
</P>
<P>
   Solid management is vital. For big companies, he relies on Wall
Street research to evaluate management's record. ``I'm more active
talking to management of smaller companies,'' he said, ``because we
can gather information that's not well understood on the Street.''
</P>
<P>
   What does he look for? ``I like them to be able to articulate
business strategy in a sensible way,'' he said. ``And I prefer
management that can answer my detailed questions on the spot,
because it means they have their finger on the pulse of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson recently added shares of Paccar Inc., a Bellevue, Wash.,
company that sells heavy-duty trucks. ``The stock was very
inexpensive, because an industry downturn is under way
domestically,'' he said. ``But the company is more global than
perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has some debt but low fixed costs because it
assembles trucks from components rather than manufacturing them
from scratch, he added. That has helped earnings during the
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   He first bought shares in 1991 at $16.96 and recently added more
in the low 40s. They closed on Friday at $41.9375, or almost seven
times Wall Street's earnings estimate of $6.27 a share for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also expanded its position in Monaco Coach, a
manufacturer of recreational vehicles in Coburg, Ore. ``We're
playing into a strong demographic trend,'' he said. ``Young
retirees love these things, and the market should be very strong as
baby boomers reach retirement age.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock price is down because of rising interest
rates and fuel prices, he said, but the company is debt-free and
management is adjusting production. He started buying in July 1999
and has paid an average of $12.94. The stock now trades at
$15.8125, or more than six times the consensus 2000 earnings
estimate of $2.48 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite is the Corixa Corp., which he bought at the
initial offering in 1997 at $13 a share. It closed on Friday at
$38.875. Corixa, a biotechnology company in Seattle, is developing
vaccines for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Its chairman and chief
executive, Steven Gillis, was co-founder of Immunex, another
biotechnology company in Seattle. Simpson said he had ``confidence
in his grasp of the business and science of managing a biotech
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian regulators recently approved the company's melanoma
vaccine, and approval by the Food and Drug Administration is
expected by year-end, he said. Wall Street's consensus estimate is
that the company will lose $1.62 a share this year. Nevertheless,
Simpson is optimistic about the long-term prospects.
