<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Students and scholars in
Belgium Saturday handed over a protest letter to the NATO
headquarters here to condemn the NATO bombing on Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
They said in the letter that all the Chinese students and
scholars in Belgium feel extremely sad and outraged to know that
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade was bombed by three NATO cruise
missiles at midnight on May 7, 1999, which left three people dead
and more than 20 people injured.
</P>
<P>
"We express our strongest condemnation to this inhumanity
action. We demand the immediate explanation and official apology
from NATO to the Chinese people and government. NATO must be fully
responsible for this severe disaster caused by the bombing," the
students and scholars said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of about 1,500 students and scholars from all over
Belgium, eight representatives signed their names on this letter
to give the authority to all the journalists to convey their
protest letter to the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Some student leaders said they will hold a demonstration in the
front of the NATO headquarters on Sunday despite a temporary ban
on street rally in Brussels during the NATO air war against
Yugoslavia.

JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese students and scholars in

</P>
<P>
"This was definitely a kind of war action against our nation

Scholars Association in Israel (CSSAI) said in a protest letter
to the U.S. government.

The CSSAI, representing more than 400 Chinese students and
scholars studying in or visiting Israel, will deliver the letter
to the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and its consulate in Jerusalem

"We strongly demand that those murders be severely punished and

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians killed in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were killed
and two others injured Saturday in U.S.-British warplane attacks
on Iraqi civilian facilities and military sites in the north, an
Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 9:15 (0515 GMT), nine
formations of enemy warplanes coming from Turkish airspace fired
18 bombs at some civilian and military targets in the northern
provinces of Dohuk, Erbil and Neiveva.
</P>
<P>
The provinces are part of the no-fly zone in the north. The
U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq following
the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in
the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's
suppression."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared that it does not recognize these restricted
zones and vowed to continue confronting any allied planes
violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The enemy warplanes' bombardment also led to severe damage on
civilian properties, added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back and forced
the enemy planes to flee to their base in Turkey at 15:15 (1115
GMT).
</P>
<P>
Enemy warplanes also violated southern Iraqi airspace in the
day, said the spokesman. Some 24 formations of enemy planes from
Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated Iraqi airspace over Basra, Misan
and Muthana provinces, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-night airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi military and civilian targets.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Classifying GCC Goods: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Fresh progress has been made in
classifying commodities of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states, marking another step forward towards the establishment of
a customs union within the group.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1,286 items out of 1,289 commodities have been
categorized, Minister of State for Financial and Industrial
Affairs of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Mohammed Khalfan Bin
Kharbash said in Riyadh Saturday after a meeting of the GCC
finance ministers on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
When GCC finance ministers agreed last August to form a
customs union by March 2001, only 1,140 commodities were
classified.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states have wide gaps over the classification of goods
due to differences in each country's economic priorities, which
have blocked the implementation of an agreement on the customs
unification since it was signed in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Bin Kharbash said GCC specialized committees were pondering
potential unified custom tariffs, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the commodities which have been
classified fall into three categories, namely those exempted from
tariffs, basic goods with tariffs ranging 1 to 12 percent, and
other goods.
</P>
<P>
Customs tariffs in the GCC states at present vary from 4 to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance
established in 1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the UAE.

<HEADLINE> NATO Raid Violates U.N. Convention: Iranian TV Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's state-run television said on
Saturday night that NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade was an open violation of international conventions.
</P>
<P>
"The attack on the Chinese embassy openly violated the 1961
Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations," the television said
in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the NATO has trampled the U.N. Charter and
international norms by launching air strikes for more than 40
days on Yugoslavia without consent from the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
What happened in the Balkan indicated that "the continuous
actions violating international laws and norms in the Balkan will
never recognize any limit," the television said.
</P>
<P>
"Now, with the attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the
credit of an international norm has become a plaything" of the
U.S.-led NATO, it added.
</P>
<P>
The NATO missile attacks on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
Friday night has killed at least four Chinese and injured over
20.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Premier-Designate to Form Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister-designate
Bulent Ecevit Saturday held his first round of talks with other
political party leaders on the forming of a new coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Ecevit held talks with the political
party leaders in parliament since he was assigned by President
Suleyman Demirel on May 3 to form the 57th government.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who is also leader of Democratic Left Party (DSP), said
that the common expectation is that the new coalition should
include DSP and the right-wing Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).
</P>
<P>
He added that MHP leader Devlet Bahceli shared the same view.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Ecevit said to Bahceli that "according to
the results of the polls, the DSP and the MHP have the
responsibility to form the new government."
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the outcome of the just-concluded talks
showed that the DSP, MHP and central-right Motherland Party (ANAP)
will most probably form the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The DSP won 21.17 percent of the votes in the April 18
parliamentary elections and got 136 seats, becoming the first
largest party in the 550-member legislature.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who is expected to begin his second round of talks with
party leaders on May 12, said that the election for new parliament
speaker will come soon.

<HEADLINE> S. African Party Condemns Bombing of Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of the
South African Communist Party (SACP) said Saturday that it was
disgusted by NATO' s bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing campaign flouts all international legality, it
deliberately bypasses the U.N. .and U.N. Security Council. The
bombing will simply exacerbate the situation on the ground in
Kosovo, and further polarize matters," the party said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
NATO's apologies for hitting the embassy, like its earlier
apologies for hitting refugees and civilian buses, were
unacceptable, the SACP said.
</P>
<P>
"This latest incident threatens to escalate the conflict beyond
its current Balkan context, posing a threat to world peace.
</P>
<P>
"The SACP Central Committee saluted the consistent stand taken
by our government on the situation, and called for it, as the
present chair of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), to "ensure that
NAM takes active steps to condemn NATO and halt the bombing."

<HEADLINE> "Cluster" Development Approach Urged In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of State in the
vice- president's office Sithembiso Nyoni has urged local
authorities to embrace the "cluster" type of development approach
which promotes small to medium scale enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Clusters are inter-sectoral networks that are formed around an
economic or industrial activity that is dependent on a single
primary resource in order to maximize the employment creation
potential of the inter-linked sectors.
</P>
<P>
Nyoni told an investment conference in south Zimbabwe Saturday
that small to medium scale enterprises had been identified as the
sector with the highest potential for growth of the ailing economy
as they cater for the disadvantaged majority and have a high
capacity for employment creation, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"With liberalization, globalization and rapid technological
change, clusters offer an opportunity for competitiveness through
specialization and active cooperation," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said examples of successful clusters in developed countries
could be found in Italy where there were "industrial districts" in
fashion goods, and Silicon Valley in United States, where there
were clusters for electronics and software.
</P>
<P>
She said clusters would exist because of extra-market relations
between firms in industry, and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The clusters exploit cumulative external economies and were
supply and demand driven, as well as near to specialized support
services, she said.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nationwide demonstration broke out
in China to protest the U.S.-led NATO's Friday night attack on the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, killing at least four and injuring
over 20 in the embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of angry protesters, mostly university
students, took to the streets in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and
Chongqing municipalities, and capitals of many provinces and
ethnic autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
All the demonstrations were approved by the local authorities
and well-organized, with the protesters holding banners and
chanting slogans condemning the attack, according to eye-witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Protests were reported in Jinan, capital of Shandong Province,
Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei Province, Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi
Province, Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province, and Wuhan, capital
of Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators view the attack as an aggression against
China and a violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, pedestrians
interviewed by Xinhua expressed their strong indignation against
NATO's brutal attack. Pubu, a Tibetan young man, said, "The
Chinese nation has never yielded to evil forces in the history and
we will safeguard the sovereignty of our motherland."
</P>
<P>
In Changsha, capital of Hunan Province, students demonstrated
in the streets while local TV stations stopped regular programs to

<HEADLINE> Iran to Purchase Airbuses from France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran Air, Iranian national carrier,
has planned to purchase four airbuses from France to add 1,200
seats to its flight fleet to London, Amsterdam and other
destinations abroad.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Saturday by Ahmad Reza Kazemi, managing
director of Iran Air.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the international standards, Iran Air
would gradually replace the aging airliners with new planes, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention the value of the four planes and
the date of delivery.
</P>
<P>
In the coming two years, Iran Air will also overhaul seven
Boeing 747 airliners to meet the international standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kazemi said Iran Air has already bought two airbuses, six
Fokker F-100 and leased several airliners to meet its needs in
domestic and overseas flights.
</P>
<P>
He said that the company has also started negotiations with the
airplane manufacturers from Russia and other European states on the
technology transfer to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iran Air is flying to 40 destinations abroad, with 23 of them
in Europe, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Regrets Former Mayor's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Saturday expressed regret over the jailing of his reformist ally,
former Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, who was sentenced to
two years in prison on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Karbaschi's wife, Khatami
said it is unfortunate that the Iranian nation is deprived of the
service of Karbaschi for the time being, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He praised Karbaschi as a personality who, before the Islamic
revolution in 1979, worked for the independence and freedom of
Iran and the establishment of the Islamic republic by tolerating
detention and torture.
</P>
<P>
"Following the victory of the Islamic revolution, Karbaschi
was a capable administrator whose services we can see in Tehran
today," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi reported to the Iranian conservative judiciary on
Thursday after he was ordered to serve the prison terms.
</P>
<P>
Iran's supreme court rejected an appeal lodged by his lawyers
in early April.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi, a strong supporter of Khatami, was publicly tried on
charges of graft last July and given five years in prison, a
20-year ban from holding government posts, 60 lashes and a fine of
1 billion rials (about 160,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A Tehran appeals court later reduced his prison sentence to two
years and the period Karbaschi was banned from taking public
office to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi was appointed the capital's mayor in 1989 when the
Iranian government started post-war reconstruction
programs.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, the Iranian capital city changed its
face with new highways, parks and high apartment blocks.
</P>
<P>
However, he was accused of pocketing public funds and offering
financial support for Khatami during the 1997 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, Karbaschi was temporally jailed, but
released later under an order from the supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei following a political turbulence caused by his
arrest.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Envoy Summoned over President's Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry Saturday
summoned the Turkish Ambassador to Iran Sencar Ozsoy over the
recent remark made by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The summon came following Demirel's recent statement that
there is a link between some Turkish groups and political
parties and Iranian circles, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish ambassador was made aware that linking Turkish
internal affairs with foreign agencies does not help serve
cordial bilateral relations and in no way assists in resolving
problems, a source at the Iranian Foreign Ministry told IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The source said that questions were put to the Turkish
ambassador regarding the truth behind the remark made by the
Turkish president.
</P>
<P>
Ozsoy assured the Iranian Foreign Ministry that the Iran's
views would be relayed to Turkish authorities. He said that
Turkey is determined to strengthen bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Maize Yield to Significantly Drop In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) of
Zimbabwe said Saturday that it expected a significantly reduced
maize crop yield in the 1998/99 agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
In a review of the 1998/99 agricultural season, union President
Nick Swanepoel said the crop yield was expected to be about 1.54
million tons which fell short of local requirements of about 1.8
million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Price control, which is a significant threat to the farmer was
 responsible for reducing the farmers' interest in maize as a crop
during the planning stages in June/July 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production was expected to be about nine percent lower
than the 1997/98 season total production.
</P>
<P>
The crop was adversely affected by water logging, overcast
climatic conditions and severe weed pressure, he said, adding that
production was estimated to reach 250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
He said the end of the rains that pounded the country would see
an improvement in the condition of cattle as the rains produced
abundant grazing throughout the cattle-producing areas.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Urged to Campaign Against HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President Negasso
Gidada Saturday called on the Ethiopian people to participate
actively in the nation-wide campaign against the deadly HIV/AIDS
disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of "Dawn of Hope -- Ethiopia", the
first national association of people with HIV/AIDS, Negasso said,
"although AIDS is fast spreading in our country, it is my
conviction that if we channel all our energy to the task and work
in a coordinated manner, we would be in a position to prevent the
spread of the disease."
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government attaches great importance to the
establishment of the "Dawn of Hope -- Ethiopia" association which
is part of the HIV/AIDS prevention campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged government bodies, development associations and
various other sections of the society to coordinate their efforts
to prevent the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The association, the first of its kind in Ethiopia, focuses on
the prevention of HIV/AIDS and providing care and support as well
as protecting the rights of its members. According to the
association, only HIV-virus carriers and children orphaned as a
result of AIDS are allowed to be its members.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Zewdu Getachew, president of the
association, who is an HIV victim, said there are over 600,000
children orphaned by the disease in Ethiopia and one-third of
hospital beds are occupied by AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
"As there can be nobody who is immune to the virus, it is the
duty of every household to join in the struggle against the
disease," he said.
</P>
<P>
Health reports said there are about 27,000 reported AIDS cases,
300,000 AIDS patients and three million HIV-carriers in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> NATO Should Apologize to China, Says German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The NATO should at least apologize to
China after its missiles attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade,
said Angelika Beer, the defense spokeswoman of Germany's Greens
Party.
</P>
<P>
Beer told Saarland Radio on Saturday the fact showed "NATO's
military division does not want a peace process ". Three people
had been killed in NATO's attack on Chinese Embassy and the
buildings had been severely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The German government said it "regretted" the strike.
</P>
<P>
"It was under no circumstance deliberate," claimed Peter
Weichert State Secretary of Defense Ministry, at the ministry's
daily news briefing in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
In Berlin more than 7,500 people Saturday rallied against
NATO's air war. The demonstrators held placards reading "No More
War", "NATO Goes Out", and "German Weapon, German Money, Murders
in All The World".
</P>
<P>
Gregor Gysi, parliamentary leader of the left wing opposition
Democratic Socialism Party (PDS), said at the demonstration, "It
is the time to stop the war."
</P>
<P>
NATO has launched an aggressive war which hasn't by now helped
any ethnic Albanian in Kosovo a little, said Gysi.

<HEADLINE> Leading Chinese Paper Condemns NATO Bombing On Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's foremost newspaper, the
People's Daily, has strongly condemned the U.S.-led NATO bombing
of the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia, accusing the alliance of a
savage violation of Chinese sovereignty, which has provoked
extreme indignation in the Chinese government and people.
</P>
<P>
Foreign embassies and consulates were generally accepted as the
sovereign territory of their countries and were protected by
international law, stressed the newspaper in a commentary to be
published in Sunday's issue.
</P>
<P>
At midnight local time on May 7, NATO hit the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade with missiles, killing three people, injuring more
than 20 and severely damaging the embassy buildings.
</P>
<P>
NATO's strike on the Chinese embassy was a blatant trampling on
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and other basic
principles of international law. This atrocity had kindled strong
opposition from all peace-loving states and sharp protests from
the Chinese government and people, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's subsequent chicanery, with claims that it did "not
intentionally target the Chinese embassy", could not cover up the
bloody fact, said the commentary. Three missiles blasted the
embassy from different angles, which completely exposed the
aggressors' evil intentions and spilled Chinese blood in an act
for which they must be accountable, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led alliance would be held responsible for all the
consequences and the Chinese government had stated that it
reserved the right to take further action.
</P>
<P>
During the more than 40 days of bombing against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia starting March 24, NATO has changed its
targets from military to civilian structures such as hospitals,
bridges, TV stations, oil refineries, power plants and residential
places. Now, the target has become the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Not only innocent Yugoslav civilians but also foreign diplomats
and journalists have been killed in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the Kosovo crisis, the Chinese government
and people have more than once clearly demanded that the crisis
should be solved through peaceful means on the basis of respecting
the integrity of Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territory, said the
commentary.
</P>
<P>
China, which maintains a foreign policy of independence and
peace, will oppose anyone who practices hegemonism and will
condemn those who invade others. China will never change this
stand no matter what threats are faced.
</P>
<P>
The bombing by the U.S.-led NATO forces on the Chinese embassy
in Yugoslavia has brought strong reaction from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the commentary urged the international community to
make joint efforts to stop NATO from invading Yugoslavia.

evil action brutally violating our country's sovereignty and a
severe provocation to the Chinese people as well as to all the
peace-loving people in the world".
</P>
<P>
The religious groups strongly demand the U.S.-led NATO to
punish the war criminals who have conducted the attack in
accordance with the international conventions, stop the bombing on
Yugoslavia immediately and unconditionally, and end the brutal and
barbarous aggressive war.
</P>
<P>
The act of the U.S.-led NATO, which has undisguisedly violated
the international conventions, damaged the world peace, trampled
the international standards on human rights, must be strongly

<P>
All the staff members of the foundation attended an emergency
meeting tonight, lodging the utmost protest, with deep grief and
strong indignation, against the brutal act of NATO and expressing
profound condolences to those who were killed in the incident and
heartfelt consolation to the wounded and their family members.
</P>
<P>
The brutality is a gross violation of China's sovereignty and
human rights, a trampling over the Vienna Conventions on
Diplomatic Relations and the basic norms in international
relations and an overt provocation to all peace-loving countries,
regions and people, they agreed.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Urges Ties Expansion With Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei here on Saturday called for further expansion of
relations between Iran and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the remark in a meeting with visiting Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the current conditions are favorite for
both Iran and Zimbabwe to further expand their cooperation, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei expressed his appreciation for Mugabe's personality
and his independent policies, saying that bilateral cooperation
will help the two nations preserve their political independence.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian leader reiterated Iran's detente policy, saying
that Tehran is fully determined to preserve and safeguard its
detente policy besides being committed to its foreign policy
principles at international forums.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the U.S. imposition of unipolar policy, Khamenei
underlined that under such circumstances, there was a need for
broadening cooperation among those countries following an
independent stance.
</P>
<P>
The big powers are trying to force their domination in order to
fully exercise their domineering military might, he said, adding
that "what is going on in the Balkan region is an example of an
unrestrained exercise of power."
</P>
<P>
Khamenei is apparently referring to the air strikes against
Yugoslavia launched by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which have entered its 40 days.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said that Zimbabwean nation based on its independent
policy is to fully expand bilateral relations with Iran.
</P>

Mohammad Khatami.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Bombing of Chinese Embassy "Tragic Mistake" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
Saturday the bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade was a "tragic
mistake" as China lodged strongest protest against the atrocious
attack.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragic accident," Clinton, in his first response to the
matter, said at Oklahoma city after touring the tornado damage.
</P>
<P>
"I want to offer my sincere regret and my condolences to both
the leaders and the people of China, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Denying the attack was "barbaric", Clinton said NATO would
continue its military campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important that NATO stay the course," he said.
</P>
<P>
At midnight Friday, the U.S.-led NATO wantonly dropped three
missiles from different angles on the embassy of China in
Belgrade, killing at least three people, including Xinhua female
correspondent Shao Yunhuan. One was still missing while more than
20 were injured. The embassy complex was devastated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, Pentagon Spokesman Ken Bacon claimed that
NATO's bombing of Chinese embassy in Belgrade was "an error".
</P>
<P>
"We did not target that building. The bombing was an error,"
Bacon said at press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"But there is no way to avoid collateral damage or unintended
consequences when weapons are employed to solve what might have
been solved diplomatically," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bacon also expressed "deep regret" and "condolences" to the
Chinese for those who were killed and injured.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government issued a solemn statement Saturday,
expressing its utmost indignation and strong condemnation, and
lodged its strongest protest against the matter.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO should bear all responsibilities arising
therefrom. And the Chinese government reserves the right to take
further action on the matter," said the statement.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Condemns Overthrow of G. Bissau President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) Saturday condemned the overthrow of President
Joaoa Vieira in Guinea Bissau, saying it was "inconsistent with
the democratic aspirations" of the people in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by the 16-member organization,
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate said the "violent
overthrow of the legal and democratic institutions" in that
country offered no viable solution to the current political crisis
in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
It is in flagrant contravention of the spirit of the Abuja and
Lome accords on the resolution of the conflict in Guinea Bissau,
the statement said one day after 600 presidential guards
surrendered to the rebels led by sacked army chief General
Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the surrender of the guards marked the
end of resistance by pro-government troops after two days of
fighting with the rebels who launched their rebellion in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate urged the rebels to "abandon this venture and embrace"
the Abuja and Lome accords as the "only way to a just and lasting
settlement" of the crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
President Vieira was forced to flee his palace when it was set
on fire by rebel forces and took refuge at the Portuguese embassy
in capital Bissau Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guinea Bissau officials said they expected Malam Bacai Sanha,
president of parliament, to be appointed interim head of state to
replace Vieira at a meeting of rebel leaders and members of
parliament later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Zamoro Induto said the constitution of Guinea
Bissau allowed for the replacement of a president by the head of
the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Fransciso Fadul, Prime Minister of the transitional government,
said in Lisbon, capital of Portugal, that there would be no change
in the plan to organize "honest and transparent" elections in
November.
</P>
<P>
Fadul who was out of the country in Europe when the fighting
broke out Thursday night is expected to return to Bissau later
Saturday.

<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa also called for "a political solution to the
Kosovo issue under the framework of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
The NATO has been bombing Yugoslav sites since March 24 to
force Belgrade to sign a peace agreement, granting greater
autonomy to the independence-seeking ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
province.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Beaten But Remain on Top of Chinese Soccer League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Fushun was beaten 2-0 by
visiting Jilin Aodong in the ninth round of the Chinese Soccer
League on Sunday but still managed to stay on top of the league
with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua, which beat Shenyang Haishi 2-1 on Sunday, had
to settle for the second place as they had an inferior goal
difference than Liaoning Fushun.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Liaoning Fushun suffered a defeat at
home since the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Quanxing, the leaders in the first six rounds of the
league, dropped to the third place with 14 points to their credit
as they lost 2-1 to Chongqing Longxin. It was their third
consecutive defeat.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Fushun were favored to win the match against underdogs
Jilin Aodong. They dominated their opponents early in the match
and forced Jilin Aodong into defence.
</P>
<P>
But Liaoning Fushun, which missed two players due to
suspensions, failed to convert any of the scoring chances though
they outshot their opponents early in the first half.
</P>
<P>
It was Jilin Aodong which broke the deadlock as they opened
scoring with their first attempt at the 11th minute.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected served as a blow to the confidence of the young
and inexperienced Liaoning team. They pushed forward, trying to
get an equalizer but instead gave Jilin Aodong more space and the
latter made it 2-0 at the 42nd minute.
</P>
<P>
In other matches played on Sunday, Qingdao Hainiu beat
defending champions Dalian Wanda 2-1, Beijing Guo'an beat Shandong
Luneng 1-0, Wuhan Heart K drew with Guangzhou Songri 0-0 and

<HEADLINE> Macao Media Lauds Selection Process for Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Macao's media Sunday devoted extensive
coverage to the question-and-answer sessions attended by the two
candidates for the office of the first chief executive of the
future Macao Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
All newspapers here printed on their front-pages the views of
Edmund Ho Hau Wah and Stanley Au Chong Kit expressed during two
separate question-and-answer sessions held on Saturday. The two
candidates answered a total of 101 questions on a wide range of
subjects.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers quoted celebrities, experts and scholars as
lauding the two candidates as "well-performing," "well-prepared"
and "sincere" in airing their views.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the
Macao SAR, described as "good" both the questions from the members
of the Selection Committee and the answers by the two candidates.
</P>
<P>
Paulina A. Santos, a Macao-born Portuguese, said both
candidates were very well-prepared and were competing on an equal
footing.
</P>
<P>
They have gone to the grass-roots to hear the public opinion
and this is a blessing to Macao, Santos said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the question-and-answer meeting truly reflects
the spirit of fairness, justice and openness and the spirit of
honesty and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the selection process, many members of the
Selection Committee said Macao people have eventually obtained
true democracy.
</P>
<P>
Susana Chou, vice-chairwoman of the Preparatory Committee for
the Macao SAR, said the selection of the first chief executive of
the Macao SAR has drawn the high attention of Macao residents,
bringing the "election culture" into Macao.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the two candidates unveiled their running
platforms and answered questions from the Selection Members, who
will select the first chief executive of the Macao SAR on May 15,
has produced in Macao a new "election culture based on fair
competition," she said.
</P>
<P>
Macao will return to China on December 20 this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A black-and-white photo with a brief
caption in Reference News, which is published by the Xinhua News
Agency, expressed the sorrow of many over the loss of Shao Yunhuan,
a woman reporter who was killed during NATO's air attack on
China's embassy in Yugoslavia on Friday.
</P>
<P>
And, at the "Guangming Daily" building in the southern part of
Beijing at half past ten this morning, the Internationale could be
heard playing as several hundred journalists mourned the loss of
their colleagues Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, who were killed in the
same attack.
</P>
<P>
"Reference News" and "Guangming Daily", which are major
newspapers in the Chinese, had photos of the reporters on the
front page along with accounts of their lives and statements by
the heads of the two news organizations, with words expressing
condolences and indignation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Central Television ran a statement of condolence and
the Internet updated information on protests across the country
against the atrocity.
</P>
<P>
All-China Journalists Association, which represents China's
550,000 news people, issued a statement strongly condemning NATO's
atrocity and supporting the statement by the Chinese government
that said: "As the heralds of peace and supporters of justice,
Chinese reporters have come to cover the front and have written a
large number of accurate and vivid reports that helped Chinese
readers and people overseas be more aware of the facts of NATO's
bombing of Yugoslavia. These reports were praised by readers." (

Some colleagues of the three reporters also became the focus of
the media as people sought to know more about how these reporters,
with their smiling faces, did their duties and sacrificed their
lives.
</P>
<P>
Xia Haitao, editor-in-chief of "Reference News," could hardly
control his emotions when he recalled talking with Shao Yunhuan
before her departure for Yugoslavia in March: "I still remember
that Shao smiled and said that with her experience in the field
she was certain of doing her duty."

<P>
Li Chunli, a colleague of Yu Xinhu, said, "Yu's death made us
very sad and has also made us understand the sublime nature and
dignity of this profession."
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has received over 500 telegrams expressing condolences
and the Guangming Daily has received messages from over 40 news
organizations in one day.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guoming, a scholar at People's University, said that there
were cases of reporters being killed in the field or in battle,
but few of their being killed in an embassy bombing. NATO's showed
a disregard for news regulations and trampled on civilization.
</P>
<P>
A women journalists association in the Chinese capital issued a
statement of protest over the Internet on March 26 against the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and was the first Chinese news
association to voice its protest. Deputy chairwoman Xiong Lei said,
"We are shocked and enraged by this atrocity, which is a trampling
on human life and a disrespect of human rights."

Holding the banner of "humanitarianism," NATO has wantonly
bombed a sovereign state and caused a great number of civilian
causalities and left tens of thousands of people homeless,
demonstrating the extreme vanity of the U.S.'s protection of human

</P>
<P>
Disregarding the Vienna Conventions on Diplomatic Relations and
international relations, NATO openly attacked the Chinese embassy.
The sheer hegomonism and power politics of the act is a gross
violation of Chinese sovereignty and a seriously provocative act
that is completely unacceptable to the Chinese people, the
military men said.

NATO should immediately stop the bombing of Yugoslavia and bear

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Journalists "Shocked" at NATO's Bombing of Chinese Embassy in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- "I was deeply shocked, and grieved at
the deaths of the Chinese journalists" in NATO's bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on Saturday, a senior editor of the
Holiday, the leading weekly newspaper in Bangladesh, told Xinhua
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I regret such a thing has occurred... We condemn such
incidents, we disapprove the unfortunate indiscriminate
air-strikes (by NATO)," he said, commenting on the NATO's bombing
of the Chinese Embassy in which Three Chinese were killed and more
than 20 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Dr. Shaikh Abdus Salam, director
general of the Press Institute of Bangladesh, said that "They who
are leading in NATO should apologize to the Chinese government
unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
"Every country, every community should condemn it (such an
attack on the Chinese Embassy)... They (NATO members) should honor
the flags of other countries and international conventions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's excuses for its bombing on the Chinese Embassy "are
disagreeable, unacceptable," he said. "It is not a mere mistake,
it is more than that," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked at the bombing," said a senior editor of the
Daily Ittefaq, the largest circulated daily newspaper in
Bangladesh. It was "bad," "brutal," and the NATO bombed the
Chinese Embassy "deliberately," he said.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Anti-American demonstrations rocked Chinese cities for a
second day Sunday as tens of thousands of Chinese students
continued to lodge protests against NATO's deadly missile attack
on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration struggled Saturday to prevent the
missile strike on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade from either
hobbling NATO's air campaign or stifling the nascent diplomatic
search for a way to end the war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The White House said the American Ambassador in Beijing, James
Sasser, had apologized to the Chinese Government and would
continue to provide Chinese officials with information on how the
event happened.
</P>
<P>
-- The once-strong likelihood that India would soon sign the
nuclear test ban treaty faded this week to a very faint
possibility as the Hindu nationalist-led government, which
appeared to be headed toward signing the treaty, narrowly lost a
confidence vote last month after only a year in office.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legal Scholar Says Human Rights Are Not Above Sovereignty (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Human rights are not above
sovereignty at any time and international protection and domestic
jurisdiction agree on this, according to Liu Wenzong, a specialist
in international law at China's Foreign Affairs College.
</P>
<P>
NATO has provided a bad example by interfering in other
countries' internal affairs and trampling on their sovereignty, he
said, and NATO's military action in Yugoslavia has infringed on
its sovereignty and the rights of the people there and this is
detrimental to the UN Charter and the principles of international
law.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UN Charter stresses the protection of human
rights while respecting sovereignty and that no provision in
international law says that human rights questions can be settled
by the use of force or the threat of the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Liu explained that sovereignty is the most fundamental and
important right in international law, which does not allow
interference in other countries' internal affairs no matter what
the excuse.

<HEADLINE> Congress Party Condemns NATO Attack On Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party Sunday
strongly condemned the NATO air attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade and demanded an emergency meeting of the United Nations
Security Council to stop the aggression.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn in the strongest terms the NATO air attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade," Natwar Singh, chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Department of the All-Indian Congress Committee,
said in a press statement here.
</P>
<P>
NATO countries were "blatantly flouting" the UN Charter and
world public opinion, Singh said, adding the bombing of Yugoslavia
without the Security Council's sanction was contrary to all norms
and had set a very dangerous precedent.
</P>
<P>
He said that three of the NATO countries bombing Yugoslavia
were permanent members of the Security Council and it did not
behove them to become "self-appointed policemen of the world".
</P>
<P>
The Congress high official asked the U.N. secretary general to
immediately call an emergency meeting of the council failing which
he should convene a special session of the General Assembly to
stop the NATO aggression.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker Indian government on Saturday deplored the NATO
air strike on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and pressed its
demand for an immediate stop of its attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
External Affairs Minister of the caretaker Indian government
Jaswant Singh said that "any damage to a diplomatic establishment,
intended or otherwise, is to be entirely deplored".
</P>
<P>
The Indian minister said that continuous aerial bombardment, in
the name of humanitarian issues, resulting in the loss of innocent
civilian lives was "totally unacceptable".

<HEADLINE> Russian Journalist Analyzes NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Evgueni Belenky, correspondent for
Russia's Izvestia Newspaper in Bangkok, analyzed Sunday the NATO
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, saying he wouldn't
believe that NATO intelligence was so bad that they didn't know at
least the embassy was in the same neighborhood as their target.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Xinhua, Belenky, on behalf of all Russian
correspondents in Bangkok, said that the bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade was qualified by the NATO experts as an
"accident", just like the other events of this kind earlier in the
"air war."
</P>
<P>
"But my personal opinion is that it is time to stop describing
these happenings by the terms that presume innocent unintentional
mistakes on the NATO part," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing of civilian targets was intentional, strikes at
residential areas were intentional, as was the attack on the area
where, obviously known to the NATO command, the Chinese Embassy
was situated," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one undoubted mistake, and it was made by the
U.S. administration and NATO six weeks ago, when they decided to
start the bombings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Belenky also said that the whole six-week history of the NATO
"air war" against Yugoslavia has shown quite clearly that even
with the latest technology there still is no such thing as a
"surgical" airstrike in existence.
</P>
<P>
"There are just too many 'accidents' happening there, including
the ill fate of more than 60 Albanian refugees hit by missiles on
a road, a civilian railway carriage, and many others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Belenky also expressed his sincerest condolences to the Chinese
journalists, who were killed in the "purely barbaric act".
</P>
<P>
He hoped their death may open the eyes and wake the conscience
of those who are using "the blind deadly force".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Defense Specialists Say NATO Bombing No Accident (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese defense
specialists said here today that the attack on the Chinese embassy
in Yugoslavia by NATO was in no way an accident.
</P>
<P>
One member of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences
concluded that the attack was planned and carefully plotted. That
might have been possible if only one bomb had hit the embassy, but
the fact is that three missiles hit the building from three
different angles makes it impossible to label it an accident.
</P>
<P>
One of the three bombs hit the top of the five-story building
and penetrated down to the ground floor, another hit the fourth
floor straight on, and the third seriously damaged a part between
the office building and the ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
All of them said the attack was a barbarous act that was rare
in the history of international relations, or of diplomacy and war.
</P>
<P>
International convention is that countries involved in war
never attack embassies of countries not involved, one of the
specialists said, pointing out that when the People's Liberation
Army entered Nanjing, which was the Kuomintang headquarters, it
carefully protected the U.S. embassy even though the U.S. was
supporting the enemy. Now, the U.S. has fired missiles against
China, which constitutes a war crime.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia stands out and has no similar
building within 200 meters.

<TEXT>
<P>
Another analyst said that if a topographically-guided missile
was used, then NATO could mistake the picture of the Chinese
embassy for the target and if it was dropped from a fighter then
the pilot lacked the basic skills, but analysts say that such
things seldom occur, especially in regional wars like the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Some other specialists voiced their suspicion of NATO's
explanation and argued that NATO's planes are flying much lower
now because of weakened Yugoslav air defenses, so the chance of
making a mistake is less.
</P>
<P>
Modern warfare uses hi-tech weapons, so the possibility of
attacking the wrong target is extremely slim. One of the analysts,
who watched three airstrikes in Iraq, admitted that there have
been cases of accidental deviation, but said that these missiles
were some distance from each other and not concentrated.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that, if a target is hit by three missiles
simultaneously, then that is exactly the target they were aiming
for.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Retake Central Afghan City of Bamiyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
recaptured the strategic central city of Bamiyan Sunday after
routing opposition forces in heavy fighting.
</P>
<P>
"Our fighters attacked Bamiyan from the north and captured the
city," reports reaching here Sunday afternoon from Kabul quoted
Amir Khan Muttaqi, the Taliban's official responsible for
information affairs, as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Muttaqi did not provide further details about the
fighting and the latest situation in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had been fighting to recapture Bamiyan since last
month when the opposition forces took control of the city and the
Taliban troops retreated to the nearby mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
Bamiyan is largely dominated by Afghanistan's minority Shiite
Muslims, who are aligned to the northern-based opposition led by
former president Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military chief Ahmed
Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate comment from the opposition on the
Taliban's recapture of Bamiyan, but earlier the opposition did say
they lost several nearby military posts west of Bamiyan, according
to the reports.

<HEADLINE> Poor Mothers Benefit from Happiness Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Chinese cities today
conducted various kinds of activities to mark Mother's Day. The
activities are part of China's nationwide "Happiness Program"
launched to help poor mothers.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, Vice chairwoman of Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) and also President of China Population and
Welfare Fund, today attended a series of activities organized in
Beijing by China National Happiness Program Organizing Committee
and its Beijing Municipal Sub-Committee.
</P>
<P>
Information from China National Happiness Program Organizing
Committee said that 3,344 poor mothers in China have benefited by
the "Happiness Program" since it was launched in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, more than 60 million yuan were spent to
start up 155 projects. And 60,000 mothers received free medical
checkups or free medical treatment, while 80,000 mothers also
received various kinds of training courses free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Through household sideline businesses, aided with small loans,
the poor mothers raked in annual earnings ranging from 1,000 yuan
to 2,600 yuan, with the highest income standing at 100,000 yuan.
The successful rate of the aiding program is over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The "Happiness Program" was jointly sponsored by the China
Population Welfare Foundation, Family Planning Association of
China and China Population News. It is aimed at helping mothers in
China's poverty-stricken areas escape from poverty and establish
happy families by collecting donations inside and outside China.
</P>
<P>
The "Happiness Program" uses the raised funds to provide poor
mothers with loans to develop household sideline production and
establish collective economic entities. The funds are also be used
to set up schools at the village level and provide poor mothers
with health care and family planning services. Those aided are
mothers whose incomes are lower than the local average.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, a total of 100 million yuan will
have been amassed to help more poor mothers, and 80,000 mothers
will be aided, said an official with the China National Happiness

<HEADLINE> Israel Threatens to Close Orient House Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu threatened Sunday that the Orient House in the East
Jerusalem will be closed if no agreement is reached with the
Palestinians this evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Netanyahu
stressed that the Israeli security forces are ready to close the
three offices in the Orient House compound, which Israel said were
working for the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani is
holding talks with senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in an
effort to find a solution to the dispute. But so far, no
breakthrough has been made.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Israel's security cabinet ordered the closure
of the three offices in the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials argued that peace agreement signed between
Israel and the Palestinians ban the PNA's activities in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Faisal Husseini, a top Palestinian official in
Jerusalem, has said the Orient House does not represent the PNA,
noting that the compound has been working as a Palestinian center
for years.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials also warned that violence might break
out in Jerusalem if the Israeli Public Security Ministry carried
out the closure order.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani reportedly proposed that the Palestinians move two
of the three offices to Abu Dis, an Arab village near
Jerusalem, while keeping another office open at the Orient
House.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side said that they would not accept any
proposal forcing them to close offices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Husseini told Israel Radio on Sunday that the
Palestinians have put forward "a new ideal" to solve the dispute,
and Israel has not yet responded.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the traditional Arab East Jerusalem from Jordan
in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it while the
Palestinians want it their capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have accused Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of seeking publicity ahead of May 17 elections
by ordering the closure of the Palestinian building.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Human Rights Specialists Denounce NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese human rights scholars met
here today to denounce NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade and its blatant violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
 Three NATO missiles hit the Chinese embassy on Friday night,
leaving three people dead, one of them a female Xinhua reporter,
and many injured.
</P>
<P>
 The scholars expressed their indignation over NATO's
violation of Chinese sovereignty and strongly protested the
killing of the innocent. NATO's barbaric act constitutes a blatant
violation of international conventions, said Zhu Muzhi, the
president of the China Society for Human Rights Studies, and said
that it fully demonstrates that the U.S. has come to the point
that it cares about nothing in its pursuit of hegemony.
</P>
<P>
 Hegemony will only lead to the destruction of peace and human
rights and bring catastrophe to human beings, he said and called
on all human rights activists to lay bare the hypocrisy of the U.S.
and to denounce its aggression and destruction of human rights.
</P>
<P>
 For more than a month, NATO has launched air strikes on
Yugoslavia, killing hundreds of innocent civilians, destroying
towns, and forcing hundreds of thousands into exile. All this has
nothing to do with safeguarding human rights, says Professor Liu
Wenzong of China's Foreign Affairs Institute, "These are down-to-
earth fascist crimes and are a naked violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
 Professor Zheng Hangsheng of People's University says that,
for a long time, the U.S has acted as if it were the champion of
human rights in the world, but the fact is that it is using human
rights as an excuse for its own hegemony. NATO says that it was
bombing Yugoslavia to prevent "humanitarian disasters" in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, but actually, the military bloc led
by the U.S. was creating "humanitarian disasters" in the region,
he said.

Solana and the European Union to take measures to combat the
irresponsibility bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Van Der Bellen, a spokesman for the Austria's Green
Alternative, expressed his shock over the NATO missile attack on
the Chinese embassy, calling for an immediate end of air strikes
against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Direct-Selling Company Makes Strategic Shift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The well-known American direct-
selling company in China, Amway (China) Co, plans to diversify its
product portfolio in an effort to boost its bottom line on the
basis of newly recruited investment, the China Daily Business
Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to introduce production lines of nutrition
food and skin-care products in China to expand our product series
despite still being in losses here," said Dick DeVos, president of
Amway Corporation, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
The company in March announced another 21 million U.S. dollars
in investment in China. Amway has poured in 80 million U.S.
dollars since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Amway was severely hit by the government
prohibition on direct selling, the company's only sales practice
worldwide, since last April when the ban was announced.
</P>
<P>
Amway's sales volume in China fell from 1.5 billion yuan (180
million U.S. dollars) in 1997 to only 100 million yuan (12.1
million U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
But the president said he has gained confidence in Chinese
market and made the shift.
</P>
<P>
"We have quickly shifted our sales means to open retail outlets
and employ sales representatives. The new investment after nearly
a one-year transition period demonstrated our confidence," DeVos
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Condemn NATO Strike On Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists in Beijing
condemned the U.S.-led NATO attack on the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade on Friday,
</P>
<P>
Lu Yongxiang, the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
said here at a meeting of CAS scientists that Chinese scientists
firmly support the solemn safeguarding of national sovereignty,
upholding justice, and opposing aggression and urge NATO to halt
the invasion and air strikes immediately.
</P>
<P>
Fan Mingwu, the President of CAS's Institute of Nuclear
Research, said that the nature of hegemonism will not change and,
as an institute that was involved in developing China's first
hydrogen bomb and atomic bomb, CAS will manage to provide
technological support for China's nuclear science to allow the
country with power to contend with hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shupeng, of the CAS Institute of Geology, said that the U.
S. has used over 50 military and civilian satellites, more than 50
electronic information gathering planes, and a large number of
bombers in air strikes on civilian installations and that these
acts are completely inhuman and have caused worldwide indignation.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that a lesson could be learned from the attack on the
Chinese embassy and that is that only a powerful country with
advanced technology can guarantee its own security.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized, "As long as we are equipped with science and
technology to increase national power, we can strengthen world
power for peace and maintaining national security."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Minhui, the President of CAS's Institute of Electronics,
said that they are calling on scientists all over the world to
apply science and technology to social development and ethical and
cultural progress and to curb the utilization of science for
devastating wars.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology and China Association
for Science and Technology issued statements strongly condemning
the attack on the Chinese Embassy.

<HEADLINE> China's Export of Farm Products Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China turned into a net grain
importer in the January-March period, the China Daily Business
Weekly reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
While a total import and export volume of 4.93 billion U.S.
dollars worth of agricultural goods, six percent more than a year
earlier, were recorded in the first quarter of this year, the
aggregate export volume of grain fell 31 percent to 1.17 million
tons and imports declined 12 percent to 193,000 tons. Last year,
agricultural trade slumped 10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the export volumes of rice, cotton, sugar,
vegetables and fruits all grew strongly in the January-March
period, but due to a shortage in domestic supply, the export
volume of edible vegetable oils plunged by 89 percent to 17,000
tons, while imports rose by 52 percent to 184,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural exports to Europe dropped by 14 percent, those to
Asia stopped falling in the period and achieved growth of 5.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's agricultural exports to North America,
Oceania, Africa and South America have all been gathering momentum
for growth since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Asia has supplanted North America as China's largest overseas
agricultural product supplier.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, China's imports from North
America tumbled by 22 percent to 510 million U.S. dollars,
compared to a rise of 22 percent in imports from Asia and 49
percent in those from Europe.
</P>
<P>
The renewed growth in China's exports of Agricultural produce
is expected to quicken in the second half of this year and imports
will also move up, a trade analyst told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Tang Yanli, an analyst from the Information Center of the
Ministry of Agriculture, said that the majority of China's
agricultural products are targeted at the Asian market, the
recovery of economics in this region will spark demand for China's
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural foreign trade volume hit a four-year low
of 22.17 billion U.S. dollars in 1998.

invasion.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,000 police officers, including 5,000 armed

Liu Guangding, an academician of the Chinese Academy of

</P>
<P>
Liu has been for years conducting maritime geophysics
exploration, in which similar technologies are applied.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to attack a target from three different
angles without careful, prior preparations," Liu said, "otherwise,
how would the NATO explain the fact that only Chinese embassy was
attacked and hit while other embassies in the vicinity were not in
the least be touched?"
</P>
<P>
Liu's view is also shared by many other Chinese, who held that
the US-led NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy is an open
infringement on the country's sovereignty as well as a provocation
to the entire Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Beijing students from various colleges and
universities, including the prestigious Beijing University and
Qinghua University, continued to gather outside the U.S. Embassy
to lodge their strongest protest

Students held high the pictures of the Chinese journalists
killed in the attack and place a wreath at the gate of the U.S.
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Many students wore white paper flowers and black armbands to
show their condolences on the death of the three resident
journalists in Belgrade killed in the attack.

MACAO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of representatives from a
dozen social organizations gathered at the Macao Chamber of
Commerce Sunday afternoon to condemn the NATO's bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7.
</P>
<P>
At mid-night Friday, NATO wantonly dropped three missiles from

<P>
They also voiced their resolute support for the solemn and just

representative of the Association of Returned Overseas Chinese in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Macao Association of Journalists noted
that the NATO's wanton act is not only an attack on China but also
a provocation against the peace-loving people across the world.
</P>
<P>
The NATO's act is a naked aggression and a serious threat to
the world peace and progress, said a representative of the Chinese
Education Association of Macao.
</P>
<P>
A representative from the Macao Association of Chinese Students
noted that the U.S.-led western powers keep on saying that they
safeguard human rights, however, their evil and invasive acts have
shown the world time and again that their human rights are
actually the rights of these hegemonists to kill peace-loving
people and wantonly infringe upon the sovereignty of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Speakers on behalf of the Association of Chinese Enterprises in
Macao, the Macao Women's Federation and the Macao University
Students' Union shared the view that the Chinese nation is a peace-
loving nation, the Chinese bully no other people and will
definitely not tolerate the bullying from others.
</P>
<P>
Other social bodies present at the gathering included the Macao
Chamber of Commerce, Macao Association of Neighborhood Communities,
Macao Association of Government Functionaries, Macao Association
of Importers and Exporters, and some sports organizations in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from these social bodies voiced the vehement
appeal that the U.S.-led NATO should immediately stop its invasive
act of bombing Yugoslavia and make open apology to the Chinese
people for its barbaric action.
</P>
<P>
Some speakers pointed out that Portugal, which acts as one
member of NATO, should take action to stop invasion and war and
contribute to human peace and progress.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, chairman of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, presided
over the gathering. He called on local residents to carry forward
their fine tradition of loving the motherland and Macao, boost the
morale of the nation, and get united for smooth handover affairs
in Macao.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in one and a
half years, annual rate of inflation in India fell below four
percent to 3.92 percent for the week ending April 24, the Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official figures, the news agency said that inflation,
based on wholesale price Index (WPI), declined by 0.16 points to a
76-week low of 3.92 percent from 4.08 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
This is the lowest inflation rate since November 15, 1997, when
it went down to 3.92 percent. It stood at 5.92 percent during the
corresponding week last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline was contributed to continued slide of prices of
non-food articles, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
However, the index for "all commodities" (1981-82=100)
increased marginally to 355.1 (provisional) as against 355.0
points in the previous week.

Index for primary articles fell by 0.2 percent to 379.0 as

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt over Weapons in Somalia Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Tension has been mounting in the
Southern port town of Merca since the mysterious ship carrying
the Oromo ethnic military personnel and weapons had docked at the
natural port of the town five days ago.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of heavily armed militiamen with battle wagons have
left Mogadishu for Merca town, while a similar number of
militiamen and dozens of battle wagons led by Hussein Mohamed
Aidid himself have rushed to Merca Town from Baidoa for the same
cause.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen of the same Habar Gidir clan have reportedly
gone to Merca town to take their share of the weapons on the ship
docking at the port.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, elders from Habar Gidir clan have also left Mogadishu
for mediating the dispute since Hussein Aidid had already
expressed his unwillingness to distribute the weapons among the
armed groups throughout his clan.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, all seemed to have gone off control after shooting
had started between the militiamen of Hussein Mohamed Aidid and
those of Mahdi Mohamed Jumale, the governor of the region, in the
town Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the town said the shooting sparked off at about
22:00 local time last night, had ceased for a while after the
militiamen of the governor were pushed back.
</P>
<P>
But the clashes have resumed Sunday morning after Mahdi Mohamed
 Jumale' s men have regrouped.
</P>
<P>
The subsequent clashes have left at least one combat
militiamen killed and seven others from both sides wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to confirmed reports, the militiamen loyal to the
governor Jumale were defeated by the overwhelming multi-sub clan
militiamen of Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said the militia commander of the governor was
 apprehended after many of his men were disarmed while many of
them have also fled the town of Merca this morning.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in the town said miscellaneous machine guns
(heavy and light), rocket propelled grenades and ammunition were
seen being off loaded from a barge which took them from the ship
about two hundred meters off the shore.
</P>
<P>
There is no word of armed personnel carriers, but various kinds
of anti- aircraft heavy machine guns are reported to be among the
stock on board the ship. Also, tons of coal is being loaded onto
the ship.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the mysterious ship in Merca had coincided with
the resignation of all nine members of the district council in an
unusual meeting.
</P>
<P>
In their resignation document, the committee said their
resignation was prompted by the cessation of 95% of the activities
of the natural port of the town which had subsequently terribly
increased the unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The increased insecurity and the tax collected from the
business centers which never return back to the town are among
the matters which forced the local authority to step down.

COPENHAGEN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's hope to win the
Sudirman Cup was given a heavy blow when its top women player Mia
Audina pulled out of the sixth edition of the mixed team event
which starts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mia, who established her name at the age of 14 when she

forced to quit the championships after her mother suffered a fatal

The ace shuttler, who succeeded Susi Susanti as the top player
in Indonesia, married a Suriname boy Tylio Lobman without asking
for leave from the Indonesian Badminton Association after the All-

federation which made her feel upset.
</P>
<P>
A close source to the Indonesian team told Xinhua that Mia, who
did not train regularly in the last eight weeks, was not in her
top form at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she could have performance to our satisfaction
in Copenhagen," she said.
</P>

Her absence will boost the chances of other badminton powers

<HEADLINE> Asia Near Winning Battle for World Cup Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of winning the battle for
more places in the 2002 World Cup seems clearer for Asia as FIFA
president Sepp Blatter is said to show his backing ahead of a
decisive executive committee meeting in Los Angeles in July.
</P>
<P>
"We have positive signs from the president that he will take
over this matter personally and solve it for us," said Abdullah Al
Dabal, a FIFA executive committee member of Saudi Arabia, during a
recent visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
FIFA had allocated Asia last December only four places for the
2002 soccer premier event, which includes two automatic spots for
co-hosts Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
This would leave over 40 countries and regions fighting for
just two places for the first World Cup to be staged in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We want our legitimate right of three and a half places, like
we had for France, plus two as co-hosts. " said Al Dabal, who is
the Asian Football Confederation's representative on the 2002
World Cup organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
He added that Asia may be prepared to compromise to help
Blatter find a solution and avert a threatened Asian boycott of
the qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
"We might not get one and a half, we might be negotiated into
one; but we will not accept less than one."
</P>
<P>
Asked if Asia would be prepared to join a series of playoffs to
secure a third qualifying spot, Al Dabal said: "We will not enter
into any kind of playoff with another confederation. Definitely we
will not accept that."

Edwards could face an probe by English Football Association (FA)
for his comments on referee David Elleray following controversial
decisions in United's match against Liverpool last week.
</P>
<P>
The FA confirmed on Sunday they will speak to the Old Trafford
chief who is reported to have accused Elleray in a Sunday
newspaper of giving Arsenal and Chelsea a boost in the Premiership
race with controversial decisions in the United's high-charged 2-2
draw.
</P>
<P>
He said the referee should get a championship medal if either
of the London clubs pipped United to the prize. And he hinted the
club could seek an unprecedented inquiry into the referee's
handling of the passionate encounter at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Elleray awarded Liverpool a controversial penalty in front of
the Kop last Wednesday, giving Jamie Redknapp the chance to score
and haul his team back into the game at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
The referee then gave Denis Irwin his marching orders, showing
him a second yellow card for time-wasting, before Paul Ince
grabbed a late equalizer which cost United two valuable
Premiership points.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said the matter would be investigated
by compliance officer Graham Bean.
</P>
<P>
"We will be writing to Martin Edwards to seek his observations
on the comments attributed to him," he said. "From there we will
decide what action if any needs to be taken."
</P>
<P>
Alex Ferguson also slammed Elleray's performance straight after
the game but the FA will not take action against the United boss
because the referee did not include it in the official report.

<HEADLINE> Israel Postpones Talks With Palestinians Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A scheduled meeting between
senior Israeli and Palestinian officials, aimed at solving the
dispute over the closure of the Orient Office in eastern
Jerusalem, was postponed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was put off at the request of Israeli Public
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, who said he could not hold
talks with senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
But Kahalani did not give explanation for the postponement.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in a week that the negotiations over
the Orient House issue were canceled.
</P>
<P>
Israel's security cabinet ordered the closure of the
Palestinian National Authority's (PNA) offices in the Orient
House at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have said that the peace agreements signed
between Israel and the PNA ban the Palestinian activities in
Jerusalem, but the three offices in the Orient House have been
working for the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In response, Faisal Husseini, a top Palestinian official in
Jerusalem, has said the Orient House does not represent the PNA,
noting that the compound has been serving as a Palestinian center
for years.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials also warned that violence might break
out in Jerusalem if the Israeli Public Security Ministry carried
out the closure order.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani reportedly proposed that the Palestinians move two of
the three offices to Abu Dis, an Arab village near Jerusalem,
while keeping the other office open at the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians said that they would not accept any offer
forcing them to close the offices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Husseini told Israel Radio on Sunday that the
Palestinians have put forward "a new ideal" to solve the dispute,
and Israel has not yet responded.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the eastern Jerusalem from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast War and later annexed it, while the Palestinians
want to establish a future capital in the eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace agreements signed by the two sides, the
issue of Jerusalem should be settled in the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have accused Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of seeking publicity ahead of May 17
elections by ordering the closure of the Palestinian building in
the eastern Jerusalem.

Shao Yunqing, the younger sister of Yunhuan, denounced NATO's
act a infringement of human rights, and, on behalf of all of Shao
Yunhuan's relatives, urged NATO to confront the truth.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had talked about human rights, democracy and freedom,

death can bring peace as will peace-loving people all over the
world."
</P>
<P>
Ye Lijuan, Shao's sister-in-law, said she could not believe it
when she heard the news and said that Shao's brother broke the
family's TV set to hold the news back from her parents, who are in
their 70's.
</P>
<P>
"We gave them tranquilizers before telling them the truth, but
they were too grief stricken to take the sudden loss of their
daughter," she said.
</P>
<P>
Local leaders visited Shao's home today and to expressed their
condolences. Shao Fangyuan, her father, and Xu Xiuhua, her mother,
who are both above 70, have retired from jobs in the textile
industry, expressed great indignation. "She called me from
Yugoslavia," her father said, "I heard the sound of bombing on the
phone, but she said she was safe. She had written a lot of reports
about NATO's crime. I am proud of such a good daughter."
</P>
<P>
Her mother said, "I feel pain at the loss of my daughter. But
if any child of mine can carry on her work, I will let him or her

<HEADLINE> Chinese Residents Continue to Express Indignation Over NATO Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- More and more Chinese residents took
to the street today to express their utmost indignation over and
condemnation of U.S.-led NATO's attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is a
premeditated act of NATO led by the United States," said Wu
Guozhen, an engineer from a research institute in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO had claimed that their missiles can hit target
very accurately, so it is impossible that all three missiles
hitting the Chinese Embassy were launched by mistake," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu directly went to the U.S. Embassy as soon as he returned to
Beijing this morning from a business trip.
</P>
<P>
"I learned of the news of the attack last night on TV in
Shenyang, and I was sure that there will be protesters here today,
so I just came here to join them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Approximately more than 20,000 students from various colleges
and universities, including prestigious Beijing University and
Qinghua University, gathered outside the U.S. Embassy buildings to
lodge their most indignant protests.
</P>
<P>
The students carried streamers or placards bearing such slogans
as "Protest against NATO's atrocities" and "Carry forward the
spirit of the May 4th Movement." The protesting drew large crowds
of local residents.
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy at midnight Friday
killed three resident Chinese correspondents in Belgrade, and
seriously damaged the embassy building.
</P>
<P>
"The attack is a deliberate provocation against China," said a
Chinese businessman.
</P>
<P>
"U.S.-led NATO should shoulder all responsibilities," he said.

politics" and demanded open apology from the U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>

the photos of the deceased Chinese journalists, chanted "Give us
back the embassy and give us back our compatriots."
</P>
<P>
No matter what sector they represent, most protesters expressed
their "firm support" to the "solemn position of the Chinese
government."

Limited carried a national flag of the People's Republic of China
and voiced their support.
</P>
<P>
"We are Chinese," one said.
</P>
<P>
"We want peace, not war. Stop bombing," students from the
Baptist University of Hong Kong chanted.
</P>
<P>
A group of Yugoslavs, Australians and Canadians living in Hong
Kong brought their families to the front gate of the U.S.
Consulate and threw red paper planes representing bloody missiles
into the consulate.
</P>
<P>
NATO is killing in the name of democracy and human rights, a
Yugoslav who has lived in Hong Kong for five years said.

NATO has killed Albanians, Serbs and the Chinese, and anyone
can become a target, he said.
</P>
<P>
A group of over 100 protesters organized by the Hong Kong
Overseas Chinese General Association said in a protest statement
that the "barbarian act" was a "open challenge to the Chinese as
well as the world people."
</P>
<P>
"Down with hegemony. Safeguard our dignity," they chanted.
</P>

rights, is killing people and openly violating of human rights,
the statement said.

the NATO crime of bombing the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia which
left at least three people killed and over 20 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said in a
statement that Iraq reiterated its solidarity with China and
Yugoslavia against the U.S. aggression, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf said the criminal incident of bombing the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade is a new evidence that the U.S. officials are
irrespective of other countries' people.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. could commit every crime against any
other country in service of its goal.
</P>
<P>
"The aggression on an embassy of a permanent member state in
the U.N. Security Council sheds light on the level of crimes
America commits in the Arab and Muslim world, including Iraq,"
said Sahhaf.
</P>
<P>
He said that all independent countries in the world must be
alarmed to prepare what is required to confront this mad monster
before its evils touch them directly.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the Chinese embassy is considered as another
phase of the U.S.-led NATO aggression against the Yugoslav people
since March 24.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and more than 20 others injured in
NATO missile attacks against the Chinese embassy in Belgrade late
Friday.

BANGKOK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai and foreign journalists in
Thailand Sunday condemned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO)'s attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, saying it is a
"crime of war".
</P>
<P>
Thavee Yodpetch, editor-in-chief of Sing Sian Yit Pao Daily
News, the most long-standing Chinese newspaper in Thailand, told
Xinhua that he was furious over the attack which killed three
Chinese persons, including a Xinhua correspondent.
</P>
<P>
He said the barbaric act was an invasion to the Chinese
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"I myself always oppose the use of force in solving the Kosovo
crisis and I'm very concerned over the deaths of innocent people
during the air war," Thavee said.
</P>
<P>
He called the NATO to stop the bombing of Yugoslavia
immediately and solve the crisis by negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Evgueni Belensky, correspondent of the Izvestia Newspaper of

</P>

The United States had said that the attack was a mistake due to
"faulty information".

MACAO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A leading businessman in Macao on

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Witness Total Solar Eclipse, Says Expert </HEADLINE>

BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi astronomer has predicted
that Iraq will observe a total solar eclipse at 0800 GMT on
August 11, a local newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Babel daily quoted Dr. Fadhil Saleem Naji, a specialist in
solar and lunar eclipses studies, as saying total darkness
will be observed and will be followed by a drop in temperature.
</P>
<P>
In Iraq, August is the hottest month in summer and the air
temperature sometimes reaches as high as 56 centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Naji said this kind of total solar eclipse happens only
once every 500 years and is considered as one of the rarest cases
in astronomy.

MADRID, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Masao Azuma kept his perfect
record this season as he won the third straight 125cc grand prix
in his Honda on Sunday at Jerez de la Frontera, Spain.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese racer swapped the lead several times with Italy's
Lucio Checchinello and Spain's Emilio Alzamora in an enthralling
and close race before Azuma came in first to finish the 23 laps
of the 4.423-kilometre Jerez circuit in 42 minutes 25.263 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Azuma held the lead coming into the final lap but on the last
bend Alzamora overtook him only for Azuma to regain his place at
the front in the last meters as the chequered flag was poised to
drop.
</P>
<P>
Checchinello also got past Alzamora with a last-ditch effort to
snatch second place. Honda made a clean sweep of the podium
positions finishing 1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
Azuma now has a commanding lead in the riders' championship
with 75 points to Alzamora's 56.

<HEADLINE> Protest Launched around German, British Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of college students and
urban residents today converged on the site of the German and
British embassies in Beijing to protest against the U.S.-led NATO
attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In front of the German embassy, some people were seen holding
high a Chinese national flag with words reading "this is a
sovereign state."
</P>
<P>
A young man, who came from the beautiful city of Hangzhou in
east China's Zhejiang Province, was raising a banner with the
words reading" the rise and fall of the nation is the concern of
every citizen".
</P>
<P>
Many people dressed in black with a white paper flower to
express their condolences over the passing of three correspondents
killed during the attack.
</P>
<P>
Some students described this as the best way to commemorate the
May 4th Movement, a mass patriotic movement which took place in
Beijing 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
At the British embassy, protesters sang the Chinese national
anthem, and held banners "long live the motherland."
</P>
<P>
The protesters were orderly on the whole, though some of them
were excited with feelings sometimes. And many college students
wore school badges or carried their students identification cards.
</P>
<P>
Protests in Beijing began Saturday afternoon in front of the U.
S. Embassy, after local residents learned about the NATO's attack
on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia on midnight Friday, which
devastated the embassy, and left three correspondents dead and
more than 20 embassy staffs injured.
</P>
<P>
Today, thousands of people, mostly young students, continued
their protest around the compound of the U.S. embassy.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Begin Competitive Efforts for   Readership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China's newspapers are feeling the
pressure of the market reforms they are more used to chronicling
than suffering.
</P>
<P>
"There was virtually no competition in Beijing among newspapers
before the birth of the Beijing Morning Post," said Chen Kexue,
executive deputy editor-in-chief of the paper, which claimed a
daily circulation of 150,000 upon its launch on July 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The post was set up by Beijing Daily, Beijing Evening News and
Beijing Youth Daily with a combined investment of 10 million yuan
(1.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Post has posed a substantial challenge to the
advertising income of its three parents. In its five months of
operation last year, it pulled in 18 million yuan in advertising
revenue.
</P>
<P>
"That almost covered our launch costs, including installation
of new equipment," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
"We don't print too many long stories, we just provide readers
with a whole bunch of news," Chen said. " People have tighter
schedules than before and thus cannot afford to read many so-
called in-depth reports. They need quick information, and that's
where we come in."
</P>
<P>
Chen's paper is one of the five or six local papers in Beijing
with a daily circulation of more than 100,000. Like the rest of
the country, Beijing newspaper sector is divided into rich and
poor papers.
</P>
<P>
According to China Newspaper Association, the country's 2,200
papers had total advertising income of 10 billion yuan (1.2
billion US dollars) last year. But two percent of the papers
garnered 70 percent of the revenue.
</P>
<P>
Compared to local or specialized newspapers, many Party-run
papers are slower to respond to market challenges. These papers
often cannot resist the ingrained habit of printing the relatively
old stilted, dull stories.
</P>
<P>
But Wang Jiannan, editor-in-chief of Harbin Daily, had the guts
to turn his paper into a corporation in 1998. It now also
produces electric meters and has a trading firm in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Gone are the days when government departments had to buy your
paper," said Wang, implying that papers today have to rely more
and more on individual subscribers for survival.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, we have to say what the Party wants to say in a
more accessible way."

urged.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set up Industrial Investment Fund: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will set up a 10
billion-taka (206.19 million U.S. dollars) industrial investment
fund to hasten industrialization across the country, Finance
Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The fund, together with a 100 million-dollar bond, would help
create entrepreneurship in the country, Kibria said at the 20th
consultative committee meeting of the National Board of Revenue.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of the industrial fund and the dollar
bond, some of the problems of the industrial sector would go, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Industrialization would remain a dream if we cannot create
entrepreneurship in the country. Entrepreneurship would not be
created through export processing zones (EPZ). We encouraged EPZs
to attract foreign direct investment. Now we want to create newer
export sub-sectors. Seize the opportunities," he told the
businessmen at the meeting,
</P>
<P>
"You are in the driving seat of the national economy. We are
expediting the privatization, and exploring new opportunities and
new areas of exports to expand the base of the national economy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kibria sought the goodwill of the businessmen in increasing tax
collection, clamping down on tax evasion and simplifying tax
regulations. Without adequate revenue earnings, he pointed out,
funding for infrastructure building and basic services like
education and health could not be generated.
</P>
<P>
He assured the businessmen of removal of tax anomalies,
inconsistencies and discretion for evolving a balanced tax
structure and urged them to help boost revenue earnings to support
the nation's development programs.
</P>
<P>

Shao Yunhuan, a female journalist serving Xinhua News Agency,
and Xu Xinghu and Zhu Ying, a couple working for China's Guangming
Daily, were killed in the NATO bombing Friday night of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade.

<P>
More than a dozen of Chinese journalists staged a protest in
front of the U.S. Embassy, shouting anti-American and anti-NATO
slogans such as "Stop Killing", "Punish Murderers", "NATO Is
Criminal" and raising placards bearing the portraits of the three
victims.

Two representatives of the Chinese protesters entered the

accepted by Minister-Counsellor of the U.S. Embassy Vincent
Battle.

"We came to express our indignation and lodge a protest against
the attack by the U.S.-led NATO on the Chinese Embassy in
Yugoslavia, killing three of our colleagues," the representatives
told Battle.
</P>
<P>
They demanded that the letter of protest be transferred to the

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Scores of Macao University students,
who come from the inland areas of China, gathered at a downtown
square of Macao Sunday afternoon to protest against the NATO's
brutal bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Amid the chanting of slogans, copies of a statement written by
the students were distributed to the Macao residents and tourists
standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that an embassy symbolizes the sovereignty
of a country and should be protected in accordance with the
relevant international law.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's attack on the Chinese embassy is barbarian invasion of
the sovereignty of our country and overt provocation toward the
Chinese people," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"What is intolerable is that the U.S.-led NATO has been
indulged in sophistry in the face of the brutal act it committed,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Marching in the square, the students sang the Chinese national
anthem time and again and chanted slogans such as "Stop Bombing!",
"Fight Against Hegemony!", "Chinese People Cannot Be Humiliated!",
"Safeguard National Integrity!", "Stop Brutal Action!" and "We
Want Peace!"

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka Tea Earnings Drop Sharply Despite Record Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The dual impact of falling exports
and dropping prices reduced Sri Lankan tea export earnings by
almost 25 percent in rupees terms in the first quarter of 1999
compared to the same period of last year despite a record harvest,
tea brokers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, the world's largest exporter of tea, earns 9.7
billion rupees (139 million U.S. dollars) in January-March this
year, a drop of 3.2 billion rupees (46 million dollars), major tea
broker Forbes and Walker said in its market report.
</P>
<P>
Export volumes during the first quarter at 60.3 million kilos
were eight million kilos less than that in the same 1998 period,
the brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The average free-on-board (FOB) value per kilo of tea stood at
161.28 rupees (2.31 dollars) during the first quarter, compared
with 188.75 rupees (2.7 dollars) for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1999, all three months notched all-time
high production, enabling the crop at the end of the first quarter
to surge 25 percent to 72.2 million kilos against 58 million kilos
a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Noted Scholars Meet to Protest U.S.-Led NATO's Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 50 prestigious scholars from
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) met in Beijing today
to protest against the NATO's barbarous attack on the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They voiced a full support to the Chinese government's
statement over this issue. The atrocity has taught all peace-
loving people in the world an unforgettable lesson, they said, and
behind the NATO's countries' human rights mask is only
falsefulness and hegemony.
</P>
<P>
The whole world will see still more clearly the true feature of
the U.S. "democracy and human rights," they added.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that only under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and only when China is strong enough, can the
nation contribute still more to world peace.
</P>
<P>
"The updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines in
emergencies in the unspecified areas surrounding Japan, the so-
called new concept of the NATO and a series of other symptoms have
showed very clearly that the U.S., leader of the NATO, is still
striving to seek world hegemony and there are no justice and
international rules at all in its head," said Tao Wenzhao, a
research fellow of American Studies under the CASS.
</P>
<P>
Yin Yungong, a scholar with the CASS's institute of journalism,
noted that a NATO spokesman didn't allow Chinese reporters to
speak at the press conference yesterday right after the attack.
This, he said, and together with the NATO's bombing of Yugoslavian
TV stations, have shattered the U.S. myth of "free media" to
pieces.
</P>
<P>
"The history has proved and will continue to prove that justice
will eventually defeat hegemony, and the force of peace will
eventually overwhelm that of war," he said.

<HEADLINE> Divorces Increase in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Divorces are increasing in Zambia
with at least one out of every 15 women below the age of 35 being
divorcees, according to Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted a report compiled by Southern
African Women's Family Tiers Association as saying that divorce
cases in Zambia are steadily rising and almost going to the levels
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is a pity that couples are now opting for divorces instead
of reconciliation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Most affected people are men and women below the age of 35
whose age group seems to the less compromising one, said the
association, which has an office in the country.
</P>
<P>
It said that for women, most of them married early and by the
age of 30, they will have gone through a divorce.
</P>
<P>
Zambian coordinator Grace Kabwe was quoted by the newspaper as
saying in Kitwe, northern Zambia, Saturday that the association
will offer free counselling to Zambian couples and encourage
reconciliation instead of always opting for divorce which has
negative implications on the family structure.
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage couples to come together and look at
starting all- over again by having proper communication in their
homes," Kabwe said.
</P>
<P>
She said most divorce cases in the country are as a result of
lack of communication between couples, forcing their relationship
to completely break up.

life as well," the FNJ said. "We, the working journalists of
Nepal, strongly condemn this cruel and blind attack of missiles
against the pen."
</P>
<P>
"We take this kind of wild action very seriously and think that

Two agreements were signed during the visit, one on air
transportation and the other on cooperation in fighting against
organized crime.

<HEADLINE> Whampoa Alumni Condemn U.S.-Led NATO's Barbarous Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A forum was held here today by the
Huangpu (Whampoa) Military Academy Alumni Association (WMAAA) to
condemn the U.S.-led NATO's raid on the Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia at midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the forum said the atrocities committed by the
U.S.-led NATO forces was a gross tramping on China's sovereignty,
a grave provocation to the Chinese people, and a wanton trample on
international conventions and fundamental norms of international
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Whampoa alumni were shocked to learn the brutal act of the
U.S.-led NATO, which filled them with indignation, and lodged an
utmost condemnation and the strongest protest.
</P>
<P>
While voicing their full support to the Chinese government's
statement condemning the U.S.-led NATO raid, and its upright
stance safeguarding national sovereignty, upholding justice and
fighting against invasion, the participants also sent condolences
to the journalists victims in the raid and extend sympathy to the
families of the victims and people injured in the raid.
</P>
<P>
At the midnight of May 7, U.S.-led NATO forces launched three
missiles from different angles on the embassy of the People's
Republic of China in Yugoslavia, killing four people and injuring
more than 20 other people, and seriously damaging building of the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
Under the pretext of safeguarding the human records, the U.S.-
led NATO forces committed hegemonic crimes against the Yugolavian
people by carrying out 45-day-long bombings, killing tens of
thousands of civilians, participants said.
</P>
<P>
They held that U.S.-led NATO openly provoked a sovereign state
by attacking on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in disregard of
the peace-loving people's opposition and caused the worst
humanitarian catastrophe of the world today.
</P>
<P>
"The retroaction will surely encounter with the opposition of
the people of China and of the world," said the participants.
</P>
<P>
The participants called on Whampoa alumni at home and abroad to
make due contributions in safeguarding state sovereignty and
respect, halting the NATO's military invasion, combating
hegemonism and safeguarding world peace.
</P>
<P>
The WMAAA was founded in June 1984 in commemoration of the 60th

BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) convened a forum here Sunday to
strongly condemn the "barbarous" attack launched by the US-led
NATO on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said that all MOFTEC staff firmly support and will
carry out the decision of the central authorities, and resolutely
support the solemn statement of the Chinese government as well as
any action the government takes concerning the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to support the stance of the Chinese
government with concrete actions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The missile attack on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia
constitutes the rarest incident in international relations, and it
has signified that the U.S.-led NATO has trampled upon China's
sovereignty, on international conventions concerning the
protection of diplomatic missions and diplomatic institutions,
and on the norms in the international relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has fully demonstrated that the so-called human rights the
U.S. trumpeted is an utmost hypocrisy," Shi said. "Instead of
human rights, what the United States is engaged in is hegemony."
</P>
<P>
Following the end of the Cold War, the U.S. hegemonism has been
runaway to the peak, he said, adding that history has proved that
all those practicing hegemonism would come no good end.
</P>
<P>
Scores of MOFTEC officials in Beijing and former MOFTEC leaders
attended Sunday's gathering. They voiced their firm support to the
stand and any action of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The incident made them become more aware of the nature of U.S.
hegemonism of bullying the weak with its power, they said.

The MOFTEC sent a telegraph of sympathy to Chinese embassy in
Yugoslavia on Saturday morning.

NATO to take all consequences and to put an immediately halt to
its armed aggression against Yugoslavia so as to resolve the
Kosovo issue through political negotiations."

"Moreover, this severe incident has enabled us to gain a better
and deeper understanding of the reactionary nature of Western
hostile forces, and of the hideous features of hegemonism, and of
the hypocritical features in so-called safeguarding human rights,
and the incident also filled the people with still greater
patriotism and enabled them to consciously safeguard their hard-
won stability and unity and to work harder still to safeguard

<P>
The letter said that NATO's act has not only violated China's
sovereignty, but has also wantonly trampled the U.N. Charter, the
1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and international
norms.
</P>
<P>
It demanded that NATO, headed by the United States, should be
held totally responsible for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
Chinese compatriots in Argentina made clear in the letter their
opposition to any invasion and urged an halt to the inhuman war in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Chinese community in Cuba also refuted the
chicanery of the United States and other NATO countries that the
attack was accidental.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yifei, president of the Chinese Chambers of Commerce in
Cuba, questioned indignantly how come that three missiles hitting
the embassy building in three different angles could be
unintentional?
</P>
<P>
He said NATO's over-40-day brutal bombing on Yugoslavia and the
barbaric strike on the Chinese embassy indicated that the U.S.-led
NATO military organization is in complete defiance of
international norms and the U.N. Charter.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Condemns Overthrow of G.Bissau President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) Saturday condemned the overthrow of President
Joaoa Vieira in Guinea Bissau, saying it was "inconsistent with
the democratic aspirations" of the people in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by the 16-member organization,
ECOWAS Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate said the "violent
overthrow of the legal and democratic institutions" in that
country offered no viable solution to the current political crisis
in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
It is in flagrant contravention of the spirit of the Abuja and
Lome accords on the resolution of the conflict in Guinea Bissau,
the statement said one day after 600 presidential guards
surrendered to the rebels led by sacked army chief General
Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the surrender of the guards marked the
end of resistance by pro-government troops after two days of
fighting with the rebels who launched their rebellion in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate urged the rebels to "abandon this venture and embrace"
the Abuja and Lome accords as the "only way to a just and lasting
settlement" of the crisis in that country.
</P>
<P>
President Vieira was forced to flee his palace when it was set
on fire by rebel forces and took refuge at the Portuguese embassy
in capital Bissau Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guinea Bissau officials said they expected Malam Bacai Sanha,
president of parliament, to be appointed interim head of state to
replace Vieira at a meeting of rebel leaders and members of
parliament later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Zamoro Induto said the constitution of Guinea
Bissau allowed for the replacement of a president by the head of
the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
Fransciso Fadul, Prime Minister of the transitional government,
said in Lisbon, capital of Portugal, that there would be no change
in the plan to organize "honest and transparent" elections in
November.
</P>
<P>
Fadul who was out of the country in Europe when the fighting
broke out Thursday night is expected to return to Bissau later
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Maize Yield to Significantly Drop In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) of
Zimbabwe said Saturday that it expected a significantly reduced
maize crop yield in the 1998/99 agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
In a review of the 1998/99 agricultural season, union President
Nick Swanepoel said the crop yield was expected to be about 1.54
million tons which fell short of local requirements of about 1.8
million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Price control, which is a significant threat to the farmer was
responsible for reducing the farmers' interest in maize as a crop
during the planning stages in June/July 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production was expected to be about nine percent lower
than the 1997/98 season total production.
</P>
<P>
The crop was adversely affected by water logging, overcast
climatic conditions and severe weed pressure, he said, adding that
production was estimated to reach 250,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
He said the end of the rains that pounded the country would see
an improvement in the condition of cattle as the rains produced
abundant grazing throughout the cattle-producing areas.

<P>
HANOI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- General Director of Vietnam News
Agency (VNA) Ho Tien Nghi Sunday sent a message of condolence to
President of Xinhua News Agency Guo Chaoren, expressing his deep
condolences over the death of Shao Yunhuan.
</P>
<P>
Shao Yunhuan, an outstanding correspondent of Xinhua News

the Chinese embassy in Belgrade (Yugoslavia) overnight May 7th,
1999."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Gulf States Urged to Reconsider Policies on Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- An official of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) has urged Gulf states to reconsider their policies
concerning the elderly, which will jump to more than 11.8 percent
of the total population in 2025.
</P>
<P>
"We should give more attention to legislation concerning
social care for the elderly," said Matar Humaid Al Tayer, Minister
of Labor and Social Affairs of the UAE, the Khaleej Times daily
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people aged above 60 in the Gulf countries would
increase from 3.9 percent of the total population to 7.7 percent
by the year 2010 and to 11.8 percent by the year 2025, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
With advanced social and health services prolonging the life
expectancy of the people, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries need to reconsider their social, economic and cultural
policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should work initially toward changing the attitudes of
individuals and to redesign the stereotyped image of the elderly
who now regarded as dependent people," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The GCC countries include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
There must be a flexibility in implementing the rules
concerning employment, said the minister, suggesting that a system
of gradual retirement and retraining of the elderly be introduced.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to formulate policies that would
provide elderly people who are physically fit with a chance to
continue working and provide the weak ones with the care they
deserve.

<HEADLINE> HK Media Strongly Condemns NATO's Attack on  Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia has aroused grave concern and strong
indignation among Hong Kong's mass media.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers, in their editorials Sunday, pointed out that
the barbarous attack on the Chinese embassy was a gross violation
of China's sovereignty and a wanton violation of the conventions
governing international relations.
</P>
<P>
This has also enabled the international community to see more
clearly the hegemonic countenance of the U.S.-led NATO which is
waving the so-called human rights banner to interfere in others'
internal affairs, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
The papers devoted a number of full-pages to editorials,
articles and photos covering the U.S.-led NATO air-raid on the
Chinese Embassy, the Chinese government's strong protest and
condemnation against this action, large-scale protests in various
parts of China and the international community's concern and
condemnation of this barbarous bombing.
</P>
<P>
Ming Pao Daily News said that an embassy is a sovereign
territory of a particular country and is sacred and inviolable. It
should be protected even during a war. The U.S.-led NATO must make
apologies and indemnities and stop air-raids, otherwise the
Chinese people and government will never let the matter drop.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said in its editorial that the bombing was not an
accident, but a crime deliberately planned and perpetrated. The U.
S.-led NATO has therefore owed blood debts to the Chinese people.
This is also a vivid lesson for the world people and those
responsible for the bombing must be thoroughly investigated, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Oriental Daily News cited the bombing of the Chinese Embassy as
the most direct military provocation against China since the
Korean War. However, the NATO only gave a slight touch on this
matter by a mere regret, fully revealing its ugly face of
hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
The paper asked: What right does the NATO have to propagate the
so-called human rights while it is utterly disregarding the lives
of the innocent people? And why the U.S. does not show the least
respect for the human rights of the Chinese Embassy personnel
while it is chattering on about the so-called "human rights" to
China?
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Daily News said that bombing an embassy is
tantamount to encroaching upon a country's territory. Such actions
can absolutely trigger a world war. The Western countries often
fear the Yugoslav issue may lead to the third world war. However,
if this happens, the arch criminal will be no other than the U.S.-
led NATO, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao in its editorial sharply criticized the U.S.-led
NATO for its hegemonic act. If NATO, which is interfering others'
internal affairs under the pretext of the so-called "human rights
above sovereignty," is bent on doing so against the tide of
history, it will inevitably be opposed and condemned by people all
over the world, the people of the U.S. and NATO countries as well,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Local TV stations and other mass media here also gave wide
coverage to the bombing and expressed their strong indignation.

sovereignty and a wanton trampling on international law.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that Chinese students' protests in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Shenzhen and other cities against
NATO's barbarian act reflect the patriotic spirit of the Chinese
people and their support for the Chinese Government's stand on
NATO's military intervention in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Students Continue to Protest against NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 Beijing students
and local residents gathered near the U.S. embassy compound today
to continue their protest against the U.S.-led NATO's attack on
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
All students voiced their unanimous support and powerful
backing to the solemn statement of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Students from a large number of colleges and universities,
including prestigious Beijing University and Qinghua University,
gathered outside the embassy buildings in downtown Beijing, to
lodge their most indignant protest.
</P>
<P>
The students held high streamers or placards carrying such
slogans as "protest to the NATO's atrocities" and "carry forward
the spirit of the May 4th movement", while moving around the U.S.
embassy area, drawing large crowds of local residents.
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack on the Chinese embassy at midnight Friday
killed three resident Chinese correspondents in Belgrade, and left
the embassy building devastated.
</P>
<P>
Every university was marked by a squad of students who held
high their university flag, stopped briefly at the embassy gate
and shouted slogans in protest even louder when passing by the
gate.
</P>
<P>
Among the columns of protesters, some college students held in
front of their chest a large paper printed with the pattern of a
target, the popular symbol for the Yugoslav people's spirit
against foreign invasion.
</P>
<P>
The protesting students drew praises and hails from Beijing
citizens who lined at each side of the street, who also shouted
slogans of protest along with the college students.
</P>
<P>
The once busy commercial Guanghualu Road, where the U.S.
embassy is located, now attracted crowds of foreign and domestic
journalists to cover the protest.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of students and Beijing residents started their
protest wave in front of the U.S. embassy on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Reduces Banana Reference Price for Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador, largest banana exporter of
the world, reduced the reference price for bananas for export by
half a dollar, in the middle of contradicting interpretations
about the present situation and the international market outlook.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture, Industries, Commerce and Integration
ministries issued an agreement in which they fixed the price at 3.
05 dollars a box of 43 pounds, starting this month, down from the
previous price of 3.55 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The producers agree with the measure and some of them asked the
government to permit them to agree on prices with the exporters,
or to sign commitments of shared risks, although there is no
unanimity in that formula.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, according to local experts, faces a period of
depression in the world market, because of the international
financial crisis, which has affected emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
It was also because of the Balkans war, since the Adriatic Sea
is in the route of fruit exports to Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Banana Exporters Association Chief Executive Officer Sergio
Seminario said that the Adriatic ports receives 1.3 million boxes
a week, which means they have missed 7.8 million boxes during the
time the conflict has lasted.
</P>
<P>
However, Seminario and other local experts, said the
perspectives are encouraging in the European Union after the
recent World Trade Organization decision that condemned the
economic bloc's regime of importing of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
The European Union accepted officially this week the WTO
decision, and showed its willingness to start consultations with
Ecuador to discuss the recommendations by the world organization's
panel of directors.

<HEADLINE> US Experts Denounces NATO Attack on Chinese Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO attack on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is "the latest crime" in NATO's seven-
week killing spree in the Balkan state, a well-known expert on
Balkans affairs said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Danielle S. Sremac, director of the Institute for Balkans
Affairs, said in a written interview with Xinhua that the Serbian
people "deeply regret" the crimes committed by NATO Friday night,
which caused three Chinese people dead and over 20 injured.
</P>
<P>
She added that NATO also bombed a hotel in Belgrade on Friday,
and pummeled a hospital and a marketplace in Nis on Thursday in
which 15 innocent civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
"Attacks on purely civilian targets are war crimes, and
President Clinton must be held accountable," said Ms Sremac, who
has worked for seven years in Washington to help policy makers and
media with a better understanding of the Balkans and the intricate
problems that beset this vital region of southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
William C. Jones, Bureau Chief of the Executive Intelligence
Review (EIR) told Xinhua in a telephone interview that he was "
shocked" and "incensed" by the strike of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade by NATO, which he condemned as a bloody "war machine"
powered mainly by the United States and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jones expressed his condolences over the death of Shao Yunhuan,
a Belgrade-based female correspondent from the Xinhua News Agency,
and two other Chinese journalists working for the Guangming Daily,
in the NATO airstrikes, in which three precision guided missiles
hit the embassy building from different angles.

Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr., a famous economist who founded EIR 25
years ago, also sent in a written statement, calling for "
immediate courts-martial proceedings" against those in the NATO
command who are responsible for the deaths at the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"There should have been standing orders at all relevant levels
against any targeting which would have put the embassy and
consular offices of neutral powers at any conceivable risk. The
lack of such standing orders would be sufficient grounds for
courts-martial proceedings against officers at the highest ranking
positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The location of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade gives no ground
for the allegation that the bombing is "merely an unfortunate
effort," he said.
</P>
<P>
LaRouche urged the U.S. government to denounce the attack of
the Chinese embassy and hold those in the NATO command responsible.
</P>
<P>
Anchrei Sitov, bureau chief of the Washington Bureau of Itar-
Tass, said on telephone with Xinhua that he is indignant at NATO's
strike at the Chinese Embassy, describing it as a gross violation
of international norms.
</P>
<P>
NATO's sustained air strikes have caused heavy losses of lives
and properties in Yugoslavia, and Friday's missile attack of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade has made some Chinese journalists and
their relatives "new victims of this unjust war."
</P>
<P>
"We condemn NATO's military campaign in Yugoslavia. Now the
whole world has come to see that NATO must stop bombing Yugoslavia
and killing the innocent people," he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Drafts Law to Combat Computer Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Council of Information
Technology (CINTEC) has appointed a special subcommittee to
examine and finalize draft legislation on computer crime, the
Sunday Observer reported.
</P>
<P>
The Computer Crime Act, which would be handled over to the
government within the next two weeks, aims to criminalize
international securing of unauthorized access or harm to any
computer, program data or information, said Kolitha Dharmawardena,
legal consultant at the CINTEC law center.
</P>
<P>
He said laws to deal with the pornography menace on the
Internet would also be incorporated and those who introduce
pornographic material of gross indecency through the computer
medium would be penalized.
</P>
<P>
"The experience with the CIH alias Chernobyl virus which was
the first time that a computer bug was spread so widely all over
the world necessitated the importance of countries being equipped
with computer laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka, according to CINTEC sources, is taking the lead in
South Asia in establishing laws related to computers.
</P>
<P>
The CINTEC had taken the initiative in January last year in
bringing specialists on legal drafting of intellectual property
rights law to Sri Lanka.

He said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua that NATO's so-
called "mistakes" have escalated by nature from day to day and now
it is obvious that they are by no means accidental, but a kind of
tactics, whose consequences could be very serious.

to damage the peace process.

Earlier, Italian Prime Minister Massimo Dalema sent a telegram

BONN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian special envoy Vikter
Chernomyrdin Saturday urged NATO to stop bombing Yugoslavia as

Arthur Beals, the Presbyterian Church's disaster relief

"The bombing attack on Yugoslavia has created a lot of problems
and this (missile attack on the Chinese embassy) was one of the
unfortunate ones," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Terrible, terrible," he uttered repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. relief worker, who has visited China several times,
said, "I would hope the goodwill between the Chinese people and
the American people could prevail over" the stupid bombing of the
Chinese embassy by U.S.-led NATO.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the war stops. I think the bombing strategy of NATO was
not a good strategy in the beginning," he said. "I never think it

it."
</P>
<P>
Military and diplomatic miscalculations by the United States
have made the matter worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
"America should have learned since World War II that bombing
has never solved any problem," he added.

The Chinese embassy in Belgrade was attacked by three NATO
missiles Friday night and three persons including two Chinese

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Isaiah Rider took some of the
blame when the Portland Trail Blazers finished poorly in the
regular season, but he deserves all of the credit for their
terrific start to the playoffs today.
</P>
<P>
Rider scored 17 of his playoff career-high 25 points in the
second half as the Trail Blazers snapped out of an early funk and
defeated the Phoenix Suns, 95-85, in Game One of their Western
Conference first-round series.
</P>
<P>
After a 27-6 start, the Trail Blazers went 8-9 down the stretch,
relingquishing the league's best record. Always a talented but
troublesome player, Rider was late for a handful of practices and
was blamed for disrupting an otherwise harmonious season.
</P>
<P>
On the court, Rider was outstanding. Often operating in the low
post, he made four consecutive shots and scored eight points in
the third quarter as Portland began to show sings of life.
</P>
<P>
Brian Grant added 16 points and 10 rebounds for Portland, which
won a playoff series opener for the first time since the 1992
Western Conference finals against Utah.
</P>
<P>
Jason Kidd scored 17 points and George McCloud added 15 for the
Suns, who managed just one basket in a stretch of six-plus minutes
of the fourth quarter and have lost six of their last seven
playoff games dating to 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We got a little too excited and took some quick shots that
hurt us," Kidd said. "If some of those shots go in, it would be a
different game."
</P>
<P>
Portland closed to 41-40 at halftime and scored the first six
points of the third quarter. Rider's fourth straight basket pushed
the lead to 62-56 with 3:22 left. Phoenix went to a small lineup
but committed four turnovers in the remainder of the period.

and Utah Jazz. Only five minutes were required to decide their
playoff opener.
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone and Greg Ostertag triggered a quick start and the
experience of the Jazz was too much for the exuberance of the
Kings in a 117-87 rout in their Western Conference first-round
series opener.
</P>
<P>
The loss was the worst in 119 all-time playoff games for the
Kings, who entered the NBA in 1949 as the Rochester Royals. Their
previous worst was a 112-94 setback to the Philadelphia 76ers in
1967.
</P>
<P>
"We had these guys three times in overtime and they beat us
once and the others could have gone either way," Malone said. "We
needed to know where we're at as a team because we haven't been
playing great basketball."
</P>
<P>
"I don't have much to say," Kings coach Rich Adelman said. "
They took it to us in just about every way they could do it."
</P>
<P>
Brash and young, Sacramento was playing in its first playoff
game since 1996 while aging and mature Utah has reached the NBA
Finals each of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
Malone scored six points in a game-opening 12-2 run that set
the tone for what should be the highest-scoring series of the
postseason. Meanwhile, Ostertag stood firm on the defensive end,
blocking a handful of early shots that soon had Sacramento
resorting to long jumpers.
</P>
<P>
"The first quarter, we had a lot of people play hard and well
and we got to open the court a little bit more and got some easy
baskets rather than rely on the half-court offense," Jazz coach
Jerry Sloan said. "That got us off to a good start. I didn't know
if we were going to be able to stay with it or not."
</P>
<P>
Malone had 21 points and nine assists and Ostertag added a
playoff career-high 16 points, nine rebounds and six blocks as the
Jazz led by double figures over the final 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Malone won his anticipated dule with fellow MVP candidate
Chris Webber, who had 14 points and nine rebounds but shot just 6-
of-18 from the field.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek scored 18 points, John Stockton added 17 and
Howard Eisley 14 for the hot-shooting Jazz.
</P>
<P>
Jason Williams, who scored 11 for the Kings, said:"I don't
know what we did wrong or what we did right or what they did wrong
or what they did right. It's just a matter of they really wanted
it a little more than us and they jumped on us early and that hurt
us."

<HEADLINE> New York Stuns Miama 95-75 in NBA Playoff Opener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks felt they
could upset the top-seeded Miami Heat today with a 95-75 victory
in Miami in the first NBA Playoff game.
</P>
<P>
Clicking on all cylinders, the Knicks raced to a 10-point
first-quarter lead and never relented, posting an impressive win
over their old rivals in the first best-of-five first round series
in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
"Coming into this playoff I told all the reporters in New York
that I didn't see any team in the East or West that I feard," said
New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
Playing the way demoted general manager Ernie Grunfeld
envisioned when it made drastic changes in the offseason, New York
got 13 points apiece from Allan Houson and Latrell Sprewell and
seized a 48-31 halftime edge.
</P>
<P>
Ewing, battling an injured left Achilles tendon, chipped in
with six points and seven rebounds in the opening half.
</P>
<P>
Sprewell and Houston each finished with 22 points as the
Knicks improved to 5-0 when the duo crack the 20-point barrier in
the same contest.
</P>
<P>
Larry Johnson hit a trio of huge 3-pointers and finished with
15 points for the Knicks, who are aiming to eliminate the Heat
from the postseason for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Last season, New York was the seventh seed when it upended
Miami in five games. Since the playoffs expanded to 16 teams in
1984, the No. 1 seed has lost just once in 30 series.
</P>
<P>
"These things happen," Ewing said. "They've blown us by 30.
Both teams mirror each other. We're pretty much the same. Alonzo(
Mourning) and I want to battle each other. Each team wants to beat
the other."
</P>
<P>
Ewing finished with nine points, 15 rebounds and four blocks
and Marcus Camby added 11 points off the bench for New York, which
despite a $55 million payroll was just 27-23 in the regular season
and did not clinch a playoff berth until the final week.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't particularly have a great offensively, but I tried
to do other things, like block shots and rebound," Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
Mourning attempted to keep Miami in the game, scoring 26
points through three quarters. But he quickly got into foul
trouble in the
final period and added just one point over the last 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Miami, which was 33-17 in the regular season, saw its bench
outscored 17-0 in the opening half and did not get a point from
its reserves until less than a minute remaining in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Heat shot just 35 percent from the field and were
outrebounded 45-34.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't plan this at all," said Het guard Tim Hardaway, who
scored just 10 points on 4-of-19 shooting. "It's hard losing by
that much at home. When you have the home-court advantage, that's
tough."

<HEADLINE> Taufik Wants to Save Steam For World Badminton Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Taufik Hidayat has
objected to playing more than twice in the Sudirman Cup competiton,
saying he must also concentrate on preparing for the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
"With only two men's singles in our team, I and Hendrawan will
share the task of facing Malaysia or China in the round-robin," he
told reporters on Saturday in Copenhagen, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia brought only Taufik and Hendrawan for the Sudirman
Cup, scheduled from May 10 to May 15, based on their performances
in two simulations late last month. Budi Santoso and Hariyanto
Arbi, who will leave Jakarta on May 13, will play only in the
World Championships from May 16 to May 23.
</P>
<P>
World No. 10 Taufik said he might have trouble beating the
Malaysians if he was fielded in Indonesia's first match against
Malaysia on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysian players have stronger defense and offense than the
Chinese," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taufik said he would prefer to meet China's Dong Jiong, world
No. 15, rather than world No. 2 Sun Jun.
</P>
<P>
"I still lead 2-1 over Dong as I beat him twice in the Brunei
Open and the Asian Championships last year and lost once in the
Asiad individual quarterfinals. I have never met Sun before. Dong
tends to attack, which enables me to break his defense, while Sun
moves faster, his offense is sharper and he has difficult balls,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Taufik said that if China fields Sun then Hendrawan
should play him.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian Games, Hendrawan beat Sun twice in the team event
and individual semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Agus Dwi Santoso, Hendrawan and Budi's coach, said: "Based on
past percentages and our strategy against other countries,
Hendrawan and Taufik are enough for the Sudirman Cup."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Sports Council to Borrow Money for Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports Council
(KONI) will borrow some 500 million rupiah (62,500 U.S. dollars)
to support the national training program for athletes competing in
the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam in
August.
</P>
<P>
Moch. Hindarto, who is in charge of athletes development, said
the money would be used to pay the athletes' board and lodging,
pocket money, recreation and laundry. KONI is waiting on
disbursement of 5.5 billion rupiah from the National Development
Planning Board (Bappenas).
</P>
<P>
He said the deficit that occurred during the waiting period
would be shared with the sports organization.
</P>
<P>
The council would pay back the loan immediately after it
receives the funds from Bappenas, he was quoted by The Jakarta
Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the training fees, KONI will also request another 7.
2 billion rupiah from Bappenas for the athletes' accommodation in
Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Hindarto said KONI would send 448 of the 549 athletes
who are participating in the national training program, which
started on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said two sports bodies, hockey and soccer, had yet to submit
a list of athletes summoned for the training program.
</P>
<P>
The SEA Games, to be hosted for the first time by Brunei, will
run from August 7 to August 15, and will offer 235 gold medals in
21 sporting events. Indonesia will compete in 20 events.
</P>
<P>
KONI would only send the most outstanding athletes for 20
sports in the Games for economical reasons.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Industrial Injury Insurance Coverage for Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China is to accelerate reform of its
work injury insurance system, according to today's China Daily
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"In two years, we should expect to achieve a higher level of
reform to achieve a higher level of reform in the industrial
injury insurance system," said Dong Zhichang, an official with the
medical insurance department of the Ministry of Labor and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
The issue is extremely important as accident at work take the
lives of more than 100,000 people in China every year and injure
several hundred thousand more.
</P>
<P>
Dong said the coverage of the injury insurance system would be
expanded.
</P>
<P>
At present, the system only covers 37 million workers, while
the country's workforce totals 300 million.
</P>
<P>
Injury insurance is mainly implemented in State-owned
enterprises, said Ge Man, director of the theoretical research
division of the Social Insurance Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Dong said the ministry would make more efforts to develop the
system of industrial injury insurance funds, under which the
enterprises are required to pay a certain premium and the fund
will cover compensation costs should an injury occur.
</P>
<P>
Before the fund system started at the end of 1980s, most
victims of industrial injury were dealt with by the enterprises
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will draft a new national regulation on injury
insurance to replace the trial regulation issued in 1996.
</P>
<P>
And Qiu Mingyue, an official with the Ministry of Labor and
Social Security, said that the new regulation would have stronger
legal power since it will clarify the punishments for enterprises
refusing to joining the injury insurance system.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a sound injury insurance system would give
better protection to workers, who would remain protected even if
their employers were to declare bankruptcy, Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
And the development of the injury insurance system will also
help improve safety in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
As the level of the injury insurance premium will be set
according to the risk levels in different enterprises, companies
will be encouraged to pay more attention to safety to reduce
injuries.

LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people took to the
streets in central London Saturday afternoon condemning the NATO
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and calling for an end
to the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, called by the Committee for Peace in the

injured.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Sven Ottke defended his IBF
super middleweight title for the second time Saturday by thrashing
Gabriel Hernandez in Duesseldorf.
</P>
<P>
Ottke controlled the fight from the first round against
Dominican fighter, winning on all three cards, 118-110, 118-110
and 119-109.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Ottke, 15-0 but with a long amatuer career
behind him, proved too experienced for Hernandez, who never solved
the German's compact defense.
</P>
<P>
The light-hitting Ottke, with just three knockouts, floored
Hernandez in the opening seconds but the Dominican shook off the
knockdown. Hernandez began to slow down noticeably after the sixth
and Ottke began to toy with him, fighting with his hands down.
</P>
<P>
Ottke had upset American Charles Brewer in October to lift the
title on a split decision.
</P>
<P>
Ottke weighed 76.1 kilograms, while Hernandez was at 75.0.

<HEADLINE> Shipbuilding Giant Faces Division Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The China State Shipbuilding Corp. (
CSSC), the nation's largest shipbuilding company, is being
restructured into two large corporate groups, said today's China
Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
One group will be known as the China Shipbuilding Industrial
Group Corp. and the other will be called the China Shipbuilding
Heavy Industries Group Corp.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Shipbuilding Industrial Corp. will belong to the
first group, and the Dalian Shipyard will become one member of the
latter.
</P>
<P>
But the principles to be applied in the shake-up and a
timetable for the restructuring are still not available. And
analysts say the move demonstrates the government's intention to
stimulate competition in the shipbuilding industry by breaking up
its monopoly structure.
</P>
<P>
However, some industry insiders say that while competition will
bring down the costs of shipbuilding, it will be hard to guarantee
the quality of vessels since ownership of many component suppliers
will be split between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
Rapid expansion has caused overcapacity in China's shipbuilding
industry. Undercutting has become rampant between domestic
shipbuilders bidding for limited orders.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, some big shipbuilders from Japan, the
Republic of Korea and Germany have also sought to establish
shipyards in China due to the low cost of quality labor, and the
labor costs usually accounting for about 50 percent of the total
for a vessel.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, a 110,000-dead-weight-ton oil vessel built by
Dalian Shipyard was delivered to A.P. Moller/Maersk Group of
Denmark -- the first of the 12 vessels ordered by the Danish
company from Chinese ship-builders in deals worth 450 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The group has been the largest customer for Chinese vessels
since the beginning of the Asian crisis.

<HEADLINE> Top U.N. Police Officer Arrives in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' chief police
adviser Om Rathor flew into the troubled East Timor on Saturday,
saying the world body would move fast to deploy an international
police force ahead of an August 8 ballot on the future of the
territory, media reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Although the timeframe is short, we will manage," Rathor was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the size of the U.N. police force had not been
determined, "but it most probably would be between 250 to 300."
</P>
<P>
Senior and competent police officers from several nations would
make up the contingent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rathor is a former senior Indian police officer who has been
involved in other U.N. police operations, including several in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
He is the first U.N. security official to arrive since
Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement Wednesday authorizing
the U.N. to supervise the ballot.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the U.N. will deploy civilian police
advisers from several countries to assist Indonesian police in
maintaining law and order. A key function will be the disarmament
of rival factions that are either for or against independence.
</P>
<P>
The August 8 ballot will allow the territory's people to choose
whether their homeland should become an autonomous region within
Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Early this year Indonesia announced it would grant East Timor
independence if the people in the territory rejected Indonesia's
offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
on Saturday condemned the U.S.-led NATO bombing of the Chinese
embassy in Yugoslavia, accusing the alliance of challenging and
provoking the United Nations, international law and the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told reporters that the strike on the Chinese embassy, a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has
further complicated the Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the foreign minister canceled his three-day working
visit to Britain due to the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
He decided to return to his ministry only minutes before
boarding a plane from Moscow's Vnukovo 2 airport, according to
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov had been scheduled to fly to Edinburgh for talks with
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>

<P>
ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- American teenager Venus Williams set a
showdown with France's Mary Pierce in the Italian Open final after
beating world number one and defending champion Martina Hingis 6-4,
1-6, 6-4 here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis and Williams were struggling to hold their serve by the
fifth game of the opening set, with the American making the first
break for 3-2, Hingis breaking back for 4-4 with a fine passing
shot, but Williams hitting 5-4 before serving out.
</P>
<P>
The second set was a one-way traffic and Williams summed up her
performance at the start of the final set. Serving out at 40-15,
she followed up with a string of errors, including a double-fault
for break point, and squandered the game by sending a forehand
long.
</P>
<P>
She recovered to break for 3-2 and the turning point only came
at the very end, when Hingis asked a line call as she trailed 0-30,
slammed a forehand wide and then fired long to concede the match
by throwing her racquet down in disgust.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, a winner here in 1997, came from behind to upset
compatriot Amelie Mauresmo 6-7 (1/7), 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo, a losing Australian Open finalist in January, will
guarantee her a career high 10th rank in the world on Monday.

<HEADLINE> South China Province's Fixed Asset Investment Up Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, south China's island province,
plans to invest 19 billion yuan this year on fixed assets, a 5.6
percent increase from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the increased investment shows that Hainan's
economy will pick up after a reverse in the downward trend since
1995. Last year, its fixed asset investment reached 18 billion
yuan, a 7.3 percent increase from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The province, which is the country's largest special economic
zone, has spent a total of 117.7 billion yuan on fixed assets
since it was founded more than a decade ago, an average annual
growth rate of 53.7 percent, nearly double the national average.
</P>
<P>
However, this spending has not produced good results. So, in
the past few years, Hainan has come up with a series of measures
to control growth in its overheated real estate sector to have
more money available for infrastructure projects.

HARBIN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- An ecological monitoring and

Wetland in northeast China has begun with Japanese funding.
</P>
<P>
Li Fengshan, a member of the International Crane Fund, says
that the wetland, which is located on the Heilongjiang-Songhua-
Wusuli river plain, has long been used by Japanese environmental
protection organizations for research, because cranes migrating to
Japan in winter stop over on the plain that is formed by the three
rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government gave Heilongjiang Province free
economic aid worth 1.5 million yuan (180,000 US dollars) to
purchase equipment for monitoring the environment to ensure a
successful implementation of the program. The equipment was all
delivered by late April, local sources say. Five Japanese
environmental protection experts have also been sent to China to
join three local experts for the program for monitoring work.

<HEADLINE> Square Zeolite Ore Discovered in North China Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have discovered a
large area of square natural zeolite ore in Uxin Banner (or county)
in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The verified zeolite reserves are estimated to be over 50
million tons, the largest in China, and are distributed over a
land area of 1,200 sq km.
</P>
<P>
The concentration rate of this ore stands at 60 percent,
according to a research report issued by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) Yichang Institute based in central China's Hubei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Zeolites are a group of white or colorless alumina-silica-based
minerals with characteristic crystal structures which occur in
nature.
</P>
<P>
Specialists note that zeolite, a kind of igneous rock, is a
rare mineral in wide-use in the manufacturing of desiccating
agents and forage additives, as well as in water purification, and
the disposal of radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
The discovery in the 1940s that some of these crystalline
compounds can be used as catalysts in industrial chemical
processes touched off a race to synthesize new zeolite materials
with improved properties for new applications.
</P>
<P>
Local government departments have been making preparations for
non-metallic-resources exploration, and a ceramic industrial
development zone is now being built near the zeolite-rich land,
according to local sources.

what had happened," he said. "Even in the wartime, diplomatic
missions should be protected" by all sides.

and disturbed" by the attack on the Chinese embassy overnight, in
which at least three persons were killed.
