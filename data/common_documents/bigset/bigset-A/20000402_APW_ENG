Mediator in Microsoft Case Gives Up
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Richard Posner, the federal appeals court judge trying to
mediate a settlement between the federal government and Microsoft, said Saturday
he was ending his effort to get the two sides to settle their differences.
Posner said in a statement that the disagreements are too deep-seated to be
bridged. At issue is a lawsuit filed by the federal government and 19 states
alleging that Microsoft repeatedly engaged in illegal anticompetitive behavior
by using monopoly power. ''It's unfortunate that a settlement wasn't possible,''
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said in a conference call.

Clinton Faults Congress on Energy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is criticizing Congress for failing to
protect the nation's energy security in the face of rising oil and gasoline
prices, especially by not renewing his authority to tap government oil reserves.
Congress should ''waste no more time,'' give him unfettered access to the
emergency stockpile and pass a range of energy measures vital to maintaining a
strong economy, Clinton said Saturday in a letter to House Speaker Dennis
Hastert. Hastert, R-Ill., responded with an attack on Clinton administration
energy policies, which he said have put the country at the mercy of the OPEC.

Volcano Evacuees Fear Worst Ahead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Thousands of townspeople hunkered down on the hard wooden
floors of makeshift emergency shelters for yet another day today as Mount Usu
sputtered with more bursts of ash and volcanic debris. Speedy orders to get
everyone out of danger areas well before Usu's first eruption won praise for the
government. But after four days in limbo, many evacuees fear the worst was still
ahead -- more volcanic spitting and weeks, perhaps months, away from their
homes. More than 15,000 residents have been forced from their homes on Hokkaido,
Japan's northernmost main island.

Protesters Oppose Returning Elian

   MIAMI, Fla. (AP) -- Even as U.S Attorney General Janet Reno appealed to
Americans not to further politicize the Elian Gonzalez case, about 100
Cuban-Americans protested the Immigration and Naturalization Service order
Saturday to return 6-year-old boy to his father in Cuba. Reno, who favors
returning Elian to his family, spoke to students at the University of Virginia
Law School on Saturday and reiterated her position that the boy's father should
have the right to speak for him. The INS has threatened to revoke the boy's
residency status, but twice last week pushed back a deadline for the relatives
to agree, now set for 9 a.m. Tuesday.

Americans Urged To Comply With Census
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton Saturday urged all Americans to
participate in this year's census, and took direct aim at Republicans who have
grumbled about the intrusiveness of some questions. ''Those who suggest that
filling out your census form isn't essential are plainly wrong,'' Clinton said
in his weekly radio address. His remarks coincided with Census Day, the April 1
once a decade on which Americans are asked to tell the government who and where
they are. Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has said he's not
sure he would fill out the 53-question ''long form,'' which includes questions
about income, education, employment and health.

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The British banking group HSBC Holdings PLC announced Saturday
that it has made a $10.5 billion bid for Credit Commercial de France and that
the board of the French bank had unanimously recommended the offer to its
shareholders. The offer is for the purchase of all outstanding shares of the
French bank at a price of $144 per share in cash or, as an alternative, 13
shares of HSBC for each Credit Commercial share, valued at approximately $154
each. HSBC said the acquisition would give it a ''significant base for operation
in the Euro-zone,'' and bring relationships with most major French companies.

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Pippen With Blurred Vision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers forward Scottie
Pippen complained of blurred vision and left during the second
quarter of Saturday night's game against the Milwaukee Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen apparently suffered lingering effects from Thursday
night's game against Dallas, when he was hit by teammate Jermaine
O'Neal's elbow in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen went to the locker room feeling woozy, but returned later
in the period and finished with 19 points in 35 minutes against the
Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   He started at small forward against the Bucks and played the
first 11 minutes before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen finished with four points on 2-of-3 shooting and two
rebounds.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Fred Brathwaite was spectacular in
making 29 saves and the Calgary Flames earned a much-needed
victory, beating the San Jose Sharks 3-0 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Damphousse, Jeff Friesen and Todd Harvey were among the
Sharks thwarted on acrobatic saves by Brathwaite, who collected his
fifth shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Brathwaite tied the franchise record for most shutouts in a
season, matching Dan Bouchard (1973-74) and Phil Myre (1974-75).
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lindsay, Jarome Iginla and rookie Sergei Varlamov scored
for the Flames, who in 11th place are five points behind the
eighth-place Sharks. Each team has four games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim Mighty Ducks and Vancouver Canucks are tied for
ninth in the conference, three points behind San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary snapped a five-game home losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably absent from the Sharks' lineup for the first time
this season was captain Owen Nolan, out with a slight shoulder
injury sustained Wednesday against the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Without Nolan, second in the NHL with 44 goals and first in the
league in power-play goals with 18, the Sharks' power-play
suffered, going 0-for-6.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary plays at Dallas on Monday and St. Louis on Wednesday
before finishing the season at home against Colorado on Friday and
Edmonton on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose continued to struggle on the road. The Sharks take a
five game winless streak into a game at Edmonton on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames took a 1-0 lead 23 seconds in when Martin St. Louis
pounced on a San Jose turnover and fed Lindsay, who deflected the
puck past goalie Steve Shields from the top of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary made it 2-0 at 9:17 of the first when Shields was beaten
from a bad angle by Iginla after he was set up by Valeri Bure.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames made it 3-0 at 6:57 of the second on Varlamov's
second goal in three games since joining Calgary last Saturday from
Saint John of the American Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Krivokrasov's centering pass found Varalamov alone in the
low slot and the rookie calmly paused briefly before ripping a shot
over Shields and in off the crossbar.

</P>
<P>
   Golman Pierre scored in the 29th and 37th minutes, and Vladimir
Edouard got the final goal in the 72nd.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's other game in the second round of Caribbean Zone
play, Barbados won 3-1 at Aruba. The winner of the series plays
Cuba or Suriname.
</P>
<P>
   At Oranjestad, Gregory Goodridge scored in the second minute and
Jenny Alexander connected in the 22nd and 85th.

men short following the ejection of Carlos Geerman early in the
first half Ichel Lopez with two minutes remaining.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 113, Bucks 79  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Damon Stoudamire scored a season-high 31
points and tied a franchise record with seven 3-pointers as the
Portland Trail Blazers handed the Milwaukee Bucks their worst loss
of the season Saturday night, 113-79.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire scored 18 points in the first quarter and sank four
straight 3-pointers to help the Blazers pull away from a 6-all tie
and quickly turn the game into a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cassell scored 22 to lead the Bucks, who had won two
straight for the first time since Jan. 29-31. Milwaukee fell 2{
games behind idle Orlando for the final playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's Scottie Pippen left the game late in the first
quarter after complaining of blurred vision. Pippen had been hit
with an inadvertent elbow from teammate Jermaine O'Neal in Thursday
night's victory over the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen played the first 11 minutes Saturday night, but came out
after scoring four points. He went to the locker room and did not
return.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's previous worst loss this season was 103-72 at home
against Cleveland on March 12.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-point margin was also the Bucks' largest at the hands of
the Blazers since March 5, 1978, when Portland won 126-88.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks stayed close for only a few minutes after everyone but
Cassell started shooting poorly. About that time, Stoudamire and
the Blazers started warming up.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers missed their first five shots, then hit nine in a
row. After Stoudamire's four straight long-range shots, Steve Smith
finished off the 18-4 burst with a turnaround 17-footer to make it
24-10 with 4:24 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The last Blazer to hit seven 3s in a game was Terry Porter, who
did it twice -- at Golden State in November 1992 and against Utah in
January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Ray Allen, who had been averaging 31 points and 66
percent shooting his previous four games, scored just 13 on 4-of-13
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams started the second quarter with reserves, but the
Blazers stayed hot. A putback by Stacey Augmon pushed the lead to
44-23 a little more than four minutes into the period. At that
point, the Blazers were 17-of-21 after an 0-for-5 start.
</P>
<P>
   Portland shot 59 percent in the half and led 65-38.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire didn't let up in the third, sinking a 20-foot jumper
and another 3-pointer to make it 70-40. Stoudamire didn't play in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, who have won two straight at home after losing four
in a row, are virtually locked into the No. 3 playoff spot in the
West. Milwaukee, meanwhile, is fighting for its life.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks have 10 games left, and only three are against teams
with winning records -- the Magic twice and Charlotte.
Notes: The Blazers, in the middle of a six-game homestand, play
host to Seattle on Sunday night. Portland is 15-3 on the second
night of consecutive games. ... Portland, which shot 51 percent, is
23-2 when making at least half its shots. ... Milwaukee is 18-10
against sub-.500 teams, but just 14-28 against teams above .500.

   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Cobi Jones and Mauricio Cienfuegos
scored eight minutes apart in the second half to rally the Los
Angeles Galaxy to a 2-2 tie with the New England Revolution on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Leonel Alvarez and Wolde Harris scored in the first half for the
Revolution (0-1-2), before 19,878 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles (2-0-1) had the overtime's best scoring
opportunities, but Sasha Victorine's shot rolled wide right of the
goal in the second minute and Zak Ibsen's shot went wide left one
minute later.
</P>
<P>
   New England played the final 13 minutes of regulation and all 10
minutes of overtime with 10 players after midfielder Ivan McKinley
was ejected. He will be suspended for Saturday's match at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez opened the scoring in the 35th minute. Mauricio Ramos
began the sequence with a free kick that Los Angeles goalkeeper
Kevin Hartman punched away while falling to the ground. The ball
went to Ramos near the penalty spot, and he sent a left-footed
volley into the unguarded net.
</P>
<P>
   Harris scored seven minutes later, collecting Ramos' pass behind
the defense and putting a shot into the upper left corner.
</P>
<P>
   Jones made it 2-1 by putting in a rebound of his own shot in the
59th, and Cienfuegos scored on a bicycle kick that ricocheted off
the crossbar.

   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Edmonton defenseman Tom Poti scored
with 1:53 left in overtime as the Oilers overcame two late Phoenix
goals to beat the Coyotes 4-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix nearly completed an amazing comeback, scoring twice with
the extra attacker in the final minute of the third period to send
the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Travis Green scored 36 seconds into the third period
then scored his second of the game with only 39 seconds left in the
period. Greg Adams tied it 28 seconds later when he lifted one past
Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-place Coyotes hold a one-point lead over Edmonton in
the Western Conference playoff race. The Oilers would have caught
Phoenix had they won in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Smyth scored two goals for Edmonton, including one on a
power play. Bill Guerin also scored for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth was reunited with former linemates Doug Weight and Alex
Selivanov, who assisted on both of his goals.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:38 of the first, Smyth redirected a Weight feed past Sean
Burke to put Edmonton up 1-0. It was Weight's 400th career assist.
</P>
<P>
   Guerin scored his first goal in 15 games when he lifted a
backhander past Burke at 17:53 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers forward Boyd Devereaux stole the puck in the Phoenix
zone, circled the net and set up Guerin's 23rd goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Devereaux later was taken off the ice on a stretcher after being
run over by Phoenix forward Dallas Drake. The hit knocked Devereaux
out and he was taken to a local hospital for precautionary
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the incident, Smyth put Edmonton up 3-0 when he
streaked to the net and beat Burke to the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth leads the team with 28 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Salo made 28 saves to earn his career-best 26th win.

By The Associated Press	   Kenny Lofton's surprising comeback to the field was a
success.
So was Shawn Green's return to Toronto.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lofton returned to the field Saturday less than four months
after undergoing surgery on his left shoulder, starting in center
field in Cleveland's final exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last hurdle,'' Cleveland general manager John Hart
said. ''It's been amazing (his recovery). The doctor said it was
something that just doesn't happen. It's a medical miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians said it was likely Lofton would start in Monday's
opener at Baltimore, but a final decision would not be made until
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he feels like this tomorrow, we'll open the season with
him,'' Indians manager Charlie Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton had appeared in three exhibition games, all as a
designated hitter, before Saturday. He is 6-for-12 with a home run
and two stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton went 1-for-3 with a walk and two stolen bases in
Cleveland's 6-3 loss to the Braves in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel OK,'' Lofton said. ''I didn't get any balls. It depends
on how I feel tomorrow. If it feels as good as it did today, I can
go ahead and play.''
</P>
<P>
   In the field, Lofton had three routine fly balls -- all with no
runners on base -- so didn't have to throw the ball very hard, and
didn't. He lobbed the ball back to the infield, some 100 feet,
after each catch.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker made a return of sorts as well, pitching at Turner
Field for the first time since offending gays, foreigners and
minorities in a Sports Illustrated article during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker pitched a hitless ninth for the save and was greeted by
mostly cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Green, traded from the Blue Jays to Los Angeles for Raul Mondesi
in the offseason, homered and had an RBI double as the Dodgers won
at Toronto 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a good way to end things because I had just
had great time up here,'' said Green, who spent five seasons in
Toronto. ''I just didn't want to be gone without returning here for
a long time. It's nice to come back right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Green asked out of Toronto so he could play in his home town.
The Dodgers then signed him to a six year, $84 million contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of fans yelled ''Traitor!'' during his plate
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were some mixed reactions but I felt good about the
responses,'' Green said. ''In my position you hear the boos a bit
more because you pay more attention to that and those fans are the
ones who are more aggressive in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''But definitely there were a lot of cheers and it felt good to
hear that support.''
</P>

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Richard Posner, the federal appeals court judge trying to
mediate a settlement between the federal government and Microsoft, said Saturday
he was ending his effort to get the two sides to settle their differences.
Posner said in a statement that the disagreements are too deep-seated to be
bridged. At issue is a lawsuit filed by the federal government and 19 states
alleging that Microsoft repeatedly engaged in illegal anticompetitive behavior
by using monopoly power. "It's unfortunate that a settlement wasn't possible,"
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said in a conference call.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is criticizing Congress for failing to
protect the nation's energy security in the face of rising oil and gasoline
prices, especially by not renewing his authority to tap government oil reserves.
Congress should "waste no more time," give him unfettered access to the
emergency stockpile and pass a range of energy measures vital to maintaining a
strong economy, Clinton said Saturday in a letter to House Speaker Dennis
Hastert. Hastert, R-Ill., responded with an attack on Clinton administration
energy policies, which he said have put the country at the mercy of the OPEC.

	   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Thousands of townspeople hunkered down on the hard
wooden floors of makeshift emergency shelters for yet another day Saturday as
Mount Usu sputtered with more bursts of ash and volcanic debris. Speedy orders
to get everyone out of danger areas well before Usu's first eruption won praise
for the government. But after four days in limbo, many evacuees fear the worst
was still ahead -- more volcanic spitting and weeks, perhaps months, away from
their homes. More than 15,000 residents have been forced from their homes on
Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island.

<HEADLINE> Prince William Sings 'YMCA'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince William and three classmates from Eton
College performed a karaoke version of the Village People's hit
song ''YMCA'' at a hotel bar during a school trip to the north of
England, according to news reports Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth II's 17-year-old grandson was among 40 Eton
students who stayed at the Crossways Hotel in Thornley, northeast
England, last week to study local geography, hotel owner John
Hudson told the news agency Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''On Thursday night we were holding our usual karaoke evening
when William leant over to me and suggested we make it into a
challenge match -- with the Eton pupils representing the south (of
England) and our regulars representing the north,'' Hudson told
Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a bit surprised but delighted by his suggestion. It was
a keenly fought competition but in the end I decided, rather
diplomatically, to call it a draw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson said the prince, who is second in line to the throne
after his father, Prince Charles, ''just acted like one of the
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   ''William and his friends were very good and got a huge cheer
when they finished. They didn't do the actions to the song because
they seemed to be concentrating on the words too hard,'' Hudson
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Charles' office at St. James's Palace
confirmed the young prince took part in a karaoke session, but
refused to give further details.

<HEADLINE> Debate Over Hatchery Salmon Vs. Wild  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILOMATH, Ore. (AP) -- Ron Yechout was elk hunting in the Coast
Range a couple years ago when he came upon technicians at the Fall
Creek hatchery bashing coho salmon in the head with baseball bats
and stripping their blood-red eggs into 5-gallon buckets.
</P>
<P>
   Yechout got his video camera -- so incensed was he to learn that
the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife was killing thousands of
hatchery fish and millions of their eggs so that about 100
threatened wild Alsea River coho could spawn without competition
from their domesticated cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Zapruder film fueled doubts over the assassination
of President John F. Kennedy, Yechout's home video is spawning
resistance to government efforts to save salmon as he shows it to
service clubs and chambers of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The video has found a receptive audience among people still
smarting over logging cutbacks to protect the northern spotted owl.
It has also sparked a legislative effort to stop killing hatchery
fish and a challenge of the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can have a California condor raised in a laboratory and
turn them loose and they are wild,'' said Yechout, the manager of a
bank in this small farming and logging town. ''Yet we have a higher
standard for fish. There is something wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcheries have been part of the Pacific salmon equation since
1872, when the U.S. Fish Commission built the first one on the
McCloud River in Northern California. Since then more than 400 have
been established from Alaska to California, turning out more than
325 million juvenile fish a year.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with hatcheries is they make people think
they can have salmon without worrying about wiping out their
spawning habitat with dams, clearcut logging and overgrazing,
biologist Jim Lichatowich argues in his book, ''Salmon Without
Rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   From the very beginning, hatcheries ignored the lifecycle that
had made wild salmon thrive for 10,000 years since the last Ice
Age. Eggs were routinely shipped as far away as New Zealand, with
no regard for the local adaptations the fish had evolved for their
home rivers. Gene pools were truncated by spawning a whole
generation from the first few fish to come in.
</P>
<P>
   While hatcheries are good at producing fish for people to catch,
they are not as good at producing fish to survive in the wild, said
Reg Reisenbichler, a biologist for the U.S. Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   To thrive in a hatchery, fish feed aggressively on the top of
the water, where their food pellets are scattered. In the wild,
that sort of behavior will get a smolt eaten by a kingfisher.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, hatcheries genetically change the behavior of the
fish, and are vulnerable to booms and busts, said Robin Waples,
director of conservation biology at the National Marine Fisheries
Service's Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcheries generally release smolts all at once, so a whole
generation can be wiped out hitting the ocean when food is scarce
or predators are plentiful. Spawners come back in a bunch, too,
making them vulnerable to the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Wild fish are spread out as they migrate to the ocean and return
to spawn, so if smolts run into a school of hungry mackerel or the
eggs laid by spawners are washed away by flood, there are others
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only sure way we know of maintaining salmon into the
future is maintaining the natural diversity we know has carried the
species through long periods in the past,'' Waples said.
</P>
<P>
   Though still considered experimental by government agencies,
tribal fisheries programs think combining higher survival rates of
young fish in hatcheries with habitat restoration will bring back
more fish for spiritual and economic use.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hood River, which runs off towering Mount Hood into the
Columbia, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs have joined
with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. They are raising
the fish under more natural conditions, and allowing the fish to
decide when to go into the river, rather than dumping them out of a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel we've got to imitate Mother Nature the best we can,''
said Mick Jennings, a former state fisheries biologist now working
for the Warm Springs Tribes. ''These fish have adapted over
thousands of years on their own. The problems in this basin are
man-caused activities.''
</P>
<P>
   They haven't been doing it long enough to see any increase in
returning adults, but they have doubled the proportion of young
fish reaching the mouth of Hood River, Jennings said.
</P>
<P>
   At Fall Creek hatchery in Oregon's Coast Range, the coho were
bred since the 1950s for fishermen to catch in the ocean. After
ocean coho seasons were essentially eliminated in 1993 to protect
dwindling wild stocks, the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission
decided to shut down Fall Creek's coho program, said Doug DeHart,
fisheries chief for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Smolt survival was seriously declining, from 5 percent in the
1970s to 0.5 percent in recent years, he said. As a mix of stocks
taken from up and down the coast and the lower Columbia River, they
lacked the local adaptations evolved by wild fish.
</P>
<P>
   DeHart's explanations didn't dissuade two state representatives
incensed by Yechout's video from crafting a bill that would bar the
state from killing off hatchery fish and create an expert panel to
review the science.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just doesn't make sense to kill an endangered species when
we're trying to keep them alive,'' said state Rep. Jeff Kropf,
R-Halsey, who with state Rep. Betsy Close, R-Albany, plans to
introduce the bill next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Legal Foundation, a property rights organization,
lost attempts to stop killing the Fall Creek hatchery coho, but has
a lawsuit arguing that the Endangered Species Act protects hatchery
coho as well as wild.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now because of the Ron Yechout video, we know why salmon are
dying,'' said foundation attorney Russell Brooks. ''The government
is killing them.
</P>
<P>
   ''That allows them to continue to list coho salmon as a
threatened species, which in turn allows them to continue to
regulate. In that regulation they control land use and resources.
That's what it is, is a land grab.''
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the foundation, retired Oregon State University
fisheries professor Jim Lannan finds the science favoring wild fish
to be weak. He notes that the two strongest wild runs of coho in
Oregon are on rivers where salmon ranching operations went bust,
leaving their domesticated stock to breed with wild fish.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I want to see is some intellectual honesty brought into
the argument and see what the public wants,'' Lannan said. ''If
they want culture-based fisheries so they can have the kind of
robust offshore fisheries they had several years ago, that's fine.
Or if they want to treat salmon like a museum piece, that's fine,
too.''

<HEADLINE> Pa. Lawmakers in Trouble With Law  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The allegations shook the Pennsylvania
Legislature: Drunken driving, kickbacks, perjury, vehicular
homicide. In the past year, eight politicians were investigated,
charged or convicted of unrelated crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One resigned; four chose not to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   For the political establishment, facing one of the nation's most
contentious battles for power, the legislators' disgrace adds more
unknowns. Who will control the state House? Who will shape
redistricting and the state's say in Congress?
</P>
<P>
   The struggle starts in earnest with Tuesday's primary, with all
the House's 203 seats and half the Senate's 50 up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   For many voters, the mess brings a big shrug. Talk show hosts
call the scandals short-lived. Politicians see only sporadic
curiosity from constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have scandal fatigue as a society,'' said Chuck Lewis,
executive director of the Center for Public Integrity in
Washington. ''There was a time in this country when eight lawmakers
in a state in trouble with the law would be shocking. Today, we're
benumbed.''
</P>
<P>
   National politics offers no respite, with its independent
prosecutors, scandals of previous administrations and President
Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe voters think eight run-ins in Pennsylvania isn't so
bad. Or maybe the crimes and accusations show that legislators,
flaws and all, look a lot like the voter in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just expect them to be human,'' said Eddie Stone, a
bartender at Scotts Grille, a hangout for lawmakers two blocks from
the Capitol. Here, authorities say, is where state Rep. Thomas
Druce headed after he struck a pedestrian -- but before he told
insurers his leased Jeep was damaged on the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The man died on the sidewalk that night. Six months later, Druce
was charged with vehicular homicide, insurance fraud and more. The
once-rising Republican star has not resigned, but his name is gone
from his office door, and he is not running for re-election. He did
not return phone calls, and pleaded innocent to all charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think they're above the law,'' fumes Penny Humer. A
mother of two, she admits she does not have much time to attend to
politics, but when she does, she dislikes what she sees.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Serafini, longtime leader of the GOP House. Convicted of a
felony, perjury. Sentenced to five months, pending appeal.
Resigned, though fellow Republicans refused to censure or expel
him.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. William Slocum Jr. Pleaded guilty to
misdemeanors, dumping sewage into a stream while supervising the
treatment plant. Seeks re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Pat Browne. Sought treatment after his second
conviction for driving drunk. Seeks re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Four others: some accused, others investigated. Three chose not
to seek re-election. One doesn't have to decide yet.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Frank Gigliotti. Charged with public corruption.
Prosecutors say he took $17,000 in bribes as a county official.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Tracy Seyfert. Charged with receiving stolen
property. Allegations in the case -- over an electric generator in
federal surplus -- became so outrageous that Seyfert held a news
conference to deny she is a witch.
</P>
<P>
   F. Joseph Loeper, the GOP Senate Majority leader. Offices
searched by the FBI in connection with his dealings with a tax
firm. No charges filed. Denied wrongdoing. Won't face re-election
until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joseph Gladeck, former county GOP chairman. Police
investigated a call about a fight with his girlfriend. No charges.
Gladeck said he sought counseling and regretted his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Capitol leaves schoolchildren open-mouthed,
with its imposing dome, soaring hallways and sweeping staircase
modeled after the Paris Opera House. Decades ago, because of the
misdeeds of lawmakers, it was known as ''The House of Ill Repute.''
</P>
<P>
   So says Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and
Public Policy at Millersville University, who recounts a politics
fueled by bribes, backroom deals and jobs bought and sold.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pennsylvania is in a class by itself,'' Madonna said. ''These
(political) organizations, for a hundred years, maintained
themselves by patronage and publicly corrupt acts.'' As that
political machine died, the Legislature became more professional,
he said; politicians began to look more like the rest of us,
shortcomings included.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna traced the old system's last convulsion to the 1970s,
when a half-dozen legislators either resigned or were removed from
office. Scandals tarnished hundreds of other officials and
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   This year's flurry doesn't compare. ''It's individual
wrongdoing,'' said Bob Durgin, host of a Harrisburg talk radio
show. ''It's a lack of character, a lack of personal ethics. It's
lawlessness is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he says, the debate has been brief. After all, the same
mistakes can be seen daily on any TV talk show. ''Maybe it's the
Oprah-ization of politics,'' said Michael Young, a political
science professor at Penn State-Harrisburg.
</P>
<P>
   The scandals barely changed voters' opinions. Madonna, the
pollster, said confidence couldn't go much lower -- barely more than
one-third said lawmakers did a good or excellent job.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes this election season are high. Democrats want a say
in redistricting, the annual redrawing of the states' political
districts that can determine which party wins Pennsylvania's seats
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Since Republicans solidly control the Senate, Democrats are
scrambling to win the House. The GOP now holds a 102-100 edge, with
one seat left vacant by Serafini, the convicted perjurer.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, the resignations alone pose a problem. They
would rather not discuss the accusations and convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a doctor in a medical association violates the law, does
that mean all the doctors are violators? Of course not,'' said Rep.
Brett Feese, who heads Republican strategy for the House elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats plan to stress just how Republicans refused to censure
Serafini. But they're no fools. They won't try to paint all GOP
opponents with the failure of a few.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public tends to view us all with a jaundiced eye, whether
one party or another,'' said Rep. T.J. Rooney, who heads strategy
for the Democrats' House elections. ''People think we're all
(messed) up.''

<HEADLINE> Dozens Die in Sri Lankan Civil War  </HEADLINE>
By ASIF ANSAR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Fierce fighting between government
troops and Tamil rebels over a strategic causeway in Sri Lanka left
78 fighters dead and thousands of residents stranded, a senior
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   K. Shanmuganathan, the highest-ranking civil official in the
Jaffna peninsula, said more than 12,500 people living near the
Elephant Pass causeway were trapped as they tried to flee the
Pallai area, 180 miles north of the capital, Colombo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are discussing (the situation) with the International
Committee of the Red Cross and other organizations ... but because
of the shelling it is difficult to enter the area,'' he told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil lawmaker Ananda Sangari wrote to President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Saturday, asking her to make arrangements to evacuate
the civilians to safer ground. Pallai is in Sangari's constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the security situation permits, then we will move,'' said
Harsha Gunawarden, a spokesman for the ICRC. He said the
organization was monitoring the situation and the needs of the
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, intense fighting continued near the causeway.
</P>
<P>
   A defense ministry statement said soldiers found 34 rebel bodies
during search operations in Iyakachchi, near Pallai, after a fierce
confrontation that began late Friday. Twenty-seven insurgents were
killed in other clashes near the causeway.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said 17 government soldiers were killed in the
fighting and 97 were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Troops in the Elephant Pass area braced for more attacks as the
Voice of Tiger, a clandestine guerrilla radio station, called on
the civilians to move at least half a mile away from all army
posts. The rebel broadcast could be monitored in the northern
garrison town of Vavuniya.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are trying to gain control
of Elephant Pass, which would cut off the northern Jaffna peninsula
from the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels say more than 700 government troops have been killed
and wounded since the attack was launched seven days ago and put
their own loses at 71. But the army admitted to only 102 deaths and
claimed to have killed 210 rebels.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the rival claims as
journalists are not allowed into the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are fighting for an independent homeland for the
Tamil minority in the north and east of the country. They accuse
the majority Sinhalese community of discriminating against the
Tamils in education and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 61,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983 in this small island nation off India's southern
coast.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Livestock Stricken Ill  </HEADLINE>
By KYONG-HWA SEOK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Scientists said Sunday that tests
showed cattle and pigs near the small village of Paju were infected
with foot-and-mouth disease -- the first confirmed outbreak in Asia
since nearly all of Taiwan's pigs were wiped out three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of the highly communicable disease began showing up
last month in Paju, 30 miles north of Seoul, and then Hongsong, 60
miles south of Seoul where officials are still conducting tests.
South Korean officials have been slaughtering infected animals,
quarantining farms and forbidding them to transport livestock.
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, 13 head of cattle also were destroyed at three
farms in southern Japan, 10 of which showed foot-and-mouth
symptoms. But Japan has not yet determined whether any of them were
suffering from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and South Korea both stopped importing beef and pork from
one another, and Australia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore banned
them from both countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The disease that infected cattle in the Paju area is confirmed
to be foot-and-mouth disease,'' Chin Young-hwa, a spokesman at the
National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service, told The
Associated Press on Sunday. ''We will continue to take measures as
we have been already.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 105 head of cattle were slaughtered in Paju.
Authorities said 20 other cattle in the same area began showing
similar symptoms late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, 93 head of cattle and pigs were killed in
Hongsong, South Korea's vice agriculture minister, Kim Dong-gun,
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The highly communicable disease often leaves animals with a
declining appetite, fevers, and blisters around their mouths and
hooves, and can cause death. Taiwan destroyed 3.6 million pigs -- 80
percent of its total -- in 1997, the last time foot-and-mouth
disease broke out in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike mad cow disease, which is believed to cause a
brain-wasting ailment in humans, foot-and-mouth disease cannot be
passed on to people.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, South Korea said it was willing to destroy 350,000
cattle and pigs within a 12-mile radius of the farms in Paju. The
government also plans to buy the meat or reimburse farmers who have
to sell their meat at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Ministry said hundreds of pigs in
Hongsong had been transported to Seoul and surrounding areas
shortly before the movement of livestock was banned there Sunday.
Quarantine officials isolated the pigs for tests, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The government was also checking on how many other cattle and
pigs have been moved out of the two areas since last month, while
almost 1,000 quarantine officials were conducting tests on selected
farms across the nation, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed soldiers setting up roadblocks in
Hongsong.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were not allowed to transport their livestock, and all
vehicles moving in and out of the area were forced to roll slowly
across thick spongy rugs doused with chemicals that suppress the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were inoculating hundreds of thousands of animals in
the two areas. Officials burned barns and suspended imports of
Chinese hay suspected of having transmitted the disease.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea last year exported 89,000 tons of pork to Japan, the
largest destination for the country's pork exports. South Korea
exports little beef.

<HEADLINE> Surging Economy Aids Politicians  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Whether it's cramming more spending into the
budget or easing voters' worries about Social Security and Medicare
solvency, politicians' jobs are being made a whole lot easier by
the blazing economy.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons the experts have yet to fully grasp, the economy is
growing at breakneck speed, causing revenue to cascade into federal
coffers and budget surpluses to swell. What once seemed
unaffordable is now deliverable for President Clinton and Congress,
a delectable election-year scenario for incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a small businessman who wakes up and finds he has
more money in the cash register than he ever thought possible,''
said Richard May, a consultant and former Republican staff director
of the House Budget Committee. ''And he not only doesn't have to
shut the shop down, he's going to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to boast to voters that you will shrink the government's
$3.6 trillion publicly held debt by at least $1 trillion over the
next five years? A GOP-written fiscal 2001 budget that Congress
hopes to finish in two weeks and Clinton's rival spending plan both
make that once implausible promise, and many expect them to
deliver.
</P>
<P>
   How about squeezing some extra money for defense and farmers,
and to battle drug producers in Colombia into this year's budget
without tapping Social Security surpluses? That's what a $13
billion measure passed by the House last week would do, with
billions of dollars to spare.
</P>
<P>
   And how about reassuring Americans that Medicare will have
enough money until 2023, and that Social Security won't run dry
until 2037? That's what trustees for both programs reported last
week, easing whatever political pressure lawmakers faced to shore
up either one for the retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   All this because, after three decades of annual budget deficits,
the government turned a $69 billion surplus in 1998. Projections
are for growing black ink for the next decade and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Some credit for this has to go to savings enacted in the 1990
budget deal between President Bush and Congress, and subsequent
pacts between Clinton and lawmakers in 1993 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, analysts credit the federal surpluses that
politicians are enjoying to high technology, the surging stock
market and other forces driving today's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, the government said the economy grew at a 7.3
percent annual rate for the last quarter of 1999, the steepest jump
in close to 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the economy's strength, federal revenues have
consistently and dramatically outpaced official expectations in
recent years, bringing with them the record budget surpluses
considered unattainable a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans took over Congress in January 1995, the
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected a $253 billion
federal deficit for fiscal 1999, with even deeper shortfalls on the
way. But when the books closed Oct. 1 on fiscal 1999, there was a
$124 billion surplus -- a $377 billion improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Surpluses are still growing. Between January and March, the
Congressional Budget Office raised its surplus projection for 2000
by $3 billion to $179 billion. Private analysts say the figure
could hit $210 billion by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have promised not to touch the part of the surplus
that comes from Social Security. CBO estimated in March that this
year's non-Social Security surplus will be $26 billion, which
lawmakers feel free to use for higher spending, cutting the
gasoline tax or debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure should also grow, perhaps to $40 billion,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   So far, these non-Social Security surpluses have been big enough
to satisfy lawmakers' urges to boost spending and cut taxes without
eroding Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the money is not limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans omitted George W. Bush's proposed five-year, $483
billion tax cut from their budget, partly for fear that the GOP
presidential candidate's plan would indeed eat into Social Security
money.
</P>
<P>
   And to fit their tax and spending plans into next year's budget,
both Clinton and the GOP are using accounting gimmicks. Among other
tricks, both would push a federal payday and scheduled payments to
some defense contractors from the first days of fiscal 2001 into
the last days of fiscal 2000, freeing up $7 billion in next year's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to the economy, politicians' toughest budget task
these days is deciding which goodies to dispense to the public.

<HEADLINE> Hints for Helping With Homework  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Tips from the National Parent Teacher Association and
the
National Education Association on helping young children get the
most out of homework:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- Assume your children will have homework every night.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ask them if they understand their homework. If they do not,
work on a few examples together.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ask to see their homework after the teacher returns it, to
learn where they're having trouble and where they're doing well.
</P>
<P>
   -- Stay in touch with their teachers. Ask about your children's
classes and their studies. Ask their teachers how you can support
what they are studying.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't be afraid to get in touch with the teacher if you and
your child don't understand an assignment or if your child is
having a great deal of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't do your children's work for them. Help them learn how to
do it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   -- Show your children that you think homework is important. If
you are at work during homework time, ask to see their work when
you get home.
</P>
<P>
   -- Praise your children for doing well. Maintain a portfolio of
''best pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Ask your school for tips or guides to help your children
develop good study habits.

<HEADLINE> Kids Stuck With More Homework  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Brendan O'Neill is home from school and emptying
his backpack of books and worksheets, not his usual 1{ hours of
homework but still enough long division problems to make the
10-year-old complain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to do my homework,'' the fourth-grader groans.
''Mom, there's 72 problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show Brendan is not alone, the amount of
schoolwork students lug home has increased.
</P>
<P>
   The mean amount of time children ages 3 to 11 spent studying at
home each week increased about 50 percent from 1981 to 1997 -- from
1 hour 25 minutes to 2 hours 7 minutes, according to a University
of Michigan study released last year. For children ages 9 to 11, it
was 3{ hours a week, almost an hour more than in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole homework issue has, I think, been raised to a
different level than when we were in school,'' said Ginny Markell,
president of the National Parent Teacher Association. ''Parents are
very fearful that their children won't achieve with the new
benchmarks. What they see is just a huge increase in homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Some children are spending hours a day on homework, particularly
in schools that stress high standardized test scores, said Ken
Kiewra, professor of educational psychology at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Kiewra noticed that his seventh-grade son was bringing home two
or three hours of homework a night, enough to disrupt their family
time.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote an article in his local newspaper and drew about two
dozen e-mail responses, most complaining about the amount of
homework assigned.
</P>
<P>
   ''It breaks a mother's heart to see her child in tears because
they have so much homework that supper was their only break in the
evening,'' one parent wrote. Another wrote: ''You can forget ever
doing anything as a family during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brendan and his three siblings are all doing assignments
from their private Chicago grade school, their mother finds herself
serving as a taskmaster in addition to answering an endless stream
of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Beth O'Neill agrees with her two younger boys that they
sometimes get too much homework, she believes the work will help
prepare her children for high school and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true for older elementary school grades, but not for
very young children, said Harris Cooper, a psychology professor at
the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper analyzed 120 studies on the effectiveness of homework and
concluded that the younger the child, the less useful homework is
in determining academic achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Very young children need a small amount of homework to get them
used to the drill, he said, but they don't have the attention span
or study skills to benefit from more.
</P>
<P>
   ''For young children, too much homework can be bad if it leads
to frustration and boredom and if it crowds out other activities,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   The PTA recommends about 10 minutes of homework a night per
grade level, meaning a first-grader should have 10 minutes and a
sixth-grader an hour.
</P>
<P>
   For a mother like O'Neill, with four youngsters in school, the
nightmare has become the days her children come home with
assignments requiring poster board, paste, markers and hours and
hours of help from Mom.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have four kids, the last thing you want to hear is
your son to come in and say 'We're doing a project on American
Indians and we're doing roundhouses out of clay,''' she said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: New Jerseyans worried about worsening pollution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- New Jerseyans are increasingly worried about
pollution, and fear it's getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   A new Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers poll found 71 percent of New
Jerseyans would maintain strict anti-pollution laws, even if it
meant losing some jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found 30 percent think the environment is getting
worse -- up from 15 percent just seven years ago. And 60 percent of
those who responded to the poll said they don't drink tap water,
preferring bottled water or water that's been run through a filter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to prove, once again, that the people are ahead of
the politicians in recognizing what needs to be done,'' said Sally
Dudley, executive director of the Association of New Jersey
Environmental Commissions. ''I hope what it will say to the powers
that be is we made some good steps, but we aren't moving fast
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's environmental protection commissioner, Robert Shinn,
was surprised at the level of worry among New Jerseyans. He cited
environmental improvements including more nesting eagles, more
flourishing shellfish beds, and fewer beach closings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing pretty dramatic improvements, although we've got
a way to go on things like ozone,'' Shinn said.
</P>
<P>
   Air quality was one area of the poll in which New Jerseyans felt
better about their environment. Two-thirds of respondents rated the
air in their communities as excellent or good, up between 10 and 15
percent from similar polls from 1979 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say that's because New Jersey's air is, indeed,
cleaner. The state no longer exceeds federal standards for carbon
monoxide, and the number of unhealthy ozone days has declined since
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Catania, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of
the Nature Conservancy, said one reason Garden State residents are
more concerned about the environment is because a booming economy
enables them to think less of pocketbook issues and more on
quality-of-life issues such as the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Jersey residents want more environmental protections, and
they want polluters to pay for it, and they're not satisfied with
how government has dealt with both,'' added David Pringle, a
lobbyist with the New Jersey Environmental Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The poll surveyed 800 people by telephone between Feb. 28 and
March 9. Its margin of error was plus or minus 3.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> African Nations Seek Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY ULBRICH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The nations of Africa, staggering under a
mountain of debt, are looking to their former colonial masters in
Europe for relief, but are unlikely to get it at the Africa-Europe
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's external debt has mushroomed 12 percent a year since
1980 from $110 billion to $350 billion today. Though Europe has
been helping, the Africans say it must do more.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central issue for discussion in this meeting is the
African debt,'' Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the
Organization of African Unity, said Sunday on the eve of the
two-day summit. ''We know there has been some movement on this and
we appreciate it. But this movement has not been enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the 15 European Union nations and 52 OAU
nations ironed out wrinkles in the two documents that summit
leaders are expected to issue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Jaime Gama of Portugal, whose country currently
holds the EU presidency, said they found satisfactory wording on
issues such as return of African cultural artifacts and nuclear
nonproliferation. Other matters, including debt, were to be studied
further by a Europe-Africa working group.
</P>
<P>
   Amr Moussa, foreign minister of the host country Egypt, said
debt and lack of investment have blocked Africa's sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real European-African partnership should be based on
promoting development and liberating the African continent from its
debts, which have been preventing economic progress and depriving
Africa of its equitable share in the global economy,'' Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, however, were adamant that questions of debt
should be dealt with in other forums, such as the Paris Club of
creditor nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The EU pointed to the recent enhancement of the Heavily Indebted
Poor Country initiative, launched by international lenders in 1996.
The EU contributed $1 billion in debt relief to that initiative.
Now there is a drive by some middle-income African countries for
moves to help them as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about figures, it's about intentions,'' said
Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen of the Netherlands, Europe's
largest donor to Africa at about $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   What Europe wants from Africa is democracy, good government
based on the rule of law, and more attention to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day ... everybody can go away with something
worthwhile,'' said Christopher Patten, the EU's commissioner for
external affairs. ''We can work with Africa to help prevent
conflicts turning into crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Europeans were treading lightly around
sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wanted to discuss the
troubles in Zimbabwe, where black war veterans have taken over more
than 700 white-owned farms. His EU colleagues sought to dissuade
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not have specific cases at the summit,'' Gama said.
''The summit is to establish a partnership as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   If Zimbabwe is raised, European ministers said it could open a
can of worms. Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel said the summit
should then also raise problems in Congo and every other crisis
affecting Africa.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey lacks programs for disturbed, drug-addicted youth  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- ''Jennifer'' has been thrown out of every
drug treatment program she has ever tried.
</P>
<P>
   The Monmouth County youth once got bounced for flirting with
residents. Other times, she just couldn't deal with the structured
environment of the residential drug treatment programs, says her
mother, who asked that the family's real names not be used to
protect her daughter's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The programs also prohibit residents from taking any medication
-- including the drugs Jennifer, now 20, was prescribed for her
learning disability. That made it even more difficult for her to
concentrate and behave.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's been through so many programs,'' says the mother. ''The
problem is, there are no programs for someone who has drug problems
and is emotionally disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just one glaring gap in New Jersey's system for treating
children who struggle with mental illness, drug abuse and emotional
problems, according to a report released last week.
</P>
<P>
   The National Mental Health Association studied New Jersey's
system and found that more than half of the 1,440 youth in the
state's juvenile justice system in 1998 had drug problems. Many
also suffer from some type of mental health problem.
</P>
<P>
   But few counties have a screening process to identify these
problems and programs to treat them.
</P>
<P>
   So, many teen-agers end up in county detention or juvenile
prisons, without ever getting treatment for the problems that
landed them there, according to the Virginia-based organization,
which is studying juvenile justice system across the country.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey also lacks programs for kids who are sex offenders,
fire setters, violent or seriously disturbed, the report said. And
schools aren't very good at identifying kids who have problems
early on, before those troubles become too severe.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman admits New Jersey has big problems when it
comes to how it treats mentally disturbed and drug-addicted youth.
She has proposed a $206 million children's initiative that is
supposed to turn the state's fragmented system into one-stop
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The new system will, in theory, provide the right help for each
troubled child and teen. A special agency will create individual
treatment plans and then provide the programs the child needs.
</P>
<P>
   The plan gets vague, however, when it comes to the type of
services that will be provided.
</P>
<P>
   State officials agree New Jersey lacks programs. But they are
reluctant to talk about the level of need -- or how much it will
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a whole lot of everything,'' said Laurie Facciarossa,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services. ''We need
to develop some things that don't exist, like after-school
programs, mentoring programs, recreation programs, in addition to
standard clinical things.''
</P>
<P>
   Some worry the state is creating a new layer of bureaucracy that
will eat up money that could be used for services.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have serious questions about bringing in a managed care
organization, whether that's necessary or whether that would reduce
the amount of available dollars for services,'' said Richard
Mingoia, president of Youth Consultation Services, which has more
than 70 youth treatment programs in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Under Whitman's plan, the state would add $39 million in new
state and federal funding to the $167 million already spent on
services for disturbed youth.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, between $8 and $12 million of that would be
used to hire a company to administer the program, much like a
managed care agency, according to Laurie Facciarossa, spokeswoman
for the state Department of Human Services. That cost includes
startup expenses, which would decrease as the program became
established, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents of children with mental health problems say the
current programs fail to fit their children's needs. They hope the
governor will make more money available for so-called
''wraparound'' services: respite care, summer camps,
community-based substance abuse programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need the most expensive services in the world,'' said
Mary, whose 10-year-old son suffers from behavior problems. ''We
just need people to speak with the family, to talk about the child,
to ask, 'What would make this better?'''

<HEADLINE> French Shepherds Protest Wolves  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN-CHARLES BANOUN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) -- Bearing anti-wolf signs and
crying ''wolf,'' dozens of shepherds led 2,000 sheep through this
town in the south of France to protest the resurgence of the
sheep's predator and to demand authorities remove it from their
Alpine pastures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not against the wolf, but against the way it was
reintroduced into France,'' said Louis Escoffier, of the Sheep
Federation of the Bouches-du-Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   Ancestors ''had to burn entire forests'' to get rid of the
wolves, said Escoffier. Following a 50-year campaign to eradicate
the wolves, they were removed from the region by 1924.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the wolves are back and doing devastating damage, the
shepherds said.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 sheep have been killed by wolves since the predators
were reintroduced to the Alps in 1992, according to sheep farmers.
</P>
<P>
   France's leftist government has tried to reconcile its wish to
regenerate the wolf population with the shepherds' fears for their
flocks. A recently-unveiled ''wolf plan'' would set up protection
zones for wolves while allowing them to be hunted in other areas,
like the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   But sheep farmers, said they want the animals -- known for their
roaming nature -- to be penned up or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative lawmaker Christian Estrosi, of the Alpes-Maritimes
region -- where the wolf was first reintroduced -- noted an 1871 law
permitting wolf hunting that was used to wipe out the wolf
population at the start of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's protest is likely to rekindle the debate, but not solve
it.
</P>
<P>
   The government said there are about 30 wolves loose in the Alps.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Evacuees Fret About Future  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DATE, Japan (AP) -- Every April after the snow melts, Katsumi
Miki has gone out on his tractor to till his vegetable farm on the
slopes of Mount Usu.
</P>
<P>
   But this spring, he's sitting in sweatpants and slippers in a
cramped emergency shelter, surrounded by hundreds of others who
fled the eruption of the volcano on whose slopes they make their
living.
</P>
<P>
   Though about 2,200 people were allowed to return to their homes
Sunday for the first time since Usu exploded back to life last
week, the lives of more than 15,000 others in this scenic corner of
northern Japan remains on hold.
</P>
<P>
   And like Miki, most aren't worried so much about their lives now
as they are worried about their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been five days since I came here, and I have no idea how
my crops are doing,'' Miki said. ''I don't care if I die, I just
want to go check on the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   After days of seismic rumbling, Mount Usu coughed up gas and
debris on Friday for the first time in 22 years, sending it two
miles into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   More eruptions opened up several new craters, and on the edge of
Abuta, a town of 13,000 that was evacuated before the eruptions
began, plumes of smoke continued to swell into the sky Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In the cluttered shelter where Miki was staying, children ran in
and out of the entryway, announcements blared over a loudspeaker
and drying laundry hung on every available surface.
</P>
<P>
   The facilities were clean and basic needs were met, but many
seem wearied by the tight quarters. Still, it was the future rather
than the present that was most troubling.
</P>
<P>
   With rich soil, hot springs and natural beauty, the area at
Usu's feet, home to about 51,000 people, is a paradise for farmers,
fishermen and hoteliers.
</P>
<P>
   While some have been escorted back home by authorities for quick
visits to feed livestock and pets, people worry about what will
happen to farms while the farmers are away, and inns where all
reservations have been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The latest volcanic activity has also changed the shape of the
land itself, creating cones of ash 35 feet high and cutting craters
and fissures into the earth. In the last eruption, in 1978, the
mountain drastically change its shape -- from a jagged point to a
squat and rugged lump.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly there have been big changes in the topography where
the eruptions occurred,'' said Tadahide Ui, a volcano expert at
Hokkaido University. ''In those areas it will be impossible for
people's lives to go back to the way they were.''
</P>
<P>
   And the economic pain will continue long after the volcanic
activity subsides.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of stores and hotels had to shut down the last time it
blew,'' said Rikio Terashima, chairman of the Date Tourism
Association. ''The sense of danger stayed with people, and tourists
and travel agencies avoided us for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   After that eruption, which wasn't officially declared over for
nearly five years, the region's tourism industry lost $11.3
million, and suffered $2 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   The number of vacationers reportedly dropped 60 percent. Overall
damage totaled $503 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of 86 active volcanoes in Japan, the mountain has erupted
eight times in the past 300 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, about 2,200 people went home to Nagawa, an area just
south of the mountain, with officials saying that the danger in
that particular spot was slim. Officials carved out a 6,177-acre
danger zone, but experts said a major eruption remained a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the past, Usu's activity has never finished on a minor
scale,'' said Hiromu Okada, a Hokkaido University volcano expert.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reports of deaths or injuries this time, and
unlike in some previous disasters, the government has won praise
for its swift response.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, those who could leave were happy to get out of the
crowded centers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such a relief,'' said Reiko Sugawada, 60, as she boarded
a bus to go home Sunday night. ''I'm still worried there might be a
big eruption, but I want to be back in my house.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Mayor Daley Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Mayor Richard M. Daley remained hospitalized
Sunday and was undergoing more tests after complaining of chest
pain and elevated blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the 57-year-old mayor's blood pressure returned to
normal soon after he was rushed to Northwestern Memorial Hospital
from his home Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Daley still must undergo tests to ensure his arteries aren't
blocked and to find out why he felt ill, doctors said. The tests
were expected to keep him hospitalized at least through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very stable and doing very well this morning,'' Dr.
Steven DeAngeles said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a family history of high blood pressure, doctors said
Daley has not had a complete physical examination in at least 10
years. His father, former Mayor Richard J. Daley, died of a heart
attack in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's spokesman Rod Sierra said Daley is an avid bicyclist
who is in good shape and had hoped to begin a ride across the
country this summer.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Billionaire Eli Broad has given $1 million to
the host committee for the Democratic National Convention in hopes
of helping fund-raisers meet their final goal.
</P>
<P>
   The donation is the first by Broad to the organization he
co-chairs, and it puts the fund-raising total to date at $26.6
million of the $33.5 million goal to cover convention costs.

<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, who recently took over control of the
local host committee, has been urging potential donors to help make
up the nearly $7 million difference.
</P>
<P>
   Broad, whose donation was announced Friday, reportedly has been
impatient with the disorganization and bad publicity surrounding
the planning for the convention.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mayor's Indictment a Blow to Camden  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- The rolls of toilet paper in the bathroom
stalls at City Hall are padlocked -- an unintentional irony in a
building where federal authorities say just about everything else
was up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's indictment on corruption charges last week is just
the latest blow to this already-reeling city, a former industrial
powerhouse now plagued by poverty and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take two steps forward and two steps back, and end up right
where we started,'' said Frank Fulbrook, president of the
Cooper-Grant Neighborhood Association and Mayor Milton Milan's
opponent in the 1997 mayoral election. ''This sure doesn't help
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan is accused of extorting money from public officials,
collecting bribes, stealing campaign funds and laundering drug
money. Prosecutors say Milan took mob payoffs of cash, vacations
and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old mayor says he is innocent, and calls the
indictment a politically motivated prosecution aimed at ousting the
city's first Hispanic mayor.	   ''I'm not going to stay down. I'm going to get
back up and
fight. I'm going to continue to be mayor of this city,'' Milan said
as he emerged from the federal courthouse after being freed on
$150,000 bail Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Milan is the second Camden mayor to face criminal charges in the
past ten years, which have been filled with troubles for this
nine-square-mile city, the fifth poorest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, a school board president pleaded guilty to
embezzling more than $24,00 in school funds; homicides soared so
much one year that state troopers had to help patrol the streets;
last year city officials sought to declare bankruptcy before the
state stepped in and began overseeing its finances; and now the
state is close to taking control of the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, residents say, the latest controversy fell in their
laps at a time when the city of 87,000 appeared to be on the
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Navy awarded the historic battleship USS New
Jersey to Camden as a floating museum and there are plans to build
a baseball stadium, an aerial tram linking the city's riverfront
with Philadelphia and an economic development center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Camden's going to be at a standstill for the next three to
five years. We're going to be idle, just trying to clean up this
mess,'' said Lee Douglass, who owns a hot dog stand a block from
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's name repeatedly surfaced in the recent federal trial of
two men convicted as leaders of a Camden drug ring. Witnesses
testified that Milan bought and sold drugs in the city in the 1980s
before becoming mayor.
</P>
<P>
   David Solares, who works in a pizza parlor across the street
from City Hall, grew up with Milan and doesn't believe the charges
against him are true.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen him and his officers out in the streets bringing in
drug dealers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Camden used to be one of the nation's mightiest industrial hubs
known for its shipbuilding, carriage-making and iron works. It had
the country's only nickel plant in the early 1860s, providing metal
to the U.S. Mint for the manufacture of coins.
</P>
<P>
   But after World War II, industry began moving elsewhere, and
with it went a third of the city's population. The only significant
reminder of its industrial past is the Campbell Soup Co., which is
still headquartered here.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 35 percent of residents live below the federal
poverty level and unemployment averages in the double-digits. The
city has trouble collecting taxes, and relies more on state
financial aid -- 75 percent of its budget -- than any other city in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the worst reputation in the country,'' said tobacco
shop owner Joseph Twardy. ''I was in Florida and told people I was
from Camden, and they said, 'You can't walk the streets there;
you'll get killed.'''
</P>
<P>
   Twardy said he campaigned for Milan in 1997 because he thought
he would be reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's predecessor, Arnold Webster, pleaded guilty to illegally
paying himself $20,000 in school district funds after he stopped
working as superintendent and became mayor. Before him, Mayor
Angelo Errichetti was convicted in 1980 for accepting a $50,000
bribe from an undercover FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought a new broom sweeps clean,'' Twardy said about Milan.
''But he swept City Hall clean into his own pocket. We go from bad
to worse here.''

<HEADLINE> 'Brockovich' Retains Top Spot  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Julia Roberts' ''Erin Brockovich'' remained
the nation's top movie for the third straight weekend, according to
studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The legal drama took in $14.2 million to hold off the debut of
the animated buddy flick ''The Road to El Dorado.'' The heavily
hyped ''El Dorado'' grossed a soft $12.5 million to finish in
second place.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Skulls,'' a campus thriller about a working-class stiff
who joins an Ivy League secret society, overcame bad reviews to
debut at No. 3 with $11.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''High Fidelity,'' a romantic comedy starring John Cusack as the
owner of a vinyl record shop trying to sort out his love life,
premiered in fifth place with $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other new movie, Jimmy Smits' boxing picture
''Price of Glory,'' bombed with $1.5 million, finishing well out of
the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich,'' the story of a real-life single mother who
led a court battle over polluted water, has grossed $76.2 million
in 17 days. It is poised to become Roberts' third straight $100
million movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Road to El Dorado,'' featuring the voices of Kevin Kline,
Kenneth Branagh and Rosie Perez, was the latest cartoon epic from
DreamWorks, which has been trying to challenge Disney's dominance
in animation.
</P>
<P>
   ''El Dorado'' executive producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who
co-founded DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, was
the driving force behind Disney's animation resurgence with such
movies as ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks has had modest success with two previous animated
pictures, ''The Prince of Egypt'' and ''Antz.'' But its animated
movies have not posted numbers to rival Disney's typical cartoon
returns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Road to El Dorado,'' about two 16th century
fortune-hunters searching for a lost city of gold, failed to grab
the audience DreamWorks had hoped for in opening the movie so
widely and marketing it so heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was slightly below what we expected,'' said Jim Tharp,
DreamWorks' head of distribution. ''But on the positive side, we
have about four weeks before any other family movies open.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's PG rating, earned partly for a scene suggesting
off-screen sex between two characters, may have been a turnoff for
families with young children. And while it features sumptuous
animation, the movie received so-so reviews describing it as
formulaic and not clever enough to appeal to adults.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it fell in between,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks the box office.
''It's not like 'Antz,' where adults could go without the kids and
still enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks did have continued good news with ''American
Beauty,'' last weekend's big Oscar winner, including the
best-picture honor. The studio expanded the film to 1,990 theaters,
up 328, and took in $5.8 million for a sixth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' has grossed $117 million since opening in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final
figures are to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Erin Brockovich,'' $14.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Road to El Dorado,'' $12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''The Skulls,'' $11.4 million.
</P>

   4. ''Romeo Must Die,'' $9.7 million.

<P>
   5. ''High Fidelity,'' $6.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Splits Seen in Turkey Coalition  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A move to allow President Suleyman Demirel
a chance at another term is aimed at ensuring stability, but the
strategy has ended up dividing Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's
coalition and sparking fears of a new government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Cracks appeared in the 10-month-old coalition when many deputies
refused last week to support government-backed legislation to allow
Demirel to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, several newspapers reported that Deputy Premier
Devlet Bahceli, leader of the Nationalist Action Party, was talking
about jettisoning another coalition partner, center-right
Motherland Party, for not backing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Message from Bahceli: it can be without Motherland,''
headlined the daily Radikal.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition leaders were scheduled to meet Monday to draw up a new
strategy for when the measure again comes up for a vote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bahceli and Ecevit are expected to warn Motherland leader Mesut
Yilmaz to back up their promise to support the motion, the daily
Hurriyet said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition holds 352 seats in the 550-member chamber and also
the backing of the opposition center-right True Path Party.
</P>
<P>
   Only 253 deputies voted in favor of the motion last week, far
short of the 367 votes needed to amend the constitution, which
would reduce the president's term from seven to five years but
allow for a second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the coalition has been hailed as unusually stable,
doggedly carrying out a tough anti-inflation program, sticking to
its uncompromising determination to crack down on Kurdish rebels
and defending the secular government against radical Islamic
circles.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ecevit, Demirel was an instrumental force behind
the country's stability, thanks to his well-honed policies aimed at
preserving the balance between the fiercely secular military and
the opposition Islamic Virtue Party, which faces court-ordered
closures for anti-secular activities.
</P>
<P>
   The army is said to favor the re-election of the 76-year-old
president.
</P>
<P>
   But there is resistance within the coalition by some who want a
fresh face to replace Demirel, who has also served as premier seven

<P>
   The post of president is elected by parliament and considered
largely symbolic. But Demirel, whose term ends in May, has used the
presidency as a power broker in several government crises.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's failed vote, he canceled trips and has spent
his days being called on by lawmakers amid rumors that he could
return to active politics if he is not elected again, the daily
Milliyet said.

<HEADLINE> Leno a Fan of Ford Vehicles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Jay Leno says he's been a Ford man since
he was fired from one of their dealerships as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Tonight Show'' host visited the Spirit of Ford museum on
Friday near the company's headquarters while in town to pick up his
2000 model Harley-Davidson F-150 pickup truck, a limited edition.
</P>
<P>
   Leno, who has a large collection of motorcycles and automobiles,
worked at a Ford dealership in Massachusetts when he was a
teen-ager. He lost his job for dropping a bunch of hubcaps but got
it back by writing to Ford headquarters to explain that he came
from a Ford family, really wanted the job and dreamed of buying a
Mustang someday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been a big fan of American cars,'' Leno said in
Sunday's Detroit News. ''It's amazing to me how far American cars
have come. I like it when the technology stays American. I always
think, given the opportunity, people will buy American.''

<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- On his triumphant return from Los Angeles,
Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda donated his Oscar statue Sunday to
the Jagiellonian University in Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   ''This university is 600 years old. It will be a great honor for
this statue to be kept here,'' Wajda told Polish Radio after a
ceremony in Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old filmmaker received this year's honorary Oscar in

communist government and an audience yearning for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let this award remind all young people who visit ... that
Polish filmmaking, which has an honorable past, also has a great
future,'' the director said.
</P>
<P>
   Wajda's Oscar will be displayed along with other gifts donated
to the university by renowned Polish people, notably the Nobel

<HEADLINE> Lithgow Says He Seeks Out Oddballs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Lithgow is known for playing oddballs,
from an over-the-top transsexual in the 1982 film ''The World
According to Garp'' to a space-alien-cum-nutty-professor on NBC's
''3rd Rock From the Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's an eccentric character to cast, they're likely to
seek me out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lithgow, who has won three Emmys for ''3rd Rock,'' admits
he's just as likely to seek out eccentric characters -- like Don
Quixote, the addled Spanish knight who jousts with windmills in
Miguel de Cervantes' 17th-century novel.
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow takes on the role, which he's wanted to play for years,
in a new adaptation premiering April 9 on TNT. He also served as
co-executive producer with Robert Halmi Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Isabella Rossellini joins Lithgow as an enigmatic duchess,
Vanessa Williams is Don Quixote's imaginary mistress Dulcinea, and
Bob Hoskins portrays his sidekick, Sancho Panza.

<HEADLINE> Oprah Launching New Magazine  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey knew she had a problem when a
woman who was interviewing to be the editor of her new magazine
asked the following question: ''I would like to know, who will be
the queen?''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, that particular candidate didn't get the job.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Winfrey, from her perch in
Chicago, is the reigning monarch of her latest media venture -- a
new magazine that bears her nickname, ''O.''
</P>
<P>
   Due out on newsstands April 19, O is intended to bring Winfrey's
message of self-determination and empowerment for women, already
widely disseminated over the airwaves, into a magazine format.
</P>
<P>
   She did eventually find an editor in Ellen Kunes who, Winfrey
says, ''has done a good job of not having her ego get in the way
with someone like me, who has such a big mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Making sure the point isn't lost, she emphasizes: ''I won't shut
up. I WON'T SHUT UP! That's on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to morph the Oprah phenomenon into the printed word,
Winfrey partnered with Hearst, the publisher of major women's
magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire. Hearst is
accustomed to working with partners, putting out SmartMoney with
Dow Jones and Talk with the Miramax film studio.
</P>
<P>
   O will be slightly oversize, about the shape of Martha Stewart
Living, said publisher Alyce Alston. The initial print run was
planned for 850,000 but was recently pushed up to 1 million, making
it an aggressive launch.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine will be bimonthly for two issues, then monthly
beginning in September.
</P>
<P>
   For Winfrey, who will be the magazine's editorial director and
also will write occasional articles, the transition from television
to print has been the hardest thing she's done since first going on
TV in 1973. Long lead times, working without a camera, and relying
on a tape recorder in interviews were all new experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating with an editorial staff in New York has also been a
logistical challenge, requiring daily FedEx deliveries, frequent
e-mails and downloading of images. ''I didn't know the computer
until last fall,'' Winfrey said. ''Now I don't know how I lived
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the line in New York, editor Kunes says she
has no illusions about who is leading the magazine forward. ''This
is her magazine, and readers need to know it's her voice that's
guiding the editorial.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with her own directive of self-examination, Winfrey
allows that there have been some rough spots in the creative
process as well as room for improvement in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was as good as I knew how to do the first time,'' she says.
''As I get the hang of it and as the whole staff gets to know me, I
can spend less time rejecting things.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is one of several projects currently on Winfrey's
plate. In addition to her talk show and book clubs, she also is a
partner in Oxygen, the new women's cable channel run by Geraldine
Laybourne.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much riding on this magazine launch, Winfrey is
devoting large chunks of time to it and her adaptation to the world
of print. She's keeping a close eye on things, approving every
story proposal, looking over the first draft, asking for and then
reviewing changes, and then going over the final copy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The O that's on the cover is more than my name,'' she says.
''It's my life.''

<HEADLINE> New Pyramid Discovered in Egypt  </HEADLINE>
By TANALEE SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- French archaeologists have discovered the
remains of a 4,000-year-old queen's pyramid south of Cairo,
complete with texts of special prayers previously found only with
kings.
</P>
<P>
   The finding was one of several announced at the Eighth
International Congress of Egyptologists, a weeklong conference that
ends Monday and has drawn some 1,500 archaeologists to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   The French team, led by Jean Leclant, uncovered the foundation
stones March 25 in Sakkara, an ancient royal cemetery about 20
miles south of Cairo. The pyramid belonged to Queen Ankh-sn-Pepi,
the wife of King Pepi I.
</P>
<P>
   The archaeologists dug into the queen's burial chamber and found
a stone bearing pyramid texts, or special prayers to protect the
dead and ensure sustenance in the afterlife. Until this discovery,
such texts had been located only in the pyramids of kings. It is
not yet known why they were in the queen's burial chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who knows what else they may find?'' said Gaballa Ali Gaballa,
head of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. The team will work
at the site, now one of the country's largest, until the end of
May.
</P>
<P>
   In another discovery, Egyptian archaeologists said they found a
painted tomb in the Western Desert from a 600 B.C. culture that
exported wine to the Nile valley.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass, who is chairing the
congress, said that through a hole in a wall of the tomb, he saw a
burial chamber containing a stone coffin. The coffin was roughly 13
feet by seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be intact, and inside there is likely a wooden
sarcophagus and maybe even a mummy,'' Hawass said Sunday. ''We will
start excavating next week.''
</P>
<P>
   The tomb is in the so-called Valley of the Golden Mummies in the
Bahariya oasis village of Bawiti, 215 miles southwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists made the discovery while re-excavating three
similar tombs that previously had been found in the village, Hawass
said. Ten houses built above the fourth tomb were removed, and
Hawass said the government will relocate the homes and compensate
the families.
</P>
<P>
   Bahariya oasis made headlines last year when 105 mummies were
found during the excavation of a vast cemetery of Greco-Roman
tombs.
</P>
<P>
   In a third discovery announced at the conference, a joint
expedition of Egyptian and French archaeologists said they found
two additional chambers and a corridor in the collapsed pyramid of
Maidum. Those ruins, some 56 miles south of Cairo, date to about
2600 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Antiquities chief Gaballa said the new rooms have so far been
seen only through an endoscope, a 33-yard-long flexible tube that
was inserted through the joints in the stones.
</P>
<P>
   He said the purpose of the rooms is not yet known, but they may
have been built to lessen the weight on the burial chambers below.

<HEADLINE> Negotiator Nixes Israel Viewpoint  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Israel accepts the inevitability of
Palestinian statehood, a top Palestinian negotiator said Sunday --
but it envisions the state as unnatural ''islands in an Israeli
ocean,'' an outcome that would be unacceptable to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Abed Rabbo, who is leading talks with Israelis in
Washington, said there has been little progress in bridging gaps
that led to a breakdown in negotiations in February. The renewed
U.S.-sponsored talks aim for an outline of a final agreement by May
and a full-fledged agreement by September.
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo said he has ascertained through the talks that Israel
hopes for a Palestine without natural borders and totally
surrounded by Israel, save for an outlet onto the Mediterranean Sea
in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo said Israel's insistence on limited statehood, as
well as its refusal to accommodate Palestinian refugees, ''is the
most dangerous issue we are facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has not formally proposed such a state, and Israeli
Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon described Abed Rabbo's perception of
Israel's position as ''extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo said Israel had dropped its opposition to the
Palestinian state Yasser Arafat hopes to declare by September. The
problem, he said, is Israel's vision of that state.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank would be divided into two clusters of land
connected by a passage. Along with some West Bank suburbs of
Jerusalem, the proposed state would cover about half of the current
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Israel would control two Palestinian border crossings into
Jordan, as it now controls the border crossing between the Gaza
Strip and Egypt. Large Jewish settlements would be controlled by
Israel, and Israel would also control security on major roads.
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo said that proposal -- which he described as ''islands
in an Israeli ocean'' -- is unacceptable to Palestinians, and he
repeated demands for the return of all Palestinian-resided lands
captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon, who is close to the negotiations, said the sides were not
so far from agreement on most issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end we will reach an agreement with the Palestinians
over a Palestinian state,'' Ramon said. ''It will not be a state
that the Palestinians could not accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said Israel sees a Palestinian state with limited
sovereignty, especially over security matters.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested postponing discussion of Jerusalem, claimed by both
sides as their capital, for a few years in order to reach agreement
on the other issues by September. Abed Rabbo rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
   A first round of talks at Bolling air force base near Washington
ended last week, and the sides are expected to return to the United
States on April 6 for a second round. Negotiators will discuss
borders, settlements, water, Jerusalem and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The sides met in Jerusalem on Sunday to discuss interim issues.
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he gave the Israelis a list
of 230 Palestinians arrested for anti-Israel acts before an interim
peace agreement was signed May 4, 1994 and asked for their release.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was to respond by next week.

<HEADLINE> Heinz Develop No-Leak Ketchup Cap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- In the beginning, there was the octagonal
glass bottle. Then came the plastic squeezable bottle, then the
recyclable plastic squeeze bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Within three months, H.J. Heinz Co. plans to introduce the next
rung on ketchup's evolutionary ladder: the ''trap cap,'' which is
meant to solve an age-old condiment conundrum -- how to reach the
ketchup without first enduring a rush of watery ketchup plasma.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the ketchup people, and we should be the ones out there
first with the newest and the best technology,'' said Mike McMahon,
senior manager for research and development, who oversaw the trap
cap project.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's team spent 18 months researching a way to solve a
problem technically known as syneresis, or the natural settling
process that causes a watery substance to rise to the top of pureed
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   For years, ketchup lovers have battled the problem by giving the
bottle a few shakes before using it or test-firing over a napkin or
sink. Heinz figured if it could conquer syneresis, it could win
more customers in a market it already dominates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to retool our way of doing things,'' McMahon
said. ''If you have trouble getting the package open, or getting
the product out, people remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's first idea -- to use a pump to pull ketchup from
the bottle the same way a liquid soap dispenser works -- turned out
to be too expensive. Another plan to design a bottle that opened
from the bottom was considered too radical a change for the
bottle's familiar shape.
</P>
<P>
   The new cap, developed in conjunction with Seaquist Closures in
Wisconsin, is taller than the old one, allowing space for a stubby
straw that extends from the hole in the center. When the bottle is
turned upside-down, the water fills the cap while the slower-moving
ketchup oozes in the straw and out the hole. When the bottle is
turned right-side up, the water mixes with the ketchup and falls
back into the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz believes the new cap also will provide better ''suckback''
action, pulling more ketchup inside and eliminating the unsightly
crust that builds around the lid.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokeswoman Deb Magness said trap caps won't appear on
the glass bottles, which have been phased out of retail shelves but
still dominate at restaurants, because the cylindrical shape cuts
down on syneresis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're proud of our glass design and consider it an icon
image,'' said McMahon. ''But you have to be in touch with the
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinz owns 54.6 percent of the ketchup market share on annual
sales of $279.9 million, dwarfing its closest competitor, Hunt's,
which has an 18.9 percent market share on sales of $95.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Serbs To Take Part in Kosovo Gov't  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's Serbs pledged to take part
in the province's interim U.N. government Sunday in an effort to
press Western governments to do more to help refugees return and
stop ongoing ethnic violence against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb National Council's decision to send representatives as
observers came despite the absence of the most radical Serbs, who
boycotted the session at a 16th century monastery five miles from
Kosovo's capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international community will help us to help them
implement the peace agreement,'' said Father Sava Janjic, one of
the Serb leaders who will become an observer.
</P>
<P>
   Janjic described the decision as a ''turning point'' in
relations between the Serbs and the U.N. administrators who run
Kosovo, suggesting that the Serbs expect the West to reward their
concession with help in security, housing and the return of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at the door,'' Janjic said. ''We need the door to be
opened a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 Serbs are estimated to have fled attacks leveled in
revenge for Milosevic's 18-month crackdown on ethnic Albanian
militants. NATO peacekeepers swept in after a 78-day air
bombardment to end Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
repressive tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's decision follows Western pressure on Kosovo's Serb
leaders to take a more active political role in arguing their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The top U.N. administrator for the province, Bernard Kouchner,
described the move as ''courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the real work can start on setting up the administration
of Kosovo,'' he said. ''This decision gives us a real possibility
of building a united and tolerant society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs who didn't attend the meeting live in the part of
Kosovo that has retained the closest ties with Milosevic's
government. Their absence could mean trouble for Western officials
desperate to bring Serbs into the day-to-day administration, the
most basic step toward Western goals of a multiethnic Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, the Serb leader in the ethnically divided city
of Kosovska Mitrovica, told Yugoslavia's state-run news agency,
Tanjug, that the decision to participate would ''have catastrophic
consequences for Serbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''History will condemn them for what they're doing,'' he said.
''However, it will be too late then.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Criticizes Chechen Blunder  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOISKOYE, Russia (AP) -- Russia's defense minister on Sunday
sharply criticized the military command in Chechnya for an
operation that left at least 43 Russian servicemen dead after an
ambush by Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who was observing military
maneuvers in Tajikistan, said there will be an inquiry to determine
who is to blame for the ambush and to what extent, Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are ready to expose these mistakes since if problems and
mistakes are not revealed, it will be impossible to eliminate
them,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the ''inadequately firm centralized command and a lack
of efficiency among officials to cope with duties assigned by the
Interior and Defense Ministers'' for the debacle, according to
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Ilya Lukin, deputy commander of Russian forces in the
Vedeno district of Chechnya, told Interfax on Sunday that 37
soldiers from a unit of OMON special troops from an Interior
Ministry unit were killed in Thursday's ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Six soldiers from a regular army unit sent to help them
following the attack also died. At least 11 servicemen were still
missing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush was the latest in a series of attacks that inflicted
heavy losses on the Russians, showing their vulnerability to the
rebels despite their claims to have defeated the rebels and
restored federal control over Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The defense minister said federal forces have destroyed all
major rebel groups in Chechnya. ''There are no large pockets of
resistance left in the republic,'' he said. ''The militants have
been scattered in small groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in an interview on the Itogi weekly news program, Col.
Gen. Gennady Troshev, a top commander in Chechnya, said the major
error was to have let the OMON unit travel a road that was not
fully under Russia control and was without ground and air cover. He
also blamed poor reconnaissance for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel bands are stepping up their campaign to sabotage Russian
troops and the number of ambushes on motorized Russian convoys is
on the increase, the military command's press service told
ITAR-Tass on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no let up in rebel attempts to infiltrate
villages in southern Chechnya in order to replenish dwindling food
supplies, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artillery has been actively bombarding rebel positions
overnight and on Sunday around the southern villages of Tsa-Vedeno,
Tangi-Chu and Tsentoroy, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russia began its latest campaign in late September, and has
driven most of the rebels out of the flatlands and into the
mountains that make up the republic's southern third.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said federal forces in Chechnya will change tactics.
''In the plains, we will carry out police operations, while in the
mountains we will conduct search and reconnaissance missions,'' he
said, according to ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson
visited the Chechen capital, Grozny, on Sunday to investigate
reports of human rights abuses in detention camps.
</P>
<P>
   During a 2{-hour visit to Grozny, Robinson visited a hospital, a
jail and spoke with residents of the city. However, she did not
manage to see everything she wanted before her departure, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson had been expected to visit the Chernokozovo detention
center, where human rights groups say Russians routinely torture
prisoners. However, she apparently did not.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chase May Buy Dresdner Subsidiary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Corp., the third largest bank in
the United States, reportedly has made a $1.59 billion offer for
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, the London-based subsidiary of Germany's
Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent on Sunday, which quoted unidentified
''insiders'' at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, said the deal could be
announced this week. Chase is already in talks to buy Robert
Fleming Holdings, a British investment bank and asset management
group, a move which if successful would make Chase a bigger player
in the securities business.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based newspaper said the two deals would complement
each other, with Chase using Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, which
handles investment banking, to build its European operations and
Fleming for its expertise in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   The spinoff of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson is apparently a result
of Dresdner Bank's decision earlier this month to merge with
Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports that the merged banks would close Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, both chief executives have previously denied such
a move, with Deutsche Bank's Rolf Breuer calling it a gem worth
keeping.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent said the 600-some staff at Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson told the board of Deutsche Bank that they did not want to be
integrated into its investment banking operations and would stage a
massive walk out if not given control over the combined operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent said neither bank would confirm the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A security guard answering calls to Dresdner Kleinwort Benson
said no one would be available to comment Sunday. Calls to Chase's
New York headquarters rang unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Volkswagen Panel OKs Scania Stake  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) -- Volkwagen's supervisory board on
Sunday approved the German automaker buying $1.6 billion worth of
shares in Scania to become the Swedish truck and bus maker's
largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen will hold 34 percent of the voting power and 18.7
percent of the capital in Scania, while Swedish investment company
Investor AB will retain 15.3 percent of the votes and 9.1 percent
of the capital in Scania for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced last week, will allow Germany's Volkswagen
to expand in the area of heavy commercial vehicles and provide
Scania with Volkswagen resources and purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes on the heels of the European Commission's
decision to block a planned merger between Scania and rival Swedish
truckmaker Volvo on competitive grounds. Volvo still holds 30.6
percent of the votes and 45.55 percent of the shares in Scania but
has no seat on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Scania, which has 25,800 employees and production facilities in
Europe and Latin America, had 1999 net income of $369 million.

<HEADLINE> Report: Beatles Write Book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Thirty years after they split up, the three
surviving Beatles have written a book setting the record straight
about the ''Fab Four,'' a newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Telegraph said Sir Paul McCartney, George Harrison
and Ringo Starr have spent six years writing the 360-page ''Beatles
Anthology,'' to be published in Britain and the United States in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The book will provide the frankest account yet of the band's
rise to the top of the pop world in the 1960s, The Sunday Telegraph
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was immediately available for comment Sunday at the
offices of McCartney, Harrison or Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Telegraph said the book, which will sell for about
$80, will disclose new information about The Beatles' drug taking,
their sexual exploits, their rivalries and eventual breakup in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will dispel some of the myths ... as every Tom, Dick and
uncle of a friend has been writing books on the Beatles since
1963,'' the newspaper quoted McCartney as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Yoko Ono, the widow of John Lennon -- the
fourth Beatle who was shot to death in New York in 1980 -- will
receive a quarter of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the book will counter the widely held belief
that McCartney pushed for the band to split up, the newspaper said,
revealing that Lennon was the first to walk away, leaving McCartney
to make the official announcement months later.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper says the book will also disclose that in 1996, the
three Beatles turned down an offer of $175 million to perform 17
concerts in the United States, Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, 57, Harrison, 57, and Starr, 59, have collected 1,200
photographs, mostly unpublished, for the book, The Sunday Telegraph
said.

<HEADLINE> Beatles Reunite for Book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Thirty years after they split up, the three

</P>
<P>
   McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr have spent six years

</P>
<P>
   The book will provide the frankest account of how the band ruled
the pop world in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking a huge volume of work, it's encyclopedic -- it
weighs something like two kilos (4.4 pounds),'' said Geoff Baker,
McCartney's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes across the board, everything is in there. It is about
the Beatles as a band, the music, but it deals with everything else
-- the tours, the drugs, the disputes,'' Baker said. ''This book
answers all the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was immediately available for comment Sunday at the
offices of Harrison or Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said the book will sell for about

   Among other things, the book will counter the widely held belief
that McCartney wanted the band to split up. Lennon was actually the
first to walk away, Baker said, leaving McCartney to make the
official announcement months later.
</P>
<P>
   The book also says that in 1996, the three Beatles turned down
an offer of $175 million to perform 17 concerts in the United
States, Germany and Japan, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of work which has gone into the book,'' Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the initial editing, he said, was done by the band's
late press officer, Derek Taylor, who died in 1997. Taylor began
working with the Beatles in 1964 and remained close to them
throughout their career.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, 57, Harrison, 57, and Starr, 59, have collected 1,200
photographs, mostly unpublished, for the book, Baker said.

<HEADLINE> FBI task force cracking down on cargo-theft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) -- The FBI is changing its strategy in the
long-running battle against cargo theft at ports such as Newark and
Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars on sting
operations where agents pose as fences and buy stolen goods, the
agency is focusing on infiltrating rings of thieves, often before
their hot merchandise is moved, then convincing some participants
to cooperate with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to compete with the bad guys, and they're willing to
pay more than us'' for stolen property, FBI Assistant Special Agent
in Charge Garey S. Chin, of the bureau's Newark office, told The
Record of Hackensack for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the price tag for a stolen truckload has jumped from
$5,000 to as much as $30,000 over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could use that money better somewhere else,'' Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy paid off recently when a special FBI task force
busted up a ring that for months had been shipping stolen Toyota
Land Cruisers and Range Rovers from Port Newark to West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, agents found an insider who told
them the ring stole luxury vehicles in New York -- to fill specific
orders -- and moved them to West Africa inside metal shipping
containers. So when the thieves delivered hot cars to a Port Newark
warehouse, agents switched the Africa-bound cars with empty
containers and monitored the thieves' response.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Authorities recovered 41 cars worth $2 million and
arrested three men, one of whom pleaded guilty last week. Other
plea deals are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that was the tip of the iceberg as far as what was
being shipped out'' by the ring, Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides autos, the FBI Interstate Theft Task Force targets rings
trafficking in stolen computers, jewelry, perfume and other
consumer items that sell quickly on the black market, as well as
tracking down stolen art and truck hijackers. The task force
includes agents and officers from the New Jersey State Police, Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, U.S. Customs Service and the
Waterfront Commission of the New York Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is a welcome one for importers, merchandisers and
insurers vulnerable to rings that grab containers from outside the
gates of ports in Elizabeth and Newark. The contents, authorities
say usually end up being sold on street corners, out of garages or
mixed among legitimate merchandise in mom-and-pop stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cargo theft is a growing problem,'' said John Hyde, vice
chairman of the National Cargo Security Council, a coalition of
government agencies and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses lose about $10 billion a year to container theft, on
top of the $8 billion worth of autos stolen in this country each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities often left investigation of container thefts to
insurance companies, industry officials told the newspaper, until
the task force switched strategies last year.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it did so was the sharp decrease in truck hijackings,
which were the bread-and-butter of many mob members until prison
terms for hijackings were increased.
</P>
<P>
   ''Armed hijackings are not worth their while anymore,'' said
Phil Spinelli, police chief of the Waterfront Commission, which
investigates crimes and workers at New Jersey ports.
</P>
<P>
   Now, police say, cargo thieves usually swipe containers after
they move from ships and trains, often at trucking warehouses or on
company parking lots. Many heists are arranged by truck drivers who
own and operate their own rigs, according to Peter Massa, a
Waterfront Commission detective.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Michael Podolak of the Port Authority said cargo theft is a
serious regional problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the goods are getting stolen out of Jersey City, Kearny or
Newark, it doesn't matter to an international shipper,'' he said.
''All he knows is that if he ships through the port, it gets ripped
off. So then he'll ship through Maryland or Florida.''

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Hudah Hammers Madagascar  </HEADLINE>
By KATYA ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- Cyclone Hudah hammered
northeastern Madagascar late Sunday with rain and fierce winds,
just weeks after the Indian Ocean island received a one-two punch
of devastating tropical storms.
</P>
<P>
   The eye of Hudah, which has been classified as a very intense
tropical cyclone -- the strongest category of cyclones -- crossed
near the northeast town of Antalaha at approximately 9 p.m. local
time, the local weather service Meteo reported.
</P>
<P>
   The cyclone, which is about 248 miles across, carried average
winds of 138 mph and gusts as strong as 193 mph, according to
Meteo.
</P>
<P>
   Meteo said the cyclone was heading west-northwest but that it
was not yet known if it would continue on that course. The current
trajectory would carry the storm into the Mozambique Channel. Given
the storm's size and intensity, rains and wind were expected for
most of the northern half of the country, including the capital of
Antananarivo, Meteo said. Winds were picking up in the capital by
late evening, but no rain was falling.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service issued a danger alert for northern
Madagascar, including the northern tip of the island, the eastern
coast and the capital. National radio warned residents up and down
the east coast of Madagascar to evacuate the area or move to safe
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in the northeastern town of Sambava said by telephone
that rain hadn't begun to fall but that the seas were extremely
rough. Residents of Ile Sainte Marie, an island 170 miles south of
Sambava, reported high winds and heavy rain but no significant
damage as of early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agency leaders met in Antananarivo on Sunday to make
plans to provide disaster assistance. World Food Program
Representative Salha Haladou said aid organizations were planning
to conduct survey flights over the northeast as soon as weather
permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone Hudah hit Madagascar in the same region where Tropical
Storm Gloria passed one month ago, flooding rice fields and killing
dozens of people in flash floods and mudslides. Residents in the
area have been dependent on food aid from the World Food Program
for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before Gloria, Cyclone Eline destroyed the homes or
crops of more than 40,000 people on much of the eastern coast of
the Indian Ocean island. It went on to cause major damage in
Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Actors' Union Extend Deal for Now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two unions representing film and television
actors have agreed to temporarily extend their contract for
commercial work with advertisers' associations so negotiations for
a new contract can continue.
</P>
<P>
   The old contract expired Friday, but Screen Actors Guild
officials advised their members Saturday to continue auditioning
and accepting work until further notice. The terms and conditions
of the old contract will remain in effect during the extension.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Television and Radio Artists have been in talks since Feb. 14 with
the Association of National Advertisers and the American
Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Union members voted last week to authorize a strike if
negotiations break down. The talks are set to resume April 10.
</P>
<P>
   The unions want a 20 percent increase in residuals, the payments
actors receive each time a commercial runs. The unions are also
seeking increases for ads running on Spanish-language television
and in foreign markets.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Free 74 Prisoners  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels stormed a provincial
jail, detonating a powerful car bomb to rip a hole in the prison
wall and free 74 prisoners, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas from the National Liberation Army and the People's
Liberation Army unleashed automatic fire Saturday night against
guards at the Modelo jail in Cucuta near the Venezuelan border,
said regional police commander Col. Rafael Cepeda.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners inside the jail joined in the onslaught and fighting
continued in the streets for more than an hour. A total of 74
inmates escaped, taking one guard with them as a hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Two prison guards were wounded and four prisoners were killed,
said Gen. Alfonso Arellano, operations director of the Colombian
National Police.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the escapees were militants of the two rebel groups or
the country's largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police agents deactivated three more car bombs in the
city, and found a car loaded with 42 hand grenades.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 prisoners have escaped from Colombian prisons since
1997, including dozens of inmates who fled during a FARC attack on
a southern village last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate attack Saturday, a police officer was killed when
FARC rebels rained gunfire and homemade rockets on the village of
Puerto Saldana, 160 miles south of Bogota.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Accuse Kabila's Army  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- As Congo slides back into war, Congolese
rebels on Sunday said they had killed at least 20 government troops
in fresh attacks by President Laurent Kabila's army.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba said the Rwandan-backed rebels
had fought off government attacks at Maloba and Kisele in southern,
diamond-rich Kasai Province, killing 17 soldiers and capturing one.
The fighting last week also left five rebels wounded, two of them
in critical condition in a hospital in the eastern rebel stronghold
of Goma.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're fighting every day. There is no cease-fire,'' Mulumba
said on telephone from Goma.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a peace accord last August between Kabila and the
rebels, fighting has resumed in Congo, frustrating efforts by the
United Nations to deploy 5,500 U.N. cease-fire observers and troops
to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   So far, more than 100 U.N. observers have been deployed in both
government-and rebel-controlled Congo. But U.N. officials have
warned that additional deployment will not be possible unless
fighting ends.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord was signed by rebel supporters Rwanda and
Uganda, as well as Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, who back Kabila.
According to the deal, a cease-fire is supposed to be followed by
the withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo and the disarmament of
Rwandan and Burundian Hutu militia fighting alongside Kabila's
army.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government set May 10 as the date for elections,
the first since Kabila took power by force in 1997. He currently
rules without a legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Gaetan Kakudji announced the date at a
ceremony Saturday launching a five-member government office that
will organize the vote. Kabila has said the 300-member body will
involve the Congolese people in running the country and its
defense, but he has not specified its powers and functions.
</P>
<P>
   The major opposition parties, however, have said they want
nothing to do with the new assembly. They say the move is an
attempt to bypass a national dialogue on Congo's political future.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila was expected Monday at an African-European summit in
Cairo, together with Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe and
Angola's Jose Eduardo dos Santos. African and European foreign
ministers meeting before the summit agreed that there would be no
specific mention of Africa's various conflicts, although they did
agree to promote conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Mulumba also said that government forces or their Zimbabwean
allies had dropped nine bombs on rebel positions around Ikela, 435
miles east of the capital of Kinshasa. The rebels, backed by
Rwandan troops, had been fighting there to regain positions they
lost last month.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Congolese Liberation Movement, which is backed
by Uganda and fighting in northern Congo, said government forces
tried last week but failed to take Zongo, on the border with
Central African Republic. Thirteen soldiers and six rebels were
killed, said Jean-Pierre Bemba.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of rebel claims.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, aid workers and U.N. officials reported renewed
ethnic tensions in South Kivu Province, where they said the ethnic
Tutsi community there had come under attack by a pro-government
militia, known as Mai-Mai. The Mai-Mai are reportedly supplied by
Zimbabwean arms and troops.
</P>
<P>
   Details on possible deaths or injuries were unknown.

<HEADLINE> Report: Algeria Detains Photographer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A freelance photographer working for a French photo
agency has been detained by Algerian police, a press watchdog group
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters without Borders said that Zerog Walid, who works for
Paris-based Imapress, was taken from his Algiers home on Tuesday,
apparently by military police, and has not been heard from since
then.
</P>
<P>
   The photographer's film and videotape were confiscated,
according to a statement by Reporters Without Borders, who wrote a
protest letter to Algeria's Interior Minister. The organization
said the photographer was apparently taken to barracks in Ben
Aknoun, located on the edge of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   No one was immediately available at Imapress for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters Without Borders is among four human rights
organizations invited to visit Algeria in May and June -- an unusual
invitation because Algeria sparingly doles out visas to foreign
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The group, and other human rights groups were barred from this
North African nation, which has waged an eight-year campaign
against Islamic insurgents. The insurgency broke out in Algeria in
1992, when the government canceled legislative elections the
now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, thousands of disappearances have been reported since
the insurgency began. Many are said to be kidnappings by the
insurgents, but human rights groups attribute some disappearances
to security forces. More than 100,000 people have died in the
violence.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Mayor Remains Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Mayor Richard M. Daley remained hospitalized
Sunday and was undergoing more tests after complaining of chest
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the 57-year-old mayor's blood pressure returned to
normal soon after he was rushed to Northwestern Memorial Hospital
from his home Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Daley still must undergo tests to ensure his arteries aren't
blocked and to find out why he felt ill, doctors said. The tests
were expected to keep him hospitalized at least through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very stable and doing very well this morning,'' Dr.
Steven DeAngeles said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a family history of high blood pressure, doctors said
Daley has not had a complete physical examination in at least 10
years. His father, former Mayor Richard J. Daley, died of a heart
attack in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's spokesman Rod Sierra said Daley is an avid bicyclist
who is in good shape and plans to begin a ride across the country
this summer.

<HEADLINE> Congressman says GOP in process of ''blowing'' U.S. Senate race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The congressman who would be a Republican
U.S. Senate candidate instead of Rudolph Giuliani said he fears the
GOP may be stumbling into losing the race against Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in the process of potentially blowing this race,'' said
Rep. Rick Lazio on ABC-TV's ''This Week'' Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio stopped short of saying Giuliani can't win the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm prepared to say is we're less likely to win relative
to myself or maybe even another candidate who can bring the party
together,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County representative said he could still replace
Giuliani as the Republican candidate if state GOP leaders -- and
particularly Gov. George Pataki -- give him the go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, GOP heads didn't seem to be budging.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe the governor or I have changed in our support
of Rudy Giuliani,'' state Republican Committee Chairman William
Powers said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Suzanne Morris said the governor's support
for Giuliani remained steadfast and that Pataki ''looks forward to
beating Hillary Clinton in November.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is yet another sign of the deep concern that Republicans
across the state have about Rudy Giuliani's ability to be effective
in the Senate,'' said Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, one month before the state Republican Convention in
Buffalo, said Pataki has to rethink his support of Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's got to say, 'Listen, we've got some serious problems
here. Hillary Rodham Clinton's numbers are moving up. More
importantly the mayor's numbers are collapsing,''' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has recently been sharply criticized for comments and
his release of court-sealed juvenile court records of Patrick
Dorismond in the black man's fatal shooting by New York City
police.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the close race between Giuliani and Clinton is
growing tighter after Giuliani's support of police in the Dorismond
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also said Giuliani apparently doesn't seek, and won't get,
Conservative party backing. No Republican has won statewide office
without Conservative Party support since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the political leadership and establishment in New York, I
think, ought to be saying is, 'Hey, let's look to find a candidate
that can bring the party together, that can attract soft Democrats
and independents, present a better, more positive, more inclusive
message for Republicans and beat Hillary Clinton,'' Lazio said. He
has put his Senate campaign on hold at Pataki's request to allow
Republicans to focus on Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a bombshell,'' said former Republican speechwriter Peggy
Noonan on CNN's ''Late Edition'' of Lazio's comments. ''I think
that's a huge announcement,'' said the author of ''The Case Against
Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there is no reason Giuliani shouldn't have to work for
the GOP nomination. But Noonan emphasized that the first lady has
no business running for the Senate seat in New York, where she has
been a resident for just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   A former ally of Giuliani whom the mayor had crossed party lines
to endorse, ex-Gov. Mario Cuomo, said Clinton remains a strong and
legitimate candidate on the strength of her ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's going to win because New Yorkers will want her,'' said
Cuomo, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has raised $19 million for the race to Clinton's $12
million. Lazio raised about $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's camp Sunday refused comment.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Crisis Over N.H. Court  </HEADLINE>
By NORMA LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A crisis involving allegations of ethics
violations at New Hampshire's Supreme Court kept lawmakers at work
during the weekend, researching impeachment procedures or trying to
arrange a less drastic solution.
</P>
<P>
   While some worked to persuade Chief Justice David Brock to
resign and avoid a protracted and damaging legislative battle,
others questioned whether a clean sweep of the court wouldn't be
better.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders wouldn't comment on whether Brock or the two
others should resign, but several rank-and-file legislators said
that may be the only way to restore public confidence in the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''If nobody trusts that group of people -- whether it's fair or
not -- that may be the only thing we can do, though I wouldn't favor
it,'' said state Rep. James Craig. ''It may be the only way to save
the integrity of the judicial branch.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Paul Mirski said Saturday he would file a bill to
impeach or otherwise remove Brock, and state House leaders
researched the mechanics of such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking to see how it's done in the event we need to go
forward,'' House Speaker Donna Sytek said Sunday. ''What's at stake
is the people's confidence in the court.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Justice W. Stephen Thayer resigned after being
accused of criminal ethics violations. In return, Attorney General
Philip McLaughlin promised not to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin issued a 25-page report that not only detailed
Thayer's transgressions but also accused the entire court of ethics
violations. He said it was an ''institutional practice'' for judges
who had excused themselves from cases to review and discuss draft
decisions in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said the chief justice broke the law just by
listening to Thayer. He said Thayer, 54, tried to influence the
selection of substitute judges when his own divorce case came
before the high court.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin is expected to release investigators' reports this
week and sources say material in them could be more damaging than
the report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Judicial Conduct Committee will be conducting
an ethics investigation of Brock, Justice Sherman Horton, Justice
John Broderick and retired Justice William Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Horton had stunned lawmakers Saturday by saying the situation
was overblown, and on Sunday several lawmakers said his comments
revealed an arrogant and cavalier attitude on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read the comments by Horton and I wasn't happy. I think it
might be more than one judge'' whose job is at risk, said state
Sen. Mary Brown. ''If this is true, this is institutional. If you
have a judge who says it's not a big deal, that bothers me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sytek said political leaders would meet Monday to go over
options.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to be sure whatever we do is done correctly and
expeditiously,'' said Sytek.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the state Senate had been warned not to comment on
the specifics of the charges since they may be asked to sit in
judgment in an impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Speaker Donnalee Lozeau, who has worked closely with the
judicial branch during her legislative career, said she felt
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all have an obligation to the public's trust and nobody's
above the law,'' she said.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A Republican congressman said Sunday his

<HEADLINE> Finland Transport Strike Ends  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Unions and employers accepted a
mediation proposal Sunday to end a five-day transport strike that
threatened to cripple the country by bringing foreign trade to a
halt and stopping many buses and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The wage agreement, proposed by government-appointed National
Conciliator Juhani Salonius, came after nine hours of talks between
the two parties. Salonius said the agreement was for three years,
but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Most services that had been disrupted by the walkout were
expected to return to normal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 11,000 members of the Transport Workers Union had been on
strike since Wednesday after days of wage talks between unions and
employers broke down.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the strike began the main transport employers
federation rejected a mediation proposal by Salonius, saying it
would cost employers too much. It also ordered a lockout in the
transport sector, affecting 4,000 more workers.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial action halted most private buses and many of the
28,000 trucks transporting cargo. Two-thirds of the country's
foreign trade, $200 million daily, came to a standstill because of
a boycott by port workers and members of the seamen's union in
support of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Some key industries, including pulp and paper, had warned they
would have to close down operations within days if the strike
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The strike disrupted garbage collections in some cities, and
rail cargo was in danger of grinding to a halt as workers refused
to unload rail cars.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen appealed for a
resumption of the talks saying the strike was extremely serious and
was costing too much.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal-run buses in most cities were not affected, and the
government-run VR Finnish Railways had laid on extra cars to help
commuters get to work.

<HEADLINE> Texas Twister Cleanup Continues  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Office workers retrieved business
papers and belongings Sunday from a 35-story building damaged by
last week's deadly tornadoes, while parishioners from one church
gathered elsewhere to give thanks that more lives were not lost.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,300 members of Calvary Cathedral International sang
and danced at a Fort Worth exhibit hall. About 100 people were
attending Bible studies in the church Tuesday evening when a
tornado shredded the cathedral's roof and stripped walls from a
prayer tower.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let the rain fall,'' they sang Sunday with arms raised. ''Let
the wind blow. There is no place I cannot go. I have a friend. His
name is Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bob Nichols told the congregation that God's grace
prevented more lives from being lost. Four people were killed and
another is presumed dead after the tornado hit Fort Worth and
another hit Arlington and Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be a purpose in so many of our lives. Instead of
five funerals, there could have been 500 or 5,000,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Sunday, some downtown workers went back inside the
heavily damaged, 35-story Bank One building to try to salvage
crucial files, computers and other items.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have restricted access to parts of downtown
because of the danger of flying glass. Eight skyscrapers sustained
damage, and repair crews Sunday halted removal of damaged windows
so office workers could return.
</P>
<P>
   Crews also installed scaffolding over sidewalks to protect
people from falling debris.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-block area will be closed again Monday so construction
crews could finish cleaning up, a process expected to last until
the middle of the week, said city spokesman Pat Svacina.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance adjusters estimate damage to Tarrant County at $450
million.

<HEADLINE> Ointment May Protect Chemo Hair  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An ointment under development appears to
prevent chemotherapy from making hair fall out, a distressing side
effect of cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The clear gel has been tested only on lab rats, but developers
said its effects are dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We noticed a marked protection of the hair,'' said Stephen T.
Davis. ''It was just stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a scientist at Glaxo Wellcome, said the company hopes to
test the ointment on people, though he could not predict when that
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer cells grow faster than normal tissue. Chemotherapy works
by killing cells that are rapidly dividing. An unintended side
effect is damage to the hair follicles, which also divide more
quickly than other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   The Glaxo drug works by temporarily stopping the follicles from
dividing, shielding them from the effects of chemotherapy. The
effect wears off within a day and does not seem to make any
difference in long-term hair growth.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William N. Hait, director of the Cancer Institute of New
Jersey, called the research well done. ''This is part of an effort
of cancer researchers around the world to make treatment a lot more
tolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis described the research Sunday at a meeting of the American
Association for Cancer Research in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The compound, code-named GW8510, inhibits an enzyme called
cyclin-dependent kinase 2, one of the basic stimulants of cell
division.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that if further testing holds up, patients would rub
the gel into their hair before getting their cancer treatment and
then wash it out a few hours afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is not absorbed into the blood stream. As far as can
be told from rat experiments, it is safe and carries no side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   In the experiments, scientists gave rats a chemotherapy drug
called etoposide. Without treatment, 90 percent of the rats had
hair loss. GW8510 prevented this totally in half of the rats. In
the rest, its effectiveness ranged from 25 percent to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The gel also appears to protect hair from some other common
cancer drugs, such as Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide.
</P>
<P>
   Hait said that a treatment for hair loss is much needed. Some
patients avoid getting screened for cancer because they fear this
and other side effects of chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE> State lawmaker seeks end to fractional time charges on cell phoneusers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Five out of six cell phone service providers in
the New York area are charging customers a full minute's rate for
fractions of time as small as one second, a state Assembly member
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Stringer, D-Manhttan, said he would introduce
legislation to end the practice that costs some cell phone users
nearly $1,000 a year for calling time that they don't actually use.
</P>
<P>
   Charging of calls in one-minute increments -- even for a few
seconds of actual usage -- is common in long-distance service, and
is now applied to cell phones as well, Stringer told a sidewalk
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He said wirelesss communications is now a $37 billion industry
and ''it is high time that wireless service providers stop ripping
off consumers.'' The problem is a national one, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by his office found that among the six major telephone
service providers in the region, only Nextel charges calls by the
second. The others were AT&AMP;T, Bell Atlantic, MCI Worldcom,
Omnipoint and Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer said his survey found that the average phone call runs
2 minutes and 40 seconds, according to the Cellular Telephone
Industry Association, but cell phone users are charged for a full
three minutes.
</P>

   ''Depending on usage, every month New York consumers are paying
an extra $1.20 to $977.76 on cell phone bills,'' Stringer said.
''Consumers are being overbilled and they're not even aware of it
... this is why people look at their phone bills and wonder where
those extra charges are coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone company offices were closed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman John Heath, reached by phone, said the rounding
off of charges to the next minute has been ''traditional industry
practice'' for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not heard from customers that this is an issue with
them,'' he said. ''It hasn't really showed up on our radar
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringer said his proposed legislation would have bipartisan
sponsorship.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds March On Confederate Flag  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- More than 600 people set out Sunday on a
five-day, 120-mile protest march to Columbia to urge state
lawmakers to move the Confederate Flag from the Statehouse dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''Take it down!,'' chanted some marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people of South Carolina -- white and African-American --
want the flag to come down,'' said Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley
Jr., who had the idea for the march.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose is to say the people of South Carolina are in
step, and we want the Legislature to get in step with the people of
South Carolina,'' said the mayor, who carried the blue state flag
with its white palmetto tree and crescent as he led marchers into
the street.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers will walk only during daylight hours and plan to
arrive in Columbia for a rally on Thursday, when pro-flag
supporters have also scheduled a Statehouse rally.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
has called for a tourism boycott of the state, saying the
Confederate flag above the Statehouse in Columbia is a racist
emblem. Flag defenders say it is a symbol of Southern heritage and
honors Confederate war dead.
</P>
<P>
   Only state lawmakers can move the flag from the dome, and
several plans are under consideration. Organizers of the ''Get in
Step'' walk say it should be moved from the dome to a place of
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Vans and shuttle buses will take people to the march so they can
join as long as they can. It will start each day where it ended the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Pat Conroy, a South Carolinian, was on hand for the
start of the march. But he said he would pick up with the marchers
again on Thursday in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would find me dead on the highway if I tried to make the
entire march,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Conroy said South Carolina lawmakers do not like being told what
to do, but predicted the march will help resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be such hideous publicity, including this right
here, that it will help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who marched Sunday was former Gov. John West, a
state lawmaker when the flag was raised by the all-white 1962
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   West, who served as governor from 1971 to 1975, led an effort to
get lawmakers who raised the flag to ask for its removal.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I have had to say publicly, somewhat to my embarrassment,
in hindsight one of the mistakes I made as governor is not taking
it down,'' he said. ''It was not an issue then. Had it been an
issue, I would like to think I would have taken it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Byers of James Island said she had two great-grandfathers
who fought for the South in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Confederate flag is my heritage, but it should have been
taken down at the end of the Civil War,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a single pro-flag demonstrator as the marchers left a
park on the edge of the city's historic district after a brief
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Carter Sabo of Charleston stood with a Confederate flag and said
he wanted to make sure the flag is given a place of honor at the
Statehouse.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Mourn Mass Murder Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- Thousands of townspeople gathered on a
hilltop soccer field Sunday to mourn the mass murder of neighbors
they barely knew.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries joined residents of Kanungu and nearby villages to
deplore the deaths of 924 members of a reclusive Christian doomsday
sect who authorities say were murdered by their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan Vice President Speciosa Kazibwe called the architects of
the deadliest cult tragedy in modern history ''diabolic, malevolent
criminals masquerading as holy and religious people.''
</P>
<P>
   A March 17 blaze inside in the chapel of the sect's secretive
compound in Kanungu burned 530 sect members alive. Authorities
initially termed the deaths a mass suicide, but the discovery of
the bodies of six slain men in a compound latrine soon shifted that
assessment to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, mass graves at three other compounds linked to the
Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God have
yielded 388 more bodies, many stabbed and strangled. The pungent
scent of rotting bodies emanating Sunday from a latrine in the main
Kanungu compound suggested the toll could still rise.
</P>
<P>
   At least one cult compound, in the remote foothills of western
Uganda's Mountains of the Moon, has yet to be searched.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a former sect member said Sunday that the failure of
the sect's doomsday prediction spurred dissent and possibly murder.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, no sect member, past or present, had confirmed the
common belief here: that the failure of the world to end Dec. 31
led members to demand belongings they had surrendered to join the
sect -- a demand that led to retaliation by sect leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ahimbisibwe, whose mother and sister died in the fire,
said members began pressing Credonia Mwerinde, one of the
movement's founders, during worship services.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who sold their property would inquire one by one.
Whoever would inquire would disappear,'' said Ahimbisibwe, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Ahimbisibwe also said he saw a man whom he identified only as
''Hillary'' carrying a hammer and nails early on the morning of
March 17. It is partly this testimony that has persuaded
authorities that windows and doors were blocked to prevent sect
members from leaving the chapel before the flames killed them.
</P>
<P>
   Sect members were ''always preparing'' to go to another world,
Ahimbisibwe said. But they had no idea anything was about to
transpire in the chapel, which police said the members had called
''the ark'' -- a reference to the wooden ship in which the biblical
figure Noah was to have survived 40 days of floods that swept away
unbelievers and the corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   On the fateful morning, sect members marched to the chapel for
prayers dressed in the sect's uniform of green-and-white robes,
Ahimbisibwe said.
</P>
<P>
   Kazibwe acknowledged that Uganda's police and intelligence
agencies failed to expose the sect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through deception and conspiracy, these criminals outwitted
the security network (and) exploited the ignorance and illiteracy
of thousands,'' she said during Sunday's memorial, adding that the
government planned to convene an interagency group to study the
country's cults.
</P>
<P>
   She was not alone in her contrition.
</P>
<P>
   ''How come that despite our elaborate parish network as
churches, we failed to detect the fate that befell so many of our
brothers, sisters and children?'' asked the Rev. Grace Kaiso, head
of the Uganda Joint Christian Council.
</P>
<P>
   Therese Kibwetere sat in the crowd as speakers vilified her
estranged husband as a murderer. Authorities are pursuing Joseph
Kibwetere, the sect's self-described ''bishop,'' but his son
Juvenal Mugambwa has said he was killed in the Kanungu fire.
</P>
<P>
   Therese Kibwetere said her priest in her village of Kabumba
persuaded her to attend Sunday's ceremony. Asked if she felt she
owed the victims and their relatives an apology, she demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''What should I have done?'' she asked.

<HEADLINE> 30 Arrests in Mich. St. Celebration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Thirty people were arrested as
Michigan State basketball fans celebrated the school's weekend
victory in the NCAA Final Four semifinals, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But authorities called the Saturday celebration after Michigan
State downed Wisconsin to advance to Monday night's title game calm
compared to last year's riot here after the Spartans lost in the
college tournament's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year more than 10,000 people ran through East Lansing after
Michigan State lost to Duke in the Final Four. At that time, some
rioters overturned cars, set bonfires, broke windows and smashed
parking meters. Police eventually arrested 132 people.
</P>
<P>
   East Lansing police Sgt. Ray Hellmann said Sunday his department
arrested 26 people and Michigan State campus police another four
for misdemeanors ranging from disorderly conduct to indecent
exposure and alcohol possession.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight of the people arrested were Michigan State students,
Hellmann said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Withdrawl Fund Plans Slowed  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With Israeli-Syrian negotiations on hold,
Washington is proceeding more slowly with plans to fund an Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said on his way to Israel Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's comments, made during a flight from Nigeria to Israel,
were released by his spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, upon his arrival in
Israel Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said a proposed American aid package to fund a withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in 1967, would be
brought before the U.S. Congress if a withdrawal was agreed upon.
The cost of relocating Israeli settlers on the Golan and providing
intelligence systems to replace the heights' strategic advantage
has been estimated by Israeli officials to be as high as $17
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told his Cabinet ministers Sunday that he was not
optimistic that the talks with Syria, stalled since January, would
be renewed, but that he was leaving the option open. The sides are
at odds over control of precious water sources on the strategic
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged to pull troops out of a border zone Israel
occupies in south Lebanon by July, even if an agreement with Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon, does not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants Syria to guarantee security along Israel's border
with Lebanon after a withdrawal. Syria wants the withdrawal to take
place within the context of a broad peace deal that would include a
resolution on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Monday, said Barak's decision to withdraw from Lebanon by July was
''brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects Cohen was to discuss with Barak, who is also
defense minister, is a high-energy laser program, still being
developed, that would help Israel intercept Katyusha rockets used
by Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon. Cohen was to reaffirm the
United States' commitment ''to support Israel's qualitative edge,''
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Cohen were also to discuss weapons of mass destruction
in the region, particularly those held by Iran and Iraq, Bacon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who last visited here in October, is to leave Israel
later Monday for a tour of Egypt, Jordan and Persian Gulf
countries.

<HEADLINE> 30 Lynx Released in Colorado  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Thirty Canada lynx were let loose in the
southwestern Colorado high country Sunday, the first this year
under a program to bring the long-absent cat back to the state for
good.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 50 lynx are to be released this year under the
program. No more will be brought in after this year, but officials
will keep a close watch on the cats in the hope that they mate and
establish a permanent population.
</P>
<P>
   The pointy-eared cats released Sunday, 17 females and 13 males
imported from the Yukon and British Columbia, were being set free
on both sides of the Continental Divide in the San Juan Mountains
about 300 miles southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The remote release points, covered by snow after a stormy March,
are in the same general area where 41 lynx were set free last year
when the program got under way.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you increase density, you increase the likelihood that
the population will reproduce and, in the long term, thrive,'' said
Todd Malmsbury, spokesman for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope some of the new males will mate with females that
have staked out territory since their arrival last year. Breeding
season is beginning, and the cats normally give birth in June,
Malmsbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 41 lynx trapped in Canada and Alaska and released in
Colorado last year, 17 have died, including six of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Assailed by ranchers and outfitters, the reintroduction program
drew criticism from some environmentalists after the deaths. But
Malmsbury said officials had warned that as many as half the
animals would die.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the deaths, he said, was that the animals were
released within a day or two of their arrival in Colorado, leaving
them little time to adjust to their new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Canada lynx used to roam Colorado, but before last year the last
confirmed sighting was in 1973, near Vail. The state lists the
animal as endangered, and federal officials last month listed it as
threatened.

<HEADLINE> Mormon Church To Build New Temples  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Mormon church plans to build six new
temples -- three in the United States and three abroad -- president
Gordon B. Hinckley announced Sunday at the close of the faith's
170th semiannual General Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The new temples in this country will be built in Lubbock, Texas;
Snowflake, Ariz.; and somewhere in the Tri-Cities area of
Washington state, comprised of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, temples were announced for Aba, Nigeria; Asuncion,
Paraguay; Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Schedules have yet to be set for groundbreaking or construction.
</P>
<P>
   ''And so we will go on building temples,'' Hinckley said.
</P>
<P>
   As head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
Hinckley has made temple-building a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Temples, where Mormons perform sacred ordinances like eternal
marriage and baptism of the dead, are open to church members only
and differ from the more common meeting halls where regular
services are held.
</P>
<P>
   There are 76 temples in operation around the world -- up from 53
less than two years ago -- and the 77th is set for dedication
Thursday in Palmyra, N.Y., the home of the church's founder, Joseph
Smith. A 78th is to be opened in Fresno, Calif. next Sunday and 34
more are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Five other temples have been announced previously but are not
yet being built.
</P>
<P>
   Mormonism's rapid growth was a central theme throughout the
conference as participants called attention to the massive new
conference center used for the first time this weekend. With seats
for 21,000 -- far more than the 6,000-seat Tabernacle that housed
conferences for 133 years -- the modern hall was cited along with
the temple building as a symbol of the young faith's incredible
expansion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Ruby Folsom Ellis Austin, the sister of
one Alabama governor and mother-in-law of another, did Saturday.
She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, nicknamed ''Big Ruby,'' served as the state's unofficial
first lady for one year during the first term of her brother, Gov.
James E. ''Big Jim'' Folsom.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Austin's daughter, Cornelia, married Gov. George Wallace
after the death of Wallace's first wife, former Gov. Lurleen
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Ruby'' became a legend in her own right, known for her
sharp sense of humor and her ability to cultivate Alabama's
political movers and shakers as well as reporters covering her
famous 6-foot, 8-inch brother.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, who was nearly 6 feet tall herself, and her two children
-- Cornelia and Charles Ellis -- moved into the governor's mansion in
Montgomery in 1947, not long after Folsom was elected governor in
1946.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom's first wife had died before he took the oath of office,
and Austin assumed the duties of Alabama's first lady.

   McAllister's use of neon and streamlined curves graced many
buildings and won him the praise of architectural historians. His
design for the Bob's Big Boy in the Toluca Lake area of Los Angeles
-- the third Bob's built and the oldest still in existence --
prompted the Los Angeles Conservancy's Modern Committee to lead a
campaign in 1992 to have it declared a California State Point of
Historical Interest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, McAllister set the tone for the Las Vegas Strip when he
designed the El Rancho Hotel dude ranch, which featured chuck wagon
murals, rambling bungalows and a cowpoke casino. He later worked on
the original plans for the Desert Inn, and designed the Fremont and
Horseshoe hotel casinos, which still stand.
Gregory B. Shuker
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gregory B. Shuker, a journalist and documentary
film maker whose cinema verite-style work on news events and social
issues won prizes at Cannes and elsewhere, died March 29 of liver
cancer. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Shuker was a Life magazine reporter in 1959 when he discovered
its then-experimental television unit, Drew Associates, and
eventually moved from print to documentary film-making, using the
unobtrusive cinema-verite style.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Time-Life, Shuker joined the Public Broadcast
Laboratory, forerunner of PBS, and participated in two pioneering
films -- ''The Chair,'' about an attorney trying to save a condemned
man, and ''Free At Last,'' a 90-minute documentary about Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. that by chance was being made when King was
murdered in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chair'' won the grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival;
''Free at Last'' won an Emmy and first prize in the Venice Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Shuker earlier won a grand prize at Venice for ''Faces in
November,'' showing mourners at President Kennedy's funeral. Other
work included ''Letters from Vietnam,'' a 1965 documentary, and a
1967 ABC-TV special, ''Twiggy: Why?'' in which he interviewed media
theorist Marshall McLuhan.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include three children and five grandchildren.
Allie M. Smith
</P>
<P>
   PLAINS, Ga. (AP) -- Allie M. Smith, the mother of former first
lady Rosalynn Carter, died Saturday. She was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Born Dec. 24, 1905, Smith was an accomplished seamstress who
also sold milk and butter to support her four children after her
husband, mechanic Edgar Smith, died of leukemia in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   For years she served as treasurer of Plains United Methodist
Church and was a retired postal clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 72, is the oldest of Smith's four children. When Smith
went to work at a grocery store to support the family, Carter
assumed much of the responsibility for caring for her sister and
two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   She also contributed to the family income by working after
school in a beauty parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very poor and worked hard,'' Carter once said.

<HEADLINE> Defector Indentifies With Elian  </HEADLINE>
By WILSON RING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The man once known as the ''littlest defector'' for
choosing this country when he was just 12 came to Miami on Sunday
to lend his support and sympathy to 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Polovchak, who defied his parents two decades ago and
chose to stay in the United States while they returned to the
Ukraine, said that while Elian may not understand the legal battle
over his custody, the boy's perspective on American life is
probably clear enough for him to have an opinion about his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel he's a little more mature and understands,'' Polovchak
said. ''Even a 6-year-old will realize you don't have to stand in
line for food, that even dogs have aisles for food in the
supermarket in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak met Elian and his Miami relatives Sunday to offer
support and sympathy for their plight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just said they should stay strong and believe in their
cause,'' Polovchak said after a 45-minute meeting with the family.
''I believe eventually they will prevail. It's overwhelming to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 12-year-old defector, Polovchak listed Jell-O and bananas
as top reasons for wanting to stay in the United States. But what
he really was expressing was a love of freedom, he says. He
marveled at walking in a grocery store and plucking things from the
aisles; he was used to long lines and small rations.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak's refusal to return to the Ukraine with his parents
set off a 5{-year custody battle that didn't end until he turned 18
and was granted U.S. citizenship. He's now an office manager in
Chicago, is married and has a 6-year-old son of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak said he understood what Elian was going through during
the custody tug-of-war between his Miami relatives and his father
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He said the best solution for Elian might be for his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to come with his wife and young son to live
with him in the United States, rather than fighting to take him
back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, visibly frustrated over the
attention focused on the boy, said Elian was in good spirits when
he and family members went to church Sunday morning. But when the
family returned later from an afternoon county fair, Elian seemed
tired.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a little bit stressed out,'' said Elian's cousin
Marisleysis Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time he goes out, he has 30 of you staring at him,'' she
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak said the scene outside Lazaro Gonzalez's home reminded
him of the media attention he received during his own custody
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looked at as a traitor to my country,'' he said,
recalling that time. ''My father was under a lot of pressure to
return. Elian's father is under tremendous pressure, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak has visited his parents twice since becoming a U.S.
citizen, and says the family wounds have healed somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been following Elian's case since the boy was
found clinging to an inner tube off Florida's coast on Thanksgiving
Day. The boy's mother and 10 others died when their boat sank two
days earlier during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Polovchak said his trip to Miami was financed by an unidentified
California doctor not affiliated with any Cuban exile group.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Woman Decries Taliban  </HEADLINE>
By SHEILA HOTCHKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Frayba Wakili of an Afghanistan spent her
second day in the United States at an international feminist
conference pleading for help for women in her homeland who remain
under the control of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Afghan women was a focal point at Feminist Expo
2000, a three-day conference to review the feminist movement's
achievements and set new goals.
</P>
<P>
   Swatches of blue mesh, pinned to the clothes of many
conference-goers, represented the mesh that covers the eyes of
Afghan women, who are required to wear burqas that cover them from
head to foot.
</P>
<P>
   The country's women are no longer allowed to work, go to school
past the age of 8 or walk outside without an escort, under the
harsh brand of Islamic law espoused by the Taliban. Those who break
the rules are sometimes beaten in the streets by Taliban soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Wakili spent the last six years in a refugee camp in Pakistan as
her country was first torn apart by civil war and then taken over
by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taliban abused and used our religion to oppress women,''
Wakili said. If she returned to Afghanistan, ''I cannot hold a job
or go to school, and so would be forced to beg for food like
thousands of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavis Leno, wife of ''Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, urged those
at the expo to pressure the U.S. government and the United Nations
''to put some teeth into their condemnation of the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If they don't, make them say why not -- I want to know who
benefits from these terrible men being in power,'' she said.
''Essentially, the women of Afghanistan have been left with nothing
but their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile issue at the expo was the abortion pill
mifepristone. The pill, which has been available in France since
1988 when it was known as RU-486, has been waiting for Food and
Drug Administration approval for about four years.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Feminist Majority Foundation, which organized the
conference, vowed to campaign for the drug's approval, declaring it
not only an effective method of abortion but also a potential
treatment for illnesses including meningioma tumors and fibroid
tumors, which can lead to hysterectomies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If men were having something that major, they'd be looking for
a cure really fast,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist
Majority Foundation. ''We cut out female organs and think nothing
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference covered a wide range of other topics including
sweatshop labor, eating disorders, violence against women and the
future of the feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Steinem, the founder of Ms. Magazine and a longtime
feminist leader, said the conference showed that feminism's time is
not yet finished.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't let them impede the movement by declaring it over, which
they do every Wednesday at tea time and have done since 1969,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Syria Won't Back Lebanese Remarks  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Syria on Sunday distanced itself from a
top Lebanese official's suggestion that Syrian troops might be
deployed at the Israeli-Lebanon border after an Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese Defense Minister Ghazi Zueiter's remarks, reported on
Saturday, had alarmed Israel and led to speculation that the idea
was unofficially backed by the Syrian government.
</P>
<P>
   However, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, on a brief
visit to Beirut, made it clear that Syria did not endorse Zueiter's
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is wrong for some of us to make some statements,
even if emanating from personal sympathy, that will reflect
negatively or from which Israel benefits to push matters toward an
unpeaceful direction,'' al-Sharaa said after meeting with President
Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, the main power in Lebanon, maintains 30,000 troops there,
although none are in the south, where guerrillas are trying to oust
Israel from a zone its troops have held since 1985. Israel has said
it will withdraw from south Lebanon in July.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Zueiter was quoted as saying that asking Syrian
forces to accompany the Lebanese army to the areas vacated by
Israel ''would be one of the important possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Zueiter said his comments were taken out of context and
that he was only expressing a personal opinion, but by then alarm
bells had begun ringing in Israel with Cabinet ministers warning of
serious repercussions. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said such
a move was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders believe that a unilateral withdrawal would
deprive Syria of leverage in its on-and-off peace negotiations.
Syria has in the past used south Lebanon as a bargaining chip
because it is in a position to influence the Lebanese guerrillas
fighting Israeli troops in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, Syria and Lebanon want Israel to conclude peace
with them first before vacating south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the main guerrilla group battling Israeli troops in
southern Lebanon, has not said what it will do after Israel
withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   The group's deputy secretary general, Naim Kassem, warned Sunday
that a withdrawal would not guarantee calm for Israel because of
its other ongoing disputes with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even with a withdrawal from every inch of the occupied
Lebanese territories, Israel will not have security guarantees
because it is still involved in the Palestinian question and it is
still occupying the Golan Heights,'' Kassem told a crown in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Kassem said Hezbollah was not worried by Israel's threats of
airstrikes against Lebanese infrastructure in retaliation against
guerrilla attacks. He did not specify if Hezbollah would conduct
attacks into northern Israel after a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects of Israeli-Syrian peace appear distant after last
Sunday's failed summit between President Clinton and Syrian
President Hafez Assad to get negotiations restarted, stalled since
January.
</P>
<P>
   State-run Beirut radio said al-Sharaa handed Lahoud, the
Lebanese president, a message from Assad on the outcome of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa reiterated Syria's position that it will resume peace
negotiations with Israel only after the Jewish state committed
itself to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau that Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Israel maintains it cannot decide the extent of its pullout
before first knowing what security arrangements and level of
normalization in relations Syria is willing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa ruled out the possibility of a new war in the Middle
East. He said U.N. resolutions called for complete Israeli
withdrawals from southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights ''in the
framework of a just and comprehensive peace settlement.''

<HEADLINE> Warships To Train Off Puerto Rico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Warships will begin training
Tuesday in waters off Puerto Rico but will steer clear of a
controversial training ground on the island of Vieques, the U.S.
Navy said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 18 ships from the United States, Colombia, Britain,
Canada and the Netherlands will participate in the maneuvers, Navy
spokesman Jeff Gordon said. The exercises will take place on the
high seas south of Puerto Rico, though some anti-mine training
could be done as close as 12 miles from shore, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vieques won't be involved at all,'' Gordon said. ''This will
all be way off the coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy exercises have been a controversial issue in the U.S.
territory since a bombing accident in the Vieques training ground
killed a civilian security guard on April 19, 1999. Protesters have
occupied the bombing range since then to thwart further exercises.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Navy was forced to move training to the Gulf of
Mexico and Florida's Eglin Air Force Base because of the protests.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised to order the Navy out of Vieques
by 2003 if the island's 9,400 residents vote for the expulsion in a
referendum, likely to be held in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   This week's training is part of an annual multinational exercise
that began March 20 off the coast of Colombia, Gordon said. The
exercise will end off Puerto Rico on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Between August and November, warships will sail around South
America to participate in a second round of Unitas exercises with
Latin American navies, Gordon said.

Microsoft Ruling Expected Soon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks between Microsoft and government lawyers broke down
this weekend, and a decision is expected any day from U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson in the antitrust lawsuit. Sources said government lawyers no
longer were insisting on a breakup, but that Microsoft refused to accept
proposals submitted by the Justice Department and 19 states who sued the
company. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates contended yesterday that ''it became
impossible to settle because the Department of Justice and the states were not
working together. Between them, they appeared to be demanding either a breakup
of our company or other extreme concessions.''

Relatives Say Elian's Father Unfit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives took another stab at
trying to keep him in the United States by saying that his father in Cuba was
unfit to care of the young boy. The father's lawyer said the ''outrageous''
allegations were a sign the Miami relatives are getting desperate. The family's
arguments, backed up by members of Congress who want Elian to remain in the
United States, come as the Justice Department insists that the relatives agree
to surrender Elian if they lose their pending court case.

Israeli Withdrawal Fund Plans Slowed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With Israeli-Syrian negotiations on hold, Washington is
proceeding more slowly with plans to fund an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said on his way to Israel. Spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said a proposed American aid package would be brought before the
U.S. Congress if a withdrawal was agreed upon. The cost of relocating Israeli
settlers on the Golan and providing intelligence systems to replace the heights'
strategic advantage has been estimated by Israeli officials to be as high as $17
billion.

Ugandans Mourn Mass Cult Deaths
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KANUNGU, Uganda (AP) -- Thousands of townspeople gathered on a hilltop soccer
field Sunday to mourn the mass murder of neighbors they barely knew. Dignitaries
joined residents of Kanungu and nearby villages to deplore the deaths of 924
members of a reclusive Christian doomsday sect who authorities say were murdered
by their leaders. A March 17 blaze inside the chapel of the sect's secretive
compound in Kanungu burned 530 sect members alive. Authorities initially termed
the deaths a mass suicide, but the discovery of the bodies of six slain men in a
compound latrine soon shifted that assessment to murder.

Refining Prostate Testing Will Help
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A researcher at Northwestern University reports
fine-tuning the standard screening test for prostate cancer can help doctors
reduce false alarms by up to 40 percent and perhaps find early-stage tumors that
might otherwise be missed. About three-quarters of men with prostate cancer have
elevated levels of a protein called prostate-specific antigen -- PSA. Testing
blood for PSA has been a standard screening method for older men since about
1990. However, other conditions, such as non-cancerous prostate enlargement, can
also make PSA levels shoot up.

'Brockovich' Retains Top Spot
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Julia Roberts' ''Erin Brockovich'' remained the nation's
top movie for the third straight weekend, according to studio estimates today.
The legal drama took in $14.2 million to hold off the debut of the animated
buddy flick ''The Road to El Dorado.'' The heavily hyped ''El Dorado'' grossed a
soft $12.5 million to finish in second place. Erin Brockovich,'' the story of a
real-life single mother who led a court battle over polluted water, has grossed
$76.2 million in 17 days. It is poised to become Roberts' third straight $100
million movie.

thrilling a boisterous crowd by beating Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten in a dramatic
four-set marathon. Looking weary, Sampras took a 6-2 lead in the final
tiebreaker but then made four consecutive errors to make the score 6-6. He held
another match point at 7-6 but double-faulted, and hit a backhand return long at
8-7. Sampras, seeded second behind Andre Agassi, earned his third title at Key
Biscayne but his first since 1994. He received $410,000 and Kuerten earned
$215,000.

   TORONTO (AP) -- Sam Perkins made all six of his 3-point attempts and scored a
season-high 22 points as the Indiana Pacers embarrassed the Toronto Raptors on
NBC with a 104-83 rout today. Perkins, who had missed 17 of his previous 22
3-point attempts, was left wide open against the Raptors, who have lost seven of
their last eight games. Jalen Rose, who has led the Pacers in scoring in eight
of the last nine games, had a team-high 23. The Pacers were 10-for-22 from
behind the arc, while the Raptors were just 2-for-16.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Premier Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
By SHIGEYOSHI KIMURA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO, Japan (AP) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was
hospitalized Sunday after reportedly fainting, and media reported
he may have suffered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's Juntendo University Hospital said Monday that the
62-year-old premier remained under care, and newspapers said a team
of cardiovascular experts and neurosurgeons was monitoring Obuchi's
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were not releasing details of his
condition. Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki told reporters late
Sunday that Obuchi, who was admitted to the hospital early Sunday,
was conscious and alert and did not use an ambulance to go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But NHK, Japan's state-run television network, and two major
newspapers -- the Asahi and the Mainichi -- quoted unidentified
medical sources as saying Obuchi may have suffered a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The Asahi report said Obuchi lost consciousness before being
taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi has over the past few days had to deal with a major
volcanic eruption in northern Japan and turmoil in his ruling
coalition. Last weekend, he traveled to southern Japan to inspect
preparations for the G-8 summit in July.
</P>
<P>
   Senior ruling party officials met to discuss the situation after
the news conference. Aoki said the possibility that he would be
named acting prime minister, if necessary, was being considered.
That had not been done as of Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not want to announce anything that is mere speculation,''
Aoki told about 100 reporters who swarmed to the hospital. However,
he said he called the news conference because Obuchi is the head of
government and the situation should ''be disclosed honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese media reported that Obuchi has a chronic heart
condition, but it was not known if that was related to his current
hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party had ejected a junior
partner, the Liberal Party, from the government coalition in a move
that still left him firmly in control.
</P>
<P>
   That left the mighty LDP and the New Komeito, a party affiliated
with a lay Buddhist organization, in control alone.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kyodo reported Sunday that LDP and New Komeito were
going to form a new coalition with some members of the Liberal
Party who broke away from their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the New Komeito party went unanswered Sunday, and LDP
headquarters guard Kazumoto Kawashima said officials were
unavailable to confirm the report on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi became prime minister in July 1998, and many analysts
believed he would not last long in office.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first year he jump-started the economy, consolidated
his party's dominant position in parliament and championed
legislation strengthening Japan's regional security role and giving
official status to the Rising Sun flag.
</P>
<P>
   His fortunes have sagged recently, however, with polls finding
that support for his cabinet is declining.

<HEADLINE> 2 Brazilian Town Leaders Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) ---- The mayor and treasurer of
northeastern Duas Estradas city were shot to death, and police
Sunday searched for a city council member in connection with the
killings, media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joao da Costa Lima and treasurer, Orlando Pereira, were
buried Sunday in the city, located in Paraiba state about 1,200
miles northeast of Rio, Globonews television reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police are looking for City Councilman Antonio Fernandes
Massimo, who is suspected in connection with Saturday's slayings,
Globonews said.
</P>
<P>
   Further details on the killing were not provided, and police and
city government officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Assassinations of politicians are not uncommon in Brazil's
northeast. In neighboring Alagoas state, most legislators wear
bulletproof vests to work and travel only with armed bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   In February, two men shot and killed the mayor of Jandaira, in
Bahia state some 870 miles northeast of Rio, as he played cards at
home.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parents Led Kids to Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNYARIGI, Uganda (AP) -- After her young grandchildren's abrupt
departure, after the gas-fueled flames and the charred remains,
74-year-old Margaret Kibetenga wonders if there's something she
could have done.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, her daughter-in-law came to her mud-walled home to
fetch two children she had left in Kibetenga's care. Saying she
needed to take them to visit a sick relative, Jane Ayebare began
packing her youngsters' belongings.
</P>
<P>
   When Ayebare muttered something about the end of the world being
near, Kibetenga thought little of it. Ayebare had joined a strange
religious group, but as far as Kibetenga was concerned, she was
still Catholic. That's all that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the world didn't end Dec. 31, as the sect had
predicted. But for Ayebare and her four children, life ended 10
weeks later in the flames of a sealed chapel belonging to Uganda's
doomsday cult.
</P>
<P>
   They were not alone. Terrified, trusting or willingly marching
off to glory, children of the cult streamed out of hill villages by
the hundreds to die trapped in the flames of the sealed church or
by ropes and knives in the hands of grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Children made up a large part of the bodies recovered from mass
graves in southwestern Uganda since the March 17 inferno at the
chapel at Kanungu alerted the world, and some Ugandans, to the
Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God.
Authorities now are pursuing the sect's leaders, who they believe
masterminded the murders of at least 924 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never took it seriously,'' Kibetenga now says, her eyes
dropping to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   For the movement, childhood was an occasion of sin. ''These days
... the majority of the youths go to hell; only very few go to
heaven in a day,'' its handbook states. The sect's leaders went to
brutal lengths to ensure children wouldn't fall into what they
believed were the clutches of Satan.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Credonia Mrewinde, one of the movement's
founders, forced 60 children to live in a 15-by-40-foot backyard
shed in the village of Kabumba, according to Juvenal Rugambwa, son
of sect leader Joseph Kibwetere.
</P>
<P>
   He said the shed's windows were nailed shut and the children
forced to sleep on the dirt floor, where many contracted scabies, a
contagious skin disease.
</P>
<P>
   Children and their parents were placed in separate living
quarters when they joined the sect, Rugambwa and former sect
members said. Parents also were forced to withdraw their children
from school.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Paolino Tomaino, who became acquainted with the sect when
he worked in Kabumba from 1976 to 1989, says it was inevitable that
the children would follow their parents, even to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would expect a Uganda child to follow his parent,''
Tomaino said. ''They were with their parents. I'm sure they
couldn't leave.''
</P>
<P>
   John Katebalirwe sold his mud hut for $30, then forced his wife,
27-year-old married daughter and her seven younger brothers and
sisters away to attend a gathering at sect headquarters in Kanungu.
Neighbors say the wife and eight children went with him
unwillingly.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told us he was going to pray in Kanungu,'' said Aida
Kaguze, who bought the hut from Katebalirwe. ''They had heard from
God, and they were going to meet Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Katarina Tumuhimbise's daughters, aged 8 and 14,
left the remote western foothill village of Sweswe with adults who
were leading other children to the March 18 dedication of a new
church at the sect's home in Kanungu.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in Sweswe said the girls' parents couldn't afford to
go to Kanungu. Instead, they stayed behind with their three younger
children at their mud hut, decorated by a shrine with straw prayer
mats and pictures of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and the pope.
</P>
<P>
   The father insisted to his neighbors that he had left the cult
but wasn't able to stop his girls from going since they still were
members.
</P>
<P>
   Tumuhimbse, rosaries draped around her neck as she spoke to a
reporter, denied membership as well and said a woman in the sect
had taken her children away. The father chased after them, but in
vain.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughters were among the 530 sect members on March 17 who
entered the chapel on the sect's main compound in Kanungu to pray.
Within minutes, they were enveloped by what police believe was a
gas-fueled fire sparked by an explosive combination of water and
sulphuric acid.

Judge To Rule in Microsoft Case

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in Washington
is expected to rule on the Microsoft antitrust suit after talks between
government lawyers and the computer giant broke down this weekend. Describing
the negotiations as ''very complex,'' Iowa Attorney General Thomas Miller said
''many factors'' led to the breakdown but ''the position of the states was not
the cause of the failure.'' Sources said government lawyers no longer were
insisting on a breakup, but that Microsoft refused to accept proposals submitted

Elian's Father Maligned in Fla.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives took another stab at
trying to keep him in the United States by saying that his father in Cuba was
unfit to care for the young boy. The father's lawyer said the ''outrageous''
allegations were a sign the Miami relatives are getting desperate. The family's
arguments, backed up by members of Congress who want Elian to remain in the
United States, come as the Justice Department insists that the relatives agree
to surrender Elian if they lose their pending court case.

Warships To Train Off Puerto Rico

States, Colombia, Britain, Canada and the Netherlands will participate in the

Verison (pronounced vurr-EYE-zun) is an ''inexact composite'' of the words
''vision'' and ''horizon.'' The combined company is expected to spend more than
$300 million to promote the new brand name, according to Ad Age. The two
telecommunications companies are awaiting approval by the Federal Communications

Castro: Elian's Dad May Come Monday

   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Elian Gonzalez's father was
willing to travel alone to the United States tomorrow morning if U.S. officials
promise to turn over the boy to him and let them return to Cuba right away.
Failing that, visas would be sought for father Juan Miguel Gonzalez and an
entourage of more than 30 people to leave for the United States as early as
Tuesday to try to get Elian back, Castro said today during a live appearance on
national television. Last week, Castro said Gonzalez was willing to travel to

<HEADLINE> Devils 4, Lightning 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Patrik Elias had two goals and Martin Brodeur
stopped 26 shots as the New Jersey Devils beat the Tampa Bay
Lightning 4-1 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils lead Philadelphia and Washington by four points in
the race for the top sees in the Eastern Conference. New Jersey --
with 101 points -- topped the 100-point mark for the fourth straight
year.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who tied Terry Sawchuk for the most wins over a
five-year span with 195, improved to 18-4-2 against Tampa Bay. He
came within 3:40 of his second consecutive shutout, but Fredrik
Modin scored for the Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils lead the series between the teams 25-6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Elias and Vladimir Malakhov scored power-play goals during a
three-goal first-period. Elias added his team-leading 35th goal in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, one of the NHL's top power-play teams, converted two
of five chances. In the past three games, New Jersey has six goals
in 13 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning were outshot 9-0 before Brodeur robbed Vincent
Lecavalier from point-blank range midway through the period.
Brodeur also stopped Mike Johnson on a partial breakaway late in
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Elias scored his first goal from near the left post off a pass
through the slot by Petr Sykora during a 5-on-3 power-play at 4:06
of the first period. Malakhov scored his first goal since Mar. 18,
1999 -- a span of 25 games -- just over a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   Malakhov, who missed Montreal's first 53 games with a knee
injury, was traded by the Canadiens to New Jersey last month.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Stevens had the other first-period goal for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay defenseman Jassen Cullimore left in the first period
with a left knee sprain. Lightning forward Todd Warriner also went
out in the period with a right hand injury.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 106, Knicks 82  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- At this stage of their respective careers,
Shaquille O'Neal is far too much for Patrick Ewing to handle. It
showed again Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, a virtual lock for his first Most Valuable Player award,
scored 24 of his 34 points in the first half as the Los Angeles
Lakers rolled to a fight-marred 106-82 victory over the New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the ninth straight and 28th in 29 games for the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old O'Neal also had 12 rebounds, four assists and
five blocked shots in dominating the middle against the 37-year-old
Ewing, who is in the twilight of his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who shot only 6-of-17, had 14 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant and Chris Childs were ejected following an exchange
of punches with 43.4 seconds left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant came around a screen and appeared to clip Childs in the
chin with an elbow. While play continued, the two exchanged words
and bumped chests before Childs threw two punches, with Bryant
responding with a punch of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Childs' punches appeared to hit Bryant in the neck and upper
chest, while Bryant's punch missed. Neither player was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Ewing exchanged harsh words and the game was delayed
for nearly five minutes before Bryant, who had 17 points, eight
assists and six rebounds, angrily left the court. Childs, who
scored 10 points, left more peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Both players face automatic suspensions for throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination of two Los Angeles wins or two Portland losses
gives the Lakers (62-12), who have lost only once since Feb. 1,
homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The win also gave the Lakers a 27-3 record against Eastern
Conference teams -- the best record by a West team against the East
in NBA history. They play their final eight games against Western
Conference teams.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Eastern Conference champion Knicks, meanwhile,
suffered their most lopsided loss of the season in losing for just
second time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson added 13 points and Allan Houston had 11 for the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   With Ewing leading the way, the Knicks outscored the Lakers 13-4
to start the second half to draw within nine points, but that was
as close as they would get.
</P>
<P>
   It was 71-60 when Bryant and Childs had their exchange, and
75-60 entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who had 43 points and 10 rebounds to lead the Lakers
past the Knicks 92-85 two weeks earlier, served notice on Ewing
early in this game, blocking his first shot and then scoring the
game's first basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who never trailed, led 28-21 entering the second
quarter and 58-40 at halftime. O'Neal scored the final seven points
of the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers had winning streaks of seven, 16 and 19 games
earlier this season. The 19-game streak, snapped at Washington on
March 16, was one short of the second-longest in NBA history. ...
The win was also the 14th straight at home for the Lakers, whose
last loss at Staples Center came against Portland on Jan. 22. ...
All indications are veteran Lakers guard Ron Harper, who scored 12
points, will be placed on the injured list in the next few days,
giving him a chance to get some needed rest before the playoffs.
The 36-year-old Harper, who has tender knees, would have to miss
five games. ... Filmmaker Spike Lee, a rabid Knicks' fan, had a
courtside seat, like he does at Madison Square Garden. ... The
previous Western Conference record against the East was 33-5 by the
1971-72 Lakers, who went on to win the NBA championship.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Starter Sprains Ankle  </HEADLINE>
By KEN BERGER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Tennessee's Kristen Clement sprained her
right ankle and did not start the NCAA championship game against
Connecticut on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The injury happened during a shootaround Sunday morning at the
First Union Center, the site of the game. Tennessee spokeswoman
Debby Jennings said Clement rolled the ankle, but did not know
exactly how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, one of the Lady Vols' emotional leaders, entered the
arena on crutches and walked onto the court with an obvious limp.
X-rays showed no broken bones, and Clement underwent treatment
before the game, said Dr. William T. Youmans, the team's orthopedic
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Clement's absence would severely hinder the Lady Vols, seeking
their seventh national title and fourth in five years. Clement's
job was to guard Sue Bird, UConn's dangerous point guard. Senior
Kyra Elzy, an excellent defensive player, started in place of
Clement.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, nicknamed ''Ace,'' stood beneath the basket during
presume warmups, still wearing earrings. She shouted encouragement
to teammates while bobbing her head to the tunes of the UConn pep
band. Moments before the tip, Clement stood in the middle of a
circle of teammates while they joined hands, chanted and bobbed
back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee trainer Jenny Moshak worked quickly last week when
national player of the year Tamika Catchings sprained her right
ankle in the first half of the Mideast Regional final against Texas
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Catchings missed only about seven minutes of the game and
finished with 16 rebounds as Tennessee won 57-44.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, from the Philadelphia suburb of Broomall, is averaging
5.6 points and a team-high 3.5 assists.

<HEADLINE> Japan Central Bank Optimistic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's central bank said Monday that business
confidence at major manufacturing companies improved for the fifth
consecutive quarter, reflecting growing faith the country is
pulling out of its lengthy economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   In its closely watched quarterly ''tankan'' survey for March,
the Bank of Japan said sentiment among large manufacturers had
brightened to a figure of minus nine from minus 17 in the last
survey in December.
</P>
<P>
   The tankan measures the percentage of firms seeing business
conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions worsen.
The result was in line with analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The growing confidence also fit with economists' assessment that
Japan's economy was gradually gaining strength. The country is
struggling to emerge from its worst economic slowdown in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production was up in February, and government
officials say figures on machine orders and capital expenditure
indicate a recovery is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy, however, still faces troubles. The economy
shrank 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter, pushing the
country technically back into recession. Private consumption
dropped a steep 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies plan to reduce capital expenditure by 0.6
percent on average this fiscal year, according to the tankan
survey. That decrease was smaller than the expected decline of 0.9
percent in the year that began April 1.
</P>
<P>
   In its previous report in December, the Bank of Japan showed
sentiment among large manufacturers had gained to a figure minus 17
from minus 22 from the earlier survey in September.

<HEADLINE> Heat 88, Spurs 84  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Jamal Mashburn scored 26 points and Miami
benefitted from Tim Duncan's poor free throw shooting to beat San
Antonio 88-84 Sunday, the Heat's 16th win in their last 17 home
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs had their five-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Tied at 83, P.J. Brown blocked Duncan's shot in the lane, and on
the other end, Mashburn hit a 3-pointer, his second of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 86-84 with 1:16 to play, Duncan missed the second of
two free throws. Tim Hardaway then hit a scoop shot under Duncan to
give Miami an 88-84 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan could have pulled the Spurs to within two points, but
missed two more from the line.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson led the Spurs with 28.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning picked up his fifth foul with 8:26 to play. With
Mourning on the bench, the Spurs dominated the lane and took their
first lead of the game on a 3-pointer by Jaren Jackson with 3:42
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat led 53-44 at the half behind 13 points from Mashburn
and 10 from Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio trimmed Miami's nine-point, first-quarter lead to
30-28 with three consecutive baskets in the opening minutes of the
second quarter. But the Heat used a 14-4 run to take their largest
lead of the first half at 44-32 with a little more than five
minutes to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   In the spurt, Bruce Bowen hit a pair of 3-pointers. His first
caused coach Gregg Popovich to call a timeout. His second came on
Miami's next possession, about 45 seconds later. It infuriated
Popovich and forced him to take another timeout.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs got within two points several times in the third
quarter. Robinson scored 15 in the third, hitting all nine of his
free throws and adding a dunk and two short jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   @Notes: Heat coach Pat Riley denied a report in The New York
Times that a Lakers representative approached him three times last
year about returning to Los Angeles. ''I heard those rumors
myself,'' Riley said. ''They probably emanated out of New York.''
... Dan Majerle's 3-pointer in the first quarter extended the
Heat's consecutive game streak with a 3-pointer to 497 games, an
NBA record. ... Miami now has beaten the defending NBA champs for
the fifth straight season. The Spurs, playing without Duncan, beat
the Heat 93-69 on Feb. 29 in San Antonio. The last time Miami
didn't record at least one win against the champions was during the
1994-95 season when it went 0-2 against the Houston Rockets. ...
San Antonio guard Terry Porter, who played for Miami last season,
dressed for the game but did not play. He has been out since early
March with a sprained left medial collateral ligament.

<HEADLINE> 33 Lynx Released in Colorado  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Thirty-three Canada lynx were let loose in the
southwestern Colorado high country Sunday, the first this year
under a program to bring the long-absent cat back to the state for
good.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 50 lynx are to be released this year under the
program. No more will be brought in after this year, but officials
will keep a close watch on the cats in the hope that they mate and
establish a permanent population.
</P>
<P>
   The pointy-eared cats released Sunday,
</P>
<P>
   imported from the Yukon and British Columbia, were being set
free on both sides of the Continental Divide in the San Juan
Mountains about 300 miles southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Division of Wildlife had planned to release 30 lynx Sunday,
17 females and 13 males, but spokesman Todd Malmsbury said
biologists looked at the lynx in holding pens and decided three
more were ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   He did not know the sex of the additional three.
</P>
<P>
   The remote release points, covered by snow after a stormy March,
are in the same general area where 41 lynx were set free last year
when the program got under way.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you increase density, you increase the likelihood that
the population will reproduce and, in the long term, thrive,'' said
Todd Malmsbury, spokesman for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope some of the new males will mate with females that
have staked out territory since their arrival last year. Breeding
season is beginning, and the cats normally give birth in June,
Malmsbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 41 lynx trapped in Canada and Alaska and released in
Colorado last year, 17 have died, including six of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Assailed by ranchers and outfitters, the reintroduction program
drew criticism from some environmentalists after the deaths. But
Malmsbury said officials had warned that as many as half the
animals would die.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the deaths, he said, was that the animals were
released within a day or two of their arrival in Colorado, leaving
them little time to adjust to their new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Canada lynx used to roam Colorado, but before last year the last
confirmed sighting was in 1973, near Vail. The state lists the
animal as endangered, and federal officials last month listed it as
threatened.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen early Monday
despite dollar-buying intervention by Japan's central bank. Tokyo
stocks advanced moderately.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.12 yen, down 1.16 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo but higher than its late New York level of 102.64 yen on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 189.22
points, or 0.93 percent, to 20,526.54 in the first hour of trading.
On Friday, the average closed down 104.18 points, or 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher compared with its
New York level on Friday after Bank of Japan conducted yen-selling
to buy the greenback during early Tokyo market on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank action failed, however, to push the dollar
above its level late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming Monday's intervention, Zembei Mizoguchi, head of
international bureau with Japan's Finance Ministry, told reporters:
''Proper action was taken...we're watching markets closely and will
take appropriate steps as needed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth such dollar-supporting intervention by the
Bank of Japan since the beginning of this year, with the last one
conducted on March 15 in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the central bank's intervention was not immediately
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have said the yen's rapid appreciation
against the dollar could hurt the nation's nascent economic
recovery by making Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and thus
less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.72 yen, down from
100.76 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started Monday nearly
unchanged from Friday's closing level, as the mild improvements
shown by the Bank of Japan's key ''tankan'' quarterly survey of
business confidence were already largely factored in, traders said.
</P>
<P>
   The tankan showed that business confidence at major
manufacturing companies improved for the fifth consecutive quarter,
reflecting growing faith the country is pulling out of its lengthy
economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   But prices later moved higher as investors welcomed the Bank of
Japan's intervention in the currency market.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 5.86 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,711.80. The
TOPIX closed down 6.51 points, or 0.38 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in early trading. On Friday, it settled at 1.7750 percent
ad its price stood at 101.07.

Security consultant and author Bruce Schneier's new Counterpane Internet
Security Inc. system, being launched today, uses teams of analysts working
around the clock to scrutinize activity logs from customers' Internet sites. If
the Counterpane analysts notice something fishy at a site -- a potential hacking
attempt, for example -- they call the customer, alert them to the intrusion and
help them plug the security breach.

streak snapped. Tied at 83, P.J. Brown blocked Duncan's shot in the lane, and on
the other end, Mashburn hit a 3-pointer, his second of the game. Trailing 86-84
with 1:16 to play, Duncan missed the second of two free throws. Tim Hardaway

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chris Carr scored 10 points in the fourth
quarter to spark the Chicago Bulls to an 83-74 victory over the
Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carr hit a 3-pointer with 2:10 remaining to put the Bulls ahead
to stay, 74-72, and Chicago went on to snap a four-game losing
streak and win its 15th of the season. The Bulls had lost their
previous 13 road games.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, who scored all 16 of his points in the second half, made
one of two free throws with 1:34 remaining to make it 75-72.
</P>
<P>
   Eldon Brand, who led Chicago with 23 points and 14 rebounds,
extended the lead to 77-72 by grabbing an offensive rebound and
scoring with 56 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Lamond Murray led Cleveland with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers' Shawn Kemp scored only seven points, 10.9 under
his average, and fouled out for a league-leading 13th time.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned during the fourth quarter when Cleveland went
8:31 without a field goal. After a 15-footer by Danny Ferry gave
the Cavaliers a 64-59 lead with 11:44 to play, the Cavs got only
five free throws until Andre Miller drove to the basket and scored
with 3:13 remaining. That pulled Cleveland to 71-69.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Ferry hit a 3-pointer from the wing, but Carr
countered with his 3-pointer to give Chicago a 74-72 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie forward Ron Artest scored all 18 of his points in the
first half to spark Chicago to a 43-40 halftime lead. The rookie
had just three points Wednesday night in an 86-81 home loss to the
Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Boykins, a 5-foot-5 guard, gave Cleveland a late first half
spark by hitting all three of his shots from the field for seven
points in six minutes.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cleveland had won the last seven meetings between the
teams. Chicago avoided being swept by the Cavaliers in consecutive
seasons for the first time. ... Chicago held a 62-39 rebounding
advantage. ... Chicago's last road victory was against the Los
Angeles Clippers on Feb. 6.

<HEADLINE> Wallace Sets Record for Fouls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Rasheed Wallace earned two technical fouls
milliseconds apart and an automatic ejection Sunday night, setting
an NBA record for technical fouls in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace received his 33rd and 34th technical fouls with 10:37
left in the second quarter against the Seattle SuperSonics. That's
the most since the league began keeping statistics on technical
fouls in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace surpassed the old mark of 32 technicals by Charles
Barkley in 1992-93 and 1994-95 with Phoenix, and tied by Dennis
Rodman in 1993-94 with San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace has been ejected six times this season.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was in the low post against Seattle's Vin Baker when he
turned and put up a shot that fell short. Teammate Brian Grant
grabbed the offensive rebound and was fouled, but Wallace flew into
a rage, complaining he was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace got in the face of the nearest official, Joey Crawford,
and sparks flew. Wallace began screaming at Crawford and flailing
his arms, and Crawford immediately called two technicals in
succession, resulting in an automatic ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace tried to approach Crawford but was restrained by
teammates and an assistant coach. He left the court without further
incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Martin Lapointe's goal with 14.4 seconds
remaining in overtime gave the Detroit Red Wings a wild 6-5 win
over Montreal on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, once down 4-1, twice rallied into third-period
ties, the last on Craig Darby's goal with 1:02 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Lapointe broke loose to beat Montreal goalie Jeff Hackett on
a lead pass from Nicklas Lidstrom, who had a goal and two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal, which has lost two straight, is in a ninth-place tie
with Buffalo, one point behind Carolina for the eighth and final
Eastern Conference playoff spot. All have three games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is three points behind St. Louis in the race for both
the Central Division title and home-ice advantage throughout the
playoffs. The Red Wings have two games left and the Blues three.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit took a 5-4 lead when Yuri Butsayev deflected a shot by
Larry Murphy past Hackett with 2:59 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But Darby scored in a furious scramble in front of Detroit
goalie Chris Osgood just seconds after the Canadiens pulled Hackett
for an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Stevenson scored one of Montreal's three third-period
goals and assisted on another by Martin Rucinsky. Patrice Brisebois
and Brian Savage also scored for the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Shanahan scored his 40th goal, Sergei Fedorov had a goal
and an assist and Steve Duchesne also scored for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Osgood had 31 saves. Montreal goalie Jeff Hackett, 1-12-1
against Detroit in his career, stopped 39 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Brisebois scored just 27 seconds into the game when he converted
a return pass from Shane Corson to end a 3-on-1 break.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Wings answered with three straight goals.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan scored his 40th at 6:58. He was skating into the
Montreal zone after a shift change and intercepted a clearing
attempt by Brisebois before wristing a shot past Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Duchesne put Detroit ahead when he shot in Stacy Roest's rebound
at 12:01, and Lidstrom made it 3-1 just 2:23 later with a
short-handed goal.
</P>
<P>
   The teams traded second-period goals. Fedorov scored on a
breakaway 32 seconds in and Savage scored on a power play with 1:41
left when he took a corner pass from Corson and shot it over
Osgood's stick.

<HEADLINE> Philly a Big Draw for Women's NCAA  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The NCAA women's basketball tournament
committee gambled five years ago when it selected Philadelphia for
the Final Four. The gamble paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The event drew more reporters -- 669 -- than any previous women's
Final Four. The crowd of 20,060 at Friday's semifinal games was the
second-best for a national semifinal and was the largest crowd to
ever witness a college basketball, men's or women's in
Pennsylvania. Sunday night's championship between top-ranked
Connecticut and No. 2 Tennessee was expected to be the most-watched
women's game in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had not been in a really big city,'' said Linda Bruno, the
Atlantic Ten commissioner who chaired the tournament committee in
1995. ''This is the way I wanted it to happen. It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The event has not only been great for Philadelphia, but for the
women's game overall. UConn coach Geno Auriemma believes more fans
will be attracted to the sport after watching the final.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people would watch the game, maybe that have one set
of impressions, one bias toward the game and, say, 'Here is what I
think women's basketball is like,''' Auriemma said. ''and maybe by
tuning into the game, will see something that will spur a different
thought. Like, 'Wow, I didn't know what it's like.' Maybe people
will stop comparing it to the men's game and be able to see it on
its own, for its own value.''
</P>
<P>
   The UConn-Tennessee final has been compared to the Michigan
State-Indiana State men's final in 1979 and the World Cup run by
the U.S. women's soccer team last year in terms of being a
breakthrough for the sport. Shea Ralph, the Huskies' All-American,
said she sees a similarity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that whole women's soccer tournament, that whole World
Cup was just wonderful for women in general and women in sports,''
Ralph said. ''I think they really got the ball rolling, especially
for soccer. It hasn't been that popular and it's growing
tremendously. Stuff like that, that's really made the difference
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport has also been helped by the ever-growing rivalry
between the Huskies and Lady Vols. Sunday's game was the 11th time
they met, with the teams splitting the first 10. They played three
times before in the NCAA tournament, including UConn's victory in
the 1995 championship game, which capped a 35-0 season for the
Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The country is always looking for that kind of stuff,''
Auriemma said. ''Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, Cowboys and 49ers,
Yankees and Dodgers. You're always looking for that. It makes for
great stories, keeps everybody entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   UCONN-TENNESSEE III: Geno Auriemma was reluctant to schedule
Tennessee twice during the regular season. Now the UConn coach is
glad he did it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought why do we need to do this. Why put ourselves in a
situation that limits the variety in our schedule?'' Auriemma said.
''The benefits far outweigh any negatives. We're going to do it
again next year. And where it goes beyond that, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NO REGRETS: Kristen Clement committed to Tennessee during her
junior year at Cardinal O'Hara High School in suburban
Philadelphia. Clement completed her junior season at Tennessee
without any regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad I followed my heart,'' said Clement, who chose
Tennessee over Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ANOTHER LOCAL ANGLE: The Final Four had a heavy Philly flavor
with several players and three of the four coaches having ties to
the area. The local angle was capped Sunday night when veteran
referee Dennis DeMayo worked his first title game. DeMayo is a
resident of nearby Bensalem.

acting premier Monday after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi suffered what doctors
believe was a stroke. Obuchi was in intensive care Monday and there were few
details about his condition. But Aoki said Obuchi seemed to have worsened since
Sunday afternoon and he did not know if he was conscious or not. Obuchi, 62, was
hospitalized early Sunday at Tokyo's Juntendo University Hospital after
complaining of fatigue. The hospitalization was not expected to have any

to leave for the United States as early as Tuesday. Last week, Castro said
Gonzalez was willing to travel to the United States and wait out the results of
an appeal for custody by their Miami relatives in federal appellate court, if
the U.S. government gave him custody of Elian in the meantime.

Microsoft Decision Expected Any Day

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks between Microsoft Corp. and government lawyers
failed after the company insisted on its own proposal to settle the antitrust
lawsuit and not because of disputes between state and federal officials, people
familiar with the negotiations said Sunday. The talks broke down Saturday,
sending the case back to U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in
Washington, who last fall issued a finding of fact that Microsoft used its
monopoly powers to thwart competition. A decision on the lawsuit is expected any
day, and if Jackson sides with the government, he will begin the lengthy process
of determining a penalty that could include a breakup or restructuring of the
company.

Ugandan Parents Led Kids to Deaths

   BUNYARIGI, Uganda (AP) -- Children made up a large part of the bodies
recovered from mass graves in southwestern Uganda since the March 17 inferno at
the chapel at Kanungu alerted the world to the Movement for the Restoration of
the Ten Commandments of God. Authorities now are pursuing the sect's leaders,
who they believe masterminded the murders of at least 924 people. Children and
their parents were placed in separate living quarters when they joined the sect,
Rugambwa and former sect members said. Parents also were forced to withdraw
their children from school. For the movement, childhood was an occasion of sin.
The sect's leaders went to brutal lengths to ensure children wouldn't fall into
what they believed were the clutches of Satan.

<HEADLINE> Ralph Steals Show At Women's Game  </HEADLINE>
By KEN BERGER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Her face bears the expression of someone on
the playground whose lunch money has been stolen. Whatever someone
is trying to take from Shea Ralph, she aims to get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Connecticut cruised to its second national
championship with such ease Sunday night because one of its players
would never stop diving, swatting snarling and shouting. With all
this, Ralph somehow found time to get nearly every loose ball, make
every deadeye pass, toss in every layup that her tenacity earned.
</P>
<P>
   With the determination of a freight train, Ralph led UConn to a
71-52 victory over archrival Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph scored 15 points on 7-for-8 shooting and had seven
assists, six steals and a block for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   After sparking UConn's 21-6 run to start the game, Ralph ensured
there would be no letup in the second half. She started off with a
layup and double-clutch, driving jumper to make it 36-19, then
picked off a pass and quickly set up Svetlana Abrosimova for a
layup to give the Huskies a 40-19 lead.
</P>
<P>
   She got free for another layup to make it 48-27, then ran a
little give-and-go on the fast break with a bounce pass to
Abrosimova for a layup that gave UConn a 50-27 lead with 13:31
left.
</P>
<P>
   Her face, always contorted with a mixture of consternation and
aggression, revealed almost as much as her relentless game.
</P>
<P>
   When she forced a jump ball, she pumped her fist wildly. When
she attacked the basket for a jump-stop and jumper, she screamed,
flexed her biceps and grabbed any teammate who would dare share her
vice-like embrace.
</P>
<P>
   When UConn blitzed Tennessee with a 21-6 run to start the game,
Ralph was in the middle of every scrum. She seemed to have her
hands on every loose ball, her face in every Lady Vols player's
personal space. A fan watching basketball for the first time might
have assumed that the goal of No. 33 was to rub her elbows on every
inch of the court -- then get up and scream like a professional
wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was it effective. Ralph came up with four steals and forced
at least three jump balls in the first half alone. She turned
Tennessee's offensive gameplan into a mosh pit -- with herself in
the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   With Ralph causing chaos on the perimeter, interior and
everywhere in between, the Lady Vols missed 18 of their first 20
shots. She flopped on the floor to force a jump ball and pumped her
fist, then poked the ball away again leading to Kennitra Johnson's
layup for a 17-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With UConn leading 21-8, Ralph committed a smart foul on April
McDivitt when she noticed that the 6-foot-2 Gwen Jackson had a
mismatch on Sue Bird, who is 5-foot-9 standing on a phone book.
McDivitt made both free throws, but it was just another example of
Ralph's determined, cerebral play.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had three fouls at halftime, Ralph was 3-for-4 for
seven points, had four steals, a block and three assists as UConn
led 32-19.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a performance for a player who missed the entire
1997-98 season with her second ACL injury to her right knee in as
many seasons. The running joke around women's basketball is, ''Shea
Ralph is still at Connecticut?''
</P>
<P>
   You bet she is. And she's only a junior. She'll be back for more
floorburn next year, and probably can't wait.

<HEADLINE> The latest win in Gampel is the big one  </HEADLINE>

   STORRS, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut opened up a 21-point lead early
in the second half of the title game Sunday against Tennessee, and
Steve Ogden leapt from his seat in Gampel Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got 'em! We got 'em! They look unstoppable,'' said the
UConn freshman.
</P>
<P>
   They were, from wire-to-wire, and beat Tennessee 71-52 for their
second national title.
</P>
<P>
   And for the second straight year, the campus will welcome home a
national champion on Monday. The men beat Duke 77-74 last year for
their first title.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden was one of about 2,000 fans that gathered in the Huskies'
homecourt to watch the game on three giant screens. With pep band
and cheerleaders on the floor, Gampel had all the sights and sounds
of the game. And much like UConn's regular season victories on
their home floor, this one was won in convincing fashion, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''Us beating Tennessee just makes it great. It's such a
rivalry,'' said Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies beat Tennessee in 1995 for their first title, and
split two regular season games with the Lady Vols this season.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Lewis, director of counseling services at UConn,
furiously waved her blue and white pom-pon as the seconds ticked
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is elation. This is exciting. I'm just so proud that our
UConn women's team is Number One,'' said Lewis, who has been at
UConn 24 years. ''I'm just so thrilled to see our team bring home
the trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Shea, a retired state worker, said he and his wife,
Beverly, made the 45-minute drive from their Southington to campus
Sunday for one reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was to see Tennessee lose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case the Huskies needed more help than their deep bench
could deliver, Beverly Shea came prepared. During a timeout late in
the game, She pulled a gold chain with a cross from around her neck
to show a visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm praying for them, believe me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With 2 minutes left in the game and UConn up by 23, Dave Andrade
began working the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''IT'S ALL OVER! IT'S ALL OVER,'' shouted the UConn senior.
</P>
<P>
   He knew it. They knew. And Tennessee knew it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm lovin' it,'' said Andrade. ''I'm lovin' every minute of
it.''

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 100, Grizzlies 86  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Dirk Nowitzki scored 15 of
his 22 points in the third quarter as the Dallas Mavericks beat the
Vancouver Grizzlies 100-86 on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks, eliminated from the playoffs on Friday, used a
balanced attack in beating the Grizzlies for the second time this
season. Six Dallas players scored in double figures, including
Michael Finley with 18 and Hubert Davis with 16 in a reserve role.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash added 11 points and 10 assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies were led by Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who scored 23
points. Mike Bibby had his first career triple double -- the third
in club history -- with 14 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver (19-53), which committed 18 turnovers that turned into
24 points, lost for the 16th time in 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies coach Lionel Hollins, frustrated with his team's
performance, picked up his second technical foul and was ejected by
referee Tom Washington at halftime after throwing his towel onto
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver went without a field goal for over nine minutes in the
quarter while the Mavericks finished out the half on a 22-4 run.
Dallas turned a 29-20 deficit into a 42-33 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has won 12 of 19 away from Reunion Arena. Vancouver fell
to 10-27 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim was all the Grizzlies had going for them in the
first half, with 15 points. The rest of the team went a combined 4
of 25 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams shot under 35 percent in the first quarter, but the
Grizzlies used an 11-0 run to take a 28-18 lead.
Notes: Vancouver went 1-14 in March after compiling a 12-15 record
in January and February. The Grizzlies, in their five-year history,
are 6-73 in March. ... The Mavericks were 7-9 in March. ...
Vancouver is 1-5 on its seven-game homestand. The Grizzlies will
finish it off with games against Houston and Portland. ... The
Mavericks have been in Vancouver since Friday, when many watched
the Knicks beat the Grizzlies 89-83. ... Prospective Mavericks
owner Mark Cuban was in attendance. ... Grizzlies forward Antoine
Carr strained his calf and didn't return after playing five
minutes. He's listed as doubtful for the remainder of the season.

Castro: Elian's Dad May Come Monday
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- President Fidel Castro said Elian Gonzalez's father was
willing to travel alone to the United States Monday morning if U.S. officials
promise to turn over the boy to him and let them return to Cuba right away.
Failing that, visas would be sought for father Juan Miguel Gonzalez and an
entourage of 27 others to leave for the United States as early as Tuesday to try
to get Elian back, Castro said Sunday during a live appearance on national
television. Last week, Castro said Gonzalez was willing to travel to the United
States and wait out the results of an appeal for custody by their Miami
relatives in federal appellate court, if the U.S. government gave him custody of
Elian in the meantime.

Japan Names Acting Prime Minister
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO, Japan (AP) -- Senior Cabinet minister Mikio Aoki was named Japan's
acting prime minister Monday after Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi suffered what
doctors believe was a stroke. At a press conference, Aoki announced he would be
standing in for the prime minister because it was not likely Obuchi would be
able to resume his duties soon. Obuchi, 62, was in intensive care Monday after
being admitted to Tokyo's Juntendo University Hospital the previous day,
complaining of fatigue. Aoki said he had apparently suffered a stroke. The
hospitalization was not expected to have any immediate impact on the operation
of the government.

Decision Expected in Microsoft Case

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in Washington
is expected to rule on the Microsoft antitrust suit after mediation between
government lawyers and the computer giant broke down this weekend. Describing
the negotiations as ''very complex,'' Iowa Attorney General Thomas Miller said
''many factors'' led to the breakdown but ''the position of the states was not
the cause of the failure.'' Sources said government lawyers no longer were
insisting on a breakup, but that Microsoft refused to accept proposals submitted
by the Justice Department and 19 states who sued the company.

Hundreds Protest Confederate Flag
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- More than 600 people set out Sunday on a five-day,
120-mile protest march to Columbia to urge state lawmakers to move the
Confederate Flag from the Statehouse dome. The marchers, who made it 12 miles to
Goose Creek Sunday night, will walk only during daylight hours. They plan to
arrive in Columbia for a rally on Thursday, when pro-flag supporters have also
scheduled a Statehouse rally. The National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People has called for a tourism boycott of the state, saying the
Confederate flag above the Statehouse in Columbia is a racist emblem. Flag
defenders say it is a symbol of Southern heritage and honors Confederate war
dead.

Gel May Protect Hair From Chemo
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- An ointment under development appears to prevent
chemotherapy from making hair fall out, a distressing side effect of cancer
treatment. The clear gel has been tested only on lab rats, but developers said
its effects are dramatic. Davis, a scientist at Glaxo Wellcome, said the company
hopes to test the ointment on people, though he could not predict when that will
happen. Cancer cells grow faster than normal tissue. Chemotherapy works by
killing cells that are rapidly dividing. An unintended side effect is damage to
the hair follicles, which also divide more quickly than other parts of the body.

Connecticut Wins Women's Championship
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With an impressive display of ball-hawking defense and
efficient, balanced offense, the Connecticut Huskies overwhelmed Tennessee 71-52
Sunday night to win the women's NCAA title. The top-ranked Huskies (36-1) beat
No. 2 Tennessee for the second time in three meetings this season and did it in
a way that left the Lady Vols (33-4) dazed and looking helpless. Tennessee was
in the Final Four for the 12th time and was seeking its seventh national
championship. But the Lady Vols could offer little more than token opposition to
the UConn machine.

Red Wings Beat Canadiens 6-5, OT
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Martin Lapointe's goal with 14.4 seconds remaining in
overtime gave the Detroit Red Wings a wild 6-5 win over Montreal on Sunday
night. The Canadiens, once down 4-1, twice rallied into third-period ties, the
last on Craig Darby's goal with 1:02 remaining. But Lapointe broke loose to beat
Montreal goalie Jeff Hackett on a lead pass from Nicklas Lidstrom, who had a
goal and two assists. Montreal, losers of two straight, is in a ninth-place tie
with Buffalo, one point behind Carolina for the eighth and final Eastern
Conference playoff spot. All have three games remaining.
