<HEADLINE> Singapore Minister on Measures to Control Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Minister for
Communications Mah Bow Tan Wednesday summed up measures to control
traffic congestion and lauded his country's Electronic Road
Pricing (ERP) system as one of the key tools to solve the road
congestion problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the International
Conference on "Transport into the Next Millennium," which was also
attended by ASEAN transport ministers who are in Singapore for the
4th Transport Ministers Meeting, Mah Bow Tan said the familiar
problem of traffic congestion is a growing problem in cities all
over the world and there is a general consensus among transport
experts that the problem requires a combination of measures.
</P>
<P>
He summed up the measures as:
</P>
<P>
-- Coordinating land use planning with transport planning
ensures that transport infrastructure can support the transport
demand generated by land use.
</P>
<P>
-- It can not be neglected to build a good network of roads.
</P>
<P>
-- Traffic control measures should be developed to maximize
road carrying capacity.
</P>
<P>
-- The public transport system must be made an ever-more
accessible, affordable and convenient alternative to private
transport.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that what is in crucial need is to control
congestion through demand management and to control vehicle
population growth and the demand for road space.
</P>
<P>
Mah Bow Tan said based on the experience of Singapore he
believes that in the long run the ERP system will prove an
essential means of managing demand for road space and keeping
traffic flowing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy that the hard work (for road demand management )
has borne fruit in the Electronic road pricing (ERP) system ,
which was fully implemented in our central business district and
our major expressways last week."
</P>
<P>
ERP system, which started on the major expressways and the
central business district of the city state on September 1, 1998,
consists of three main components: the In-vehicle Unit (IU), the
gantry and the central computer system. The IU is an electronic
device installed in vehicle that accepts a stored value CashCard.
The IU deducts the appropriate ERP charges from the CashCard every
time the vehicle passes through an ERP gantry. Rates are different
from business hour to after-business hour and from private cars to
taxies and public buses. Registration plates of vehicles making
illegal entries, such as those without an IU, without a CashCard
or with an insufficient balance on the CashCard, will be
photographed by gantry cameras for subsequent enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Mah Bow Tan said ERP is now processes some 300,000 transactions
daily and "the early indications are that motorists have indeed
begun to change their travel behavior--to consider more carefully
the time of travel and the route of their journey."
</P>
<P>
"Traffic volumes in the central business district for example,
have dipped significantly during the peak periods, " he added.

<HEADLINE> UK's Retail Sales Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's retail sales growth
has slumped for the third month in a row as a slowdown in the UK
economy takes its toll on the High Streets or shopping centers,
according to the latest report form the British Retail Consortium
(BRC).
</P>
<P>
Retail sales growth has fallen to its lowest level for more
than four years, as shoppers, worried about the job security, have
cut back on spending, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the BRC's Economic Affairs Committee Andrew
Higginson as quoted by a BBC report as saying: "It is time for a
cut in interest rates," for consumers have become more cautious
following a string of high profile job losses announced by large
manufacturing groups.
</P>
<P>
Like for like sales growth rose just 1.5 percent in August,
compared to 7.6 percent a year earlier. Over the last three months
underlying retail sales have risen by less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ann Robinson, director general of the BRC, said: "Customer
confidence has been been declining for some time. More recently we
felt this might have increased due to some loss of jobs in
manufacturing."
</P>
<P>
She called for the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee
to cut interest rates when it meets later this week. It is hoped a
cut in rates will help fuel consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
In August the most successful sectors were clothing and
footwear, which up to then had suffered a lousy summer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. GOP Fails to Win Senate Support for Speeding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Republicans on
Wednesday failed to win a Senate approval of its renewed push to
speed the work on a costly national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
The 59-41 vote fell one short of the 60 needed to overcome
Democratic opposition and move ahead with debate on the
legislation. All 55 Republicans voted for the legislation, but
only four Democrats voted with the GOP to proceed on the measure.
</P>
<P>
Even though Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Republican from
Mississippi, had made the bill a top part of his 1998 agenda, the
vote was identical to one last May.
</P>
<P>
Republican sponsors of the measure had cited the political
instability in Russia and other security threats as an urgency to
move ahead with a program that would protect the United States
from attacking by intercontinental ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton Administration allies contend the legislation
is premature and feared that it could violate arms-reduction
agreements with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Republican bill requests an implementation of a national
missile defense system as soon as it is technologically feasible.
A similar version is expected to be debated in the House later
this month.
</P>
<P>
However, the existing program provides for three years of lead
time once a potential threat has been identified and the Defense
Department has showed strong opposition to a speedier approach.
</P>
<P>
General Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, renewed his opposition in a meeting with Lott Tuesday and
has sent letters to senators urging a "no" vote.
</P>
<P>
Senator Carl Levin, Democrat from Michigan, who managed the
opposition to the legislation on the Senate floor, said that the
Senate should not go against the best judgment of the nation's
military.

<HEADLINE> India's Economic Activities May Lead to Ecological </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- India's economic march into
the 21st century could result in ecological devastation, causing a
environmental damage of 10 billion U.S. dollars a year, or 4.5
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
If higher estimates were used, the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) said Wednesday, the total environmental cost
would be 13.8 billion U.S. dollars annually, or six percent of the
country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
A breakup of the estimated 10 billion U.S. dollars shows that
urban air pollution costs India 1.3 billion U.S. dollars a year,
according to the "Human Development Report, 1998" released here
today by UNDP resident representative Brenda Gael Mcsweeney.
</P>
<P>
Water degradation leads to health costs amounting to 5.7
billion U.S. dollars every year, nearly three-fifths of the
country's total environmental costs.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion affects 83 to 163 million hectares of land every
year in the country, said the UNDP report.
</P>
<P>
Land degradation causes productivity loss equal to four to 6.3
percent of the total agricultural output annually, amounting to
2.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Deforestation, which proceeded at the rate of 0.6 percent a
year between 1981 and 1990, led to annual costs of 214 million
U.S. in the South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Warning that acid rain was becoming a major problem in the
developing world, the report said wheat yields in India have been
cut in half in areas close to large sources of sulphur dioxide
emissions.
</P>
<P>
UNDP ranks India 139th among 174 countries in terms of overall
human development, though the country showed certain improvement
in several fields including life expectancy at birth, real
earnings, adult literacy, female literacy and noteworthy
participation of women in political and economic life.
</P>
<P>
Canada tops the list with the destination of retaining the
position consecutively for the last five years, followed by France
and Norway at second and third positions respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ranking is done on the basis of overall health, general
level of education, and the degree to which an average person
enjoys a decent standard of living.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the real earnings per employee in India
have increased at the rate of 2.5 percent for the period
1980-1992, while life expectancy at birth has risen from 44 years
in 1960 to 61.6 years in 1995 and adult literacy from 34 percent
in 1970 to 52 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On women's participation in economic life in India, the report
puts the female economic activity rate at 46 percent, while female
managers account for two percent and professional women technical
workers are 21 percent.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Communist Party,
along with two other parties, recommended Yuri Maslyukov, chairman
of the Duma's Committee on Economic Policy, to be one of the
candidates for prime minister
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party, said at a

right person to lead Russia out of the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin has not yet made a decision on whether to
nominate Viktor Chernomyrdin as the prime minister for the third
time. His silence is welcomed by leaders of the Duma and some
political parties as a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
Russia's state Duma has twice rejected Chernomyrdin's
nomination as the prime minister. Under the Russian Constitution,
if the nomination is rejected three times, the president will
have to dissolve the Duma and call new elections within three
months.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said that if Yeltsin renominate Chernomyrdin as the
prime minister for the third time, the state Duma will not discuss
the issue of the prime minister's nomination until it has finished
voting on the impeachment process of the president.
</P>
<P>
The president can not dissolve the Duma once the impeachment
process has been adopted, according to the Russian Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Report on Turco-Israeli Air Maneuvers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Wednesday denied the
report that Turkey and Israel will conduct first joint air
maneuvers from September 13 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan as saying that "we have no such
information" on Turco-Israeli joint air maneuvers as reported by
Britain's Jane's Defense Weekly.
</P>
<P>
However, it is possible that the two countries will conduct
joint naval maneuvers, Utkan added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides held their first joint naval drill in the
Mediterranean in January.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, during a visit to the
Palestinian city of Ramallah Tuesday, confirmed that Turkey and
Israel would hold the second joint naval exercise in November.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
early 1996 when they signed two military cooperation deals.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has allowed Israeli pilots to use its air space for
training, and Israel has been upgrading Turkish fighter planes
with its advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that the growing military cooperation between Israel
and Turkey could leave it encircled by an enemy coalition, Syria
has claimed that the Turco-Israeli military alliance is bringing
more tensions to the region.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have been at odds over sovereignty issues,
water rights and the alleged Syrian support for the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party fighting for independence in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has been occupying Syria's strategic Golan
Heights after it captured it in the 1967 Middle East War.

<HEADLINE> Afghan President Meets Iranian Foreign Minister on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The ousted Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani here on Wednesday discussed the latest
development in Afghanistan with Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani came to Iran following his participation in the recent
summit of the Non-Aligned Movement and a visit to Turkey, the
official news agency IRNA reported without giving when Rabbani
arrived in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rabbani told Kharrazi that the Afghan
people hailed Iran's policy towards Afghanistan, which is "based
on Islamic and international principles".
</P>
<P>
He accused the Afghan Taliban militia, which has seized most of
the Afghan territory, of massacring people in northern part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
With the revealing made to the world by the Amnesty
International, it is now proved to all that the Taliban have no
respect for Islamic, humanitarian and international principles,
the Afghan president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi expressed regret over continuation of
crisis in Afghanistan and massacre of Afghan people, stating that
Iran has always denounced policy of resorting to force in
Afghanistan and today severely condemns massacre of innocent
Muslim people in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taliban by attacking the Iranian consulate in
Mazari Sharif and kidnaping Iranian diplomats have shown to the
world that they do not believe in any Islamic and international
principles.
</P>
<P>
Iran holds the Taliban responsible in this connection,
Kharrazi said, expressing hope that through efforts of the United
Nations, the crisis will soon come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that the Taliban forces kidnaped 11 Iranian
diplomats and an IRNA correspondent from Mazari Sharif. However,
reports reaching here said that the group of Iranian have been
killed by the Taliban when they occupied the city.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Rabbani's visit to Tehran is aimed at
encouraging Iran to arm Afghan refugees in Iran and to support
his group to fight against the Taliban forces which drove his
forces out of the capital Kabul in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Criticizes Planned Israeli-Turkish Naval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Wednesday criticized the
planned Israeli-Turkish naval exercise later this year as an
ill-timed development that is directed against Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, President Hosni Mubarak's top political adviser,
said that Egypt is concerned that a "non-Arab alliance" is being
formed in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said during his visit to
Israel this week that the two navies will conduct a joint naval
exercise in the Mediterranean in November, their second this year.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is very dangerous when a non-Arab alliance is set
up in the region because it appears directed toward Arabs," Baz
told reporters in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa also called the joint
Israeli-Turkish drill a "negative development".
</P>
<P>
"It comes in the time we are trying to revive the peace
process," Moussa said at a joint press conference with his Italian
counterpart Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Arab concern about the Israeli-Turkish military
alliance, Israel and Turkey said their cooperation is not directed
against any other countries and only aimed at promoting stability
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dini held talks Wednesday with Mubarak and Moussa on the
situation in Africa, Europe and the Mideast, with special focus on
the Mideast peace process. The Italian foreign minister arrived
here Tuesday evening for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled for 18 months mainly due to
Israel's refusal to fully accept a U.S. initiative calling for a
13 percent Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Carry out Projects ensuring Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has planned to carry out
a number of projects over a period of 14 years to counter the
problem of water scarcity, a Water and Irrigation Ministry report
obtained on Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The projects estimated to cost 3.5 billion Jordanian dinars (5
billion U.S. dollars) are aimed at extracting water from the
Jordan Valley and tapping water potential in eastern desert oases,
the report released to a meeting of Jordanian businessmen late
Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Jordan's water demand is predicted to
stand at nearly 1.7 billion cubic meters annually by the year
2020. But its current water facilities can only meet 85 percent of
the demand by then.
</P>
<P>
"These projects will ensure that the chronic water problem
will not worsen," the ministry secretary general, Qusai Quteishat,
said.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the private sector would invest in
the projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a water-poor country below the international level of
annual consumption of 1,000 cubic meters of water per capita.
</P>
<P>
Limited resources have caused the water scarcity in the
kingdom, which lacks major surface water sources and depends on
restricted shares of international waterways.
</P>
<P>
Rapid population growth has also aggravated the problem of
water supply of Jordan, which has 4.6 million people with an
annual growth rate of 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Pledges to Give Priority to Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia Wednesday
pledged to give priority to human resources development by
promoting poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony of the human development
report 1998 here, Mulatu Teshome, Vice-Minister of Economic
Development and Cooperation, said in order to implement human
resources development program, new policies and strategies have
been formulated.
</P>
<P>
He added that efforts are being made to develop human
resources from regional to grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
The budget earmarked for education which was only 2 percent of
the national expenditure in 1986/87 has grown to 3.5 percent in
1995/96, Mulatu disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In his launching statement, Rafeeuddin Ahmed, Associate
Administrator of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP),
said every African household consumes 20 percent less than they
did 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said, in the Netherlands and the U.S. every person consumes
190 kgs of meat a year, and in Burundi and India only four kgs.
</P>
<P>
According to the human development report 1998 released by the
UNDP throughout the world on Setpember 9, 1998, the world will
consume a record 24 trillion U.S. Dollars in goods and services
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the gap between the rich and the poor is expanding.
Eighty-six percent of the world's goods is consumed by just 20
percent of the world's people. Millions of people, particularly
in the developing countries, have been excluded from the
consumption revolution. in some countries, people have fewer
goods and services available to them now than they did 20 to 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The annual report disclosed that among the 4.4 billion people
who live in developing countries, almost three-fifths live in
communities without basic sanitation, almost one-third are
without safe drinking water, one-quarter lack adequate housing,
one-fifth live beyond reach of modern health services, one-fifth
of the children do not get as far as grade five in school.
</P>
<P>
While the wealthiest one-fifth of the world's people consume
45 percent of all the meat and fish, 58 percent of total energy,
and 84 percent of all paper, the poorest one-fifth consume only
less than five percent of all the meat and fish, less than four
percent of energy, and 1.1 percent of paper, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Investigate on Car Mafia Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Finance
Fouad Siniora Wednesday said the country will soon open an
investigation into an alleged mafia network smuggling stolen
European cars into Lebanon, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He said to the radio that "there is definitely a mafia network
smuggling stolen cars into Lebanon and we will follow up the case
all the way to the end."
</P>
<P>
He added that more details of the story will be known after he
returns from a three-day visit to Cairo beginning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese minister's comments came a day after the country's
largest Arab-language newspaper An Nahar revealed that there was
a mafia in the country which is smuggling sedan cars stolen
in various European countries, especially Germany, to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted well-known sources as saying that Lebanese
political figures are using their influence to make sure
the stolen cars to pass through customs without any problems.
</P>
<P>
It also obtained a copy of a report of the international
Police (Interpol) Organization addressed to the Lebanon's customs
management, saying Lebanon has the highest rate of car theft
in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
But the report added that the cooperation of the Lebanese
customs authorities with Interpol has made it possible to
intercept some of the stolen cars before or at their arrival in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Lebanese customs authorities, in
cooperation with Interpol, have recently seized some 75
Mercedes-600 sedan cars allegedly stolen from European
countries.

<HEADLINE> Greece Denies Postponement of Missiles Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Greece denied Wednesday that
there would be any postponement of the installation of
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greece's acting government
spokesman Yannis Nikolaou said that it would not be dragged into
the furore over the issue.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the Cyprus problem still remained an issue
of the invasion and occupation of a free state by Turkey, he added
that the Cypriot government was handling the issue of the
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its defense capacity, Cyprus has decided to
purchase the Russian-made S-300 missiles, which will be deployed
in later November on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has warned that it will use force to prevent the
deployment of the missiles because it will also pose a threat to
Turkish security.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., a major mediator of disputes between Greece and
Turkey as well as between Cyprus and Turkey, also opposes the
installation of the missiles by Cyprus, and has been pressuring
Nicosia into cancelling the deployment plan or at least delaying
the deployment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Arrives for Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross arrived here Wednesday afternoon in a bid to press
Israel and the Palestinians to clinch a deal on an overdue West
Bank redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to hold talks with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat Wednesday evening in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
But it was unclear whether his scheduled talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday will be held since
the Prime Minister's Office said Netanyahu has got a flu.
</P>
<P>
Due to the illness, Netanyahu suspended a Cabinet meeting on
the 1999 budget Tuesday night and decided to cancel a scheduled
trip to Georgia early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ross was dispatched back to the region last week by
U.S. President Bill Clinton amid reports that Israel and the PNA
were closer to reaching a deal on the West Bank pullback.
</P>
<P>
Since January, the U.S. put forward a proposal calling for a
13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal in the next stage of troop
redeployment in the West Bank so to break the Israeli-Palestinian
stalemate since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the PNA has already accepted the U.S. initiative, Israel
has so far refused to publicly endorse it. Originally Israel
rejected the proposal citing that any pullback exceeding 10
percent would endanger its security.
</P>
<P>
However, under the pressure from the U.S. and the PNA, the
Israeli government recently softened its stand and expressed its
willingness to accept the U.S. proposal with some conditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel is demanding that 3 percent of the proposed land be
turned into nature reserve where Israel retains full security
control, and that the Palestinian Covenant be revised to abolish
clauses calling for Israeli destruction.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Ross would also try to arrange a tripartite
summit by Arafat, Netanyahu and Clinton in the White House on
September 23 to mark the fifth anniversary of the historical
signing of the Oslo Accord.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian health officials have
reported an outbreak of cholera in the Upper East Region of the
West African country, according to a report reaching here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said about 120 people have been admitted to the
Bawku Hospital, out of which eight have died.
</P>
<P>
It added that about 70 cases have also been identified in
other parts of the region, which shares borders with Togo and
Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen Togolese and 10 people from Burkina Faso were among
the 70 cases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Alexis Nangbefiobah, a doctor from the Bawku Hospital was
quoted as saying Monday that there had been diarrhoea cases since
the beginning of the rainy season and the situation became worse
by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
"We are now sitting on a time bomb because the disease is
spreading very fast," he said, adding that medical supplies are
being sent to the various hospitals in the district on a daily
basis to keep up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that medical personnel from the district have
held discussions with their counterparts from Togo and Burkina
Faso on how to control the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out the fact that the disease might have been
spread to the district from these countries since the first cases
were seen in Dapa Ngo in Togo and Mognore, a border town, where
the people indulge in illegal gold mining and live under
unhygienic conditions," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Urges Angolan Govt to Be Patient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Special Envoy
Issa Diallo, While pledging continued effort for peace in Angola,
said Wednesday that the government should keep patient.
</P>
<P>
Diallo made the remarks after talks with Angolan President Dos
Santos here, his first meeting with the president since he
arrived in Luanda on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Diallo promised that the United Nations would continue its
effort for the implementation of the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The government should never lose its patience as the
materialization of final peace in the country is the will of the
Angolan people, Diallo said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy refused to comment on the newly-established
UNITA Renovation Committee, and did not say anything on whether
the new organization should be accepted as representative of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) for peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
UNITA Renovation Committee came into Angola's political arena
on August 2 after some officials of UNITA released a communique,
urging all patriotic UNITA members to strive for peace in the
country and remove Jonas Savimbi from the top position of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The government declared the cut-off of its relations with
Savimbi and recognizes the Reform Committee as UNITA's
representative in future peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel movement of UNITA led by Savimbi has been
blamed for failing to implement the Lusaka protocol fully by
refusing to disarm its entire army, transfer the four central
cities to the government and move its headquarters to Luanda,
etc.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
warned that its embassy in Lebanon is under threat of terrorist
attack, the state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the U.S. embassy in Beirut said that the
U.S. government has received information about a possible attack
on the embassy here similar to the attacks against its embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania last month.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the U.S. companies and citizens in Lebanon have not
received threats, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, the embassy still has to remind them to be
on a maximum state of alert.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the embassy has taken special security measures, the
embassy's press official said that it has taken same measures like
other U.S. missions all over the world following the bombings in
the two African countries.
</P>
<P>
Early in August, the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were
attacked almost at the same time by bombs which killed at least
250 people.
</P>
<P>
Two months earlier, two rocket-propelled grenades which
exploded near the fortress-like U.S. embassy in the northern
Beirut suburbs caused no casualties or damages. But there has
been no result of the investigation into the incident.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Govt Reaffirms Support for Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President
Specioza Kazibwe has reaffirmed the government support for the
Universal Primary Education (UPE) for the benefit of all children
in the country.
</P>
<P>
She made the pledge when opening a two-day UPE conference here
Wednesday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The national UPE program must succeed because it is relevant
to the destiny of the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
The major goals of UPE should, above all, ensure equitable
educatl?7 with emphasis on girl child education, provision and
maintenance of quality education accessible to learners, relevant
to their needs and national goals and initiating a fundamental
positive transformation of society in the social, economic and
political fields.
</P>
<P>
This program is not a dream, but a scientifically conceived
idea to reverse seemingly perpetual problems of backwardness and
underdevelopment that the country continues to face, she added.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of UPE, the government has raised the
educational spending since 1996. A total of 612 billion Ugandan
Shillings (500 million U.S. Dollars) has been allocated for the
education sector up to now.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998/99 financial year, the education budget has been
raised from 177 billion shillings (150 million Dollars) in the
1996/97 financial year to 243 billion shillings (200 million
Dollars) in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The vice president also said a total of 8,022 teachers have
been recruited for teaching primary schools and that the
government aims at 94,500 teachers as maximum in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The ulterior motive of UPE is to make education affordable and
accessible by all Ugandans, she concluded.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Respect for People's Choices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese legislator said
here Wednesday that people of all countries have the right to
choose the social system, road to development and way of living
that fit in with their own national conditions, which books no
foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
"With diversity as an objective reality of today's world,
tranquility of the world and harmony in state-to-state relations
can only be achieved when the objective reality is respected and
countries are treated with equality and friendship, " Xu Jialu,
head of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) delegation,
said at the general debate during the on-going 100th Conference of
the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
Xu, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, noted that
while the overall international situation is easing, the world
today is still full of complicated contradictions, global and
regional destabilizing factors still exist and that the world is
still not tranquil.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the end of the Cold War, some people still cling to
the Cold War mentality and pursue hegemony and power politics in
international relations," Xu said. "The unfair and irrational
international political and economic order is yet to be
fundamentally changed."
</P>
<P>
He said the further move toward multi-polarity at the global
level is a positive situation in international relations and
conducive to world peace and common development.
</P>
<P>
"China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace, and its
NPC vigorously supports and cooperates with the government to
conduct international cooperation with all countries in the world
on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," Xu
said.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, Xu called for the equal importance of both the
universality and particularity of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Since the roads to development chosen by all countries
according to their realities cannot be identical, countries in the
world should recognize national particularities and differences
and respect other countries in their choice and efforts with
respect to protecting human rights.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that countries should enter into dialog and
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect to enhance
mutual understanding and confidence," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that more and more people in the international
community have come to agree with China in opposing the
application of double standards to the human rights question and
interference in other countries' internal affairs under the
pretext of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Xu also touched upon environment, saying that more attention
shall be paid to the developing world's priority tasks of economic
development and poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
"Environment and development are inseparable," Xu said. "Only
when their (the developing countries') economy is developed, can
they acquire a stronger ability to protect environment."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, either in working out environment standards or in
international legislation, national conditions of developing
countries and basic needs of their people should be taken into
full consideration and their development level and enduring
capacity should be accommodated."
</P>
<P>
"It is both unfair and impractical to require developing
countries to shoulder responsibilities and obligations that are
above their development levels," Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Favors Collective Regional Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Defense Minister
Yiannakis Omirou said here Wednesday that Cyprus favors a
collective security system for the Eastern Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his return from Greece, Omirou said neither
Cyprus nor Greece favors security axes in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We back collective security systems which will encompass all
the people in the region. We do not favor the creation of axes,
which by definition operate as a destabilizing factor in the
area," Omirou added.
</P>
<P>
The minister's comments came only a couple of days after a
visit to Israel by Turkey's Premier Mesut Yilmaz, during which
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reported to have
said that the central axis between his country and Turkey is the
basis, though not the exclusive basis, to form a regional
framework.
</P>
<P>
Omirou also indirectly questioned Israeli assurances that a
defense cooperation agreement between Israel and Turkey is not
directed against any other country.
</P>
<P>
"Israel cannot possibly declare that its defense agreement
with Turkey is not directed against us or any other country on one
hand and on the other strengthen a country, Turkey, which acts as
a destabilizing factor in the region," Omirou told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus opposes the military cooperation reflected in a
military axis between Israel and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' relations with Israel have been greatly enhanced since
the opening up of its embassy in Tel Aviv five years ago and
through the exchange of visits by high-ranking officials.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman is due to visit Cyprus before
the end of the year.

BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Two freight trains collided
each other and were derailed on Wednesday in central Belgium,
interrupting rail services between Belgium and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
No casualty was reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Due to the fact that one of the trains carried dangerous
materials, people near the collision spot had to be evacuated and
the evacuation work took longer than expected.
</P>
<P>
The collision, that took place just outside the Belgian city
of Namur toward the direction of Luxembourg, delayed local train
services for half an hour and interrupted international passenger
services by more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
The railway line, affected by the collision, is expected to
return to normal operation early on Thursday, railway authorities
told the press.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Dagestan Getting Worse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the Dagestani
capital Makhachkala deteriorated on Wednesday following the
detention of the Lakh national movement's head, Magomed
Khachilayev, the Itar-Tass news agency reported from Makhachkala.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have gathered in front of the State Council
building to protest Khachilayev's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police sealed off the central part of the city,
while law enforcement agencies have been put on alert.
</P>
<P>
Dagestani Police in a special operation arrested Khachilayev
who was suspected of organizing mass riots in th=tBB city in May,
1998.
</P>
<P>
The Dagestani Interior Ministry said the operation was approved
by the Russian prosecutor General's Office. There has been no
official statement explaining the reasons for his detention.
</P>
<P>
The report said Khachilayev is the head of t]B Le coordinating
council of Dagestan's national movements and is the leader of the
Lakh national movement, a deputy of the Dagestani legislature and
chairman of the republic's peace committee.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, members of a special force detonated a
charge and opened submachine-gun fire, trying to detain a car
reportedly carrying Khachilayev.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Itar-Tass a Interior Ministry's spokesman
confirmed that a special operation to arrest the Khachilayev
brothers had been carried out on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One of the brothers was arrested, while the other managed to
escape.
</P>
<P>
The Public Prosecutor's Office charged the Khachilayev brothers
with organizing mass riots in Makhachkala on May 21, when the
brothers and their supporters seized the building of the State
council and the government of Dagestan. The building was damaged.
</P>
<P>
It was confirmed that besides Khachilayev another five his
bodyguards were also detained. Now Khachilayev has been handed

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Host International Conference on Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- An international conference
on future business centers will be held in Cyprus next month with
the participation of about 150 experts from across the world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Wednesday, Chairman of
Cyprus' Employers and Industrialists Federation Antonis Pierides
said the two-day conference, entitled "Business Centers of the
Future", would deal with international legal, financial and fiscal
 issues and offer advice to countries seeking to set up their own
business centers.
</P>
<P>
"We are giving others the opportunity to compete with us, but
the whole point is to enable everyone to exchange views and ideas
because we all face the challenge of dealing with the fast-moving
technological advances, the globalization of the world economy
and the intensified corporate competition," Pierides said.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference is not just aimed at selling Cyprus as a
place to do business but also bringing together international
experts to discuss the requirements of future business centers.
</P>
<P>
Pierides said Cyprus cannot expect to continue to prosper
automatically as a recognized international offshore center if it
does not address the realities of what the next century will bring
about.
</P>
<P>
He believed that a future business center must provide all the
latest business, banking, transport and communication facilities,
a financially attractive taxation scheme and a good living
environment for the families of investors.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Relaxes Curfew in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Wednesday relaxed its two-week
long overnight curfew in Kinshasa, after the restoration of a
stable power supply to most parts of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Abdoulaye Yerodia, Chief political aide to Congolese President
Laurent Kabila, said on a state television that the curfew,
originally run from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m., will be shortened,
beginning from midnight to 6 a.m., according to a report reaching
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The news in Kinshasa came after Kabila's forces defeated
Tutsi-led rebels in the western part of the country under the
support from Zimbabwean and Angolan troops.
</P>
<P>
But reports keep saying that the rebels who took up arms to
fight Kabila since August 2 are still holding large part of
eastern Congo including some major towns.
</P>
<P>
The overnight curfew was imposed on August 26 after
anti-Kabila rebels clashed with loyalist forces near the airport
outside Kinshasa.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Growth Slows Down in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economic growth slowed
down considerably in the second quarter, increasing only by an
annual rate of 1.7 percent after an extraordinarily strong growth
of 4.3 percent in the first quarter, official data showed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Latest official figures issued by the German statistics office
in Wiesbaden also showed that Germany's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew only by 0.1 percent in the second quarter when compared
with the level of the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
For the first half year as a whole, Germany's GDP showed a 2.9
percent growth from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office noted that the strong expansion in the
first quarter was attributable to a number of special factors,
including the milder winter, two more working days and a buying
spree triggered by a one-percent increase of value-added tax
effective from April 1.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter, however, saw a reversal of some of these
factors, including two fewer working days compared with the same
quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt on Wednesday
expressed the belief that despite the second-quarter slowdown,
Germany's GDP would still expand by a real 2.9 percent in the
whole year.

<HEADLINE> UK Urges France to Privatize Aviation Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary
George Robertson Wednesday urged the French government to
privatize its aviation industry in a joint effort to face
challenges from the American aviation giants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a tour of the on-going Farnborough
International Air Show, Robertson said Britain would like "the
French to be part of any future (European) consolidation. We have
all made it clear that that can only take place if it is on the
basis of private ownership."
</P>
<P>
Britain and its European partners want to get the main European
firms to create a commercial and military aerospace rival to the
newly consolidated U.S. giants Boeing, Lockheed Martin and
Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
However, the leading British Aerospace (BAe) and Germany's
Daimler-Benz Aerospace (DASA) have refused to accept a merger with
their French counterpart Aerospatiale in the Airbus Industrie
consortium, while Aerospatiale remains a state-controlled company.
</P>
<P>
"The French industry has taken huge leaps forward towards
private ownership and I think it is very encouraging," Robertson
said, adding France was "very committed to a European
consolidation."

<HEADLINE> Hariri Urges Israel to Change Policy on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
el-Hariri Wednesday urged Israel to restore its credibility by
changing its policy of blocking the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is not optimistic regarding the Israeli stances which
are very distant from the spirit of Madrid conference," he told
reporters following a meeting here with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Syria and Lebanon are ready to cooperate with any Israeli
government if it changes its policies and acts in a way to
restore its credibility," Hariri added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that his talks with Mubarak dealt with the
faltering peace process and the obstacles hindering the promotion
of the peace drive.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak reiterated the necessity of Israeli pullout from South
Lebanon and Egypt's support for the Palestinian cause during the
talks, Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying since 1985 a buffer zone in south
Lebanon, where anti-Israeli Lebanese guerrillas have been fighting
to oust the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the year, Israel agreed to unilaterally withdraw from
south Lebanon on condition that the Lebanese government agrees to
ensure the safety of its north. Lebanon rejected the offer,
arguing that the U.N. has demanded Israel pull out from Lebanon
without setting any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hariri arrived here early Wednesday to lead his country's
delegation to the third session of the Egyptian-Lebanese Joint
Higher Committee, which will primarily focus on the creation of a
joint free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
He also met with his Egyptian counterpart Kamal el-Ganzouri on
facilitating bilateral ties and free trade. He is expected to meet
later Wednesday with Arab League chief Esmat Abdel Meguid and
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to Lebanon reached 109.7 million U.S. dollars
last year, while its imports were 59.4 million dollars.

CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The number of joint stock companies subject to
bankruptcy in Yemen by the end of August has reached 24, the
shares of which are distributed among about 50,000 shareholders,
according to Wednesday's "Alam Al Yom" newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The shareholders own over 850,000 shares with a total value of
approximately 35 billion rials (about 270 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But over 90 percent of them could not resort to courts or banks
to claim their money after the companies announced the cessation
of activities due to losses and shortage of profits.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has planned to carry out a number of projects
over a period of 14 years to counter the problem of water
scarcity, a Water and Irrigation Ministry report obtained on
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The projects estimated to cost 3.5 billion Jordanian dinars (5
billion U.S. dollars) are aimed at extracting water from the
Jordan Valley and tapping water potential in eastern desert oases,
the report released to a meeting of Jordanian businessmen late
Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Jordan's water demand is predicted to
stand at nearly 1.7 billion cubic meters annually by the year
2020. But its current water facilities can only meet 85 percent of
the demand by then.
</P>
<P>
"These projects will ensure that the chronic water problem
will not worsen," the ministry secretary general, Qusai Quteishat,
said.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the private sector would invest in
the projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Chairman of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB)
Ahmad Mohammad Ali said on Wednesday that the bank is trying to
raise the inter-member trade by 13 percent over next three years,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting starting on Tuesday in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, about the bank's export-financing program, Ali expressed
confidence that the goal is attainable provided that strenuous
efforts are exerted to surmount obstacles to trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based IDB includes 52 Islamic countries in the
world. One of its top priorities is to promote inter-member trade,
which is estimated at 10 percent of their total external trade.
</P>
<P>
The bank's program is aimed at financing exports and imports
among the members, creating a portfolio to safeguard investment
and exports credits.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About Security on Turco-Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will convey its concern
over the security on the Turco-Iranian border to the Iranian side
during Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem's coming visit to
Tehran, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Sermet Atacanli, deputy spokesman of the
Turkish Foreign Ministry, at a weekly press briefing here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is concerned about the security at her border with
Iran. This time, Foreign Minister Cem will convey Turkey's
sensitivity about borders to Iran," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
Cem is to pay an official visit to Iran from September 12 to 13
in an effort to improve the two countries' bitter relations and
discuss the latest situation in Afghanistan as well.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Tehran of sheltering and providing
support to Turkey's outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
militants who have been fighting for autonomy since 1984. But this
has been rejected by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Cem will explain the Turco-Israeli ties to the
Iranian officials, Atacanli said that "we have many times
explained the true nature of the relations between Turkey and
Israel."
</P>
<P>
"The desire of Turkey to develop its relations with Israel
isn't directed against any country in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ongoing tripartite meeting between the
foreign ministers of Greece, Armenia and Iran in Tehran, Atacanli
said that "Turkey is closely following this meeting."
</P>
<P>
Turkey is evaluating the nature and outcome of the meeting,
said Atacanli, adding "we are carefully watching the developments
and making the necessary assessments."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been sharing bad relations with the three neighbors
due to various problems.
</P>
<P>
However, officials of the Greek delegation headed by Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos have said that there is no reason for
Turkey to be concerned about the normal meeting.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministerial meeting is mainly of economic nature
instead of that of anti-Turkey, they said.

</P>
<P>
These are the biggest military clashes between the government
forces and the UNITA military in the recent peace crisis.
</P>
<P>
The National Police authorities warned Monday to response to
any military actions by UNITA.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Allied Militiamen Killed in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Two militiamen of the Israeli
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed and four others
wounded Wednesday in south Lebanon's conflicts with anti-Israeli
guerrillas, the Voice of the People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The fatal casualties were caused by a roadside bomb detonated
by Lebanese guerrillas when an SLA patrol consisting of senior
officers was passing by its position in the eastern sector of the
Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Nabih Ibu Rafiia, the SLA chief in charge of military
operations in the eastern sector, narrowly escaped the attack,
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
There has been no group claiming responsibility for the
attack, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli warplanes accompanied by artillery
shelling raided the villages in the central and western sectors of
the occupied zone which are believed to be hideouts for guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against Israeli occupation of the country.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Lay off Over 10,000 Armymen in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 9 (Xinhua) -- "As many as 10-12 thousand
employees in the army structures will be laid off till late this
year", Chief of the General Staff of the Romanian Armed Forces
Constantin Degeratu told a news conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Armed Forces, about 200,000 in number, are in a
restructuring process. As many as 8,898 employees, including army
and civil staff, were made redundant so far, he said, adding that
"three brigade commandments, namely, "units whose activity was
inefficient were dismantled."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of National Defense aims at restructuring the
commandments of big units, taking into account the ratio between
the ministry's financial resources and the expenditures this
process requires, he added.
</P>
<P>
Degeratu complained of the small budget, of 6,543.1 billion lei
(about 730 million U.S. dollars). With 73 percent of the sum for
staff's living expenses, the army scarcely has money for
purchasing military equipment, he said, stressing that Romania's
spending on defense per armyman is among the lowest in Europe,
less than 4,000 U.S. dollars, compared with 10,000 U.S. dollars
spent by Hungary, 14,000 by the Czech Republic and Poland, and
90,000 by NATO member countries.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday the Group of Seven industrialized countries will take
little concrete decisions on helping Russia when their ministers
are meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told reporters that
Russia's main challenges were political, adding that the
international community had to wait for Russia to lay down a new
policy framework.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very much premature to discuss these issues,
pending Russia making judgments about its choices," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the discussions to be of a much more analytical and
tentative nature. I am sure the meeting on Russia will be a
general discussion of the Russian situation, an attempt to
understand what is happening in Russia and to think about possible
scenarios going forward."
</P>
<P>
"Until the political authorities indicate the direction in
which they wish to go it is very difficult to calibrate an
international response because appropriate international responses
have to be built on a reality that countries shape their
destinies," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
Duma, the Russian parliament, has twice rejected President
Boris Yeltsin's candidate, Viktor Chernomyrdin, for prime minister
and Yeltsin has not yet put forward a name for a third and final
vote.
</P>
<P>
If parliament rejects Yeltsin's candidate three times, the
president must dissolve the legislature and call new elections,
which would only prolong the current economic chaos in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Going forward I don't think that there is any alternative to a
stable currency and that means financial practices that make
possible a stable currency," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that sound money, a rule of law, enforcement of
property rights are "requisites for economic success."
</P>
<P>
"I do not say this to minimize the profound challenges that
Russia faces, challenges that first and most of all are
political," he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia's banking system is in tatters after the government
defaulted on some debts and allowed the rouble currency to fall,
and consumers are nervously stocking up on goods.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Embassy to DRC Relocated, Not Closed: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Embassy to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is just relocated to Congo's
capital Brazzaville, not closed, a senior diplomat has said.
</P>
<P>
Cos Kamanda Bataringaya, ugandan ambassador to the DRC, made
the statement to journalists in the Foreign Ministry headquarters
Wednesday, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
The envoy, who was introduced to the press by the Acting
Director of Information and Public Relations Department,Edward
Kwisenshoni, said he came to brief the ministry authorities about
the recent successful evacuation of Ugandan citizens from the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The mission was just relocated to a safe place in Congo and
was not closed as some reports said, he clarified, adding that
the bilateral relations between Uganda and DRC are normal.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the alleged arrests of Ugandan nationals in
DRC, he reiterated that the worsening situation there affected
not only Ugandans, but nationals of other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
Since armed conflict erupted in DRC on August 2, President
Laurent Kabila has accused Uganda of backing the Tutsi-led
rebellion, but Kampala denied any kind of involvement.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ugnanda admitted military presence in eastern DRC,
but said it was there to flush out rebels in accordance with an
oral undertanding between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
The latest regional summit in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, failed
to negotiate a truce as expected. The rebels vowed to fight on.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Political Commissar of Uganda's ruling
National Resistance Movement, James Wapakhabulo, said Tuesday
that Ugandan army would remain deep in DRC till the rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces, who operate from their bases there, are
flushed out of the Rwenzori mountains.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Devotes Attention to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council devoted much of its attention to conflicts in Africa in
its open meetings for the past 12 months, according to its 53-rd
report to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the former Yugoslavia and Iraq were also a
prime concern of the council, said the report adopted on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It said the 15 member council, one of the most powerful U.N.
organizations, also met on Afghanistan, Albania, Cambodia,
Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The report, covering the period from June 16, 1997 to June 15
1998, said the council held 103 formal meetings, adopted 61
resolutions and issued 41 statements by the council president.
</P>
<P>
On the subsidiary organs of the council, the report said the
period under review was one of the most challenging with regard to
the relationship between Iraq and the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
The Commission was set up by council resolution 687 (1991) to
monitor the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions on Iraq imposed since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990 will not be lifted unless UNSCOM sees Iraq's disarmament
as completed.

<HEADLINE> NATO Could Deploy Troops in Kosovo to Keep Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) said on Wednesday that it could send 50,000
troops into Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo to keep peace if a
ceasefire is agreed upon between the parties.
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that it will be ballpark 50,000 if you had a
ceasefire agreement," U.S. Navy Adm. Joseph Lopez told reporters,
but stressing the figure is not firm.
</P>
<P>
Reports said U.S. negotiators have presented both sides in the
Kosovo conflict with a draft for an interim agreement
incorporating principles of self-government in the
Albanian-dominated province.
</P>
<P>
But the question of a ceasefire remained a major stumbling
block, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Lopez, based in Naples, Italy, as commander of NATO forces in
southern Europe with responsibility for Kosovo, said that a
diplomatic solution is still the first choice.
</P>
<P>
"We prefer that there will be a diplomatic solution so that
there won't be that necessity" to send in U.S. and other troops,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, a NATO official said the alliance has drafted
contingency plans for a range of military options for Kosovo
including using troops to enforce any ceasefire or peace
settlement but would not act without authorization from the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
A peacekeeping operation in Kosovo might be similar to NATO's
efforts in Bosnia, but it would be complicated because it would be
seen as an "occupying" military presence and would have to deal
with ethnic Albanians who want independence from Yugoslavia, noted
Lopez.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are trying to fight for
independence from Belgrade. However, the effort gains no support
even from the West, which has blamed Belgrade for the atrocities.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani: Taliban Cannot Escape Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Iran's powerful
State Expediency Council (SEC) Hashemi Rafsanjani said Wednesday
that the Afghan Taliban militia can not escape the responsibility
for the fate of missing Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani,
Rafsanjani said that Taliban's attack on Iranian consulate in
Mazari Sharif and the kidnapping of Iranian diplomats are "obvious
and unjustifiable violation of international laws."
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that inhuman events that took place in
Afghanistan under the name of Islam, the official news agency
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that the Taliban forces kidnapped 11 Iranian
diplomats and an IRNA correspondent in Mazari Sharif on August 8
when Taliban forces conquered the city, a major stronghold for the
Northern Alliance led by Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Taliban has denied knowing the whereabouts of the Iranian
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
There are mixed reports on the fate of the missing Iranian
diplomats. Some said the Iranian diplomats were killed by the
Taliban forces when they took over the Iranian consulate, while
others said they were kept alive in a Taliban prison.
</P>
<P>
In a show of military strengthen to the Taliban, Iran recently
conducted a massive military maneuver along the border with
Afghanistan and has deployed the participating troops along the
border.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, the former president, said that Iran condemned the
massacre of oppressed people in Afghanistan by the Taliban. He
said "the Afghan issue could be solved only through union among
all Afghan groups and their participation in the future
government."
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Rabbani briefed Rafsanjani the latest
political, military and social developments in Afghanistan. He
said that the crude, non-Islamic and inhuman nature of the Taliban
militia was more obvious for the world than before.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the fate of missing Iranian diplomats, Rabbani
said that Taliban's attack on the Iranian consulate is an evident
violation of international laws.
</P>
<P>
He called on the United Nations and the Organization of the
Islamic Conference to condemn Taliban's crimes, particularly the
massacre of Afghan people, and bring the criminals to justice.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani was ousted by the Taliban in September 1996 and his
alliance suffered serious military setbacks in recent months.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here Tuesday night from Turkey to seek Iran's
support for his government, which is still generally recognized as
the legitimate ruler of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Cautiously Optimistic Over Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Wednesday he hopes that obstacles
can be removed to put the stalled Mideast peace process back on
track.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Abdel-Meguid as
expressing the hope just as the U.S. envoy Dennis Ross returned to
the Middle East to try to narrow the gaps between Israel and the
Palestinians over Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said he welcomed the efforts exerted by the
U.S. and other countries which are keen to establish stability and
peace in the region, but he expressed cautious optimism about the
effect of Ross' visit to region.
</P>
<P>
What has been done in the past has led to "nothing positive,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Currently on the negotiating table is a U.S. proposal for an
Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent more of the West Bank in
exchange of Palestinian enhanced efforts to crack down upon
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have accepted the initiative, and Israel,
initially rejecting the proposal, agreed later to hand over 10
percent and convert the 3 other percent into a nature reserve,
with Israel retaining full security control.
</P>
<P>
The two sides resumed direct talks on July 19 after a lapse of
16 months, but there have been no signs so far to show a deal on
the redeployment is within reach.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdel-Meguid said the Palestinians will offer "more
and more information and details" about the result of its recent
negotiations with Israel during the 110th session of the AL
Council of foreign ministers here on September 16.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, is expected to back acting Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's candidacy for prime minister on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party, Agrarians and People's Power, three
leftist factions that compose the Duma's largest voting block,
will all vote in favor of the Kremlin's new choice to head the
Russian cabinet, the Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The three groups compose 213 of the Duma's deputies. Primakov
needs to get 226 votes of support from parliament's 450 lawmakers
to win Friday's confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, a career diplomat whose service spanned the Soviet
and Russian times, emerged as a possible compromise candidate last
week when leftists and liberals in the opposition-dominated State
Duma put his name forward.
</P>
<P>
The Duma had twice rejected acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's first choice for
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting Thursday with Chernomyrdin and Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist deputy in the Duma, Yeltsin sent a letter
to the State Duma nominating Primakov for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The Communist-led Duma opposition welcomed Yeltsin's action.
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov said it was "the most reasonable"
option, adding: "We know Primakov well. We will support him in the
Duma."
</P>
<P>
His fellow Communist and party leader Gennady Zyuganov said
"common sense has prevailed...Primakov is known around the entire
world and knows how to defend Russia's national interests," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Born in Kiev on October 29, 1929, Primakov was graduated from
the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies in 1953. He has been
serving as Russian foreign minister since January 9, 1996.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Four of the world elite
teams are to battle it out for top honor in women's volleyball in
the two-day GD Guangdong Cup World Grand Prix Finals starting at
the Hong Kong Coliseum here this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Local favorites China, current title holders Russia, twice
former champions Brazil and World and Olympic champions Cuba will
test each other's wits in the 560,000 U.S. dollars event.
</P>
<P>
Cuba plays Brazil and China takes on Russia in the semi-finals
on Saturday. The winning teams will meet for the title on Sunday
while the losers will vie for the third place.
</P>
<P>
"Although all the three other teams are of world-class caliber
and stronger than our side, we will give our best shot and
entertain the local fans and friends who have long been
supporting our team," said Lang Ping, head coach of the Chinese
team, here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The former ace Chinese spiker attributed her team's victory
over Russia earlier in the Grand Prix Bangkok leg to successful
setting and fast attacks. "If we could do the same here, we'd

<HEADLINE> Japanese Rightist Gets Prison Term For Cutting Cinema Screen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese rightist was
sentenced to 16 months in prison for slashing the screen at a
Yokohama movie theater in June during the showing of a film about
the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Yokohama District Court pronounced the sentence on Shin
Higaki, 27, for his guilty of destruction and damage of property
and impeding business by threatening behavior.
</P>
<P>
Higaki, a member of a rightist group, rushed from his seat in
the movie theater in Yokohama's Naka Ward, which was screening
"Nanjing 1937," and slashed the screen in seven places with a
cutter on June 6.
</P>
<P>
He was later arrested by police officers who had been posted
inside the theater.
</P>
<P>
The film, produced jointly by China's mainland and Hong Kong,
depicts the fate of three families living in Japanese-occupied
Nanjing during Japan's aggressive war against China.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 Chinese civilians and prisoners of war were
slaughtered by Japanese troops following the fall of Nanjing in
late 1937.

<HEADLINE> First Teachers' Day Marked in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A reception was held here
Thursday to celebrate the First Teachers' Day in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa paid his tribute to all teachers
in the SAR at the reception attended by schoolmasters, teachers,
students, people who show concern about the teaching profession,
as well as educators from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception, Tung said that teachers always give
proper and patient guidance to all students without
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
"We are all deeply indebted to our teachers, who well deserve
the respect of the whole community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today is our first Teachers' Day since our reunification with
our motherland and it is also the Teachers' Day of the mainland,"
Tung said. "This occasion is especially meaningful as celebration
is held by the local and mainland educators together," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said that the SAR government has allocated
considerable resources for the provision of quality education at
all levels although Hong Kong is confronted with economic
difficulties at present.
</P>
<P>
"We understand fully the importance of investment in
education," Tung said. Education has always had the largest share
of public spending, he added.
</P>
<P>
This year, the recurrent expenditure on education exceeds 38
billion HK dollars (5 billion U.S. dollars), which accounts for 21
percent of the total recurrent expenditure of the government.
</P>
<P>
The gross expenditure on education is well above 45 billion HK
dollars (5.8 billion U.S. dollars), which is approximately 18
percent of the government's gross expenditure, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure that our huge investment in education will yield
positive results, we must do our best endeavors to implement
various new policies and measures on education, including programs
on quality education, information technology education and the use
of instruction medium", Tung said.
</P>
<P>
To commend teachers for their devotion to the teaching
profession and to recognize the achievements made by schools, the
Quality Education Fund plans to launch an award scheme for
outstanding teachers and schools.
</P>
<P>
To promote the culture of quality education, teachers and
schoolmasters with outstanding performance and schools with great
achievements will be short listed for commendation, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung declared September 10 each year as Teachers' Day in his
first Policy Address delivered after the establishment of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region last year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Gains Euro-Zone Banking Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank
(ECB) will allow Britain to help coordinate banking supervision in
the new European single currency zone even though it is not
adopting the euro.
</P>
<P>
The concession reflects a recognition of the importance of
London as Europe's largest financial center, according to today's
Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
Britain is one of four European Union (EU) members that will
not join the single currency on January 1, 1999. But the ECB's
board of governors is expected to admit Britain, Greece, Denmark
and Sweden to a key committee, coordinating banking supervision
and ensuring financial stability, according to European banking
officials.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which could be taken at a meeting of the ECB's
governing council in Frankfurt on Friday, is partly influenced by
renewed sensitivity to the importance of maintaining the stability
of the EU financial system following the financial crises in Asia
and Russia, the Financial Times said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the decision is politically significant because it
further blurs the distinction between the 11 "insiders" who will
take part in the single currency and the four "outsiders," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The ECB already operates two separate boards of governors, a
governing council, drawn from the euro-zone 11, that makes policy
decisions, and a general council that includes all 15 central bank
governors.
</P>
<P>
A previous vote to accommodate the interests of the outsiders
came in July when ECB governors opened the "target payments
system" to the central and commercial banks of outsiders on
unexpectedly generous terms. Target is expected to be one of the
main systems for inter-bank transactions in the euro-zone
beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times quoted a British official as saying that
the decision to include Britain in the supervisory activities of
the ECB was a matter of common sense and came as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
"It would not make any sense at all to exclude the UK, and I am
glad that this is not happening," said one senior European banking
official.
</P>
<P>
Britain will be represented by the Bank of England and the
Financial Services Authority (FSA), the financial market
regulator. The committee is to meet at least four times a year.
</P>
<P>
Under Europe's new monetary regime, national authorities will
remain in charge of banking and financial sector supervision; the
ECB head office will play only a relatively minor role.
</P>
<P>
The banking supervisory committee could become a key body for
coordinating policy across national boundaries and for ensuring
that the euro-zone will be equipped to deal with financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
For example, the ECB and national central banks have not yet
laid down pan-European rules about how national monetary
authorities can assist domestic banks in trouble. Some European
officials have defended the lack of formal rules, arguing that
transparent bail-out regulations would create moral hazards by
encouraging banks to take on unnecessary risks.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid has
disclosed that the number of Arab states embarking on the
executive program of the greater Arab free trade zone has so far
reached 12.
</P>
<P>
These countries, he said, have instructed their respective
customs offices to implement the gradual reduction of duties by 10
percent on commodities of Arab origin.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 62nd session of the Arab economic and social
council in Cairo Wednesday, he said that trade activities of these
countries represented some 80 percent of the total Arab trade with
the outside world, and approximately the same percentage with
regard to inter Arab trade.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Palestinian Minister of Agriculture Hikmat Zeid has
said that he would discuss with the Syrian government the import
of a list of agricultural crops,
</P>
<P>
In an interview in Damascus with Arab daily "Al Hayat"
published Thursday, Zeid said he will also seek Syria's approval
to receive Palestinian experts to acquire Syrian expertise in the
domain of agriculture. He will further seek official approval for
the passage of transit goods to the Palestinian autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he estimated last year's agricultural losses, as a
result of Israeli practices, at over 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has announced the
abolition of custom duties on most Egyptian and Lebanese goods
flowing into either country as from the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Egyptian daily "Alam Al Yom" reported that Hariri
made this statement while referring to the signing of a free trade
zone agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili is
drawing up a memorandum to be submitted to Prime Minister Kamal el
Ganzouri suggesting a cut on custom duties on rice imports from 20
to 15 percent, Thursday's Egyptian daily "Al Akhbar" reported.
</P>
<P>
This cut is aimed at maintaining stability of the local rice
market and to guard against unjustified hike in prices, hence,
promoting the rate of exports.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdi Al-Banbi has
disclosed that Egypt and Chile will sign next year two agreements
on Chile's taking part in oil and gas prospecting activities in
the Gulf of Suez and Egypt's western desert.
</P>
<P>
According to Thursday's Egyptian daily "Al Ahram," Chile
expressed growing interest over the past two years to operate in
Egypt in the field of prospecting and development and have been
closely following international tenders offered by the Egyptian
Petroleum Authority.

<HEADLINE> Gap Between Rich, Poor Widens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The gap between the rich and
the poor in Kenya is continuing to widen, according to the 1998
U.N. Human Development Report available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report recently launched by the U.N. Development Program
(UNDP) says that the poorest 20 percent of the Kenyan population
live on around 238 U.S. Dollars per person annually in real terms
while the richest 20 percent live on 4,347 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
This means that the richest 20 percent of the population of
around 29 million Kenyans are a staggering 18.26 times richer
than their poorest fellow countrymen.
</P>
<P>
The report puts the east African state in the human
development index to position 137, down from 134 last year among
174 countries ranked. Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Sierra Leone
are at the tail end of the list.
</P>
<P>
Among the 77 developing countries ranked in the index, Kenya
is placed 35. Some 27 percent of Kenyans now live in absolute
poverty.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya continues to perform better in terms of key
human development indicators (HDI) such as health care, life
expectancy and education than many of its African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy rates in Kenya at nearly 54 years are around
average for the continent while the adult literacy rates at 78.1
percent in the east African country are over 17 percent higher
than the average for the low income countries with low human
development.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven of every 100 Kenyans is inaccessible to safe water
and another 23 percent lacks access to health services.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in 1998 the HIV/AIDS scourge will have
pushed up the child mortality rate by 100 percent in Kenya, says
the report.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP report, which concentrates on the widening gap in
consumption between the North and the South, also gives a
breakdown on the gap between the rich and the poor within the 174
countries covered.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's neighbors - Uganda and Tanzania - have far more equal
societies than Kenya. Data show that the richest 20 percent in
Tanzania earns an average 1,430 U.S. Dollars a year compared to
the poorest who earn 217 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the figures are 2,189 Dollars and 209 Dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report's ranking system goes beyond per capita income as a
measure of human progress which is also assessed by such factors
as average life expectancy, literacy and overall well-being.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Countries Reach Consensus on Women Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The second South Asia
regional meeting on women issues ended here Thursday with
consensus reached on major achievements, critical gaps and serious
concerns that have characterized countries in the region in the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the two-day meeting said that
considerable development has been witnessed in South Asia in the
past three years since the Fourth World Conference on Women held
in Beijing in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the achievements included drawing up of national
plans of action and national policy instruments to implement the
Platform for Action adopted at the Beijing conference, move toward
legal reforms and strengthening of laws and expansion of
institutional mechanisms for securing gender equality.
</P>
<P>
Increased commitment to combating trafficking in women and
girls, intensification of efforts to make national statistical
systems sex-desegregated and reflective of women's contribution
and increased NGO activism, networking and mobilization of women's
movement around key gender concerns were also achievements in the
region, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the region has witnessed greater assertiveness and
awareness among women at all levels, and increasing consensus in
favor of and efforts at affirmative action to secure greater
representative of women at local levels, it said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the achievements, there are serious shortfalls in
almost all the member countries of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
These include lack of strong political will to gender equality,
increased incidence of gender-based violence, sexual abuse and
sexual harassment, lack of proper mainstreaming of gender
consideration across sectors and low levels of women's
participation in higher levels of governance, political leadership
and civil service, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ministers, secretaries and senior government officials,
representatives of non-governmental organizations and women groups
from SAARC member countries attended the meeting organized jointly
by the Nepali government and the U.N. Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM).
</P>
<P>
They noted that the SAARC region is facing serious challenges
and threats, such as the continuing feminization of poverty, lack
of gender sensitization of policy-makers, the rise of religious
fundamentalism and attitude of religious leaders and instability
of governments standing in the way of sustained policy-level
efforts at securing gender equality.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to direct their efforts in the coming years toward
a number of priority concerns within the frameworks of SAARC,
UNIFEM, U.N. agencies, women's networks and the national
governments.
</P>
<P>
The first such regional meeting was held in September 1996 in
New Delhi, India.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Are A Powerful Force: Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has praised women as a powerful force for promoting economic and
social development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said this during a discussion with the new leaders of the
All-China Women's Federation and some deputies to the Eighth
Women's Congress here today.
</P>
<P>
The forum was presided over by Hu Jintao, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, another member of the committee, and some other
top leaders, attended the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Chinese women have made great contributions to
the development of the Chinese nation. "They have also created a
new era for the liberation and progress of Chinese women," the
president noted.
</P>
<P>
He praised highly the women who have done heroic deeds in the
anti-flood fight this summer, saying: "Facts have proved that our
country's women are a powerful force for promoting the country's
economic and social development."
</P>
<P>
The whole nation is holding high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory to modernize the country, Jiang said, and no
victory can be achieved in the process without women's
participation.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, without the advancement of the cause of the
Party and the people, Chinese women will not witness their own
progress, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he hoped that Chinese women would study hard to
improve their capabilities and skills. They must master Deng
Xiaoping Theory and the Party's policies, in addition to general
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the legacy of hard work and frugality, and the
tradition of respect for the elderly and care for children.
</P>
<P>
"If every old person is fully respected in the family, every
child is cultivated in an all-round way, and every family develops
a fine style of living, the general mood of society will become
better," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Party always pays attention to women's
work, and safeguards and protects their rights and interests in the
country's political, economic and cultural lives by ensuring that
they enjoy equal status with men.
</P>
<P>
The president also asked the All-China Women's Federation to
serve as a bridge between the Party and ordinary women, and to
inspire women to contribute to the country's reform and opening up.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao concluded that the forum fully demonstrated that the
Party cares cordially for China's women, and Jiang has
issued a call to the whole Party and nation in his speech.
</P>
<P>
This is because Jiang's important speech represents the CPC
Central Committee's instructions on women's work, and sets the
orientation for the cross-century women's movement in China, Hu
explained.

ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Bodies of nine Iranian
diplomats who went missing in northern Afghanistan in early August
were recovered in Mazar-e-Sharif, a Taliban spokesman said
Thursday in the Afghan southern city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian diplomats have been missing since the Taliban
troops overran Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north of the Afghan
capital of Kabul, which served as de-facto capital of the
anti-Taliban northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
"We will punish those who killed these Iranian diplomats,"
Taliban's spokesman Wakil Ahmad Mutawakkal said in a statement
released from Kandahar Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said the bodies of these nine Iranians were recovered from a
suburb of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
However, he rejected the claim by the Iranian leadership that
Taliban's supreme leader Mohammad Omar ordered the killing of
these Iranians.
</P>
<P>
He said it was actions of individuals and not policy of
Taliban, adding that the militia was ready to hand over the bodies
of these Iranian diplomats to Tehran.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Most of Romania's
mechanical farming equipment such as tractors and
harvester-threshers are now considered to be old and worn out,
Rompres news agency reported Thursday, citing sources in the
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Romania at present has 163,000 tractors and about 50 percent of
them are 8-14 years old. In addition, about 87 percent of the
nation's harvester-threshers are more than 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
The low quality of farming equipment resulted in behind the

</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the nation needs to
invest about 6.7 billion U.S. dollars in farming equipment from
now to the year 2004.

</P>
<P>
The Taliban's aggressions only serve to further harm peace and
security in the region, Khatami was quoted by the official news
agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Afghan issue should be resolved
peacefully with due respect for rights of all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president condemned the genocide carried out in
Afghanistan, calling on the international community to take
measures to prevent such crimes.
</P>
<P>
"We consider the instability in Afghanistan as a threat on our
borders to our national security whose defense is our right,"
Khatami stated.
</P>
<P>
Iran held military exercises last week near the Afghan border
following the allegation that the Taliban held captive 70
Iranians, including 11 diplomats and a journalist, after capturing
the city of Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
But the Taliban denied any knowledge of the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iran's army Chief and Staff Ali Shahbazi announced Thursday
that new war games would be held on the eastern border with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rabbani expressed appreciation for Iranian
humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and also for its hosting of
millions of Afghan refugees over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Taliban's behavior towards Iranian diplomats and
aid workers in Afghanistan as "a source of shame for the Afghan
nation," and stated that "this mercenary group bears the
responsibility for such barbaric behavior."
</P>
<P>
"I have told Pakistani officials that we view the Afghan war
as a Pakistan's war against the Afghan nation, a repression which
we would never forget," Rabbani said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Pakistan has provided arms and other
support the Taliban, student militia, which has controlled most of
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Italian Nun Abducted in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- An Italian nun working in
an SOS hospital in the Somali capital was abducted by
unidentified gunmen Thursday morning, worsening the health
situation in war-torn Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, the nun, Madame Marsa, who served
in the Child and Maternity hospital of SOS-Mogadishu, was taken
away by gunmen right in front of the hospital at about 7:00 a. m.
local time.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the abduction is not yet known, but it was
reported that the gunmen have taken her to a house in the
district of Huriwa in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Two other nuns working in the same SOS hospital in Mogadishu
quit as from Thursday on in protest against the abduction. It is
feared that if other medics join them, the hospital would be
closed.
</P>
<P>
The nuns took care of the medical and food supplies warehouses
and supervised the patients in the absence of the doctors
especially during night times since they resided inside the SOS
premises in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The SOS hospital in Mogadishu is the only main maternity and
child health center which serves the Somalis free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other hospitals, SOS has never closed its doors to
poor Somalis even during the worst times of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the hospital said the kidnaping followed
a quarrel between Chief of SOS Somali Section in Kenyan capital
Nairobi, Willy Hubert, and the finance manager of the SOS in
Mogadishu Abdullahi Erro.
</P>
<P>
Hubert sacked Erro, replacing him with Dahir Madobe after
discovering Erro was in the middle of a financial fraud.
</P>
<P>
Erro was blamed for allegedly cheating more than 50 million
Somali Shillings (some 6,250 U.S. Dollars) every month under the
payrolls of non-existing local employees.
</P>
<P>
However, the life of Madame Marsa is not in danger, according
to an informed source, who said her immediate release might
depend on how the SOS Nairobi deals with Erro who is believed to
be behind the act of abduction.
</P>
<P>
This abduction will have a very bad negative impact on the
health situation of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 women and 400 children with various diseases go
to see doctors at SOS-Mogadish daily.
</P>
<P>
The effects left behind by the abduction of the 10 members
from the International Commission of Red Cross (ICRC) in
Mogadishu this April still hurt since nearly all the foreign
expatriates had pulled out of the country since.

<HEADLINE> China Has One Million Parkinson's Disease Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More than one million Chinese
are suffering from Parkinson's disease, and with the ageing of the
population, that number is on a constant rise, according to a
report from a symposium held here today.
</P>
<P>
The disease, caused by a lack of dopamine in the brain, is
found in one in every 1,000 people, on average, but in one in
every 100 among the population above the age of 65. Dopamine
transfers chemical information among nerve cells and is connected
with muscle control.
</P>
<P>
So far, the disease can not be fully cured. In 1960, the
Hoffmann-La-Roche Company of Switzerland first used Levodopa to
treat the disease, with encouraging results.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the symposium said that they believed that a
kind of new medicine named Tasmar introduced by the same company
recently may bring good news to Chinese Parkinson's disease
sufferers.
</P>
<P>
Tasmar can effectively increase the amount of dopamine reaching
the brain by reducing its loss during the transfer process, thus
greatly improving patients' movement functions.
</P>
<P>
The new medicine has been proved effective in clinical
experiments in hospitals in both Beijing and Shanghai, according
to experts.

<HEADLINE> IFC Provides Financing to Non-Public Chinese Enterprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today signed a joint venture contract with the
Zhen Jing Leather Products Co. Ltd. from southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement represented IFC's first invest contract with a
local non-public-owned company in China.
</P>
<P>
The financing agreement includes an equity investment of two
million U.S. dollars, or 12.5 percent of the company's registered
capital, and a loan of 4.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The terms of the contract call for Zhen Jing to use the funds
to install a new leather production line with an annual capacity
of 300,000 tanned hides and 180,000 finished garments. A portion
of the funds will also be used to install an environmental
management system.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project will also enable Zhen Jing to diversify
its product mix and introduce improved management.
</P>
<P>
IFC, a subsidiary of the World Bank Group, promotes economic
growth in developing countries by providing financing for private
sector investments.
</P>
<P>
Jemal-ud-din Kassum, IFC's vice-president for investment
operations, noted that the corporation's major goal is to support
what he referred to as "home grown" Chinese businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Non-state industries have contributed greatly to China's
economic growth and will continue to help to stabilize the economy
as the country proceeds with the reform of state-owned enterprises
and various other difficult issues," said Kassum, adding that IFC
will play a role in pioneering long-term financing for the
non-state sector and promoting improved corporate management of
local firms.
</P>
<P>
China is IFC's fastest growing client. IFC had provided 1.2
billion U.S. dollars in financing for 37 projects in China by the
end of June, with the total project cost standing at 2.95
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhen Jing, founded in 1993 as a private enterprise group, is
one of China's leading producers of leather product. The company's
total 1997 sales hit 200 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
IFC sources note that financing for Zhen Jing has been
supplemented with matching equity and debt investment by the
Netherlands Development Finance Company.

BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing has called on the nation to render further respect for
teachers in this era of the knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's gathering at the Great Hall of the People to

Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, asked the nation
to abide by President Jiang Zemin's instructions on invigorating
China through science, technology and education.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting cited 2,797 outstanding teachers from across

fight against floods this summer. Li urged the people to learn
from them.
</P>
<P>
He said that these teachers struggled side by side with the
People's Liberation Army and the people to protect students and
school property.
</P>
<P>
The educational sector suffered greatly from the floods, with
more than 40,000 school buildings damaged and millions of students
displaced.
</P>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela left for Mauritius Thursday morning on a two-day
state visit and for a summit of southern African heads of state
to he held on the Indian Ocean Island.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, accompanied by his wife, Graca Machel, was expected

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Claims Go Up to 7-Week High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. first-time claims
for unemployment benefits went up last week to a seven-week high,
due to the pilots strike and related layoffs in Northwest
Airlines, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Benefit claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 312,000, up from
304,000 the week before, the highest since the week ended July 18,
according to the department.
</P>
<P>
A department analyst attributed much of the increase to a large
rise in Minnesota, the home state of Northwest Airlines, the
fourth-largest in the industry in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment claims had hit a four-month low of 299,000 two
week ago. For two consecutive weeks in late June and early July,
they soared to 394,000, a result of the nearly-two-month-long
General Motors strikes.
</P>
<P>
A four-week average of claims rose to 304,500, up from 302,500
and the most in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Despite global financial turmoil and weakness in American
manufacturing, jobs remain plentiful. The nation's unemployment
rate, at 4.5 percent in August, remained near a 28-year
low.

<HEADLINE> First E. African Freight Fair Opens in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The first ever East African
Freight and Transport Exhibition opened here in the Kenyan
capital Thursday, in response to the rising demand from the
on-going regional integration.
</P>
<P>
It is the shift toward regional integration that "calls for an
expansion of the freight and transport industry" in east Africa,
said Kenyan Minister for Transport and Communications William Ole
Ntimama at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"This region has recorded phenomenal growth in cargo traffic
in the last five years and road transport has increased by
three-fold over the last decade," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Freight Expo'98, the fair is geared to meet the
specific needs of the freight and transport industry and will
feature innovation and development applicable to the east African
market.
</P>
<P>
It "provides a unique opportunity for stake-holders in the
freight industry to make business contacts and explore new
business approaches and opportunities which will form the basis
of future growth and development in east and central Africa," the
minister added.
</P>
<P>
"Keen interest has been shown by shipping lines, haulers,
freight forwarders, warehousing firms, heavy commercial vehicle
dealers, port authorities, maritime suppliers, airlines and air
cargo agents," said Exhibition coordinator Irene Murugu.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister of State for Works, Housing and
Communications Andruale Awuzu said at the opening ceremony that
faster and safer transportation is especially important for
land-locked Uganda which is over 1,000 kilometers away from the
ports of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"To sustain its rate of growth of 6.5 percent, Uganda, among
other things, requires a cost-effective transportation system,
highly conducive to growth and counter inflation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also claimed that the two countries are
"making a unified transport sector" in a bid to promote the
regional economy.
</P>
<P>
The three-day fair, organized by Art-Trak Communications, has
attracted 55 firms in the road, sea, rail and air freight
business from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Ideal Place to Do Business: Business Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A business leader from Hong
Kong said here Thursday that Hong Kong has been equipped to react
to Asian crisis and is an ideal location to do business in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Hong Kong International Committee of the Hong
Kong General Chamber of Commerce T. B. Stevenson made the point in
his address at a luncheon here organized by the Hong Kong Economic
and Trade Office in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said, "The corporate sector in Hong Kong is slimming
down for better cost economy and better control in efficiency."
</P>
<P>
"This will enable Hong Kong to have a strong base to return to
positive growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course this also means that there are excellent investment
opportunities available in Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Stevenson, Hong Kong's key advantages are its
geographic location, rule of law, a high quality civil service and
regulatory environment, free flow of information which is critical
to all investors and its low and advantageous tax rates.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said Hong Kong's return to China and its close
linkage with the interior of China is "the single strongest factor
in Hong Kong's favor."
</P>
<P>
"China is Hong Kong's biggest partner," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson also said that if China develops its economy and
meets its economic targets, "then Hong Kong's economy will recover
steadily and Hong Kong and China would be one of the catalysts to
pull Asia back."
</P>
<P>
Stevenson told his audience that Hong Kong's economy has
adjusted dramatically and as a result it becomes much more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
"Our property prices are down and lower commercial and domestic
rents will mean lower costs for companies doing business in and
from Hong Kong," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson said he saw no possibility that the dollar peg will
be removed.
</P>
<P>
One positive aspect of the financial crisis was the speedy
reaction of the Hong Kong government to many of the challenges it
faced and the Hong Kong government has introduced a number of
measures that given time would lead to substantial benefits to the
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Stevenson, who is also chairman of Ernst &AMP; Young's operations in
Hong Kong, is in Singapore on a business visit.

<HEADLINE> EU Tries to Untie Legal Tangle Over Flight Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Thursday that it is studying the legality of a flight ban on the
Yugoslav carrier JAT.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesperson said the EC, the executive body of
the 15-nation European Union, was seeking a solution to the legal
issue that prevented Britain from implementing the flight ban.
</P>
<P>
Most European Union member states have implemented the flight
ban, unanimously agreed upon in June by the European council of
foreign ministers, and finalized last week by the same council.
</P>
<P>
The ban came into force this Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav national carrier JAT has already been banned from
flying to Germany, Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands and Denmark
after these EU member states suspended its landing rights.
</P>
<P>
Britain, however, announced that under a 1959 agreement with
Yugoslavia it is required to give a 12-month notice before
canceling flights from that country.
</P>
<P>
The British authorities quoted the community treaty as
stipulating that member states have to honor international
agreements with non-EU countries as well.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Spain also face the same issue, but Spain will
decide on Friday whether to implement the ban.
</P>
<P>
The commission said on several occasions that the flight ban is
to send out a political message over the Serbian action in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.

The daily newspaper quoted Joa Marcelo, SAB coordinator for
export, as saying that the South African beer giant has sent a
research team on a probe mission to Angola.
</P>
<P>
Beer is one of the most favorite beverages in Angola. It is
estimated that 50 million liters of beer are consumed each year
in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Marcelo said the SAB strategy puts great emphasis on the
southern African markets.
</P>
<P>
Since Angola is one of the important emerging markets among
the Southern African Development Community (SADC), he said, it is
necessary for SAB to establish producing facilities in the
country and elsewhere in the sub-region and market its
world-famous beers.
</P>
<P>
With the history of over a century of manufacturing beers, SAB
has more than 20 plants in Africa and other parts of the world,
including Hungary, Poland, Rumania, and China. Most of them are
joint ventures with local enterprises or governments of those
countries.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, SAB ranked the fourth among the biggest beer brewers
in the world. Its well-known products include Castle Lager,
Castle Milk Stout, Lion Lager, Ohlssons and Bafs.

<HEADLINE> China Never Poses Threat to Any Country: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China did not, does not and
will never pose any threat to any country in the world, Chinese
Ambassador to India Zhou Gang said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing officers of the National Defense College of India,
Zhou Gang said that as the Chinese people were subjected to
aggression, oppression and bullying by the foreign powers in
modern times, China would not impose such sufferings on the people
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese envoy explained that China's socialist system has
ensured that it would never carry out expansionist acts and
aggression against other countries.
</P>
<P>
The arduous task facing the Chinese government is to achieve
the targets of economic development and improvement of the living
standards of its 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
To fit for its modernization drive, the ambassador said, the
prime objective of China's foreign policy is to create a favorable
international environment, long-term peaceful, stable and friendly
surroundings in particular.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Gang briefed his audience on China achievements in
socialist construction since the founding of the People's
Republic, particularly tremendous changes following the
implementation of the policy of reform and opening-up in 1978.
</P>
<P>
On the average, he said, annual growth rate of the Gross
National Product increased by 9.5 percent between 1979 and 1997,
with Gross Domestic Product totaling renminbi 7,477.2 billion yuan
(approximately 90 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 and total value of
imports and exports of 325.1 billion U.S. dollars, making China
the 10th biggest trading power in the world.
</P>
<P>
With contracted overseas investment of 521.16 billion U.S.
dollars and actual use of 221.87 billion dollars by the end of
1997, China has become the second largest country in the world in
attracting overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
However, the ambassador reminded his audience of the
distinctive disparities in development among different regions in
China, and huge pressure on resources by the population growth and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal of modernization, he said, China would need
the unremitting efforts and hard struggle of several, perhaps a
dozen generations.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Gang cited this as the main reason for China's need of a
long-term international environment of peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
On China's foreign policy towards South Asia, the ambassador
said, China attaches great importance to the development of the
long-existed friendship and cooperation with South Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
It is China's sincere hope that all these countries become its
good neighbors, good friends and good partners, he said.
</P>
<P>
China not only wants to develop with them long-term and stable
relations of good-neighborliness and friendship towards the 21th
century, but also hopes that these countries treat one another on
an equal footing, live in harmony, develop friendly cooperation,
seek common ground while reserving differences, promote mutual
understanding and settle their differences and disputes through
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
On the nuclear tests conducted last May first by India and then
by Pakistan, the Chinese ambassador said, these tests aggravated
the tensions between India and Pakistan and provoked a nuclear
arms race in the region.
</P>
<P>
Peace and stability in South Asia and the world in general had
been seriously threatened and the international efforts at
realizing non-nuclear proliferation regime had been dealt a heavy
blow, Zhou Gang said.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Indian relations, the ambassador regretted that some
Indian leaders made groundless remarks about the so-called
"China's threat to India's security", which he said made relations
between the two countries abnormal.
</P>
<P>
The wanton attack and accusations against China had greatly
hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and vitiated the
atmosphere of the relations between China and India, which China
was unwilling to see, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese envoy expressed his hope that Sino-Indian relations
would overcome temporary difficulties and return to normal at the
earliest time possible.

MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) announced Thursday that it has approved a loan of 50 million
U.S. dollars for road rehabilitation in Kyrgyz Republic.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be used to rehabilitate a road which links the
capital of Bishkek with the country's second major city of Osh,
the Manila-based bank said.
</P>
<P>
The Bishkek-Osh road, which is sometimes closed in winter due
to unsafe conditions, runs through four of the country's six
regions and serves almost half the country's population.
</P>
<P>
The road, which is essential to the country's economy, is also
part of the transnational route linking Uzbekistan and Tajikistan
with Kazakstan, China and Russia's Siberia.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will provide a technical assistance grant of 600,000
dollars to help the government strengthen policy functions and the
financial management ability of the Transport Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Volvo to Close Assembly Plant in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Volvo Canada Ltd. will shut
its only auto assembly plant in Canada by the year-end, the
Financial Post newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Halifax assembly plant, which will close on
December 18, produces about 8,200 vehicles a year, small by North
American standards. Workers assemble the S70 sedan and V70 wagon
models from kits of parts shipped from its plants in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The move will cost 223 employees their jobs at the plant, and
force the company to give up its Canada-U.S. Auto Pact status.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the 1965 Auto Pact, the Canadian
subsidiaries of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., as well as Volvo AB, can import parts and completed
vehicles into Canada without paying the 6.3% import tax, as long
as they meet production and local parts spending targets.
</P>
<P>
The plant, the Swedish auto maker's only car manufacturing
operation in North America, is being closed in part because Volvo
has excess manufacturing capacity around the world and partly
because it is a so-called kit plant where parts shipped from
Europe are assembled into cars, which adds costs.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis Dampens German Exports to Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany saw its exports to Asia
drop sharply by 8 percent in the first half of this year due to
the Asian financial crisis, the German Federal Statistics Office
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Latest official data released by the office put German exports
to Asia in the first half year at 46.5 billion marks (27.1 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile German imports from Asia surged 11.8 percent to 60.2
billion marks (35.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The official data also showed that Japan and China remained the
most important trading partners of Germany in Asia, absorbing
almost one-third of German exports to the region and accounting
for over one half of German imports from Asia.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian crisis, Germany's total exports still rose
12.8 percent to 478 billion marks (278.6 billion dollars) in the
first half year. The first-half imports also grew by 12 percent to
410 billion marks (238.9 billion dollars), the report said.

<HEADLINE> HK Unit Trust Industry Witnesses Net Outflows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unit trust
industry witnessed net outflows of 66.5 million U.S. dollars in
the first seven months of this year due to large redemptions
recorded in various Asian funds.
</P>
<P>
However, the total would have been higher had it not been for
the robust inflows into European equity funds and bond funds, said
Desmond Chan, newly-appointed chairman of the Hong Kong Investment
Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
In the seven months, European and bond funds registered total
net inflows of about 250 million U.S. dollars, offsetting much of
the 326 million U.S. dollars in outflows registered by the six
Asian fund sectors, Chan told his first press conference in his
new capacity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of around 50 fund companies under the umbrella of the
HKIFA, Chan said the wide diversity of their products, spanning a
broad spectrum of markets and asset classes, has enabled them to
maintain much resilience in the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, the Jardine Fleming fund manager admitted that, as a
whole, most fund houses registered a drop in the asset size of
their authorized funds.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the HKIFA's plan for the coming year, Chan pointed
out that "to further boost the professional standards of the
investment management industry will be a key objective," with two
certificate courses on mandatory provident fund to be developed.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from providing training to the local industry
participants, we are working closely with the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) to provide training for the mainland
counterparts," Chan added.
</P>
<P>
He saw growing demand in China for fund professionals as the
Chinese fund market has undergone rapid development, with five
domestic funds already set up.
</P>
<P>
A two-week training program is now being held in Beijing for
mainland regulators and industry participants and the HKIFA has
provided support to the CSRC in organizing the course.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Steps Up Efforts to Ease Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
has earmarked 10 million HK dollars (1.28 million U.S. dollars) to
help school leavers participate in community service projects and
acquire useful experience before entering the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The money is specially for the Commission of Youth to implement
a community service program for school leavers and some 3,000
youngsters are expected to benefit from the scheme.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the fourth meeting of the Task Force on
Unemployment here Thursday, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said,
 "We hope that school leavers will make full use of these
opportunities to learn and develop their potential before joining
the workforce."
</P>
<P>
On accelerating public works and infrastructure projects,
participants in the meeting noted that the government had already
accelerated 21 projects worth a total of 5.9 billion HK dollars
(756.41 million U.S. dollars), which would advance the creation of
some 2,870 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also focused on discussing how best to promote the
tourist industry so as to generate more employment.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that there was a significant rebound
in visitor arrival figures in July this year, with some 833,000
tourists visiting Hong Kong, up 26.5 percent over July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said it is vitally important for Hong Kong to revive the
tourist industry, as it provides employment not only for the
hotel, aviation and travel industries, but also the retail,
catering, restaurant and transport sectors.
</P>
<P>
It provides the engine for job creation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Unemployment Rate Down in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Howard
Thursday welcomed the new released better than expected employment
figures which showed the unemployment rate in August fell to 8.1
percent from 8.3 in July.
</P>
<P>
While campaigning in regional Victoria for the October 3
election, Howard said, "I am very pleased that there has been a
significant rise in employment."
</P>
<P>
"The unemployment rate is down but we still have a long way to
go and that's why we need tax reform that will generate in the
longer term more jobs," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the coalition government received a major boost for
its election chances with the new figures confirming a record
number of Australians in work.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello hailed the first fall in the
unemployment rate in four months as good news for job seekers,
delivered by an economy standing up to the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Australia's peak social welfare group, the Australian
Council of Social Service, said unemployment remained a national
disgrace and economists warned of little further improvement over
the rest of 1998/99, with slower economic growth expected.
</P>
<P>
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures showed the number
of Australians with jobs rose by 13,200 in August to 8.6 million,
pushing down the July seasonally adjusted rate of 8.3 percent to
8.1.
</P>
<P>
"It's ... around the lowest levels of unemployment we've seen
in Australia for the last eight years since Labor's 1990
recession," Costello said.
</P>
<P>
But, according to the ABS figures, all the gain came from an
extra 15,500 new part-time jobs, mostly filled by women, while
full-time employment reversed slightly with the loss of 2,300
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said the government could take no
comfort from the figures and that the trend unemployment rate
meant no progress was being made.

WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr Wednesday sent the
House of Representatives what he deemed "substantial and credible"
evidence that may warrant the impeachment of President Clinton for
trying to illegally cover up his extramarital affair with Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton made a private apology to House of
Representatives Wednesday morning in the rarefied confines of the
White House residence. Six hours later he made a public apology in
the everyday surroundings of downtown Orlando hotel. Six hours
after that, in Miami, he did it again.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate resurrected an overhaul of the nation's campaign
finance laws, seven months after tossing the bill into the
legislative dust bin.
</P>
<P>
-- House Republican leaders said they would press for a tax cut
of up to 80 billion dollars over five years and pay for it by
dipping into budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Stocks swung down again amid renewed concern about President
Clinton's future and financial troubles abroad. The Dow Jones
industrials slid 155.76 points, or 1.94 percent, to 7865.02,
leaving stocks slightly down for the year. The worries helped to
drive up Treasury bond prices.
</P>
<P>
-- Aid to Kosovo was ordered by Clinton, but Serbia must grant
access before the 20 million dollars can reach an estimated
265,000 ethnic Albanian refugees. A U.N. aide said 25,000 refugees
are fleeing Serb attacks south of Pec. NATO estimated 50,000
troops may be needed to police any peace accord.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Share prices nose-dived on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday after consecutive rally in the
past three trading days.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) dropped 20.46 points to
865.00 as market sentiment was depressed by overnight decline on
Wall Street, weaker regional currencies and reported denial of any
share transfer agreement between the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
(KLSE) and the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES).
</P>
<P>
Total turnover was 403.17 million units valued at 232.96
million Singapore dollars (134.27 million U.S. dollars). There
were 217 decliners against 99 advancers while 271 counters were
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong remained the most active stock of the day as it
registered a volume of 25.25 million stocks traded. It was
followed by MBF Cap that had 15.86 million units done. M Res was
next with 14.02 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Shangri and Perlis were the top gainers of the day as both
edged up 11 cents. They closed at 1.62 and 1.36 Singapore dollars
respectively. Oriental was up 10 cents to finish at 1.70 Singapore
dollars. Hume inched up 9.5 cents to end at 0.61 Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, HL Ind was the biggest loser of the day as it
lost 78 cents to finish at 0.61 Singapore dollars. Bukit Sem,
Creative 50 and SPH all slid 50 cents to end at 5.50, 17.50 and
12.90 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia shares traded on CLOB, Singapore's over-the-counter
market, fell on jitters that the KLSE would not recognize the
transfer of shares to Malaysia' Central Depository.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the sell-off was triggered by a news report from
Malaysia, which cited KLSE as denying that it had reached any
agreement with SES on procedures or timing on the proposed
transfer of the Malaysian shares traded on CLOB.
</P>
<P>
The report contradicted Wednesday's report which said the KLSE
had agreed to accept all Malaysian shares bought on CLOB which
resumed Wednesday and would cease within a week.

"We have discussed with Arsenal Football Club plc a range of
ways in which our two companies could work together. These
discussions are at an early stage."
</P>
<P>
Most Arsenal shares are owned by directors of the club, with
only a minority of shares available on the open market.
</P>
<P>
The largest individual shareholder at Arsenal is one of the
directors, Danny Fiszman, a multi-millionaire.
</P>
<P>
But the highest-profile member of the board is vice-chairman
David Dein, formerly the largest shareholder, who still holds the
third biggest stake.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported that any deal would see Carlton buying
most of the stakes held by Dein and by chairman Peter Hill-Wood,
but Fiszman would keep most of his.

<P>
Arsenal have won the English championship 11 times, second
only to Liverpool, and last season won the Double of the
Premiership title and the FA Cup.

<HEADLINE> Trade Surplus Maintains Yuan Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese bank official
said today that China's continuing trade surplus has provided a
solid basis ensuring the stability of its currency, the Renminbi.
</P>
<P>
"The trade surplus, huge reserves of foreign exchange and
increasing exports have played a decisive role in maintaining the
stability of the yuan," according to Liu Mingkang, deputy governor
of the People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank. Liu made
the remarks at the ongoing Second China Investment and Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that China has achieved an annual trade
surplus of 30 billion U.S. dollars over the past few years, with
the trend continuing through the first seven months of this
year. China has achieved a foreign trade volume of 179.5 billion
U.S. dollars in spite of the financial crisis sweeping Asia, with
the surplus in the first half of this year rising by 26.6 percent
from the same 1997 period to 22.6 billion U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves stood at 140.5 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of June, 620 million U.S. dollars more
than last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
The growing momentum in export will continue through the end of
the year due to the adoption of a series of measures which have
included reducing costs, improving the product mix and exploring
various markets, according to sources from the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that China's total exports for the year will
hit 200 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liu Mingkang also mentioned other factors which have
contributed to keeping the Renminbi from being devalued, including
residents' increasing bank savings deposits, rational foreign debt
pattern, and inconvertibility of the Chinese currency.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Day in a Flood-Stricken Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Liu Aimei, a teacher, was
correcting her students' papers on a dyke surrounded by flood
waters. And her students were sitting reciting their lessons in
temporary tents.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, which damaged Liu's school and the students'
homes several weeks ago, flows behind them, still turbulent.
</P>
<P>
Today is China's 14th Teachers Day. The teachers and the
students from the Fifth Farm Primary School in Jiujiang County,
Jiangxi Province, have had to spend the holiday on the dyke.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of five teachers and some 60 students. They
have stayed on the dyke for one month. The rebuilding of their
homes will not start until the water level recedes back to normal.
</P>
<P>
"My home was there, but nobody can find it now," said Liu,
pointing to the surface of the water, some 50 meters away. "My
house was well constructed and decorated."
</P>
<P>
In early August, to ensure the security of a railway line and
an expressway nearby, a section of dyke was breached to divert the
floodwaters. Liu's home was on the unlucky dyke.
</P>
<P>
"Adjacent to my home was the school, which had a high
reputation in the region," said Liu, who has taught in the
countryside for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
When the floods came, Liu and her colleagues moved desks and
chairs to a secure place, but their own furniture was submerged by
the water.
</P>
<P>
As the new semester approached, tents provided by the army were
set up on the dyke as temporary classrooms, and the desks and
chairs were put to use.
</P>
<P>
Local officials had vowed that they would not let even one
student quit school because of the floods.
</P>
<P>
Every one of Liu's students has a new school bag and
stationery, which were donated by a Tianjin factory. Officials
were sent by army speedboat to the dyke to express holiday
greetings.
</P>
<P>
"Today is Teachers Day. I will send my teacher a paper boat
made with my own hands, hoping that our homes will never again be
flooded," said Pan Jie, a third-grade student.

<HEADLINE> New Telecom Services Open Between Beijing, Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Two new telecommunication
services which will greatly boost the quantity and speed of
digital data transmission between Beijing and Australia opened
today.
</P>
<P>
The "frame relay" and "integrated service digital network
(ISDN)" were jointly sponsored by Beijing Telecom and the
Australian telecom giant Telstra.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, the frame relay system, originating in
the early 1990s, is able to provide extra paths for sudden surges
in data transmission, and is ideal for inter-regional telecom
networks.
</P>
<P>
ISDN provides support for voice, data and video transmission
via a single telephone cord. It can be connected to telephones,
fax machines, data terminals and multimedia facilities, and allows
for videophone services, long-distance medical operations and
internet education.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Telecom has opened ISDN services with the United
States, Japan, Germany, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland and
Britain, as well as Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Within the
Chinese mainland, this system is used to connect the cities of
Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Senior Prosecutor Dismissed for Violating Party Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The top prosecutor of Tieling
City in Northeast China's Liaoning Province has been dismissed
from his post for breaking the rules of the Chinese Communist
Party on selecting and appointing officials, the Party's
Organization Department announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zhicheng, chief procurator of the People's Procuratorate of
the city, was also given a "severe" disciplinary warning by the
Party, according to the Organization Department.
</P>
<P>
It was found after investigations that Wu illegally promoted 23
officers without complying with related Party rules, just two days
after he heard that he was to be shifted to another post in June.
</P>
<P>
According to the Party rules and related legal procedures,
official promotions and demotions must be first discussed with
organizational departments of the Party, and then democratically
recommended by the public and investigated by the Party
organizations. Certain appointments must also be validated by
local legislatures.
</P>
<P>
Wu's wrongdoing was reported by the public to the Organization
Department.
</P>
<P>
His sudden announcement of the promotion of 23 officers was
declared invalid, and Wu himself was deprived of the position of
top prosecutor by the local legislature. Wu is also no longer on
the service rotation roll.

<P>
BONN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany's annual inflation rate
dropped to 0.8 percent in August, the lowest level since the
German reunification in 1990, the Federal Statistics Office
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest decline, which was attributable mainly to dropping
fuel prices, came after Germany registered the previous record low
inflation of 0.9 percent in July.

In a West-East breakdown, consumer prices in western Germany
increased only by 0.7 percent in August when compared with the

September 1987.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for eastern Germany also dropped for the
first time below one percent since 1991, with a reading of just
0.9 percent in August, the office said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East Peace
Envoy Dennis Ross Thursday briefed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on his latest talks with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was hold in Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem and
lasted only 45 minutes apparently due to the prime minister's
illness.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who has a flu, decided to meet Ross after an
improvement in his condition.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Netanyahu did not appear before reporters,
and Ross only said that the discussions between them were "useful".
</P>
<P>
Ross hold a three-hour meeting with Arafat Wednesday night
in a bid to narrow the differences between Israel and the
Palestinians over the second redeployment of Israeli troops in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz quoted diplomatic sources as saying that
the United States wants to begin drafting at least some aspects
of the second pullback.
</P>
<P>
And the daily noted that Ross, who began a new round of
mediation on Wednesday, was accompanied by U.S. State Department
legal advisor Jonathan Schwartz, who came with Ross to the region
in late 1996 and early 1997 to help draft the Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the Palestinians have agreed in principle to a
U.S. plan, which calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank in the next withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
But Israel proposed that 3 percent of the area be turned into
a nature reserve with building restrictions. But the Palestinians
stressed that they rejected any changes in the U.S. initiative.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: National Debate on Signing CTBT Intensifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- With the national debate on
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) heightening, both experts
and opposition parliamentarians in Pakistan agree in principle on
signing the treaty because it will not impair the country's
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has
decided to hold an exhaustive debate in the parliament before
taking any decision on the issue. The parliament in its joint
sitting on Friday will begin its discussion on CTBT.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in the supremacy of the parliament and want
democratic debate on vital national issues," said Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain Sayed.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parliamentarians and experts on international
affairs have almost reached consensus on the one point that
Pakistan should sign CTBT.
</P>
<P>
There might be divergence of opinions on when to sign or under
what conditions, but they seem to be coming around that Pakistan
should seize the initiative in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The treaty simply stops the member states from conducting
nuclear tests and it does not discriminate between the nuclear
club or the non-nuclear states, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Signing CTBT would not damage what we have achieved as it puts
ban on conducting nuclear tests," said former foreign minister
Aseff Ahmed Ali.
</P>
<P>
He called for signing CTBT before India, saying that it will
help the country overcome present economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The politicians who are against the signing, are doing so
because of their poor understanding of the treaty, said the
experts, adding that "it does not stop you from developing your
delivery system."
</P>
<P>
Both defense analysts and parliamentarians have suggested
Pakistan can take its own decision on issues of importance and it
is not necessarily to link its decisions with India's.
</P>
<P>
"We are mature enough and should take our initiative
independently without waiting for the Indian decision on the
issue," said Ahmed Mukhtar, secretary general of the Pakistan
People's Party (PPP).
</P>
<P>
"I think Pakistan should have signed it immediately after
testing nuclear devices (in May). We would have got diplomatic
advantage," said Dr. Shireen Mazari, a leading defense expert.
</P>
<P>
If Pakistan had signed CTBT soon after its nuclear tests the
international community would have been put on the defensive and
imposition of sanctions on Pakistan would have become difficult,
she said.
</P>
<P>
If Pakistan signs CTBT, it will not affect its nuclear status,
she said, because under CTBT there is no verification procedure
and no one can come and inspect Pakistan's nuclear installations.
</P>
<P>
Naiz Naik, former foreign secretary, said Pakistan should not
put its signature on CTBT without getting anything in return.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan should demand lifting of "economic sanctions
and an economic bailout" before signing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan should not sign it unless we are assured of economic
and political security by the major powers including the United
States," he observed.
</P>
<P>
However, Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf made it clear on
Thursday at a weekly news briefing that Pakistan would not sign
the CTBT unless entire ambiance of coercion was removed.
</P>
<P>
"Until entire atmosphere of coercion is not removed, we will
not sign CTBT," he declared.
</P>
<P>
The removal of coercive sanctions would lead Pakistan to
consider the signing of the global accord banning nuclear tests,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Taliban Blamed for Iran's Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran Thursday criticized
Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban group for dragging on forming and
dispatching a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan to see into the
fate of its missing nationals.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said the delay by
Pakistan and the Taliban in sending the mission to investigate the
whereabouts of its diplomats and reporter raises questions.
</P>
<P>
The statement reiterated that the Iranian government holds the
Taliban and its supporters responsible for the ensuing crisis and
its consequences.
</P>
<P>
Iran accuses Taliban of abducting 11 diplomats and a reporter
of the official news agency IRNA last month when the group
captured Mazari Sherif in the north of Afghanistan, a stronghold
of the Afghan opposition Northern Alliance backed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, widely believed to have been supported by
Pakistan, rejects Iran's accusation.
</P>
<P>
Iran calls on the Taliban and its supporters to avoid any
conduct which might further deteriorate the situation and show
sincerity in assuming responsibility, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published on the Iran News daily Thursday,
Pakistani Ambassador in Tehran Javid Husain said that Islamabad is
not responsible for what has happened in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan "should not be held responsible for what has happened
in Afghanistan," Husain said, adding that "Afghanistan is an
independent country and accordingly we have no policy of
interfering in the Afghan internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan has assured Iran that it would spare no
efforts to help Tehran find a satisfactory solution to the issue
and has fully cooperated in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Bank Governor Blames Student Rally for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian student rally
foiled a government plan to begin easing its tight monetary
policy, Antara News Agency Thursday quoted central bank chief as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Following the student protest action demanding lowering of food
prices and the replacement of President B.J. Habibie's government
this week, the rupiah depreciated to nearly 12,000 to the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts by Bank Indonesia to strengthen the rupiah have
really been hampered by the student unrest," Bank Indonesia chief
Syahril Sabirin said.
</P>
<P>
After lingering at weak levels against the U.S. dollar for many
months, the rupiah climbed to the 10,000 level last week and
stayed under the 11,000 level until Tuesday, when it began to fall
again.
</P>
<P>
It was trading Thursday at 11,700-11,800 to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
When the rupiah strengthened to 10,650 against the U.S. dollar
last week, Syahril said, the government was beginning to think of
taking steps to ease its tight monetary policy but the student
demonstration prompted it to put off its plan.
</P>
<P>
Students in Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, Bandung and other
cities this week held rallies to protest the spiraling prices of
the basic commodities. They urged President Habibie to take
concrete measures to resolve the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Over the past couple of weeks, rice prices have sharply
increased to about 5,000 rupiah (0.45 U.S. dollar) per kilogram,
compared with the Indonesian government target price of 2,000
rupiah per kilogram.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Launch New Maneuver Near Afghan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Amid growing tension between
Tehran and the Afghan Taliban militia, Iran announced on Thursday
to launch another grand maneuver on the country's eastern border
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"The annual Zolfaqar military maneuver will be carried out soon
in the eastern border areas," the army's chief of staff Ali
Shahbazi announced to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi did not mention the date and place of the maneuver,
but said that the maneuver would be unprecedented in terms of its
scope and variety of operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the order for the maneuver has been issued and the
necessary forces have been stationed in the region during the past
month.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying how many troops would be involved in the
war games, the army's chief of staff said that the latest
innovations by Iranian experts would be showcased in the
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
He said the army's ground force would bear the brunt of the
maneuver and would utilize its elite forces, armored, mechanized
and artillery units with the support by the army's airborne
division and the airforce.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver will be the second one on Iran's eastern border
following the tension between Iran and the Taliban, who was
accused of kidnaping 11 Iranian diplomats and an IRNA reporter
from Mazari Sharif, northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps
(IRGC) launched a ground-breaking maneuver with participation of
70,000 troops near the Afghanistan border to give a warning to
the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC deployed the troops and equipment involved in the
maneuver along the border with Afghanistan, and rumors widely
spread said that Tehran would launch a strike on the Taliban if
the group failed to give a "satisfactory answer" about the
missing Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi stated that the Iranian army under the command of the
Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
would carry out its duties in defending the territorial integrity
of the country and in guaranteeing the national security
regardless of the big powers threats.
</P>
<P>
It is Iran's natural and legal right to employ all the
resources and capabilities to guarantee the national security
and to defend the rights of its citizens, he said.

<HEADLINE> EU, Vietnam Sign New Textile Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam can now export more
textile products to the European Union while the union member
states enjoy a tariff cut on their exports to the Asian country
after the two sides signed a new textile agreement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral agreement, covering the period from this year to
2000 and signed by European Commission Vice-President Sir Leon
Brittan and Vietnamese Trade Minister Truong Dinh Tuyen, took 22
categories of Vietnamese products off the quota limitation while
in the 29 categories where quotas remain Vietnam can export almost
a third more.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union will enjoy a 2-percentage-point reduction
in Vietnamese tariffs on a range of textile and clothing products
while 3 to 5 percentage points more will be further reduced on
tariffs for the period between 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, already in force since the beginning of the
year, also guarantees that there be no discrimination in the
allocation of quotas against EU companies involved in
joint-venture programs.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement supersedes an old one signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
EU-Vietnam trade experienced increases in the first eight
months of this year when EU imports from Vietnam were up by 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
EU imports from Vietnam in 1997 were worth 2.2 billion ecus
(2.4 billion U.S. dollars) while EU exports to Vietnam were 1.1

injured in clashes with Anderlecht fans during a Belgian first
division soccer match against Club Bruges on Wednesday, police
said.
</P>

Police, who had cordoned off the main entrance and gates for
visiting Bruges fans, used water cannon to disperse the crowds.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Art That Ticks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to an ongoing
timepiece fair in Hong Kong may find it hard to tell what the
exhibits are: art work of splendid flair or some commonplace in
unexpected forms.
</P>
<P>
Camper, Fire Alarm, Diving, Cycle, Orienteering, Survival, and
Kid Time. All these themes, each representing a certain function
or purpose, prefix one same thing -- a watch or a clock.
</P>
<P>
Other watches and clocks are more romantically hued -- After
Dusk, Two Linked Hearts, Hand in Hand, Tulip, or Lonely Star. Such
chronographs certainly go well with fashion.
</P>
<P>
A few have come from the hands of abstractionists, or possibly
fans of high technology -- the name "9805130930SQ" could stand for
either a date or an alias on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating imaginative endowment of their designers, some
watches have virtually entered the realm of art, especially those
presented in the exhibition's debut section, "Premier Watches of
the World," which features more than 40 prestigious brands of the
world.
</P>
<P>
One Piaget design embedded with 146 granules of diamond along a
heart-shaped frame, plays to the full the grace and nobility of
the rare pink sapphire.
</P>
<P>
The days when watches were luxuries are gone. They are no mere
time meters either. While analog quartz watches remain the
mainstream of Hong Kong's timepiece industry, watches are emerging
as a fad item and a darling of youngsters, organizers say.
</P>
<P>
Timepieces are going multi-functional, particularly for the
sports purposes -- compass, thermometer, calendar, world timer and
countdown device. They are even expected to play the roles of
electronic game player, digital diary, tone dialer, pager or
mobile phone in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Watch and Clock Fair is one of the world's major
events in timepiece trade. This year's event, running from
September 9-13, has attracted a record number of 811 exhibitors
from 15 countries and regions, up from 779 exhibitors in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total exports of watches and clocks, including
parts and components, in 1997 amounted to 47 billion HK dollars (6
billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 2 percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The overall export of timepieces in Hong Kong has remained
steady this year despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis
thanks to the increasing demand of major markets such as the
United States and some European Union nations, according to the
organizers.

<HEADLINE> Trimble-Adams Direct Talks Ends in Belfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland First
Minister David Trimble and Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams ended
their first direct talks on Thursday, the first direct encounter
between Irish republican and pro-British unionist leaders since
1922.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the 80-minute meeting in Belfast, Trimble said
the meeting had been "civilized" and Adams characterized it as
"good and constructive."
</P>
<P>
"When I came in, I said I had hoped...that we would have a good
meeting, and we had," Adams was quoted as saying by Reuters. "I
put it to Mr. Trimble that he and I had been cast in this position
and we had to narrow the gap. We had to try (to find) ways of me
helping him and him helping me."
</P>
<P>
Trimble said the meeting was "workmanlike" but problems
remained between himself and Adams.
</P>
<P>
"It is an inevitable fact of involvement in politics here and
in Westminster that you have to meet and work with a range of
people and they are not all angels," Trimble told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Adams said before the meeting that the meeting was
important. "A journey of a thousand miles starts with one step. So
the development of common ground, of a shared future, and a shared
responsibility for that future, has to start with one meeting."
</P>
<P>
"We will seek certainly to build and to move forward and all
the time keep very, very focused on the prize, which is freedom
and justice," he said.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Trapped David's Deer to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 head of David's
deer, which have been trapped on an isolated island by floods for
about 70 days, will return to their homes in the Tian'erzhou
David's Deer Nature Reserve near Shishou City, in central China's
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Most of the deer have survived the floods, and three baby deer
were born during the period. However, about a dozen have gone
missing in the floods, according to the staff of the nature
reserve.
</P>
<P>
A David's deer has the antlers of a deer, the head of a horse,
the body of a cow and the tail of a donkey. The animal used to be
a rare breed native to China until the early years of the 20th
century, when Westerners invaded China and took the remaining deer
abroad. Now, there are about 2,000 David's deer scattered in more
than 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, China brought some deer back to their original home
and raised them near Beijing as well as in Jiangsu and Hubei
provinces. The Tian'erzhou David's Deer Nature Reserve, covering
about 1,600 ha was set up in 1995 near the old course of the
Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
This summer, about 130 deer broke through the fences of the
reserve and fled to a narrow dyke in nearby Chaima Village, when
the nature reserve was ravaged by floods.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by water, the deer were threatened by hunger. But
staff and workers of the reserve risked their lives to transport
5,000 kg of fresh waterweed and 300 kg of fodder to the dyke by
boat.
</P>
<P>
On August 8, the US-based International Society for the
Protection of Animals donated 50,000 US dollars for food for the
deer. The Hubei Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau also
allocated 200,000 yuan for the deer.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the abating floods, the dyke which was the last
protection for the deer, started to collapse on August 26. At this
moment, about 100 PLA soldiers came to reinforce the dyke and the
situation was put under control.
</P>
<P>
Now, as the floods have receded, the deer will be returned to
the nature reserve, but it will take another month for their
staple food, waterweed, to grow again in the flood area.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that this year's floods were a big challenge to
the David's deer, for they had only just adapted themselves to
living in the wild.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Hubei Provincial Environmental Protection
Bureau said that the construction of anti-flood facilities in the
nature reserve, which estimated to cost six million yuan, is now
being planned, so that the reserve will be safe enough for the
deer.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ends Transport Ministers Meeting in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Transport Ministers
ended their two-day fourth meeting here Thursday after signing an
agreement on mutual recognition of vehicle inspection certificates
and endorsing a framework agreement on cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Communications Mah Bow Tan told a press
conference at the end of the meeting that the Agreement on the
Recognition of Commercial Vehicle Inspection Certificates of Goods
and Public Service Vehicles by ASEAN member countries will
facilitate cross-border movement of such vehicles.
</P>
<P>
With the agreement, public service and goods vehicle operators
from ASEAN member countries will no longer be required to send
their vehicles for inspection checks before they enter another
ASEAN member country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Mah Bow Tan said the ministers also endorsed the ASEAN
Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit which
will be signed at the ASEAN summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, on December
15 and 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to have a separate ASEAN Framework Agreement
on the Facilitation of Inter-State Transport and directed senior
transport officials to target the conclusion and the operation of
the accord by year 2000, Mah Bow Tan added.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the key objective of the ASEAN
Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit is to
facilitate the movement of goods in transit among ASEAN countries
by simplifying all transit transport procedures and requirements
and minimizing unnecessary delays or restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Mah Bow Tan said the ministers also exchanged views on current
transport issues in ASEAN and in particular, on the impact of the
current economic downturn in the ASEAN transport sector.
</P>
<P>
They held a common view that there is urgency to enhance the
region's economic competitiveness through closer cooperation and
agreed to explore various areas for cooperation although concrete
consensus on a series of issues has yet to be reached, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mah Bow Tan said the ministers expressed confidence that the
long-term prospects for the region remain positive although the
present crisis has dampened demand for transport services and
created adverse employment dislocations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Asian Games Entries Plummeting Due to Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of athletes and
officials registration for the 13th Asian Games falls far below
the expected 10,000 because of the deepening economic woes.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee
(BAGOC) said Thursday that the BAGOC was leaving open the
registration date for individual events in the hope of attracting
more entries.
</P>
<P>
The official, who did not give his name, said billiards and
carom, two of the cue sports events which are making a debut at
the Asian Games, are heading for cancellation due to fewer
entries.
</P>
<P>
The number of countries participating in the two events is
less than the required figure of five. Under Asian Games
regulations, a competition cannot be held if the number of teams
is less than five.
</P>
<P>
Besides the host, the only two other countries to confirm
entry in the billiards event are India and Malaysia. The four
countries interested in taking part in carom are India, South
Korea, Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
While billiards and carom have attracted only three and four
teams respectively, pool reached the required figure, but only
just.
</P>
<P>
Snooker is comparatively better off with 10 countries and
regions confirming participation. Last month's Asian Snooker
Championship in Pakistan had players from 18 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
The football competition also seems certain to fall short of
the expected number of 32 teams. So far, confirmed entries for
this event is 27.
</P>
<P>
The BAGOC's technical committee revealed on Wednesday that in
all 40 countries and regions will send athletes to compete in the
Games' events However, the number of countries and regions taking
part in individual events was a disappointing 25.
</P>
<P>
Japan will send a total of 635 athletes, the highest among the
participating delegations.
</P>
<P>
Brunei, Palestine and Afghanistan have yet to say whether they
will take part. The technical committee has not received any
correspondence from the three countries.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's UMNO Youth Chief Refuses to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ruling United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) Youth chief Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
said Thursday that he will not resign from the post and will leave
it to the UMNO Supreme Council to decide his position in the
movement.
</P>
<P>
A special meeting of the UMNO Youth executive committee here
Thursday unanimously resolved that his position in the movement be
decided by party president Mahathir Mohamad who is the country's
prime minister, Ahmad Zahid told reporters at a brief press
conference after chairing a five-hour meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Zahid is known as a strong supporter of former Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim who was ousted
from the cabinet and expelled from UMNO of which he was the deputy
president last week.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Zahid had earlier been pressured by UMNO Youth leaders
from the state and divisional levels "to resign honorably" for
failing to express the movement's support for Anwar's expulsion
and for being frequently in the former deputy prime minister's
house.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot force me to resign, I will not resign from the
post," Ahmad Zahid said, adding that he would not step down as he
was elected by the delegates and in line with the UMNO
constitution and regulations he could not be dismissed from the
post.
</P>
<P>
"If any among the committee members are not happy with my
remaining as head of the movement, then they will have to wait for
the party president to make a decision on my position," he said.

PHNOM PENH, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Demonstrations and
protests against the government were still going on in Phnom Penh
Thursday despite the government's ban.
</P>
<P>
One person was seriously wounded in clashes between police and
protesters.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, police scuffled with hundreds of
demonstrators around the U.S. Embassy in a chaotic chase, which
ended with shootings.
</P>
<P>
The protesters played a game of cat and mouse with the police.
Several times they were dispersed by the police, then gathered
again at another place. The protesters used slingshots and threw
stones at policemen.
</P>
<P>
For the last few days, riot police have been patroling the city
in trucks, appealing to people "not to join in demonstrations
which destabilize the country," but their words did not seem to
have much effect.
</P>
<P>
It was reported here that the opposition leader Sam Rainsy on

JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- International Amateur

back here at accusations that he had undermined the athletics
program at the Commonwealth Games by holding the World Cup athleti

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Nebiolo said: "The reality is
not that we decided to stage the World Cup at the same time as
the Commonwealth Games but that the Commonwealth Games decided to
stage their games at the same time as our World Cup.

"It was a great mistake by the Commonwealth Games to try and

acceptable."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin Thursday sent a letter to the State Duma nominating acting
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov for the third nominee for prime
minister to be endorsed.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken following the meeting among Yeltsin,
acting prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and deputy of Communist
Party faction in Duma Yuri Maslyukov Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is believed to be a figure acceptable to all
factions in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said he welcomed the
president's decision.
</P>
<P>
"This is the most reasonable decision, and Primakov will
undoubtedly receive the support of the State Duma," he said.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov described Primakov as a person with enormous
experience who is known throughout the world and capable of
forming an efficient cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to the speaker, the State Duma is ready to consider
the candidacy of Primakov at a plenary session on Saturday or
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Federation Council Yegor Stroyev said the
candidacy of Primakov "was a very correct nomination."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who was rejected twice in the State Duma, asked
Yeltsin on Thursday not to nominate him for the third time,saying
that he did not intend to become prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's decision to submit a new candidate averted a
possible dissolution of the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution, if the nomination for premier
is rejected three times by the State Duma, the president will have
to dissolve the Duma and hold the elections ahead of time.

The benchmark All Ordinaries index closed 16.2 points down at
2,526.3 but pulled itself back from an intra-day low of 2,516.5.

Jones.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the Australian market had anticipated the Dow

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The first dinosaur
fossil to be found in Namibia was uncovered by geologists at the
Waterberg National Park, The University of the Witwatersrand
reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton from the early Jurassic period was discovered by
geologists and paleontologists from the Universities of
Liverpool, Witwatersrand and Wuerzburg in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The skeleton was preserved in 208 million-year-old sandstone
and was discovered in rocks exposed in a park, which has now been
nicknamed "Jurassic Park".
</P>
<P>
The skeleton discovered was one of the oldest known dinosaurs,
Massospondylus, a plant-eating animal about six meters long.
</P>
<P>
It is accepted that dinosaurs roamed this Palaeo-desert region
of Namibia millions of years ago as footprints have discovered
higher up in the dune sands.
</P>
<P>
The latest discovery was important as it refined the link of
the Godwana continent and the understanding of how the continents
were once together and then seperated, professor Bruce Rubidge of
Witwatersrand University said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan U.N. Reentry Proposal Doomed to Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The proposed resolution
submitted by a small group of countries including Nicaragua, which
supports Taiwan's reentry into the United Nations, is doomed to
failure, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu commented on the motion during today's regularly scheduled
press conference, describing it as "unpopular."
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations is an international
intergovernmental organization composed of sovereign states and
that Taiwan, a province of China, lacks qualification necessary
for U.N. membership.
</P>
<P>
The issue of representation of China in the United Nations was
thoroughly resolved by political and legal procedures completed as
early as the 26th U.N. General Assembly which passed Resolution
2758, said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is unpopular that a small number of
countries including Nicaragua has once again tabled the motion to
support Taiwan's "reentry into the United Nations," an act that
contradicts the purpose and principles of the U.N. Charter, is in
open defiance of the will of the vast majority of U.N. member
states and wantonly interferes in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The General Committee of the U.N. General Assembly has refused
to accept similar resolutions for five consecutive years and this
attempt is once again doomed to failure this year, said Zhu.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Moves Up in Asia in Human Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepal moved up by two
positions to rank 152nd this year in terms of human development
among 174 countries and regions included in the U.N. Human
Development Report 1998, but it remained second to Bhutan from the
bottom in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference organized here Thursday by the
U.N. Development Program (UNDP), Shankar Sharma from the National
Planning Commission of Nepal said trends in human development in
Nepal show that the progress has been fastest especially during
the period of 1992-95.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the human development index, which measures
a country's achievements in terms of life expectancy, educational
attainment and adjusted real income, increased at a rate of 7.2
percent per annum in Nepal compared with an annual average of 2.3
percent during 1960-92, Sharma noted.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the Human Development Report, he said Nepal's
average life expectancy has increased by approximately eight
months annually within the last 20 years, but those in Canada and
Singapore are 41 percent and 38 percent higher respectively than
Nepal's.
</P>
<P>
Despite rapid progress in education in Nepal, the education
index is only about one-half of the average for developing
countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The overall situation of human development index and
gender-related development index is also low in Nepal," he added.
</P>
<P>
This year's human development report, the ninth of its kind,
examines consumption from the perspective of human development.
</P>
<P>
Sharma said the average protein consumption per person is 60
grams per day in Nepal compared with an average of 65 grams a day
in the developing countries and 85 grams in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
However, Nepal lies well above the average among the developing
countries in the supply of cereals per person per year, he noted,
adding that its per-capita average daily supply of calories is
also at a comfortable level.
</P>
<P>
In terms of health indicators, Nepal's position is very poor.
</P>
<P>
The country ranks top among the developing countries in
cigarette consumption. On average a Nepalese smokes 341 cigarettes
per year as against the annual average of 160 in the developing
countries and 64 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"Per-capita cigarette consumption has more than doubled in
Nepal during the last 20 years," Sharma said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in terms of communication and information access,
Nepal is below the average for the developing countries and the
situation is similar in energy consumption including electricity.
</P>
<P>
Henning Karcher, UNDP's resident representative and U.N.
resident coordinator in Nepal, attributed Nepal's deficiencies in
human development index to poverty.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the programs of UNDP focus on poverty alleviation in
the country, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Primakov, a career
diplomat whose service spanned the Soviet and Russian times, was
nominated by President Boris Yeltsin as the country's prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is seen as a figure acceptable to all factions in the
State Duma, or lower house of parliament, which is likely to
confirm the nomination quickly.
</P>
<P>
Born in Kiev on October 29, 1929, Primakov graduated from the
Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Fluent in English and Arabic, Primakov had worked as a
correspondent for the State Gosteleradio Committee handling radio
and television broadcasting under the Soviet Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
In 1962-1970, he worked as a columnist, a deputy editor and a
correspondent for the national daily Pravda, an official newspaper
of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
For the following seven years Primakov served as a deputy
director of the Institute of the World Economy and International
Relations, a think-tank under the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
In 1977-1985, he was director of the Institute of Oriental
Studies, also under the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Since November of 1985, Primakov had been director of the
Institute of the World Economy and International relations.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed director of the Central Intelligence Service

<HEADLINE> Estrada: No Deal With Imelda on Victim Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Thursday that nothing definite yet has been
reached between the government and the Marcos family on
compensation to victims of human rights abuses during Ferdinand
Marcos' rule.
</P>
<P>
"That's still nothing. It is still verbal. There has been no
official offer yet so we can not gauge whether or not the offer is
genuine or not," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks one day after he described
Imelda Marcos' reported offer of 150 million U.S. dollars as "too
small" to compensate about 10,000 claimants who suffered during
former President Marcos' 20-year rule of the country.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he believes the former first lady's offer, if
true, would not be enough to pay for the damages claimed by the
victims.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added that it would be too premature to respond
to a supposed offer which Imelda has proposed only through the
media.
</P>
<P>
Imelda was quoted by the media as saying she was offering 150
million dollars to the victims who allegedly suffered abuses
during her late husband's rule, "out of compassion, not guilt."
</P>
<P>
However, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Thursday in a
radio interview that Imelda informed him that she did not make any
offer at all to compensate the victims.
</P>
<P>
Marcos fled to Hawaii, the United States, in a popular revolt
in 1986 and died there three years later.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 students
demonstrated near the presidential palace here Thursday in protest
of soaring prices and urged President B.J. Habibie to bring former
President Soeharto to justice.
</P>
<P>
The students also urged Habibie to take concrete measures to
solve the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The students gathered at the National Monument Park at about 10
a.m. and tried to approach the Merdeka Palace. However, security
officers blocked their way when they arrived at the Gambir railway
station near the palace.
</P>
<P>
The Merdeka presidential palace and the state palace were under
heavy guard. At least five military vehicles and four armor
vehicles were seen guarding the streets surrounding the two
palaces.
</P>
<P>
It was the second rally in the capital after thousands of
students staged an anti-government rally at the House of
Representatives here Monday, expressing their distrust of the
capability of the government to lower price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Student protests have also spread to other big cities.
</P>
<P>
At least 17 people were injured during clashes between riot
police and thousands of demonstrating students and workers during
a one-day visit by Habibie to the country's second largest city of
Surabaya on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Semarang, capital of Central Java Province, more than 1,000
students of state-run Diponegoro University Wednesday marched to

<P>
About 200 students Wednesday also held a peaceful demonstration
at the Sunan Kalijaga Institute of Islamic Studies campus in

<HEADLINE> Traditional Chinese Medicine Enjoys Bright Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A group of foreign medical
experts have recently pointed to the bright future for Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM).
</P>
<P>
Experts from 16 countries are currently attending the Shanxi
International Acupuncture Training Class in Taiyuan, capital of
north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
They noted that safe, convenient and inexpensive TCM promotes
improved health. The experts agreed that TCM enjoys boundless
prospects and will enjoy a prominent position in the world's
medical circles in the next century.
</P>
<P>
TCM has a long history and was introduced to various Asian and
European countries as early as the sixth Century.
</P>
<P>
One Chilean expert said that it is simply a matter of time
before the majority of foreign countries will accept TCM and he
predicted a bright future for related products and applications.
He also noted that the Unites States has approved the use TCM.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish expert, who has studied TCM for 10 years, said that
he and his colleagues have successfully used acupuncture
applications for rehabilitation programs, as well as an anesthetic
and for the treatment of hemiplegia and sterility.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts from Zimbabwe, Palestine and Iraq noted that
the cost of the TCM is low and TCM applications are both safe and
easy to use. They also pointed to the vast potential market for
TCM in underdeveloped countries. TCM is readily suited to economic
and social conditions in related countries, according to the
experts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, foreign medical experts spoke highly of the nontoxic
properties of TCM and the lack of related adverse side effects.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's visit to Russia has been postponed, South
African and Russian foreign ministries said in a joint statement
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The governments of South Africa and the Russian Federation
have mutually agreed to postpone Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's
visit to Moscow to a later date," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"New dates for the visit will be announced in due course," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's visit was originally scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, South African Foreign
Ministry spokesman Marco Boni refused to say that the
postponement was due to the political turmoil in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Boni only said: "Both sides believe that the time for the
visit is not opportune."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Mbeki was first invited to visit
Moscow by Viktor Chernomyrdin when he was prime minister. The
invitation was then taken over by Sergei Kiriyenko, who was
sacked by Russian President Boris Yeltsin on August 23.
</P>
<P>
"It was a long-standing invitation," Boni said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to say whether the visit will be made immediately
after the political turmoil ends in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's nomination as prime minister has been rejected
twice by the State Duma (lower house of parliament). On
Thursday, Yeltsin nominated Acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov as prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Banks Asked to Reach Lending Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday asked banking institutions to achieve
the 8-percent lending growth target for this year to finance an
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
These institutions have sufficient funds to finance economic
activities and must achieve the 8-percent lending growth target
set by Bank Negara (State Bank) for this year, Mahathir, who is
also first finance minister, told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
"Banks will have to try to achieve this 8-percent target. If
they don't they are not doing their duty as a banker," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara earlier pegged loans growth at 15 percent for the
whole 1998.
</P>
<P>
"But bankers reacted badly and did not lend any money so much
so that credit growth was only at 3 percent," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that since these bankers had a tough time in
achieving the 15-percent target, the central bank has reduced it
to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank Negara Wednesday announced that banks should lend more and
achieve a loans growth of 8 percent by the end of 1998 in an
effort to finance the economic recovery, asking those banks which
fail to meet the target to explain to it.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also expressed confidence that the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange will strengthen over time with prices reflecting the true
value of companies despite its volatility early this week.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mahathir also announced the
appointment of Salomon Smith Barney, an international financial
consultancy company, as financial adviser to his government.

<HEADLINE> Twin Giant Pandas Born in Sichuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Twin giant pandas were born
at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Base in southwest China's
Sichuan Province today, bringing the total number of newborn at
the base to five this year.
</P>
<P>
The two pandas weigh 140 grams and 58 grams. This was the
fourth time that 13-year-old giant panda Cheng Cheng has become
mother. Both the mother and baby pandas are in good shape,
according to sources at the base.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the panda base said that giant pandas become
pregnant once a year and deliver one or two babies. Cheng Cheng
became pregnant this spring through artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Base is the only place in China
conducting special research on giant pandas. The base is located
in the northern suburbs of Chengdu, and covers more than 30
hectares.
</P>
<P>
China first successfully bred giant panda through artificial
insemination in 1963. Now, the base can help about 80 percent of
the artificially inseminated giant pandas become pregnant and
deliver babies.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the giant panda species, all of the
naturally inseminated giant pandas at the base are capable of
bearing children.
</P>
<P>
There are approximately 1,000 giant pandas in Sichuan Province,
and northwestern China's Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, with 80
percent living in Sichuan, home of the giant panda.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Reduction Program to Benefit Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Pollution levels in Taihu
Lake, China's fourth largest freshwater lake, are expected to
fall dramatically by the end of this year when 257 factories in
Zhejiang Province fulfill their pledge to halt discharges of
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Zhejiang People's Congress
revealed that related factories were major polluters in the
Zhejiang section of the lake. However, the factories have actively
installed wastewater treatment facilities, with nearly half of the
enterprises having already completed transformation projects.
</P>
<P>
Taihu covers 2,425 sq.km. in the central part of the of Yangtze
River Delta. The lake, which borders Jiangsu and Zhejiang
provinces, two economic powerhouses in east China, has been
subject to serious pollution resulting from inappropriate human
activities.
</P>
<P>
National plans call for the lake to be free of pollutants by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, an area covering a third of the Taihu Lake Valley,
has invested 220 million yuan in pollution treatment projects, and
has adopted a series of measures to implement the national plan.
</P>
<P>
The province ordered 257 factories discharging pollutants at
levels higher than state standards to fully comply with national
requirements by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Factories adding pollution control facilities will be eligible
for funding of some 30
million yuan and will enjoy lower land rental fees and
tax rates, as well as ample supplies of power and low interest
loans.
</P>
<P>
A sewerage treatment system is currently under construction
along the Grand Canal which runs through the Taihu Lake Valley.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Scientists Discuss Urban Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 environment
scientists from leading Chinese and British research institutions
have gathered here to discuss the urban environment and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British Workshop on Urban Environmental Enhancement and
Sustainable Development, jointly sponsored by the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE) and Britain's
University College London, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhihong, vice-president of the CAS, told the conclave that
China has witnessed a rapid urbanization process in recent years,
as well as increasingly serious environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
British scientists have rich experience in this field, from which
China may learn, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
China and Britain share many urban development pollution
problems, said Tim Biscoe, vice-president of University College
London, adding that scientists from both sides may look for
scientific solutions and practical approaches to the problems
together.
</P>
<P>
Martin Davidson, cultural counselor of the British Embassy,
said this workshop enhances the close relationship between Britain
and China in the environmental area, and will assist China in
dealing with some of its most pressing environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
At present, these problems include air pollution caused by
smoke and car emissions, contamination of groundwater, water
shortages, noise pollution, and urban garbage.
</P>
<P>
Scientists of the two countries will exchange views on these
problems, and are expected to carry out further cooperative
projects in fields that are of interest to both sides.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Earth Temperature to Rise 1.2 Degrees in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- According to the latest
findings by a Sino-U.S. joint research team, the average surface
temperature of the Earth may rise by 1.2 degrees in the next 50
years, and this century has been the warmest in 500 years.
</P>
<P>
Huang Shaopeng, a Chinese scientist working in the United
States, said here that these calculations are based on an analysis
of the underground temperature measurements of 358 bore holes
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The research program was launched jointly by Henry N. Pollack,
chairman of the International Heat Flow Commission and professor
at the University of Michigan in the U.S., and Huang, a former
research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's top
scientific research body.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. "Geotimes" magazine reported the discovery in the
cover story of its latest issue. and the U.S. "Science" magazine
has decided to cover this research in its coming issues.
</P>
<P>
Huang came here to the capital of southwest China's Guizhou
Province to attend a national geological science symposium.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists believe that the changing global temperature may
have great impact on human life, and could lead to a series of
disasters.
</P>
<P>
Ye Duzheng, a leading scholar at the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said a rise in the Earth's temperature of even one
degree could give rise to the evaporation of more surface water,
faster of glacier melting, and rising sea levels.
</P>
<P>
He said present-day subsurface temperatures may also provide
evidence of temperature changes that have occurred in the past.
</P>
<P>
He added that subsurface temperatures depend on geothermal
flows deep within the earth, and on surface temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that annual changes of surface temperatures are
recorded on crust rocks at a depth of 15 meters, and changes
dating back 1,000 years are found in rocks about 500 meters
underground.
</P>
<P>
Huang said scientists can infer surface temperatures of the
past by analysing subsurface temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Huang described the bore holes as a "thermometer" inserted into
the "body" of the earth by scientists.
</P>
<P>
Global climatic changes has become a frontier research subject
attracting many scientists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
During six years of work, Huang and Professor Henry N. Pollack
established a global geothermal and ancient climate database.
</P>
<P>
The two scientists have studied the tendencies of global
climate changes over the past 500 years, and have concluded that
surface temperatures have gone up one degree over the past 500
years, and another half degree in this century alone.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse Claims 47 Lives in Kuwait in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Drugs overdoses claimed
a record 47 lives last year, local daily Arab Times reported in
its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
Meshal Al Jurayed, deputy director of the Anti-Drugs National
Project, said that up to 29,000 cases of drug abuse had been
recorded between 1991 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jurayed said "the rampant use of narcotics in the country
should prompt a sober awareness of the perils they pose to youth
and the whole society."
</P>
<P>
Attributing the problem to an array of security, legal,
social, political and economic factors, he affirmed the
importance of seeking solutions.
</P>
<P>
The official called for an expanded field study on the drugs
problem to explore various aspects such as the status of the
Kuwaiti community before the oil era and the commitment then of
citizens to Islamic values - which he said had protected the
community from drugs.
</P>
<P>
Jurayed said the study should focus on the role of the security
forces in coordination with the General Customs Department to
combat narcotics, and project the party that religion and the
media could play in enlightening the youth about the perils of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
He suggested to review some of the country's anti-drug
legislation in a manner commensurate with the dangers of drug
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Jurayed also urged the Justice Ministry to double its efforts
to crack down on drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The issue of drug trafficking and abusing has become a serious
challenge to both the government and the society, with drug cases
and drug related crimes being rising alarmingly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, 4,456 persons involved in
drug-related crimes were arrested during 1991-1997.
</P>
<P>
Another official statistics showed that 1,068 drug dealers had
been arrested by the end of May this year, among them most were
involved in crimes.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Ranks 12th Among Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand ranks 12th among
developing countries by U.N. standards and stays in the 59th place
among the 174-country list this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has a small percentage of the population living in
poverty and fares well in human development, the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) said in its annual Human Development Report,
available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Thailand and Singapore are the two Southeast
Asian countries that fare well among developing countries in terms
of life expectancy, literacy and living standards that form the
basis for the Human Poverty Indicator (HPI).
</P>
<P>
The HPI uses the criteria of percentage of individuals with a
life expectancy of less than 40 and children of insufficient body
weight, adult illiteracy, access to health care and drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, among the top countries are Trinidad
and Tobago, Chile, Uruguay, Singapore, Costa Rica, Jordan, Mexico,
Colombia, Panama, Jamaica and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, the life expectancy at birth is 69.5 years and the
adult literacy rate is 93.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
An UNDP official in Bangkok said this indicator, however, does
not reflect the present state of affairs following the Asian
financial crisis since it is based on data available two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The 10 at the bottom are mostly African countries, namely
Mozambique, Senegal, Yemen, Guinea, Burundi, Mali, Ethiopia,
Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso and Niger.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Population Pegged at 50M by 2025 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya ranks among the top 10
countries with the largest population in Africa, according to a
latest report by a United Nations agency.
</P>
<P>
The recently-launched State of the World Report 1998 from the
U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) says that Kenya ranks eighth in
Africa after Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's population, says the report, currently stands at 29
million and by the 2025 is expected to rise to 50.2 million at an
average annual growth rate of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the rural-urban drift increases, population in the urban
areas of the east African country will grow at an average rate of
5.6 percent per annum during the period.
</P>
<P>
The report ranks Nigeria as the most populous country in
Africa with 121.8 million people and with an average population
growth rate of 2.8 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
By 2025, Nigeria will have to feed, clothe and shelter a total
of 238.4 million people, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Egypt comes a distant second after Nigeria will a total
population of 65.7 million. By 2025 the north African country
will house 95.8 million people if the population growth rate
stays at 1.9 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, the most populous country in eastern Africa, follows
closely with a population of 62.1 million. It will have one of
the biggest populations in Africa (136.8 million) with a
population growth rate of 3.2 percent per annum by 2025.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Republic of Congo comes fourth with 49.2
million people followed by South Africa (44.3 million), Tanzania
(32.2 million) and Algeria (30.2 million) respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the category of countries with low population figures, as
at early this year, Guinea Bissau ranks first with 1.1 million
people.
</P>
<P>
The small west African country's projected population by 2025
is 1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
Gabon and Mauritius share the second slot with 1.2 million
people each.
</P>
<P>
However, the report notes, the population in Mauritius will
increase at a slower rate (1.1 percent per annum) than that in
Gabon (2.8 percent per annum).
</P>
<P>
And by 2025 Gabon's population is expected to shoot up to 2.1
million while that of Mauritius will increase slightly to 1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
Botswana comes third with 1.6 million people followed by
Namibia with 1.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
The report however notes that some countries with low
population figures have high population densities per hectare of
arable land. Guinea Bissau for instance has a population density
of 5.42 per hectare of arable land, a higher figure than Kenya's
4.85.
</P>
<P>
Gabon and Namibia also have higher population densities of 5.4
and 4.9 respectively.
</P>
<P>
On child health care, Kenya ranks the second in eastern Africa
-- after Mauritius -- in the list of the countries with low and
medium infant mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Kenya's infant mortality rate per 1000
live births stands at 65.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius has the lowest mortality figure not only in eastern
Africa but also in Africa as a whole with only 15 deaths per 1000
live births.
</P>
<P>
The UNFPA report ranks Malawi the first in the category of
countries with high infant mortality rates. The country tops the
list with 142 followed by Rwanda with 125, Burundi 114, Uganda
113, and Somalia 112 respectively.
</P>
<P>
On average life expectancy, Tunisia, a country with 9.5
million people, ranks first with 68.4 years for males and 70.7
years for females.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's life expectancy is 52.3 years for males and 55.7 years
for females, the report says.

<HEADLINE> Successful Rice Planting Raise Hope for Guangxi's Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China has successfully grown
upland rice imported from Brazil in 12 impoverished mountainous
counties of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Local agro-technicians in charge of the experimental planting
said they achieved an increase of about 100 kilograms per mu (one
mu equals 0.067 hectares) by using the imported rice instead of
conventional varieties of dry rice.
</P>
<P>
The imported rice has proven features such as
drought-resistance, a high survival rate in harsh mountainous
conditions, high output and quality, the technicians said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese rice specialists say that by successfully planting the
imported upland rice in this south Chinese autonomous region, a
new way has been found to eradicate poverty and bring prosperity
to the mountainous areas of the region.
</P>
<P>
This rice, along with eight other precious crop varieties, was
a gift from the Brazilian government to former Chinese premier Li
Peng in 1992 when he attended a world conference on environmental
protection and development in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Propagated by agro-scientists with the Rice Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the foreign rice had
been grown successfully on a trial basis in Jiangxi, Jiangsu and
Hubei provinces before being used in Guangxi.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of IMF Waiver for Drawing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine central bank
Thursday expressed confidence that the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will grant a waiver to allow the country to draw the
remaining loans it has with the institution.
</P>
<P>
Central bank Managing Director Amando Tetangco said bank
officials need not go to Washington anymore just to get approval
of the waiver.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the IMF executive board will grant that waiver and
allow us to complete a review of our economic policies and draw on
the resources of the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tetangco said the waiver will allow the government to draw a
total of 260 million U.S. dollars out of the 1.35 billion dollars
available under the special arrangements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"IMF arrangements are designed in such a way that they are
disbursed in tranches and so the arrangement that we have is for a
two-year period from March 1998 to March 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
An IMF panel conducted a review of the Philippine economy from
August 28 to September 8, during which the two sides revised the
major economic targets for the Philippines for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
If the revisions are approved by the IMF executive board, the
Philippines would be allowed to draw the 260 million dollars, the
first tranche of the 1.35-billion-dollar standby loan the IMF
agreed to provide in April this year.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang's Consumer Goods Market Continues Active </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The consumer goods market in
east China's Zhejiang Province continued active in August,
official figures indicate.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's retail consumer goods sales totaled more than 14.4
billion yuan last month, up 10.5 percent over the same month last
year, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Analysis indicates that the catering and manufacturing sectors
reported the highest growth rates in August, at 24.1 percent and
19.8 percent year-on-year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Official figures also show that Zhejiang's retail sales
reached 121 billion yuan in the first eight months, an increase of
8.7 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's retail sales first began to recover in July when
monthly sales rose 11.7 percent year-on-year to 14.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some observers say that brisk sales of air conditioners,
electric fans, microwave ovens and computers was the major factor
behind the recovery of the consumer market in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
An official sample survey found that urban residents in
Zhejiang spent an average of 512.2 yuan in July, up 11.92 percent
from the same month last year. The growth rate is significantly
higher than the 1.4 percent average rise for the first six months.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the consumer market has caused price indexes to
rise, as Zhejiang's consumer price index in July was 0.4
percentage points higher than in June. In August, the index was up
another one percent.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Oppose Changes in U.S. Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH (West Bank), September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians
have expressed objection to any changes in a reported United
States proposal on Israel's further withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to fragment the American package will only
complicate matters," senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
told reporters Wednesday night after a meeting between Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat and U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Erekat stressed that the Palestinians "will not allow such
act," adding that they are still waiting for a positive Israeli
response to the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has called on Israel to withdraw from a further 13
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the
initiative, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu balked
at it.
</P>
<P>
Israel is now edging closer to the withdrawal scope outlined in
the plan, but it proposed that 3 percent out of the 13 percent be
turned into a "nature reserve" where the Palestinians only have
limited powers.
</P>
<P>
Erekat told reporters that Ross pledged in the meeting to deal
with issues "in a comprehensive manner."
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Wednesday,
starting a mission to help bridge the gap between the Palestinians
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said after the meeting with Arafat that he had a "productive
discussion" and is looking forward to meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that he could help narrow differences between
the two sides and get the peace process moving again after an
18-month impasse.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
stalled since March 1997 after Israel began building a Jewish
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as
the capital of their would-be independent state.
</P>
<P>
The talks are currently stuck over the long-overdue Israeli
further troop pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"It's crucial for everybody concerned that we change the
climate in this region, to change the atmosphere in a way that
trust is restored," Ross said.
</P>
<P>
"When there's trust, we'll find that even the hardest issues
can be solved, and without trust, we'll find that even the
smallest issues become very difficult to solve," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he did not directly answer the question whether the U.S. is
committed to all the parts of its initiative, which has apparently
strained relations between Netanyahu and the White House.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to meet Netanyahu on Thursday, who on
Wednesday canceled a trip to the former Soviet republic of Georgia
because he had the flu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office said that the meeting is "dependent on an
improvement in the prime minister's health."
</P>
<P>
If progress can be made in talks with Israeli and Palestinian
leaders, Ross will extend his mission and stay for "a week or
more," according to Israel Radio.

<HEADLINE> Asian Games Entries Plummeting Due to Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of athletes and
officials registration for the 13th Asian Games falls far below
the expected 10,000 because of the deepening economic woes.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee
(BAGOC said Thursday that the BAGOC was leaving open the
registration date for individual events in the hope of attracting
more entries.
</P>
<P>
The official, who did not give his name, said billiards and
carom, two of the cue sports events which are making a debut at
the Asian Games, are heading for cancellation due to fewer
entries.
</P>
<P>
The number of countries participating in the two events is
less than the required figure of five. Under Asian Games
regulations, a competition cannot be held if the number of teams i
s less than five.
</P>
<P>
Besides the host, the only two other countries to confirm
entry in the billiards event are India and Malaysia. The four
countries interested in taking part in carom are India, South
Korea, Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
While billiards and carom have attracted only three and four
teams respectively, pool reached the required figure, but only
just.
</P>
<P>
Snooker is comparatively better off with 10 countries and
regions confirming participation. Last month's Asian Snooker
Championship in Pakistan had players from 18 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
The football competition also seems certain to fall short of
the expected number of 32 teams. So far, confirmed entries for
this event is 27.
</P>
<P>
The BAGOC's technical committee revealed on Wednesday that in
all 40 countries and regions will send athletes to compete in the
Games' events However, the number of countries and regions taking
part in individual events was a disappointing 25.
</P>
<P>
Japan will send a total of 635 athletes, the highest among the
participating delegations.
</P>
<P>
Brunei, Palestine and Afghanistan have yet to say whether they
will take part. The technical committee has not received any
correspondence from the three countries.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded late Wednesday night in an Israeli bombardment on a
village in south Lebanon, the Voice of the People radio reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two civilians were hit by the shrapnels of Israeli shells,
which landed at the village of Marj Zuhour in the west of Bekaa,
the country's eastern province.
</P>
<P>
Several houses at the village and surrounding areas believed to
be hideouts of guerrillas of the anti-Israeli Hezbollah, or Party
of God, were also damaged by the attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The shelling came as a retaliation for Hezbollah's earlier
raids on the Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas ambushed an SLA patrol by detonating a
roadside bomb in the eastern sector of the Israeli occupied south
Lebanon. Two militia officers were killed and four others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas, who have been fighting to
drive the Israeli troops out of Lebanon.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Twenty fishermen suspected
to have been using chemicals to harvest fish from Lake Victoria
have been arrested in Busia District, western Kenya, according to
local police.
</P>
<P>
Police said Wednesday that 15 of the suspects had been
apprehended by fellow fishermen and handed over to the law

also found large quantities of dead fish on the beaches," the
Daily Nation newspaper Thursday quoted local police boss Godfrey
Babu as saying.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the suspects would be arraigned in court
this week.
</P>
<P>
A special branch officer said that Kenyan and Ugandan security
and administration personnel had held emergency talks in Tororo
Town, Uganda, on how to arrest the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local schools have withdrawn fish from their
students' menu soon after the outbreak of fish contamination.

officers said that they had a sudden upsurge in patient
admissions for those suffering from diarrhoea and bouts of
vomiting.
</P>
<P>

been admitted to health facilities," said David Makale, a
clinical officer at Port Victoria.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Uses Foreign Funds to Upgrade Steelworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a leading
heavy industrial center in northeast China, is actively seeking
foreign investment to upgrade major iron and steel companies.
</P>
<P>
The Benxi Iron and Steel Company (BISC) and the Marubeni
Corporation of Japan recently consummated a contract covering the
comprehensive use of metallurgical slag.
</P>
<P>
BISC, a major state-owned steelworks with a history of over 90
years, has net fixed assets of 7.25 billion yuan (876 million US
dollars). The company was selected as one of 100 pilot plants to
undertake experiments with the modern enterprise system. BISC has
since gained stock listings open to both domestic and foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned contract calls for BISC to receive funds of
some 300 million US dollars from Japan over the next three years
for a massive transformation program. BISC has also offered
foreign investors opportunities to participate in 60 cooperative
projects.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Anshan Iron and Steel plans to attract
some 350 million yuan (42.3 million US dollars) over the next 19
months to reconfigure oil-fired boilers into coal-fired units.
</P>
<P>
The facilities power plant currently uses 380,000 tons of heavy
oil annually. The plant plans to reconfigure two boilers to
coal-fired units in order to reduce production costs. The
transformation is expected to provide annual saving of some 228
million yuan (27.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Foreign funds will also be used in building a conveyor belt
system for coal and ash.

<HEADLINE> China's First Debris Power Plant Goes On Line in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A power plant using methane
produced by buried debris to generate electricity has gone on line
in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, situated near the Tianziling debris dump in
Hangzhou's northwestern suburbs, is operated by the Zhongjia
Environmental Technologies Co. Ltd., and was jointly started by
Waste Management Group of the United States and the Hangzhou City
Bureau of Environmental Sanitation, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
Now with seven employees, the power plant began construction in
April 1996 with the American company providing financing and
equipment. So far, some three-million U.S. dollars have been
spent on the project.
</P>
<P>
Fully computer-controlled, the power plant has two generating
units and will be able to generate 15 million kw/hours of
electricity annually. The investment spent on the project could be
recovered within ten years.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the plant will help improve environmental
conditions in the area surrounding Tianziling by reducing the
discharge of carbon dioxide into the air from the debris dump.

<P>
HANGZHOU, September 10 (Xinhua)-- Twin test-tube baby boys,
each weighing 2.5 kg, were born recently at an obstetrics hospital
in the east China city of Hangzhou where human reproduction
technology in China has been spearheaded.
</P>
<P>
The birth of the twin boys, the first test-tube twins born at
the Hospital for Gynecology and Obstetrics attached to the
Hangzhou Medical University, has increased the number of test-tube
babies born at the hospital to 40 since it began this experimental
technology in July of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The mother of the twins, a teacher at a local nursery school,
had difficulty conceiving because of fallopian tube
blockage. Doctors at the hospital placed four fertilized eggs in
her womb and the embryos and fetuses were said to have grown
normally right up to birth. The twins are currently alive and well
and under the care of their mother.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has another 11 women who expect to give birth to
their test-tube babies soon.

<HEADLINE> Shantou Residents Exhibit New Thirst for Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cai Wei prefers to spend his
weekends browsing the shelves of bookstores, rather than
travelling to popular scenic sites.
</P>
<P>
Cai noted that most people in Shantou, an open special economic
zone in south China's Guangdong Province, previously spent
weekends and holidays travelling, shopping and dining out. Today,
however, and increasing number of local residents enjoy visits to
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
Cai pointed to the activity as a highly enjoyable pastime.
</P>
<P>
Shantou's more than 500 bookstores offer a wide variety of
books.
</P>
<P>
The Sanlian Business Culture Center, one of the oldest
bookstores in the city, attracts numerous local bookworms,
including many people who browse the shelves until the store
closes.
</P>
<P>
The Chaoyang Book Center, the largest bookstore in Shantou
located near the Sanlian Center, opened in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-sq.m. store has more than 400,000 books in the first
month of operations, with the total sales volume for the first
month hitting 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Manager Hong Yujia said the decision to open such a large
center was based on our "confidence in the fact that local
residents would readily invest in knowledge."
</P>
<P>
Hong said the center plans to expand the existing facility and
open a chain of stores.
</P>
<P>
Small bookstores found in every corner of the city are also
attracting an increasing clientele.
</P>
<P>
Insiders contend that investing in knowledge will become an
important segment of the future expenditures of urban
citizens. They attributed the rising popularity of books to the
increasing demand for skilled personnel and the rapid emergence of
a knowledge-based economy.

<HEADLINE> Poland Holds Top-level Meeting on Russian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Polish government convened a
high-level meeting Wednesday to discuss ways to fend off possible
impact of the Russian crisis, the Polish Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Participants included Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration
Leszek Balcerowicz, Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, Minister
of Economy Janusz Steinhoff and President of National Bank Hanna
Gronkiewicz-Waltz.
</P>
<P>
President Aleksander Kwasniewski did not attend the meeting but
has reportedly been watching the situation in Russia closely.
</P>
<P>
Following a close look at the economic and political situation
in Russia, the participants agreed that they should keep a close
eye on it.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of the premier's office Jerzy Nowakowski said
after the meeting that Poland should figure out ways to help
Russia limit its crisis within the area of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The impact of the Russian crisis has already been felt in
Poland. It is partly blamed for the turbulences in the Polish
stock and foreign exchange markets and a sagging Zloty, the Polish
currency.
</P>
<P>
The Russian crisis has also led to the shrinkage of Poland's
exports to Russia and a 50-percent drop in Warsaw's market
turnover. The market turnover for the city of Lodz dropped by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment withdrawn from Poland over the past few
weeks amounts to over a billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite all these, Polish Central Banker Gronkiewicz-Waltz said
the Russian crisis would not cast direct influence on the Polish
situation. The country's foreign reserve has been growing recently
to reach 27.3 billion dollars by last weekend.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Told to Rethink Quitting Int'l Rubber Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and other major
rubber-producing countries should think twice about their plans to
quit the International Nature Rubber Organization (INRO), the Thai
Farmers Research Center said in a report available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the world's largest rubber producer, has announced
plans to leave INRO, a cartel of six exporting countries and 22
importing countries, saying the organization was no longer useful.
</P>
<P>
However, the researchers argued that INRO failed to stabilize
sagging rubber prices over the past two years because natural
rubber was a different commodity from others.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices are linked to world oil prices, they noted.
Whenever oil prices decline, demand for lower-priced synthetic
rubber increases while demand for natural rubber falls.
</P>
<P>
The researchers admitted that INRO, through its buffer stock
administration, had not prepared any means to deal with sever
exchange rate fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Either the price-stabilization system failed to function, or
INRO did not start buying rubber to intervene in the market even
though prices had fallen sharply, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, INRO was trying to improve its operation to bring it
into line with the current situation. It has also offered to let
Thailand and Malaysia, the world's two leading producers, to lift
reference prices to intervene in the market.
</P>
<P>
The biggest losers in Thailand would be planters and rubber
factories, the report added.
</P>
<P>
As an INRO member Thailand's annual membership fee is 15
million baht (375,000 U.S. dollars), while it had to spend 4.7
billion baht (117.5 million dollars) to buy 99,000 tons of rubber
to support prices this year.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, the world's third largest rubber producer, has
already stated clearly that it intended to quit the cartel.

<HEADLINE> Floods Enter Third Month in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The unrelenting floods
beginning to hit Bangladesh in early July entered the third month
on Thursday leaving a trail of devastation on both life and
property.
</P>
<P>
For the past two months, the flooding has virtually given no
respite, though at times some major rivers showed signs of slight
fall in water levels, particularly in the northern upstream.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing flood, which has swept 47 of the country's 64
districts, is now turning into the worst deluge in the region in a
century, according to officials and experts. For example, the
Padma river is setting new records surging above all previously
recorded watermarks at many places, and the high tide at
southeastern Chandpur measuring points has crossed its
ever-highest level, they said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands and thousands of flood victims living in shelters in
the capital city are passing their days in misery, without
adequate supply of food, drinking water and clothing.
</P>
<P>
And local residents here are panicked as the two embankments
protecting the city are threatened by rising waters in the
Buriganga, Turag, Kaliganga and Shitalakhya rivers surrounding the
city, and troops have been placed there to ensure the
Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) and the Dhaka City Protection
Embankments safe from the deluge.
</P>
<P>
The district administration of Narayanganj, 10 kilometers south
of here, has formed a rescue team to evacuate people living along
the DND dam on an emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
Railway and waterway communications are partially on to and
from Dhaka to most of the flood-stricken district towns, while the
highway network linking the capital with the rest of the country
has been totally disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Experts said due to the influence of the post-full moon, the
Bay of Bengal experienced abnormal tide which impeded drainage of
floodwater, creating the worst scenario in the coastal and central
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The lingering flood water, which experts said was likely to
last till the end of this month, has make thousands of mills and
factories down, incurring heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, the official flood-related death toll rose to
649 with nearly 30 million people affected.

<HEADLINE> Panama's Budget Hit by International Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Panama's budget for the
1999 fiscal year will be squeezed by the international economic
crisis, the Ministry of Economic Policy and Planning said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Carlos Gonzales, director of the ministry's
budgeting department, rising interest rates on foreign debts will
force a tighter budget on Panama, which is enjoying a relatively
healthy economy for the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debt interest will be increased because of the
government's decision to have floating exchange rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation will worsen, as we have to pay the World Bank
and other institutions 22 pending credits starting next year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Economic Policy and Planning Guillermo Chapman
indicated that the most important effect of the crisis was the
rise in interest interests.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, we are not going to pay the extra money, so we
will not get any credit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chapman said that Panama had the means to face the crisis,
though he admitted that it would entail some costs, such as
canceling planned projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A three-day meeting between
U.S. entrepreneurs and Cuban government officials started
Wednesday in Cancun, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, arranged by Washington-based Alamar Associates, is
aimed to promote U.S. businessmen's understanding of Cuba's
economic situation and the possibilities for trade and investment
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Ferradaz Garcia, Cuban minister of foreign investment and
economic cooperation, will meet executives from more than 70
American companies.
</P>
<P>
Alamar Associates had planned to arrange a 24-hour Havana trip
for the businessmen during the meeting, but the plan was denied
permission by the U.S. government despite a verbal approval given
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government said such a trip would be "contrary to
current foreign policy."
</P>
<P>
However, Washington approved a one-day visit to Havana by
leaders of more than 50 U.S. businesses, including major drug,
oil, food and transportation operations, during a meeting with
Cuban officials in March.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed economic sanctions on Cuba in 1962,
restricting its citizens from doing business with Cuba or

<P>
YANGON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A state-owned Myanmar
insurance enterprise and its Australian counterpart Wednesday held
a seminar here to discuss ways and means for cooperation in the
insurance field.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar jointly sponsored by the Myanmar Insurance and
the Manufacturers Mutual Insurance Group of Australia, topics on
liability insurance, social insurance and health and worker's
compensation insurance were discussed, the official New Light of
Myanmar newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liability insurance will become more vital as a result of the
expansion of business in the country, Myanmar Minister of Finance
and Revenue U Khin Maung Thein was quoted as saying at the opening
ceremony of the seminar.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the benefit of individual citizens, social
insurance and health and worker's compensation insurance will be
widely conducted in the country.
</P>
<P>
After the enactment of the country's Insurance Business Law in
June 1996, Myanmar opened up its insurance sector to local private
and foreign businessmen as part of its efforts to develop the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, three Japanese marine and fire insurance companies
-- Mitsui, Yasuda and Tokio -- have signed memorandums of
understanding with state-owned Myanmar insurance institutions to
set up joint ventures.

to set up a new university in Uva Province at a cost of 1,000
million rupees (15.2 million U.S. dollars), the Higher Education
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There are already nine universities including an open
university in the country. More than 10,000 students are admitted
annually to the universities, the ministry's officials said.
</P>

But still there is a serious lack of accommodation in the
universities for the large numbers that qualify for admission.

Announcing the establishment of the new university, Minister of
Education and Higher Education Richard Pathirana said they expect
to start graduate programs in planting, tourism, surveying,
technology and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The officials said this university together with another to be
established soon in Wayamba (North Western) Province will be able
to admit 15,000 students.

HANOI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will further open
access to Internet as a development step, the Vietnam Investment
Review reported in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
"We now understand that limiting access to Internet is an
isolationist policy," the weekly quoted a senior Communist Party
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dang Huu, head of the Communist Party's science and education
department, said the current limitation on access to Internet use
discouraged communication and technology development in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has nearly 11,000 Internet users with a growth rate of
20 percent, which is still below that of many other developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners working in Vietnam always complain of the
"information firewall" which was designed to bar "inappropriate"
information from entering the country through Internet.

YANGON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Singapore tourism
authorities are jointly training more than 1,100 Myanmar students
under a bilateral tourism cooperation agreement between the two
countries on manpower training.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore
Hotel and Tourism Education Center, Myanmar is able to turn out 38
diploma holders in hotel management for the first time, Minister
of Hotels and Tourism Major-General Saw Lwin said at a graduation
ceremony of a hotel management course here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Saw Lwin pointed out that Myanmar lacks trained personnel while
the number of international visitors and high-class hotels have
increased tremendously in the country, The New Light of Myanmar
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the maximum number of tourist arrivals before
1988 was only 42,000 annually and there were only 39 hotels with
1,240 rooms in the country.
</P>
<P>
At that time, tourism was more or less monopolized by the
state, he said, adding that dramatic changes have taken place in
all sectors of the economy, especially in the tourism sector after
the country opened up to the outside world in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar now allows both local and foreign private sectors to do
business in tourism under the Tourism Law revised in 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign investment in hotels
and tourism has amounted to 1.1 billion U.S. dollars up to now.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals were 265,122 in the 1997-98 fiscal year which
ended in March and the number in the first six months of this year
was 138,863, according to the statistics.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants Flexibility of Trade Within APEC Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants to liberalize
trade under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) scheme
but is seeking flexibility on products, time frame and final
tariff rates, the Bangkok Post Thursday quoted a senior Foreign
Ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand was prepared to free up trade as much as possible with
the other APEC members, but insisted that some products be
reserved from early liberalization because the local business
operators need time to adjust before competing with foreigners,
the newspaper said, quoting Somkiati Ariyapruchya,
director-general of the Economics Department.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also preferred to start lowering import tariffs after
2005, with the lowest rate of 0-5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Somkiati made the remarks before heading for a meeting of
senior APEC officials held on Monday in Kuantan, Malaysia. The
meeting aims to resolve differences on targets and deadlines for
trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
APEC leaders agreed last November on early and voluntary
liberalization in nine of 15 sectors, including chemicals, energy,
environmental goods and services, fish and fishery products,
forestry products, gems and jewelry, medical equipment, toys and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries are committed to freeing up trade by 2010,
and developing countries by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Thailand wanted to begin liberalizing trade under the APEC
framework in 2005 because it wanted member states of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to enjoy similar
privileges first.
</P>
<P>
Under the ASEAN free trade plan, Thailand is committed to
reducing tariffs to 0-5 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Somkiati also said the economic crisis would not prevent
Thailand from opening up trade.

<HEADLINE> Ties with China Important for Venezuela: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's relationship with
China is its most important bilateral relations outside the
American continents, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Burelli
Rivas said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo, Rivas
said Wu's visit contributes to closer relations between the two
countries, notably their cooperation on oil.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that China and Venezuela, both influential developing
countries on the world stage, have no conflict of interests while
holding same or similar views on many major international issues.
</P>
<P>
He said China is willing to make joint efforts with Venezuela
to build long-term stable friendship and wide-ranging cooperation
oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On the economic and trade relations between China and
Venezuela, Wu said the two major oil countries have complementary
resources and technologies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Venezuela is the biggest beneficiary of Chinese
investments in South America, the Chinese official said it is in
the interest of the two countries to strengthen economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Venezuelan government for adhering to the
one-China policy and rejecting official relations with Taiwan and
expressed thanks for its support for China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two sides signed agreements to continue
cooperation on agriculture, livestock farming and fishery and to
start cooperation on sports.
</P>
<P>
Wu is on a three-day visit to Venezuela as part of his South
America tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar have
agreed to resume suspended border trade from September 17 using
the U.S. dollar as the currency for settlement, a TV report said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries made the joint announcement after talks in
Bangkok on Wednesday between their commerce ministers. Myanmar was
represented by Maj-Gen Kyaw Than and Thailand by Supachai
Panitchpakdi, who is also deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the volume of trade will increase after the
reopening of the (eastern) Myawaddy trading point," said Kyaw
Than, quoted by the report.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said: "The use of the U.S. dollar is acceptable as we
don't have to bother about currency fluctuations."
</P>
<P>
Flourishing border trade between the two countries at the
Myawaddy border town and western Thailand's Mae Sot was suspended
last November after disputes.
</P>
<P>
Since the border closure, the value and volume of trading in
the area has dropped sharply to around 70 million baht (about 1.7
million U.S. dollars) monthly from 300 million baht (about 7.5
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Business was originally due to resume Wednesday but the
reopening of a bridge across the Moei River was suspended until
after the talks between the two governments.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Garment Producers Cut Back Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's garment producers
have slashed their output by between 40 and 60 percent to cope
with the monetary crisis which has affected the country for more
than one year, the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in production would certainly lead to a fall in the
country's garment exports, the Ministry of Industry and Trade's
Director General of Various Industries Doddy Soepardy said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the overall value of garment
exports dropped by 20 percent to 2.88 billion U.S. dollars last
year from 3.58 billion dollars in 1996 as a direct result of the
monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Doddy declined to say why garment manufacturers had slashed
production, but earlier reports said the country's garment
industry faced difficulties in getting sufficient raw materials,
especially cotton and rayon fabrics.
</P>
<P>
The closure of many textile factories in Java due to the
monetary crisis has caused a fabric shortage.
</P>
<P>
Textile producers have stopped production due to the inability
to import raw materials.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, despite the monetary crisis, we are still optimistic
that through continued exhibitions business people will find more
chances to market their products," Doddy added.

BELGRADE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav police have found
yet another mass grave in Kosovo which they alleged contained the
civilian victims of Serbs killed by ethnic Albanian terrorists,
the Yugoslav news media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police found 12 badly decomposed bodies laid beside a drain in
Glodjane, a village in western Kosovo, reports said. They had
apparently been killed with gun shots.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted police colonel Dragutin Adamovic as saying that
the victims were mainly Serb civilians kidnapped and murdered by
ethnic Albanian terrorists in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province where
ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
"There was an Albanian stronghold near the site. It is a mass
grave of brutally killed Serb civilians and probably other
nationalities," Adamovic was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Adamovic, at least five more such sites existed in
the region containing the bodies of up to 40 people.
</P>
<P>
In late August, police found 22 corpses in the village of
Klecck, whom they claimed were also killed by ethnic Albanian
terrorists, who are engaged in a violent campaign intended to
separate Kosovo from Yugoslavia.

<P>
KUNMING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund will
bestow a grant of one-million U.S. dollars to assist farmers in
southwest China's Yunnan Province adopt new ways of living and
producing in order to help protect the snub-nosed monkeys there
from excessive and reckless human activities.
</P>
<P>
The WWF is the first international organization to offer
financial support to China's efforts to save this rare animal
which has been reduced to around 1,000 living in the wild near the
Yunnan Province-Tibet Autonomous Region border area, according to
local wildlife protection sources.
</P>
<P>
The WWF has selected three villages as pilot communities for
the comprehensive program in Deqing County, home to some 400
snub-nosed monkey. Farmers in these villages, mostly ethnic
minority groups, used to living by logging which poses a grave
threat to the very survival of the monkey.
</P>
<P>
With these funds, the organization plans to build small
hydropower stations, renovate irrigation systems and plan trees to
for use as fuel. It will also help farmers increase crop yields
and limit the number of domestic animals, thereby preventing the
monkey's natural habitat from shrinking.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, zoologists and other scientists will conduct
research and closely monitor the changes in behavior and the
numbers of this rare species.
</P>
<P>
The WWF has completed personnel training, and the program is
expected to be carried out over a five-year period.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Consideration must be given
to conserving the environment when rebuilding homes and
constructing water conservancy projects in flood-hit areas,
experts suggested yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the State Environmental
Protection Administration (Sepa) invited a group of academicians
from the Chinese Academy of Sciences to solicit their opinions and
suggestions on environmental conservation and disaster prevention.
</P>
<P>
Sepa will refer to the experts' comments when drafting a
national program on environmental protection to be submitted to
the State Council, said Sepa Minister Xie Zhenhua.
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed on several measures to fulfil the
environmental preservation aim. Action must be taken to stop
damage to natural forests, more timber and wood products should be
imported as a substitute for logging, and legislation must be
strengthened to protect the ecology.
</P>
<P>
The experts agreed that ecological degradation is one of the
major factors to blame for the severe flooding in the Yangtze
River basin.
</P>
<P>
The experts hoped the State could draw up a law on
environmental protection, draft a national strategy for
environmental conservation, and strengthen input into the work.
</P>
<P>
Regional planning in social and economic development must be
reinforced to give full consideration to the load-bearing capacity
of the environment, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Launches Program to Spur Corporate Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
launched a program known as the "Jakarta Initiative" to help
troubled private companies deal with their massive debts,
newspaper reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The 'Jakarta Initiative' is a program that sets out principles
that can facilitate out-of-court corporate restructuring, and will
apply to both domestic and foreign creditors in a
non-discriminatory manner," Coordinating Minister of Economy,
Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita was quoted as saying
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move sets forth guidelines for negotiations that draw upon
strategies that have proven successful in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines are designed to promote the availability of
interim financing to companies undergoing restructuring, as well
as the provision of information by these companies, so that their
restructuring proposals can be effectively evaluated by creditors.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's private debt now totals around 84 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost about 80 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since July last year, making it virtually impossible
for companies to repay their dollar-denominated debts.
</P>
<P>
"Our path to economic recovery must focus on rehabilitating our
private companies, so that they will have access to new capital in
order to develop the economy and enable the creation of
employment," Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
The program also provides for the establishment of a government
task force, the Jakarta Initiative Task Force, whose mandate will
be to facilitate out-of-court negotiations and remove regulatory
obstacles to restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The task force will be chaired by the head of Bapepam, the
capital market watchdog, Jusuf Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said that the Jakarta Initiative was also designed to
complement the new bankruptcy law and the private sector foreign
debt settlement mechanism provided by the Indonesian Debt
Restructuring Agency and would help facilitate rehabilitation of
the banking sector.

<HEADLINE> "Supermassive" Black Hole Found at Center of Milky Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The presence of an enormous
black hole at the center of our galaxy has been detected by Andrea
Ghez of the University of California-Los Angeles, according to a
press release issued Tuesday by the Central Parsecs Galactic
Center Workshop '98 being held in Tucson, Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Black holes are formed from the remnants of collapsed stars. A
black hole consists of a large mass compacted so densely that even
light can not escape its force of gravity.
</P>
<P>
Using the Keck I Telescope atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, Ghez began
tracking the movement of 200 stars near the galactic center in
1995. She found at least 20 stars that exhibited the telling signs
of the influence by extremely strong gravitational forces.
</P>
<P>
These stars are spiraling around the black hole at speeds of up
to three million miles per hour -- about 10 times the speed at
which stars typically move.
</P>
<P>
To explain the extremely high speeds of these stars, Ghez said
that an object 2.6 million times more massive than our Sun must be
concentrated into a single black hole.
</P>
<P>
"What lies in the center of the Milky Way has been one of this
century's big science questions," said Terry Oswalt, National
Science Foundation program manager for Stellar Astronomy and
Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
"Ghez's work has massive implications on our understanding of
how galaxies evolve."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Commander Says More Troops Could Have </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Marines Corps
Commander Major General Suharto Wednesday said they did not have
enough troops to cover every corner of Jakarta to safeguard the
capital during the rioting and burning in May.
</P>
<P>
The commander told the Joint Fact-Finding Team investigating
the riots that 31 companies, 3,100 troops in total, could easily
vanish in a city as large as this one, the Indonesian Observer
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 31 companies, 11 had been shipped from the Marine's
naval base in Surabaya in East Java, and the remainder were
supplied by Jakarta's own base.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters following a session with members of the
team, Suharto said his men had been on alert since May 6.
</P>
<P>
"I am just glad that my men did their best while carrying out
their job. However, I do not agree we were told about the riots
too late to prevent it from happening. I think if we had enough
forces at that time, it would not have been too late to react," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government established the Joint Fact-Finding Team in July
to investigate reports that the May riots in Jakarta and other
cities, which left 1,200 people dead, were masterminded.
</P>
<P>
Suharto told reporters that he had no knowledge nor had
received information from his men concerning the theory of "an
engineered riot."
</P>
<P>
"I personally have no information of that issue and neither do
any of my men. I think that would be the part of the affairs of
(the armed forces) intelligence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Suharto will be the sixth prominent government official to be
questioned by the team, following former Jakarta Regional Military
commander Major General Sjafrie, Jakarta's Governor Sutiyoso,
former Jakarta Police chief Major General Hamami Nata, Chief of
the Armed Forces' intelligence unit Major General Zacky Anwar
Makarim and former chief of the Army's Strategic Reserve Command
Prabowo Subianto.

<P>
HAVANA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The development of tourism and
open markets in Cuba has offered new opportunities for drug
traffickers, an international crime conference here was told.
</P>
<P>
Cuban police seized more than 30 tonnes of cocaine and
marijuana between 1994 and 1998, sources from the national
anti-drug division said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the drugs were destined for the United States,
officials told a crime symposium attended by Cuban, French and
the United Nations experts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Map to Help Tibetan Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ground-breaking progress has
been made in the research about and responses to geological
disasters in the Tibet Autonomous Region, the "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A powerful new tool, the region's first map of the distribution
of geological disasters, has been finished by the China
hydrogeological Inspection Institute.
</P>
<P>
The institute's staff has been charged with the task of
researching and responding to major geological disasters in Tibet
for 20 years. The work lends vital support to sustainable
development in this region.
</P>
<P>
Wu Xueming, an official with the institute, was quoted as
saying that for 20 years the institute has annually sent an
investigation group to Tibet to help local people locate water
resources, tackle floods, and improve their geological environment.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of these investigations, the institute has not
only presented suggestions on how to tackle big landslides, mud
rock flows, large areas of land desertification and soil erosion,
but has also completed the disaster map.
</P>
<P>
With suggestions from the institute, the paper said, the
region's government has worked out aggressive programs allowing
them to tackle mud-rock flows and landslides and to plan for such
events expected to occur within the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to regional land management plans, the institute
first chose Zhangmu Town's landslides and Qiongjie County's
mud-rock flows and land-slides for study.
</P>
<P>
With careful designs and strict construction, nearly 100
million cubic meters of landslides in these two areas have been
brought under control. These two projects have withstood this
summer's flooding, the most pronounced in the region's
history.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hopes for Closer Ties With Malta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini hoped Wednesday that the new Maltese government will improve
that country's relations with Italy and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Dini voiced his hope in a congratulatory message to Guido De
Marco, who was appointed deputy prime minister and foreign
minister after Malta's Nationalist Party won the national
elections held a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Dini said, "I am sure that the excellent friendship and
collaboration between Italy and Malta will grow even further
because of your personal interest in our two countries and the
international community in general."
</P>
<P>
"Your nomination will allow us to work together to strengthen
our already close bilateral relations and those between Malta and
the EU," said Dini.
</P>
<P>
De Marco had been Maltese foreign minister for six years until
the Labor Party came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels Wednesday, the European Commission, the executive
body of the EU, said that it is expecting Malta to take a formal
action to reactivate its application to join the EU, which was
frozen by the Labor government.
</P>
<P>
"We know that Malta is interested, but we have not yet received
any official request," the EU spokesman for Foreign Affairs
Commissioner Hans van den Broek said.
</P>
<P>
The EU has decided to discuss bilateral relations with Malta in
December.

MONTEVIDEO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Andean Community and
the South American Common Market (Mercosur) restarted talks
Wednesday on customs tariffs, part of a proposed free trade
agreement for the next century.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, representatives of the two blocs gathered
here have expressed their confidence in reaching a multilateral
trade agreement before the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on the establishment in the year 2000 of a free
trade zone, which will include most South American countries
except Chile, Guyana and Surinam, will be held on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Previous discussions between the two groups failed to reach an
accord because of changes of government in Ecuador and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, the largest trade bloc in Latin America, and the
Andean Community will hold another meeting before September 30 in
Lima, Peru.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two organizations amounted to 4.8 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996 and six billion dollars in 1997. Mercosur has
exported to the Andean member countries four billion dollars worth
of goods and imported about two billion dollars worth so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, set up in 1991, groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay. The Andean Community changed its name from the Andean
Group in 1996 and covers Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and

NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Pete Sampras of the
United States looks for a measure of revenge against No. 9 Karol
Kucera of Slovakia and fourth seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of
Spain battles No. 5 Venus Williams of the United States in toni
ght's highlight at the U.S. Open tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
Sampras and Kucera have met twice previously, both times in
Grand Slams. The 27-year-old American won at Wimbledon in 1996,
but lost to the Slovakian in the quarterfinals of this year's
Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Sampras chalked up a straight-set victory over
Russian teenager Marat Safin for his 600th career triumph. His
152-26 mark in Grand Slam matches and his 51-6 record in the
U.S.Open leads all active players.
</P>
<P>
Kucera survived a two-day, five-set marathon with No. 8 Andre
Agassi of the United States on Tuesday. He is enjoying a career
year. He is 48-19 in 1998, including a 25-5 mark on hardcourts
with titles at Sydney and New Haven and led Slovakia to the
Hopman Cup title in January.
</P>
<P>
The rematch of the quarterfinal at Australian Open tonight
will see who can win through, if Sampras is beaten again, he is
likely to lose his world top ranking to Rafter.

NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Lindsay
Davenport of the United States easily moved into her third Grand
Slam semifinal of the year, beating No. 13 Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa at the U.S. Oepn tennis championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, a strong contender to claim her first Grand Slam
title and the No. 1 world ranking, cruised past Coetzer 6-0, 6-4
in a match interrupted twice by rain.
</P>
<P>
In tonight's matches, fourth seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of
Spain battles No. 5 Venus Williams of the United States for the
final top berth.
</P>
<P>
Top seed and defending champion Martina Hingis of Switzerland
and second seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic already booked
the spots in the semifinals last night.
</P>
<P>
Davenport broke tree times en route to taking the first set in
just 18 minutes. She did not miss a first serve until the final
game of the set and limited Coetzer to just nine points.
</P>
<P>
The second set looked to be more of the same, with Davenport
breaking for a 2-1 lead, but Coetzer broke back to even the set
4-4. However the South African could not hold on as Davenport
broke back the next game and closed out the match on her fifth
match point as Coetzer hit her 38th unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
"It was a little stopping and starting, stopping and starting
again," said Davenport. "But I think if anything, it's pretty
much made me concentrate on this tournament of just making first
servers, not going for it too much. Hopefully, it will still be
OK on Friday."
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who awaits the winner of the match between Sanchez
Vicario and Williams, moved into her fourth Grand Slam semifinal
and second straight at the U.S. Open. She had been playing the
best tennis of her career this summer after sweeping all three
California tournaments.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Davenport could claim the No. 1 ranking this
week if she wins the title over anyone other than Hingis.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion and third
seed Patrick Rafter of Australia sailed into the semifinals here
today by disposing of 12th seed Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden in
straight sets at the U.S. Open tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
Rafter won the match over his doubles partner 6-2, 6-3, 7-5.
He is 22-2 since Wimbledon, winning back-to-back hardcourt events
in Toronto and Cincinnati and the title on Long Island. He has
five tournament crowns and 52 match victories in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old snapped a four-match losing streak to Bjorkman
in Canada. Their last five meetings have all come on hardcourts.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman, a semifinalist here last year, is one of three
Swedish players in the quarterfinals, along with Thomas Johansson
and Magnus Larsson.
</P>
<P>
After an outstanding 1997, Bjorkman has been up and down this
year. He started the season with an 8-4 record but reached the
quarterfinals of the Australian Open. After mid-February, he lost
11 of his 16 matches but rebounded to win his fourth career title
at Nottingham before Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Rafter defeated 14th seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia in four
sets in the fourth round Tuesday while Bjorkman advanced with a
four set win over Dutchman Jan Siemerink.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Davis Cup Team to be Announced Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Tom Gullikson, captain of
the United States Davis Cup team, will announce his lineup of the
upcoming semifinal match against Italy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Michael Chang
have all made it clear they will not compete in the tie,
scheduled from September 25 to 27 in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
With his choices limited, Gullikson is expected to select a
team featuring Davis Cup veteran Todd Martin and newcomer
Jan-Michael Gambill.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, ranked No. 8 in the world and a Davis Cup stalwart,
declared himself unavailable to play because of a scheduling
conflict. His foundation's annual benefit takes place on
September 26.
</P>
<P>
World number one Sampras, who has been critical of Davis Cup
scheduling in the past, and Chang turned down the chances to
compete. Courier is suffering a dead arm and reportedly
contemplating retirement.
</P>
<P>
That leaves Martin and Gambill as Gullikoson's logical choices
in singles. Martin is 10-2 in Davis Cup singles and 3-2 in do
ubles. He lost to Goran Ivanisevic in four sets in the second
round of the U.S. Open last week.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Gambill has yet to play in a Davis Cup tie,
but did serve as a practice partner against Belgium and Russia
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has won a record 31 Davis Cup titles,
advanced to the semifinals by beating Belgium. Italy moved into
the semifinals by sweeping Zimbabwe 5-0. The United States and
Italy have met nine times previously with the U.S. leading 7-2.

<HEADLINE> Testimony Complete in NBA Salary Grievance Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Former union chief Simon
Gourdine was the last witness as testimony concluded today in the
arbitration hearing here that will determine whether player
contracts are guaranteed during the ongoing NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
Gourdine, who was viewed as a weak union chief and eventually
was replaced by current Players Association executive director
Billy Hunter, was just the second witness called by attorneys for
the NBA. Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik, who testified last
week, was the other.
</P>
<P>
The Players Association filed a grievance with NBA arbitrator
John Feerick hours before the lockout was imposed July 1. The
union claims NBA players have guaranteed contracts which should
allow them to be paid during the lockout. The NBA contends its
actions are entirely legal during a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
Both sides will make closing arguments Wednesday, with briefs
due September 16. From there, Feerick has 30 days to render his
decision. Although he is expected to rule before that, the start
of the 1998-99 season is in serious jeopardy. The NBA is the only
major pro sports league that has not lost any games to a work
stoppage.
</P>
<P>
At the core of the grievance is specific language in a
contract signed by Sacramento Kings center Olden Polynice in 1994
which indicated the player would not be paid in the event of a
work stoppage. Contracts signed by superstars David Robinson and
Shawn Kemp also contained similar language.
</P>
<P>
NBPA attorneys argued that the language should have been part
of every standard contract because it was part of Polynice's
pact. The NBA contends the stipulation that players will not be
paid during a work stoppage is implicit.
</P>
<P>
The grievance hearing began August 24 and included five days
of testimony. The union called just three witnesses -- Hunter,
union attorney Ron Klempner and NBA commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
Feerick's ruling will have a major effect on future collective
bargaining sessions, which have digressed from unproductive to
acrimonious to non-existent over the last five months. Camps are
scheduled to open October 6.
</P>
<P>
If Feerick determines that players should be paid, the NBA
would have very few options other than to end the lockout and
resume collective bargaining form a concessionary position.
</P>
<P>
However, should Feerick soot down the grievance, the players
would be at a disadvantage in their stance, which includes the
retention of the Larry Bird Exception. The clause allows teams to
re-sign their own free agents without regard to the salary cap.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen's Tu Mu Banned for Three Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Tu Mu, who plays for
Shenzhen Ping'an, has been banned for three matches and fined
1,000 yuan (120 U. S. dollars) for elbowing a rival player in the
20th round of Chinese first division soccer league against
Yanbian Aodong last Sunday, a spokesman of the Chinese Football
Association (CFA) said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
 Nan Yong, executive president of CFA, said that the Shenzhen
club was also fined 500 yuan for Tu's "unsportsmanlike act".
</P>
<P>
The punishment means Tu will miss the first division matches
from the 21st round to 23rd.
</P>
<P>
The Ping'an side, under the charge of sacked World Cup coach
Cha Bum-kun of South Korea, was held by Aodong 0-0 in the match
and was on the verge of relegation as it stands 13th in the 14-
team first division league.
</P>
<P>
 Nan revealed in a weekly news briefing that China has been
drawn in Group B with South Korea, Japan, Iraq and Qatar for the
Asian Under-19 Championships to be held from October 17 to 31 in
Chiang Mai, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The five teams in Group A include Thailand, Saudi Arabia,
Kazakhstan, India and Kuwait. The top three teams in the meet
will represent Asia to play the World Under-19 Championships next
year in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reports Rising Sales for Imported Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The latest fad permeating the
ranks of high-income earners in Beijing, the Chinese capital,
centers on the ownership of imported automobiles.
</P>
<P>
An auto market located near the Asian Games Village in
northeast Beijing reported sales of over 200 Honda sedans
during the first six months of the year. Market sources indicate
that individuals account for over 80 percent of the total number
of buyers.
</P>
<P>
Another major factor behind skyrocketing sales of imported cars
is attributed to the narrowing price differential for medium-range
foreign and domestic vehicles. Imported vehicles currently sell
for between 200,000-300,000 yuan (25,000-37,500 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of private owners continues to rise and market
analysts predict that individuals will account for 90 percent of
purchases during 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, domestically-manufactured automobiles will continue to
dominate the market since fierce competition has forced
manufacturers to keep reduce prices and improve quality, according
to analysts.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Tourists expect to go
boating, fishing, sand bathing, and camel riding, and now they can
also appreciate the greenery in the world's largest poplar forest
park in the Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The diversiform-leaved poplar is the only tree that can survive
in the desert in great numbers; it is also the world's oldest
poplar tree variety.
</P>
<P>
Covering over 20,000 hectares, the park was completed in 1993
and is believed to have most of the diversiform-leaved poplar
trees on the globe. A highway which opened through the desert
three years ago makes it possible for an increasing number of
tourists and adventurers to visit the park.
</P>
<P>
After years of construction, the park has not only a number of
scenic spots, but also hotels for tourists who prefer to stay a
few days there.
</P>
<P>
The park is also home to swans, wild boars, black storks and
foxes.

<HEADLINE> South China Sea Oil Fields Pump More Crude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Oil fields in the eastern
section of the South China Sea have produced over 50 million tons
of crude oil since the region's first field entered production in
September 1990, according to China Offshore Oil Nan Hai (South
China Sea) East Corporation (CONHE).
</P>
<P>
The eastern waters of the South China Sea opened to foreign
cooperation in 1983, with exploratory efforts to date yielding 26
oil fields and major oil-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
The nine fields in production have a total daily output of
38,000 tons. The fields produced slightly over 12.97 million tons
of oil in 1997, with the eastern section of the South China Sea
emerging as the nation's major offshore crude oil producer.
</P>
<P>
The fields had generated a combined industrial output value of
45.14 billion yuan and paid taxes totalling 5.61 billion yuan by
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
CONHE is a subsidiary of the China National Offshore Oil Corp
(CNOOC), the major domestic oil company operating in the South
China Sea. CONHE is currently the fourth largest oil producer in
China. Daqing, China's major oil producer, has annual oil
output of well over 50 million tons, with the
Shengli Oil Field in Shandong Province and Liaohe in Liaoning
Province rounding out the top three slots.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia to Convert Up to 15 Million Dollars Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
will convert up to 15 million U.S. dollars daily in its effort to
stabilize the rupiah, the Indonesian Observer Thursday quoted the
central bank governor as saying.
</P>
<P>
The amount may vary between 5 million and 15 million U.S.
dollars, Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin said, adding that
dollars will be taken from foreign aid provided to the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is not intervention. It will be carried out until the
rupiah reaches the level that the government wants," he told
reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin did not say when the "intervention" is to start and
added that the program will last until the ailing currency
stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor did not mention the targeted exchange
rate. But the government has targeted a 10,000 rupiah/U.S. dollar
level by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah Wednesday ended the trading day in Jakarta at
11,700/11,800.
</P>
<P>
Considered the world's worst performing currency in 1997, the
rupiah has lost around 80 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar since July last year when the regional currency turmoil
began.

<HEADLINE> BSkyB and Man United Defend Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- BSkyB and Manchester United
have sought to reassure fans over the controversial 623 million
pounds(about 1.04 billion U.S. dollars) takeover of the UK's
biggest and richest football club.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to announce the deal on Wednesday,
Martin Edwards, chief executive of Manchester United, said: "The
most exciting aspect of this deal is that it forms, what I
believe will prove to be, one of the great partnerships in sport
and ensures Manchester United maintains its position as the
leader in football."
</P>
<P>
Mark Booth, chief executive of BSkyB, said: "A lot of things
have been said since this story leaked and I am very sympathetic
to that.
</P>
<P>
"Our interests are 100% aligned with the Manchester United
fans.They want to win the league, so do we. They want to win the
cup, so do we. They want to have the best manager and players and
so do we.
</P>
<P>
They don't want us to do thing that will change their club in
a negative way... and we won't."
</P>
<P>
Booth added: "The response we have had at Sky has actually
been very positive. We would not have embarked on this if we
didn't think what we were going to do was completely consistent
with the interests of the fans. We are going to do everything
possible to make sure that is done."
</P>
<P>
Martin Edwards said: "As regards to supporters who said I have
betrayed them, I have been a supporter of Manchester United since
1958, my father and I have been running this club for the last 33
years and I believe what we have done today has strengthened
Manchester United, not weakened it."
</P>
<P>
"We have certainly not betrayed our supporters. What we have
done is secured a safe future and a more prosperous future for
them going forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
Booth went on to say: "We are delighted we will have a stake
in the game that we love. Together we can create a fantastic
business for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
He pledged that BSkyB would carry on showing the same number
of live Premier League games, 60 a year.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the method by which the games are chosen
would not be changed and that pay per view Manchester United
games will not replace games covered by a contract with the

<HEADLINE> Security Council Suspends Review on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council decided on Wednesday not to conduct the review on Iraq
scheduled for October and any further such reviews until Iraq
rescinds its decision of non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on August 5 decided to suspend cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission for disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM, requesting
its restructuring to reduce what it calls the American influence.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sanctions on Iraq, imposed since 1990 after its invasion
of Kuwait, will not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The council in a resolution adopted on Wednesday reaffirms
its full support for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his
efforts to urge Iraq to rescind its decision.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, drafted by Costa, Britain and the U.S., said
the council expressed its readiness to consider Iraq's compliance
with all U.N. resolutions once Iraq has rescinded its decision and
demonstrated that it is prepared to fulfil all its obligations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Soars Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surged
against the yen Wednesday as Japan cut deeply its interest rates
to help stimulate that country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Although the interest rate cut also helped the dollar against
the German mark, the dollar couldn't sustain its gains and fell
against major European currencies. The dollar dipped to fresh
four-month lows against the yen and nearly 10-month lows against
the German mark.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican peso fell to yet another all-time low.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was traded as 137.00 yen,
up from 132.10 yen late Tuesday. After the interest rate
announcement, the dollar rose above 138 yen.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also declined to 1.7215 marks, down from
1.7285. During trading, the dollar fell to 1.7172, a level last
seen in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
In late trading in both Mexico City and New York, the dollar
rose to a record 10.3200 pesos, up from 10.2400 pesos in New York
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Japan cut a major interest rate Wednesday from 0.5
percent to 0.25 percent in an attempt to bring in more cash to
capital-starved banks.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday: 1.4127 Swiss francs, down from 1.4142; 5.7730 French
francs, down from 5.7950; 1,699.00 Italian lire, down from
1,706.35; and 1.5234 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5218.

The British pound was quoted at 1.6672 U.S. dollars, down from

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Aid for Refugees in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration
released 20 million U.S. dollars in aid for refugees in
violence-torn Kosovo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The money, added to an earlier contribution of 11 million U.S.
dollars, will go to U.N. and private agencies providing food and
shelter for refugees in the province, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is seeking 54 million U.S. dollars worldwide
to help avert a humanitarian crisis in Kosovo
</P>
<P>
White House officials with Clinton in Orlando, Florida,
announced that the new aid comes from the U.S. Emergency Refugee
and Migration Assistance fund, which the president may draw upon.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 265,000 refugees have been displaced due to Serb
attacks on Kosovar Albanian villages, and Western government and
private groups fear thousands could die without assistance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Julia V. Taft, assistant
secretary of state for refugee and migration affairs, said none of
the funding would go to Serb authorities, blamed by U.S. officials
for the flight of refugees into mountainous areas and for
hindering relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
"No amount of aid is going to be... able to avert this
catastrophe unless the authorities pull back and allow access in a
secure environment," Taft told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Describing her recent trip to Kosovo, Taft said, "An area which
has been the most densely populated of all the Balkans was
virtually empty. It's empty because of the aggressive attacks by
the Serbian security forces, maliciously attacking village after
village."
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, a top officer of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) said in Washington that it could send 50,000
troops into Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo to keep peace if a
ceasefire is agreed upon between the parties.
</P>
<P>
Reports said U.S. negotiators had presented both sides in the
Kosovo conflict with a draft of an interim agreement incorporating
principles of self-government in the Albanian-dominated province.
</P>
<P>
But the question of a ceasefire remained a major stumbling
block, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Lopez, based in Naples, Italy, as commander of NATO forces in
southern Europe with responsibility for Kosovo, said that a
diplomatic solution is still the first choice.
</P>
<P>
"We prefer that there will be a diplomatic solution so that
there won't be that necessity" to send in U.S. and other troops,
he said.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Fall with Renewed Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Concerns that Wall Street was
not holding on to Tuesday's massive gains and renewed fears about
Japan's financial system weighed heavily on European markets,
despite the boost given by a surprise interest rate cut in Japan.
</P>
<P>
London shares were left apparently bruised by Wall Street, as
New York's Dow Jones index pulled back from Tuesday's surge and
deprived UK shares of support.
</P>
<P>
The leading FTSE 100 ended the day down 33 at 5311, having
ranged between 5365 and 5256. Volume was a moderate 805m shares
traded.
</P>
<P>
London traders were surprised that the Dow's record one-day
points rise, which saw the industrials index add 5 percent
Tuesday, failed to inspire any buying this morning.
</P>
<P>
Dealers instead concentrated on weaker Asian markets, although
a surprise interest rate cut by the Bank of Japan briefly inflated
City share prices at mid-morning.
</P>
<P>
After a volatile start, which seemed to have City dealers
chasing shadows, the DJIA settled down to a 100-point deficit as
London's books were closing.
</P>
<P>
"All markets need to test the downside after a rally and even
after yesterday's gains in the U.S., the charts don't look
particularly good," Charterhouse's Robert Dickson was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, Germany's Dax fell more than 2 percent following
declines in Tokyo's Nikkei index and Wall Street as caution
returned to the market.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax was down 137.18 points, to 4958 - below the 5000
level. Traders said that bank shares were weaker over continued
worries about their exposure to Russia.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the Cac 40 blue-chip index was down 41.61 points at
3,762. Shares were affected by decline on Wall Street after its
nearly 5 percent gain on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An 1 percent lower close on the Tokyo market also worried
investors, bringing fears about Asia back to the fore.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd session of the
General Assembly of the United Nations opened here Wednesday
afternoon with the participation of the delegates from all its 185
Member States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session, Dr Didier Opertti Badan, the
newly-elected President of the General Assembly said the United
Nations has been there for more than five decades and it has
assumed many new responsibilities in the course of the changing
world.
</P>
<P>
Opertti said the United Nations is today facing special
challenges, including the serious disruptions on financial markets
and their adverse effects on national economies, the dramatic
resurgence of acts of terrorism, the drugs and its pernicious
influence, the increase in international crimes and the security
of citizens, protection of nature and environment, development
assistance and the reform of itself.
</P>
<P>
The President said these challenges can only be met if all the
Member States fulfill their commitments, demonstrate their
political will and go beyond their narrow positions in seeking to
achieve the necessary agreements and understanding on wide range of
pressing problems.
</P>
<P>
The current session will mainly focus on the themes of the
international peace and security, the reform of the Security
Council of the United Nations, the financial crisis facing the
United Nations, nuclear disarmament, the development assistance
and the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two-week long general debate will begin at September 21
when delegates from 181 Member States will state their
positions on relevant international issues.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) Independent Counsel Sends Report to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr Wednesday sent the U.S. Congress a report and two vanloads
of supporting evidence of possible impeachable offenses by
President Bill Clinton, posing the gravest threat to a president
since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
The vans carrying the report of several hundred pages and 36
boxes of documents arrived at the Capitol about 4 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The move came just hours after four Judiciary Committee aides
spoke with Starr's office, the first contact between the
prosecutor and the panel since the Monica Lewinsky inquiry began
in late January.
</P>
<P>
The report was expected to lay out evidence of possible
obstruction of justice, perjury, witness tampering and abuse of
power by Clinton in his effort to conceal an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker Newt Gingrich met with leaders
from both parties to prepare for dealing with the report.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he expected the report would be sent to a secure
room and kept from inspection until the House passed a resolution
on how the materials would be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected such a resolution to be introduced in the
House Rules Committee Thursday and brought to the full House
Friday. "None of us would have access to that room until after we
passed that resolution on the House floor," Gingrich said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Improves Food Aid Operation in S. Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. aid agencies said
Wednesday they are taking new measures to help ensure relief food
reaching the neediest people in famine-hit Bhar el Ghazal, in
southern Sudan, where the hunger is expected to last another one
year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) has decided to raise the
number of field staff to 125 from 25 at the beginning of this
year and 85 currently.
</P>
<P>
"To continue reducing the number of hunger-related deaths,
food aid must reach the mouths of those intended -- the hungriest
and the poorest" through improved food distribution systems, said
the Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), the coordinator of U.N. aid
operations to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The OLS also said the U.N. will continue to expand the number
of distribution centers and maintain the quantity of food
distributed in Bahr el Ghazal at the targeted level of 9,000 tons
per month.
</P>
<P>
The number of supplementary and therapeutic feeding centers
will be raised to cover 80,000 children, doubling the current
40,000.
</P>
<P>
Food distribution will also become more frequently, where
possible on a weekly basis, said the OLS in a statement issued
jointly with the Sudanese Relief and Rehabilitation Association
at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
However, "it is ultimately up to the southern Sudanese to
ensure that relief assistance reaches the people," the statement
said, adding that the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army is
taking "strong and significant steps" to curb looting of aid food
in the famine region.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet Approves Host-Country Accord for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The German cabinet Wednesday
approved an agreement which would serve as the legal framework to
facilitate the smooth running of the European Central Bank (ECB)
in its host country, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which outlines the administrative and legal
relations between the Frankfurt-based ECB and Germany, stipulates
among other things that ECB would not be subject to German
financial market supervision in order to safeguard its
legally-guaranteed independence.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, which still has to be approved by the German
parliament, the bank cannot be searched by German police or
financial regulators without the permission from the bank's
president.
</P>
<P>
"The ECB's independence is even more strongly anchored through
international law than that of the German central bank," said
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
They also assured that ECB's independence along with the
European Stability and Growth Pact would help make the planned
single European currency, the euro, as strong as the German mark.
</P>
<P>
The record low interest and inflation rates in Europe as well
as the stable European currencies amid recent international
financial turbulences all pointed to the public trust already
enjoyed by the euro before its launching on January 1, 1999, the
two ministers said.
</P>
<P>
The ECB has already been in operation since January this year.
</P>
<P>
As the new monetary watchdog for 11 European Union countries
that will introduce the euro in the first wave, the bank will take
over the power from member countries' national central banks to
set the common monetary policies and common interest rates for the
whole euro zone.

<HEADLINE> London's Royal Opera House Set to Close for Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Royal Opera House
(ROH) Wednesday announced it would close for a year to cut costs
and put its affairs in order.
</P>
<P>
The opera company, which has been in a 13 million pound (21
million U.S. dollar) debt and a string of management crises, said
it would stop performing in January 1999 and resume in December
1999.
</P>
<P>
"The days for fudging are long past. The Board is sad at the
pain this will cause to our workforce but only a total
restructuring will achieve real results," said Opera House
chairman Colin Southgate.
</P>
<P>
He said the radical plan included a "significant reduction" in
the 560-strong workforce, more flexible working contracts for
performers and backstage staff and cheaper tickets when the opera
house reopens.
</P>
<P>
The ROH is Britain's most highly subsidized arts institution,
receiving a 15 million pound (24 million dollar) annual grant. But
the company came within a week of bankruptcy last November and
Southgate put its current deficit at 13 million pounds, rising to
25 million (40 million dollars) by March 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Covent Garden site is currently undergoing reconstruction
and the ballet and opera companies have been touring and
performing in other London theaters for the past year.
</P>
<P>
The government had promised the Opera House "substantial"
additional funding once it started putting on opera again in the
new building in December 1999, Southgate said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President Disappointed by Victoria Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu has expressed disappointment about the summit
held early this week in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, over the war in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from the summit Tuesday night, Bizimungu
accused countries backing DRC President Laurent Kabila to have
failed to understand the real issues in Congo (k) and have
defended the embattled president at all cost.
</P>
<P>
He said that the idea of cease-fire was proposed during the
Non-Aligned Movement summit held in Durban, South Africa, which
also suggested that a neutral force should be put in place to
monitor the cease-fire, and help both belligerents to
negotiate, the Rwandan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, obstacles have emerged," Bizimungu told
reporters at the Kanombe international airport, hinting at the
fact that Kabila's coalition turned the Congolese war into the
problem of foreign invasion.
</P>
<P>
"Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and even Zambia later affirmed that
the conflict in Congo was is not Congolese, that Congo was
invaded, and therefore that there should be no talks with the
rebels," Bizimungu charged.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that this stand was imposed to other
South African Development Community (SADC)members, before Rwanda
was invited to attend the new summit in Victoria Falls.
</P>
<P>
He said Kabila and his allies tried their best to affirm
that the Congolese crisis is not a problem between Congolese
people themselves.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted that rebels fighting to oust Kabila were
mistreated and were not heard about their views on the on-going
crisis.

JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Botswana
Wednesday announced an increase in the bank rate to 12.5 percent
from the 11.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The change was retrospective as it was effective as from
September 3, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The bank said year-on-year inflation in South Africa was
beginning to rise and was expected to increase further. Given the
close trade relations between the two countries, it was
imperative to preempt the buildup of inflationary pressures in
Botswana.
</P>
<P>
The three commercial banks announced increased prime rates of
14 percent and said other lending and deposit rate would also be
revised.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Refugees in Liberia Want to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 Sierra Leonean
refugees in Liberia have accused the international relief
community of neglecting them and appealed for help to enable them
return home, a report from Monrovia said.
</P>
<P>
"We are tired of living in Liberia and refugees without
adequate food and medicine from the international relief
community, and so we want to go home," a spokesman for the
refugees said in an interview published in The Inquirer
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Edwin Jah, spokesman for the refugees at the Sinje camp, 70
kilometers west of capital Monrovia, appealed to the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) to effect their
immediate repatriation.
</P>
<P>
"We are suffering here, and it is about time that we are taken
back home," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Sinje is one of the several camps hosting Sierra Leonean
refugees fleeing fighting between the West African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG and remnant troops of the ousted military junta led
by Major Johnny Paul Koromah.
</P>
<P>
The refugees also accused the UNHCR of increasing their
suffering by transferring another batch of 4,000 refugees from
another camp to Sinje despite "the acute shortage of food."
</P>
<P>
The Panafrican News Agency quoted a UNHCR spokesman, Mike
James as saying that the UNHCR is "trying to find out whether
there is a way their (refugees) intention can be accommodated."

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Probe Results Retained for SADC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho government and
opposition parties remained in the dark on Wednesday night about
the findings of a probe into alleged election fraud, after they
were informed that Southern African Development Community (SADC)
leaders should first have sight of its contents.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Lesotho Deputy
Prime Minister Kelebone Maope as saying that South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki told a government delegation earlier in the
evening that he was unable to present the final report of a
three-nation commission until it was seen by SADC leaders who
were to meet in Mauritius at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with the Lesotho government, which lasted 45
minutes, revolved around procedures on how the findings should be
made public.
</P>
<P>
"You never know what the reaction of various parties will be,
the issue is not only about the findings, but peace and
stability," Maope said.
</P>
<P>
SADC leaders should be informed of the contents first, so that
they could prepare for any eventualities.
</P>
<P>
The government was happy with the way Mbeki and other members
of the SADC troika (South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe) handled
the matter, Maope said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether a delayed announcement would not increase
tension in the capital, he said this would not be the case as the
findings would still not be public.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy
(LCD), Mbeki went into talks with the opposition alliance, who
initially made the claim that the May 23 polls were rigged.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Mbeki flew to Maseru, where he was joined by Botswana
Foreign Minister Mompati Merafhe and Zimbabwe's high commissioner
to Maseru for a briefing by judge Pius Langa, who headed the
three-nation commission.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which was initially scheduled for 30 minutes
lasted more than three hours.
</P>
<P>
Director-general in Mbeki's office, Frank Chikane, told
reporters in Cape Town before Mbeki's departure that South Africa
had not taken extra security precautions.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that the leadership of Lesotho will handle this
matter in a way that will actually stabilize the situation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, South Africa deployed more troops along the Lesotho
border, although the army described this as part of normal border
control operations.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been wracked by political instability since last
month, when opposition supporters began protesting against the
LCD's landslide victory in the general election.
</P>
<P>
At least six people have died since the protests began on
August 4.
</P>
<P>
Following the intervention of the SADC troika, the Lesotho
government and opposition parties agreed to an independent probe,
and undertook to abide by the findings of its report.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been
ranked 89th out of 174 countries in terms of human development,
the highest in southern Africa, in a United Nations report
released in the Netherlands Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The UN Human Development Report 1998 ranked Canada first in
health, education levels and standard of living, followed by
France, Norway, the United States, Iceland, Finland, the
Netherlands, Japan, New Zealand and Sweden, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The human development indicator (HDI) measures achievements in
longevity, knowledge and a decent standard of living, taking into
account life expectancy, educational attainment, and adjusted
income.
</P>
<P>
Most African countries were ranked relatively low in the HDI
statistics. The only African countries to beat South Africa were
the East African island nations of the Seychelles, ranked 56th,
Mauritius at 61st, and North Africa's Algeria (82nd).
</P>
<P>
The bottom ten placings were assigned to mostly African
countries: Gambia, Mozambique, Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia,

<HEADLINE> House Construction in regression in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 9 (Xinhua) -- House construction has been
in regression in Romania, with only 6,332 houses put into use
during the first half of this year, according to the National
Commission of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The high costs of the building materials, the population's
dwindling financial abilities are causes for the present state of
the house construction, local analysts said.
</P>
<P>
One million houses deficit is scored in Romania at present. The
young and the jobless are seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Public Works and Land Planning Nicolae Noica was
quoted earlier this year as estimating that the state would
allocate about 45 million U.S. dollars for the completion of
unfinished apartments.
</P>
<P>
But in the first six months of this year, "the state and the
local budgets did not finance the construction of any flat in 29
of the country's 41 counties," a report of the daily Adevarul said
on Wednesday."

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urged to See Sub-Sahara Africa as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank should
see Sub-Sahara Africa as a development partner and not as a lost
region, a Nigerian banker said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lawson Omokhodion, General Manager of All States Trust Bank,
was speaking at a pre-1998 World Bank/IMF annual meetings forum
held here.
</P>
<P>
He urged the two financial institutions to involve more of
African consultants and experts in African projects instead of
leaving them in dark.
</P>
<P>
The banker suggested that efforts must be made to avoid unduly
complex, advanced technology based projects in Africa, simple
designs that rely more on labor than capital inputs would serve
the region well.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the forum is "conflicts in policy formulation and
implementation between developing economies and the World Bank:
what are the solutions?"
</P>
<P>
Referring to the implementation of Structural Adjustment
Program (SAP), he said that more than 30 countries had embarked
on SAP economic reforms in Africa and yet today after nearly two
decades the number of the very poor in Sub-Sahara Africa run to
over 250 million, more than 50 percent of the region's
population.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Africa has little or no degree of freedom in
implementing the World Bank sponsored SAP. "African countries led
on by the nose to adjust, in a program that was imposed on them
at gun point, are being denied the resources to ensure its
minimal success," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Omokhodion pointed out that the World Bank developed and
adopted one and only one adjustment model for the African
countries without studying the local peculiarities of each
country and paying little or no respect for domestic expertise.
</P>
<P>
"What developed was a master-servant relationship between the
Bank and African civil servants and the overbearing influence of
the Bank effectively castrated local opinion and view points," he
added.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Nigerian banker noted, "no country that has
gone through an adjustment program is better off today than
before the program."

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Opposition Rejects Mbeki Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho opposition parties
Wednesday night rejected a proposal by South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki that the findings of a probe into alleged electoral fraud
should first be seen by regional leaders, not the Lesotho people.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki announced earlier Wednesday night that the contents of the
report by a three-nation commission should be seen first by Southern
African Development Community (SADC) heads of state at the Mauritius
summit on Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Mbeki came here to make public the findings of the (Pius) Langa
commission, why then turn around and say the report will first have to
be presented to the SADC leaders?" opposition spokeswoman Monica
Mopeli said.
</P>
<P>
"He should not make us fools, because we have been waiting for the
results."
</P>
<P>
Opposition representatives and the SADC troika -- South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe -- were still trying to thrash out their
differences.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki had told the meeting that the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy agreed to the proposal, Mopeli said.
</P>
<P>
Another complicating factor had been the unexpected arrival of two
political parties, who were not involved in the initial campaign to
have the election results annulled.
</P>
<P>
"These parties were not even involved in the Langa commission
probe. The question is who invited them here today, and what do they
want?"
</P>
<P>
There was no indication of how long the meeting would last.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel Sends Report to Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr Wednesday sent Congress a report along with two vanloads of
supporting evidence of possible impeachable offenses by President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton apologized again Wednesday for his behavior
with former intern Monica Lewinsky, first in a meeting with a
group of Congressional Democrats at the White House and then at a
public appearance in Florida.
</P>
<P>
The vans carrying the report of several hundred pages and 36
boxes of documents arrived at the Capitol in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The report was expected to lay out evidence of possible
obstruction of justice, perjury, witness tampering and abuse of
power by Clinton in his effort to conceal an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day Gingrich met with leaders from both parties
to prepare for handling the report.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said he expected the report would be sent to a secure
room and kept from inspection until the House passed a resolution
on how the materials would be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected such a resolution to be introduced in the
House Rules Committee Thursday and brought to the full House
Friday. "None of us would have access to that room until after we
passed that resolution on the House floor," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
In Florida, Clinton told an audience, "I let you down. I let my
family down. I let this country down. But I'm trying to make it
right. I'm determined to never let anything like that happen
again. I'm determined to redeem the trust of people," according to
news reports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Clinton made an apology in the White House residence to
a group of leading House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
"Next to declaring war, this may be the most important thing we
do so we have to do it right," Gephardt said in a joint news
conference. "We have to do it objectively, fairly and in a
nonpartisan way. I think we have a good start today."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said, "It is a constitutional process that requires
judgment that is based in fact," not politics.
</P>
<P>
"Any impeachment cannot succeed unless it is done in bipartisan
or nonpartisan way," said Representative Henry Hyde, a Republican
and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Conyers, ranking Democrat on the committee,
cautioned that impeachment proceedings were not a given. "We are
not planning for impeachment," he said, suggesting disagreement
between Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the White House meeting between Clinton and
congressional Democrats, Representative David Bonior,
second-ranking member of the House, said Clinton "wants to carry
on with the business of the country but he clearly understands, I
think, the deep pain he has caused his family, his colleagues, the
people he works with, members of Congress and the country."
</P>
<P>
Bonior said there was no discussion of impeachment or
resignation. "I think the president will certainly be able to
continue in office," he told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Bonior said Clinton's meeting with Democrats was very emotional
and it was clear "that he felt the pain, and he felt it very
strongly.... What we saw was a father, a husband, the leader of
our country who was contrite, who was very sorry for his actions."
