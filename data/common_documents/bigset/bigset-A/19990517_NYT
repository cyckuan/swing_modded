BURNS'S MOVES PUT SPRINGIN THEIR STEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The grit was obvious. The passion was there, almost as
if there is a switch that every coach tells his player doesn't
exist. The Bruins played their way back into their playoff series
vs. Buffalo Sunday with that ol' tyme hockey that has kept Bruins
fans flocking to Causeway Street, ever-faithful, ever-hoping, since
the time of Eddie Shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys had to reach down,'' said Don Sweeney, ``and see what
they had inside.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the subtext and near-delirium of a fine afternoon of
hockey, it must not be lost that grit, grinding, and passion _ the
cliches of the game that do matter _ were hardly the sole
contributing factors to the Bruins putting some meaning back into
what had become a sorry washout of a series.
</P>
<P>
   After watching three games of lackluster play, coach Pat Burns
shook up his line combinations and made a key insertion on defense,
adding the quick-and-mobile Mattias Timander to the blue line. At
one point, Burns also made Kyle McLaren a left winger on the power
play. We'll say that again, just in case you thought your typist
has slipped into postseason dementia: McLaren played up front on a
five-on-four advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my job _ I had to go out and do it,'' said McLaren.
``I'm basically a big body, and that's what (Burns) wanted, go in
there, make some traffic and take the punishment. I know what it is
to take it, because I'm usually the one dishing it out.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaren didn't poke one home on the power play, nor did he set
up a goal. Not every move works according to the grand plan, in
this case a grand plan born in the truth of a 3-1 series deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only change we made,'' said Burns, ``was desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, of course. Oh, the Bruins played with desperation, and
that was different, but the different deployment of the bodies made
the key difference of the day. Different folks were taking
different strokes, and from there the emotion, and the grit and
that ol' tyme whatchamacallit began to ooze out of those Black 'n
Gold uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was the Timander factor. Right now, this is
simply a better team with Timander playing than it is with either
Grant Ledyard or Darren Van Impe (injured) in uniform. Timander
lacks some experience and isn't the grittiest guy going, but he is
a fluid skater and has a pretty impressive shot off the point.
</P>
<P>
   With a little Michael Jackson moonwalking move (sorry you Fred
Astaire fans), Timander stopped a Buffalo clearing attempt midway
through the second period, moved toward the slot, and belted a high
slapper past Dominik Hasek for a 3-1 lead. Maybe Van Impe or
Ledyard could have made that play, too, but the reality is neither
got the job done when he had his chance to do it. It was someone
else's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Timander ranks as one of those NHL/AHL guys who finds himself
down on the Boston food chain, slotted below the likes of Dave
Ellett, Van Impe, and Ledyard. Maybe it was desperation that got
him in the lineup. Whatever it is/was, he should be back there.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Burns's whole shake-and-bake approach to his
forward lines. He attempted to turn things over some in Game 4 when
he put Jason Allison between Steve Heinze and Anson Carter _ Joe
Thornton's usual wingmen. Thornton instead had Landon Wilson and
Sergei Samsonov. Those lines might have brought some spark, too,
but Thornton had to exit early after running head-first into Vaclav
Varada's knee, and the night quickly dissolved into one of the
worst postseason showings in recent Bruins history.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr wearing the spoked B
would have made much of a difference that night, noted Allison. The
Boston cause was that shapeless, spiritless, hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5, Burns kept running through line combinations as if he
were standing at the Convenient Mart lottery machine before the
night's $74 million drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened:
</P>
<P>
   1. Sweeney scored the tying goal (1-1) with help from Samsonov
and Tim Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   2. To start the second, Samsonov connected for the go-ahead goal
off some heady forechecking work by, guess who, Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov is the most gifted stickhandler on the Boston roster.
Suddenly, he found himself playing on a line with Taylor and
DiMaio, two-thirds of the club's voracious checking line (P.J.
Axelsson, the other third, plugged into whatever line needed a
right wing). A virtual spare part for much of the series,
Samsonov's value and effectiveness rose immeasurably with his new
steel-chinned linemates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to get the puck,'' said Burns, recognizing the fact
that the Sabres rendered Samsonov useless by tying up the speedy
winger's previous centers. ``You play with those two guys, you get
the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with elimination, there finally was some inventiveness in
the Boston game. What next, Hal Gill parked in the slot, a la Tim
Kerr, on the power play? Will we see Sweeney playing like Reijo
Ruotsalainen, one second a defenseman, the next doing Curly Howard
360s around the cage? Doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was certain: Had Burns used the same ol', same ol'
lineup Sunday, and used it the same ol', same ol' way, then those
guys would be cleaning out their lockers at the Vault this morning,
after one more same ol', same ol' conclusion to the Bruins' season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of different line combintions,'' said
Allison, who poked home his second goal of the series _ and
postseason _ with 43 seconds to play. Oh, and Axelsson had the key
assist with a muscle shot at the left post. ``I don't think the
combinations matter too much on our team, because all the guys play
on different lines all year.''
</P>
<P>
   From that diversity, came strength, with a little emotion tossed
into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what your line is, who you're playing with,'' said
Allison, ``you have to come out with passion and pride. And we did
that.''

LIBRARY HOLDS WEALTH OF FELINE FACTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DONNA HUFFAKER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Welcome to all things cat.
</P>
<P>
   Cat astrology. Cat psychiatry. Cat anatomy. Cat photography.
Kitty history. Kitty litter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you want to know why your whiskered pet prefers napping
on a book shelf to snoozing on a sofa cushion or you just have an
affinity for felines, The Cat Collection at Glendale Central
Library will appease even the most finicky of readers and
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   With 30,000 items, including books, magazines, journals, art and
photographs, the rare collection is touted as the world's largest,
said Nora Goldsmith, a library manager who oversees the special
collections department.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat Collection lines scores of shelves in the reference room
with nearly 6,000 books. Its broad range reaches beyond the
second-largest public cat collection at Yale, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The collection at Yale's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript
Library, which began in the 1950s with a personal donation,
features 3,000 literary works about cats, said Patricia Willis,
curator of Yale's Collection of American Literature. Unlike the
Glendale collection, which widens a little each month, the Yale
library no longer accepts materials, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, nine miles north of the L.A. Civic Center, there
are books on cat spiritualism, complete with tarot cards to discern
kitty karma and ``unlock the mysteries'' of their nine lives. Books
on cat yoga, to help relax furry friends. Books of cat photographs
and books about taking cat photographs. And in case you're at all
worried about the relationship with your persnickety pet, ``You're
OK. Your Cat's OK.'' will help you establish a meaningful
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The library recently received a $600 donation and another load
of published cat material from the estate of Roberta Billig, the
88-year-old cat connoisseur who, with her late husband, Harvey
Billig, amassed volumes of cat breeding and research materials in
the 1940s. When their collections outgrew their space, the Billigs
donated them to the Glendale library in the mid-1950s. Thus began
the library's cat collection.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Billig was an orthopedic surgeon who studied the
movements of cats to aid his research of polio, said Lee Argabrite,
the Billigs' granddaughter. One day, he brought two Siamese cats
home with him, and their meowing stole her grandmother's heart,
Argabrite said this week from her home outside of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she had up to 31 cats in her house, including
kittens,'' Argabrite said. ``She just really loved cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Billig was so moved by the agile animals that she and
her husband rallied other cat aficionados and formed the Jewel City
Cat Club in 1964. The club, still in existence today, sponsored cat
shows. Roberta Billig ended up being a cat show judge, even flying
to Tokyo for a contest, Argabrite said.
</P>
<P>
   Billig collected books on breeding that dated to the 1890s,
Goldsmith said.
</P>
<P>
   But the oldest book in The Cat Collection is a German-printed
``Puss in Boots,'' published in 1823. Goldsmith retrieved the
delicate, time-worn treasure from a locked cabinet. It, like the
rest of the collection, is listed in the computerized card catalog.
It may not be removed from the special collections room, however.
</P>
<P>
   The rare German book is part of a 2,000-piece collection
accumulated by the late Marianne Sisk Stewart, a former L.A.
resident, cat lover and book collector.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, also a member of the city's cat club, left her personal
collection to the library in 1997. It was presented to the city in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The sizes of Stewart's collectible books are as varied as their
content, Goldsmith said, noting the smallest one is 1 and one-half
inches tall and the largest is 24 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything else like it,'' Patricia Anne Kovacs,
a member of the Jewel City Cat Club said of Glendale's prized
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old Los Angeles resident said she's one of the
younger cat club members. Glendale's sea of cat materials could
answer virtually any question about felines, she said. Not to
mention, it provides quite a history of breeding and genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a chair with Tinker, one of her four cats, Kovacs said
the group today focuses on raising money for small organizations
that support spaying and neutering pets. She is one of about 20
members in the club who meet once every two months.
</P>
<P>
   The cat enthusiast has read books from the Glendale collection
over the years, she said, adding it is thrilling to know she's part
of a club that made the Billigs' treasures available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   People use the collection as a reference source to answer a cat
question or just to find rare literature on cats, both alley and
domestic, Goldsmith said. Sometimes people pop in on a Saturday
with stumpers like, ``How many bones are in a cat's tail?'' A quick
check of any of the anatomy books leads to the answer: 22.
</P>
<P>
   Cats, much like the diverse collection, are all different from
one another in some way, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what you're getting when you get a cat. But
you're going to like it,'' she said.

MERGER IS SEEN OF TWO MAKERS OF FARM GEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Case Corp. and New Holland N.V., two of the
world's largest makers of farm and construction equipment, are
expected to announce plans to merge on Monday, people who have been
briefed on the talks said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   According to those close to the negotiations, Fiat S.p.A. in
Italy, which owns 71 percent of New Holland, a Dutch company based
in London, would pay about $55 a share in cash for Case, an
estimated $4 billion, and merge it with New Holland. Fiat would
become the majority shareholder in the new company, which is
expected to be renamed.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would create a company with more than $12 billion in
revenue, mostly in the United States and Europe, and forge a much
stronger competitor to Deere &AMP; Co., the world's largest maker of
farm equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes at a tough time for companies involved in the
agriculture sector, which has been beset by low commodity prices
and weaker demand for American crops and farm equipment worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Case, based in Racine, Wis., has seen a sharp drop in profit
over the last few quarters despite strong demand for its
construction equipment. The new company would be based in Racine
and be headed by Jean-Pierre Rosso, the chief executive at Case,
people close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that Case and New Holland were in talks came last
week when shares of Case and New Holland climbed. A spokesman at
Case refused comment on Sunday; officials at New Holland could not
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, Case, which was spun off from Tenneco
Inc. in 1994, would be part of a company that is almost as big as
Deere, which is based in Moline, Ill., and had sales of about $13
billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Case had sales of about $6.1 billion and earnings after
taxes of $160 million, down from $403 million in 1997. New Holland
had sales of $5.7 billion and earnings after taxes of $298 million
in 1998, down from $477 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, shares of Case rose $2, to $44.8125, on the New York
Stock Exchange; shares of New Holland fell 43.75 cents, to
$17.5625.

AIDS ACTIVIST GOES FROM VERBAL BOMB-THROWER TO QUIETER PERSUADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He was a verbal ``bomb-thrower'' with ACT-UP, an AIDS
activist whose tools of the trade were dramatic civil disobedience
and protest.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Steve Johnson has been wearing a suit and tie, meeting
with bureaucrats and elected officials to affect change through
more traditional means _ lobbying in the marble halls of Olympia,
Wash., and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of Johnson, 35, who resigned Friday after
three-and-a-half years as director of policy for the Northwest AIDS
Foundation, in many ways mirrors how AIDS as a social and political
issue has changed in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on fire back then,'' Johnson said of his ACT-UP days.
``We could turn out hundreds of people at demonstrations at a
moment's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early '90s, members of ACT-UP were the
unpredictable guerrilla fighters in the war against AIDS. The
Northwest AIDS Foundation was often treated by Johnson and others
in ACT-UP as an adversary, a stodgy consensus-oriented organization
that needed constant prodding.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and other activists would often target individuals,
using publicity as a weapon to get what they wanted. When property
owners fought a plan for an assisted living residence for people
with AIDS, the activists showed up at a social event, screaming
epithets and eventually embarrassing them into backing down.
</P>
<P>
   Street demonstrations, disruption of meetings and a very
un-Northwest style of angry public speaking were the order of the
day. Even health officials, doctors, scientists and others who were
also fighting AIDS became targets if they failed to adhere to the
activists' manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have any regrets, it would be that I was too focused on
the issue at the time to be able to step back and realize that good
people can come to different conclusions,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was basically a bomb thrower,'' said Robert Rohan, a
Seattle attorney and one of the founders of the AIDS Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Rohan said he opposed Johnson joining the foundation years ago
because he thought Johnson would, like some activists, simply
continue to throw verbal bombs and make a scene. Not that dramatic
activism doesn't have its place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what they did was focus attention on what was needed
for people with AIDS,'' Rohan said. ``What Steve and the others did
often had a positive effect ... I just didn't think he would adjust
to working on the inside after attacking from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Stone, executive director of the AIDS Foundation, said
Johnson has done more than adjust. Stone credits Johnson with
helping energize the organization, move it in new directions and
effectively changing his tactics to accomplish the same goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all had to learn how to operate differently as well,''
Stone said. New HIV drug therapies that have extended the lives of
people, along with the changing demographics of AIDS (more women,
minorities and young people), have altered the political and social
nature of AIDS, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the promising new therapies, Stone said, there is
still no cure or vaccine. People are still getting infected, he
said, and still having problems with access to health care,
discrimination and privacy concerns
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work still to be done,'' Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agreed, noting he's already lined up work with the San
Francisco AIDS Foundation doing lobbying in Sacramento on some of
the same issues he's worked on in Seattle _ assuring privacy in
tracking HIV cases and advocating for hypodermic needle exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   But he may move away from AIDS advocacy, he said. After a decade
of AIDS activism, Johnson wants to focus more on his personal life.
He's leaving Seattle because his partner recently left the
University of Washington radiology department to take a job in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson may not remain with AIDS issues forever, but he'll
likely remain an activist of sorts. His activism appears to be
ingrained, first appearing when he was in elementary school in
Lewiston, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``At school, I started a petition drive against chicken fried
steak,'' he laughed. ``The cooks were just devastated because I got
hundreds of signatures. I felt terrible that I had hurt their
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of principle, Johnson also once broke somebody's
arm. While studying at the University of Oregon, someone wrote an
anonymous letter to his mother, claiming he had had sex with
Johnson and infected him with HIV. His mother hadn't known he was
gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt her terribly,'' Johnson said. He discovered that the
letter-writer was a jealous acquaintance of a friend, went over to
his house and beat him up. ``I broke his arm .. I couldn't believe
it. I'd never done anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he has always preferred the persuasive power of
words to physical force. He has come to prefer behind-the-scenes
discussions to making a scene diatribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can come to a solution most of the time if people are
willing to talk to each other,'' Johnson said.

EXPERTS NOW FIND HIM CHARISMATIC CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ There have been 24 Triple Crown bids, 11 of which
have been successful, most recently by Affirmed in 1978. However,
Charismatic has taken a rougher road to the threshold of greatness
than his elite predecessors, including running in claiming races.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic went off 31-1 when he won the Derby May 1, and he
was 8-1 when he took Saturday's Preakness, and the reason was that
many of the bettors, plus many of the selectors, could not get past
the fact that Charismatic twice ran for a $62,500 claiming tag.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, trainer D. Wayne Lukas warned everybody not to
make that mistake, but most did, anyway. ``I know the story line of
the week, all week, is that this horse is a claimer who got lucky
in the Derby,'' admonished Lukas. ``Don't discredit the horse. If
you have to blame somebody, blame me. Don't discredit the horse
because I was foolish enough to run him in claimers.'' Those who
listened to Lukas were rewarded with an $18.80 win mutuel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Charismatic heads for the Belmont June 5, and this time he
will be the favorite. The Belmont is run at a mile and one-half,
too far for all but the sturdiest thoroughbreds, and if there's one
thing Charismatic is, it's sturdy. He's run four races in six weeks
_ Santa Anita Derby (fourth), Lexington Stakes at Keeneland
(first), Kentucky Derby, and Preakness _ and hasn't missed an oat.
``Remember,'' said Lukas, ``I said he was fat. I didn't say he was
slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fact that he took the Preakness with relative ease by
coming around the field, which was totally against the
speed-favoring bias of the Pimlico strip, Charismatic looks strong
for the Belmont because, before he even ran in the Derby, Lukas was
touting him as a Belmont horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the Lewises (owners Bob and Beverly), in April that he
was a Belmont horse,'' said Lukas. ``We'll find out if I was right.
The Belmont is always a concern, we'll watch him, and we'll make
some adjustments. We've got three weeks between races this time,
and that's huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charismatic looks as if he hasn't even run. What I like about
him is that he's developing that devastating move. He's got that
acceleration. He showed a greater turn of foot in the Preakness
than he had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic doesn't have eye-catching speed, but he can run all
day, and that's what wins the Belmont. The bluebloods might have to
move over to make room for a claimer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, the 2-1 Preakness favorite, chased Charismatic home
with a nice rally, but could do no better than second. After the
race, his trainer, Elliott Walden, speculated that he may hold
Menifee out of the Belmont. But Sunday Walden put Menifee back on
the Belmont bandwagon. ``If he's all right, we'll go,'' said
Walden. ``I'll take Menifee back to Churchill Downs for a couple of
weeks, then bring him to Belmont in time to have one work over the
track. I think he'll really like those big turns. He's a big horse.
Wayne's horse is in a zone now. I can't feel bad standing here with
the second-best 3-year-old in the country. If I had to get beat, I
would rather have it be the Derby winner (Menifee was also second
in the Derby). It's beginning to look like it's between the two
horses. I really haven't seen another one that's with them right
now.'' . . . Both Excellent Meeting, the filly who was eased, and
Torrid Sand, who was 11th, suffered a displaced palates. ``We
scoped her and she's OK,'' said Bob Baffert, who trains Excellent
Meeting. ``We think she displaced her palate and lost her air. It
may have happened when Kent (Desormeaux) had to check real hard as
she went under the wire the first time. She seemed to be in
distress later, so he pulled her up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is those claiming affairs, but Charismatic certainly
doesn't frighten anyone. The Derby and Preakness both had full
fields, before scratches, and the Belmont, which allows 16
starters, might draw a full gate as well. In addition to
Charismatic, the connections of Menifee, Badge (third in the
Preakness), Stephen Got Even (fourth), Patience Game (fifth),
Adonis (sixth), and Kimberlite Pipe (eighth), are all interested in
contesting the third jewel of the Triple Crown. Lukas will not run
Cat Thief, who faded to seventh after taking the lead, and will
point him, instead, toward either the Jim Dandy at Saratoga in
August or the Swaps at Hollywood Park in July . . . Lee Ferrell,
22, of Bel Air, Md., the man who went on the track and interfered
with the running of the seventh race on the Preakness card, was
being held Sunday at Baltimore's central booking facility on a
first-degree assault charge. Ferrell initially was taken to Sinai
Hospital for a psychiatric review, but was released Saturday night.

REVOLUTION MUST PROVE METTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A year ago, the Revolution had earned 10
points in eight games and had just embarked on their annual
nine-game losing streak. After a 2-0 loss at Columbus Saturday
night, the Revolution have 7 points in eight games and have not won
a match in regulation time since April 24.
</P>
<P>
   The team has enough elements to likely prevent such a collapse
again, starting with player-coach Walter Zenga, but this is a
crucial time as the Revolution prepare for visits to Los Angeles
Sunday and the MetroStars May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a discouraged team in that locker room,''
Revolution investor Jonathan Kraft said after the game at the new
Crew Stadium. ``They are hungry to get out and play again. When we
get our best 11 out there we will be able to compete with any team
in the league. We need to get everyone full speed and full
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga and assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi have cast the
Revolution as a pragmatic, resourceful team. So far, they have
avoided the lopsided losses that exacerbated problems and led to
crises in confidence. But the Revolution have yet to prove they can
overcome what last year became a combination of an inferiority
complex and unrealistic self-assessment.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of explanations were offered last year about how the
Revolution were not as bad as their record. Now, the only excuse
offered is injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has been preaching patience, since the objective is to
finish the regular season in the top four in the Eastern
Conference, a goal which likely can be attained simply by remaining
organized and maintaining team morale. It also helps greatly to
have Zenga as goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution soon are going to have to demonstrate either
a more effective attack or a more ruthless defense. They seemed
either naive or unmotivated in surrendering an early goal to the
Crew's Jeff Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   After that, a combination of misfortune and resourceful play by
Columbus extended the Revolution scoreless streak to 250 minutes.
Their last goal was on a Joe-Max Moore free kick in a 2-1 loss to
Colorado May 1, and the Revolution have not scored in the run of
play since a 3-2 victory at D.C. United April 24.
</P>
<P>
   John Harkes returned from a sprained right knee ligament for the
final 15 minutes against Columbus, his first Revolution appearance.
Mike Burns (hamstring) and Richard Goulooze (calf) should also
return soon. But the Revolution will have to develop either better
cameraderie or better chemistry when they do.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams also have struggled with injuries. Columbus was
missing Brian McBride (broken cheekbone), but the Crew's attack was
dynamic. Neither Trinidadian defender Ansil Elcock nor Polish
midfielder Robert Warzycha started, but Columbus began the match
with aggressiveness and poise, dictating terms.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first Revolution loss of the season by more than a
goal. How the team responds this week could go far in determining
its fate.

ALL PAIN, NO GAIN FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BLUE JAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It's too late for Red Sox reliever Kip Gross, who had
it made in Japan, to reconsider his decision to sample life again
on this side of the international date line, where he has now come
undone not only in the US but Canada, too.
</P>
<P>
   And after giving up a walkoff, three-run home run to Toronto's
Carlos Delgado in the ninth inning of the Blue Jays' 9-6 win Sunday
over the Red Sox, Gross's next destination is an open question. It
may not be Boston, especially with the Sox in need of another
infielder after third baseman John Valentin couldn't play any
longer on a sore left knee, which he had suffered in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who came out in the fifth inning of a game in which
the Sox were unable to hold leads of 4-1 and 6-4, said he will not
play Monday night and expects to undergo a magnetic resonance
imaging when the club returns home to play the New York Yankees
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin said he has had tendinitis in his knee periodically
dating back to last year, but had said little publicly about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For it to bother me as long as it has, I definitely need to
see if there's anything wrong,'' said Valentin, who was limping
badly after his third-inning double. ``Obviously, it affects your
play. The thing is, I've always played hurt. I don't let a little
pain take me out of a game. So obviously, it's bothering me a whole
bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin's replacement, Jeff Frye, had his own pain to deal with
after taking a fastball off the left elbow from reliever Billy Koch
with the bases loaded in the eighth inning, which accounted for the
sixth Sox run.
</P>
<P>
   Frye, the only backup infielder on Jimy Williams's roster, said
he intends to play Monday night, but the Sox are expected to call
Pawtucket for reinforcements. The Framingham Kid, Lou Merloni, is
most likely to be put on a plane to Toronto for Monday night's
series finale, and Gross qualifies as most expendable if a roster
spot is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hurting,'' said Frye, whose elbow was encased in an ice
pack almost as big as the one wrapped around his surgically
repaired left knee. ``But I'm not coming out unless I physically
can't play. At the time, all I had to do was run, so I figured
hopefully it would loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have anybody else who was really an infielder. I had
to stay in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in the end, did Gross, after Williams had all but emptied
his bullpen with unhappy results, as both Rheal Cormier and Derek
Lowe blew save opportunities. Cormier, who replaced Pat Rapp with a
4-1 lead after the Sox starter walked Shawn Green to open the sixth
inning, gave up a double to Tony Fernandez, a sacrifice fly to
pinch hitter Pat Kelly, and a two-run home run to Jose Cruz Jr.
that tied the score at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jefferson's third home run, off lefty Paul Spoljaric,
restored the Sox lead to 5-4 in the seventh, before singles by
Scott Hatteberg and Darren Lewis and a walk to Jose Offerman
preceded Frye's painful RBI.
</P>
<P>
   While Cormier had been a model of consistency, Lowe has been
maddeningly erratic, and Sunday was no exception. He replaced lefty
Mark Guthrie in the eighth after Delgado hit a rocket off
Offerman's glove in short right field that was scored an error,
then changed to a single.
</P>
<P>
   Damage control? Hardly. Lowe walked Fernandez on four pitches,
and after Hatteberg made an acrobatic catch of Kelly's bunt attempt
behind the plate, he issued another pass to Cruz that loaded the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitter Kevin Witt followed with a turf special, which was
chopped in front of the plate and took an exaggerated bounce past
first baseman Mike Stanley, both runners scoring. Lowe struck out
the next two batters, but having pitched in all three games this
weekend, and throwing 24 pitches Sunday, he was not an option to
pitch the ninth, in Williams's view.
</P>
<P>
   That left Gross, whose presence this spring has come to signal a
Sox loss. Only once in his 11 appearances have the Red Sox won, as
he has been used mostly in a mopup role. On the rare occasion he
has been asked to step out of that role, disaster has struck, most
notably in Oakland, when he made an emergency start and gave up a
first-inning grand slam to Matt Stairs, then three days later gave
up another bomb to Stairs, this one a game-tying home run in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Gross held form Sunday. He walked Alex Gonzalez, threw a wild
pitch, then gave up a hard single to Green, Gonzalez holding at
third. Delgado swung at the first pitch and drove a changeup into
the second deck, just below the Hard Rock Cafe, and just more hard
times for Gross.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like to see what's happened twice now,'' Gross said.
``You definitely want better results. That (expletive). That's
plain ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clubhouse that had begun the day sharing first place with
the Yankees but now had dropped a game behind, there would be no
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to lose a game like this,'' Valentin said. ``We had
an opportunity to win, and let them back in. That's a game we
should have won.''

TVG NETWORK TO MAKE DEBUT JULY 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK GIRARDOT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seldom do the words ``horse racing'' and ``cutting
edge'' appear in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the sport of horse racing is anything but cutting
edge.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change. On July 1, through a multimillion-dollar
partnership formed by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., racetracks
around the country and cable television providers will begin
bringing the races and parimutual wagering into living rooms
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give horse racing a face lift,'' said Tony
Allevato, 33-year-old executive producer at the Television Games
Network, known as TVG. ``Horse racing is going to be ahead of
everybody else for the first time ever.''
</P>
<P>
   TVG viewers will be able to set up an account with the network
and place bets on races through their remote control, via telephone
or through the Internet. TVG executives hope that their system will
pump millions (perhaps billions) of dollars into the sport,
increasing handles and purses while attracting a new generation of
fans.
</P>
<P>
   There are some caveats: Only eight states currently allow
at-home gambling; and there is a bill before the U.S. Senate that
would outlaw Internet gambling altogether. Mark Wilson, TVG's
president has said he hopes those glitches will be corrected soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is walk a tightrope here and grow new
fans and be an entertainment program, not just a bunch of racing
signals crammed together,'' Wilson told Backstretch Magazine. ``I
want to bring new people into this sport.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Allevato has developed a 15-minute pilot for TVG
that is much like ESPN's SportsCenter but focuses exclusively on
racing. When launched in July, the channel will provide 12 hours of
live racing and 12 hours of replays and other programming devoted
solely to horse racing.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually TVG will offer a full 24 hours of live horse racing
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   During any given hour of live airtime, TVG will air four races.
An anchor and an analyst will work the studio providing information
that appeals to the expert and novice alike, Allevato said.
Reporters in the field will interact with the anchors.
</P>
<P>
   Take note: Allevato promises those television personalities
won't be a couple of crusty old track touts reading lines from the
Daily Racing Form. Instead, TVG is in the process of hiring young,
good-looking upstarts who have some working knowledge of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want fresh, young faces,'' Allevato said. ``If you just
show a couple of guys reading out of the Daily Racing Form, that's
not going to get new fans. People are just going to get bored.''
</P>
<P>
   The arcane language of racing will also be eliminated or at
least translated for the casual fan, Allevato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know what we mean when we talk about a
horse's sire and dam,'' Allevato said. ``Instead we're going to
talk about a horse's parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Other innovations will include a computerized race-tracker on
the television screen's upper right-hand corner. The tracker will
show where the pack of horses is during the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one feedback that we're going to get is that the shows are
too light and too full of fluff,'' Allevato said. ``But if we can
pull this off and do it right, it will be the biggest thing to hit
racing.''

CLEMENS, ZIMMER FANS OF FENWAY PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
 PARK-CLEMENS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESSIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Don Zimmer has richer memories of Fenway Park than
Roger Clemens, but the former Red Sox manager and the former Boston
ace both were delighted to learn that the prosposal for a new
Fenway will resemble the old park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fenway is like I am,'' said Zimmer, the Yankees' interim
manager. ``It's old. It's been one of my favorite places in the
world. But I think they need a new ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who was traded to the Yankees from Toronto in the
spring, didn't even know about the proposal until told by a
reporter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' he said. ``Particularly if they get a
new park and try to keep it close (in structure) to the old one.
Fenway Park is one of the last of its kind, especially for guys of
my generation. There are only a couple places left: Detroit, Yankee
Stadium, and obviously Fenway. I still have some dirt off the mound
at Fenway at my home in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, 68, spent seven seasons at Fenway Park, doing two stints
as coach (1974-76, 1992) and four years as manager (1976-80).
During his tenure he developed strong opinions of the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inviting,'' said Zimmer. ``The Wall there has helped some
guys but it hurt a lot of others. Guys who were straightaway
hitters might have tried to become pull hitters. The Green Monster
has probably helped lefthanded hitters more than righthanders just
by them being able to hit the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Fred Lynn hit in Boston? Something high. What did he
hit in California? He could get hits going the opposite way in
Fenway. They'd be outs in most ballparks. I always thought Jim Rice
was something special. With his strength, it would have been
awfully easy for him to go there and say I'm a pull hitter. He
didn't and it probably helped him to stick as a real good hitter.
Of course, with his strength, he usually didn't need The Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens says it would be difficult to pinpoint his best day at
Fenway. His 20-strikeout game against Seattle in 1986 ranks near
the top. He won three of his five Cy Young Awards while pitching
for Boston. He has posted a 96-55 record in 192 starts at Fenway, a
park many pitchers consider a graveyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt that way,'' said Clemens. ``I've always pitched
inside pretty much. Some guys are afraid the hitter will pull the
ball. I've always tried to feature the ball there. The Wall has
taken away home runs but it's also given some. Fenway is a
challenge. But there are others today. Cleveland is smaller. The
ball carries at Baltimore. It's a hitters park. What (Fenway) takes
away in left field it gives a little bit to lefthanders in right
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer said a lot of hurlers never learned the secret of
pitching in Fenway. Conversely, if a lefthanded hitter learned how
to work The Wall, he could prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Boston with Butch Hobson in 1992,'' said Zimmer.
``That was Mo Vaughn's first year. How many times did you think Mo
Vaughn hit the ball on The Wall or in the net from center field to
the left-field line. He did it a lot because he used the whole
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl Yastrzemski? In 1967-68 he was a pull hitter. But Yaz
learned how to put the ball in the net and he was a solid hitter
the rest of his career. I just got a feeling that lefthanders had
just as much success as anybody just taking advantage of The Wall.
Bernie Carbo was built that way from Day One. He had great
inside-outside power.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens and Zimmer will be in Fenway this week, starting a
three-game series with the Red Sox Tuesday. Clemens, who has been
on the disabled list with a strained left hamstring but will come
off it this week, may make his Yankee debut at Fenway Park
Thursday. A final decision will come after he throws Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be healthy,'' said Clemens. ``That's my main
priority right now. Everything else takes a back seat to that. We
have bigger goals around here. I'm not thinking about the short
range. You think about getting yourself in position in August,
finishing off in September, and get ready for a playoff around
here. That's what this situation is about. Here, they don't think
of anything else. They don't care about who wins or who gets wins.
As long as we win.''

RESTING PLACES OF STARS STILL DRAW FANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Jesse Hiestand contributed to this
story.) 
BY STEVE CARNEY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So powerful is the allure of Hollywood that even
after celebrities die, their loyal fans find them.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Internet, books and underground maps, groupies and the
curious alike track down the likes of Humphrey Bogart, W.C. Fields
and Jean Harlow at the Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Glendale. And
they can find Lucille Ball, Liberace, Bette Davis, Stan Laurel and
George Raft, among others, at Forest Lawn's Hollywood Hills
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forest Lawn is the final resting place for many of Southern
California's historical figures, including celebrities of
Hollywood's past,'' said Paula Graber, a spokeswoman for the
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the 100-year-old Hollywood Forever cemetery in
Hollywood owes some of its own resurrection from bankruptcy to the
enduring popularity of its residents.
</P>
<P>
   The former Hollywood Memorial Park was neglected and overgrown
until last year, when Tyler Cassity paid $375,000 to take over the
620-acre park on Santa Monica Boulevard that backs up to Paramount
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a St. Louis funeral director, Cassity once swore he'd
never go into the family business. Then he came to Hollywood and
found a new undertaking, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love movies and I love drama, and this place was just full
of drama,'' said Cassity, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, the Hollywood Cemetery Association, which
owned the graveyard, filed for bankruptcy protection. Several
purchase deals fell through before Cassity bought it last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of piqued my curiosity. I came out and thought it was
just an incredible place,'' he said. ``When I walk around, all
these people's stories start playing in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassity welcomes tourists, among them Valentino fans on the
anniversary of his death. Approximately 5,000 tourists come to the
cemetery every year and pay $2 for a map of the stars' eternal
homes.
</P>
<P>
   New at the cemetery are video and digital services for families,
including a viewing room with videotaped goodbyes and biographical
epitaphs of the dead, including the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Silent screen legend Rodolfo Guglielmi Valentino lies in a
modest burial crypt in the cemetery's Cathedral Mausoleum.
According to Cassity, it's only a loaner _ his neighbor in the next
crypt, screenwriter Jane Mathis Balboni, who helped discover him,
offered it after his death until his fan club could build a massive
memorial it had planned. Broken-hearted, she died the following
year. And the fan club never did pony up the money for that
monument.
</P>
<P>
   For years, a mysterious ``lady in black'' left flowers on the
anniversary of his death. That woman's daughter eventually assumed
the job, Cassity said, and other Valentino fans have joined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes every year. This year there were three or four
ladies in black,'' he said. ``One had an incredibly large Adam's
apple and a bit of a shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can a screen star dead 73 years still inspire someone to
leave fresh roses at his crypt?
</P>
<P>
   ``If people leave enough of themselves through technology,
people can get to know them,'' Cassity said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so beautiful and glamorous. They're still living on
the screen,'' he said. And for their fans, visiting their graves
``is the closest they can get to the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the summer, we get a lot of tourists from all over,''
said Judy Dooley, who runs the cemetery's flower shop, which also
sells photos and postcards of the matinee idols.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Forever is the final location for legendary director
Cecil B. DeMille, who directed ``The Ten Commandments'' and
``Sunset Boulevard,'' among others films. His movie ``The Squaw
Man'' was filmed in Chatsworth in 1911, the first major motion
picture made in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of the 80,000 people interred at Hollywood Forever are
not that famous. That doesn't mean they're ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved father'' David Solomon Eisenberg died June 30, 1948,
at age 107.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Hilburn, 1842-1927, served in Company K of the 7th
Georgia Volunteers in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Miller Clark has a marker in his family's tomb. Born
1894, he was lost at sea in 1912 _ on the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   But most come to the cemetery, with the Hollywood sign shining
in the hills behind, to look for Mel Blanc, voice of Bugs Bunny,
Porky Pig and hundreds of other cartoon characters. His epitaph:
``That's All Folks.''
</P>
<P>
   They want Carl ``Alfalfa'' Switzer, Peter Lorre, John Huston,
Nelson Riddle, Nelson Eddy, Eleanor Powell, Peter Finch and Bugsy
Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   They seek Douglas Fairbanks, whose massive-columned, white
marble tomb sits on the banks of a long reflecting pool.
</P>
<P>
   Or Tyrone Power, whose monument doubles as a bench on which to
view the ducks and lily pads in a nearby pond.
</P>
<P>
   Both include an epitaph by Shakespeare from ``Hamlet'': ``Good
night sweet prince; and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.''

SLEEPWALK-MURDER (Phoenix) _ After stabbing his wife 44 times in
their home in 1996, court records show, a Phoenix man put on
gloves, dragged her body to their pool, rolled her in and held her
head under. He then sealed a blood-splattered face guard, clothes
and the knife in a Tupperware container, stuffed it in a garbage
bag and hid it in the back of his Volvo. But the man says he cannot
remember any of it. He claims he wasn't even awake. When his trial
starts Wednesday in Maricopa County Superior Court, he will argue
that he is innocent of murder _ not because he didn't stab his
wife, but because the entire incident occurred while he was
sleepwalking. By VICTORIA HARKER. Story will move in the ``A''
category.  &QL;

of theill-fated warship, learned through tireless research that the
sculpture and other long-sought-after artifacts were packed away
andforgotten in a U.S. Navy warehouse. In the two years since the

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ The GTE Byron Nelson Classic wasn't so much a golf
tournament as it was Exhibit A that the young have not yet
inherited the sport. At least not totally.
<TEXT>
<P>
   How else to explain Loren Roberts _ who has seen more years than
brat-packers Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia combined _ winning the
event named for an 87-year-old legend and doing so with his
83-year-old father watching him play for the first time in nearly a
year?
</P>
<P>
   All while the sport mourns the loss of 97-year-old Gene Sarazen,
who died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts hugged his father on the 18th green after claiming a
sudden-death victory for the aged, nipping Steve Pate at the
Tournament Players Club at Las Colinas. Then Roberts summed up the
events of the week perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger and Sergio and David Duval, that's the future of golf
right there,'' Roberts said. ``Obviously, we have Mr. Nelson, Gene
Sarazen _ that's the greatness of the past of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of fit somewhere in the rest of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways. Roberts, 43, has been a PGA Tour player for
nearly two decades now, but it's only in midlife that he has found
a way to win. He collected the sixth victory of his career Sunday
by overcoming a double bogey on the 14th hole, getting into a
playoff against Pate, then making a wonderful sand save on the
first extra hole while Pate could not do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts never has been flashy. But he has become known as one of
the best putters on the planet, and for this week he was better
than anybody, period. He shot a 2-under-par 68 Sunday for a
tournament-record total of 262, 18 under par. It was only good
enough to get him in a playoff with Pate, who fired off a brilliant
66 Sunday to force the tie after 72 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, perhaps doing his best Loren-ce of Arabia
impersonation, threw his 45-foot bunker shot on the first playoff
hole (No. 18) to within two feet for a par. When Pate couldn't get
up and down on a longer shot from the sand, Roberts had the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff hole started with Roberts driving into the right
rough. With a tough left-to-right wind whipping, Roberts figured he
was at a disadvantage after Pate's drive found the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught a reasonable lie in the right rough and hit a 5-wood
out of it,'' Roberts said. ``The one thing I didn't want to do was
hit it in the right bunker because that's almost an impossible
up-and-down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little lucky in the playoff because I was very
surprised that Steve put his second shot over there.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Pate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aiming 20 feet right of the pin, thought it was 40 feet
right, and it ended up 60 feet right,'' Pate said. ``You can't feel
the wind and how strong it is when you're down there in the
fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than that shot, Pate really couldn't fault himself for his
play down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything stupid,'' he said. ``I didn't really bail
out on anything. The only thing is the wind grabbed that last
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate's sand shot stopped 15 feet shy of the hole, and he missed
the putt, handing the title to Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' father was never better than an 18-handicap, lefthanded
hacker. But Hugh Roberts was the man responsible for acquainting
his son with the game of golf more than 30 years ago, which made it
special that the father was present as the son proved he still has
plenty of golf left in him at an age when he was beginning to doubt
his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how excited and happy I am about winning this
tournament,'' Roberts said. ``Two months ago, I was sitting around,
43 years old and wondering if maybe I was too old to do this
anymore. I can't tell you how good it feels to get back in the
winner's circle. I wasn't quite to the point where it was time to
quit. But I'd missed a bunch of cuts and played miserably at
Augusta (in the Masters). I was starting to think, `Gosh, have I
still got it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's been a pretty big emotional swing over the last couple
of months.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said a talk with his former coach before the Shell
Houston Open two weeks ago was a big reason he has been able to
come back strong after missing three cuts in a row in March and
early April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Houston, I talked to my old coach, Jim Swagerty, who I
hadn't worked with in years,'' Roberts said. ``I talked to him on
the telephone, and he said, `So I see you're swinging the club now
and not turning on it.' I heard that and started concentrating on
making a full turn on the ball and keeping the club in front of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was like a light bulb went on, Roberts said, as he finished
tied for fifth at The Woodlands. And that bulb was shining brightly
Sunday, when Pate and Roberts were playing head-to-head virtually
all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw some good punches back and forth the whole day, I
thought,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' best comeback of the day didn't come in response to
anything Pate did but rather offset his only poor swing of the
final two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts came over a 5-iron on the par-4 14th and hit the lake
fronting the green. He wound up making a double bogey, which put
him behind by a shot, the first time he trailed all day.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts needed something to revitalize himself. So he socked a
3-iron from 190 yards and watched it trickle just three feet behind
the cup. That birdie on 15 tied the match, and the pair parred
their way into the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed that to really kind of get back into the
tournament,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Pate: ``That was a pretty impressive comeback. He had a
hard shot on 14, especially after seeing me go over the green. And
then to come back like that after making double, that was
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the fact that Roberts' father was able to attend the
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 83 years old, and he's had a tough time taking care of my
mother,'' Roberts said. ``She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease 2{ years ago, and it's been tough on him taking care of
her. This is the first time since the (U.S.) Open last year at
Olympic Club that he's been able to come out to a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him that I was thrilled to have him here and that
I love him. And I know Mom's watching at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a great golf supporter of me, and he loves to come
out.''

SLEEPWALKING TO BE MURDER DEFENSE: HUSBAND'S CLAIM HAS EXPERT
SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ From the facts alone, it would seem that Scott Falater
was a very deliberate, very efficient murderer.
</P>
<P>
   After stabbing his wife, Yarmila, 44 times in their Phoenix home
in 1996, court records show, Falater put on gloves, dragged her
body to their pool, rolled her in and held her head under.
</P>
<P>
   He then sealed a blood-splattered face guard, clothes and the
knife in a Tupperware container, stuffed it in a garbage bag and
hid it in the back of his Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   But Falater _ an engineer, inventor, loving father and leader in
his church _ said he cannot remember any of it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he claims, he wasn't even awake.
</P>
<P>
   When his trial starts Wednesday, May 19, in Maricopa County
Superior Court, Falater will argue that he is innocent of murder.
Not because he didn't stab his wife, but because the entire
incident occurred while he was sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy County Attorney Juan Martinez intends to prove Falater
knew exactly what he was doing in the early hours of Jan. 16, 1996.
He is seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's attorney, Michael Kimerer, is bringing in three
experts to testify that his client's claim is not only possible,
but likely.
</P>
<P>
   They are the same trio that helped acquit Canadian Kenneth
Parks, who testified he was sleepwalking when he stabbed his
mother-in-law to death in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep tests conducted on Falater show he fits the profile of a
sleepwalker, Kimerer said. He also has a history of sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his sister, Laura Healy, will testify that he once
threw her across a room when she interrupted him during a
sleepwalking episode. Several relatives also are known sleepwalkers
and talkers, Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Falater's cellmates are expected to take the stand to say
he walks and talks in his sleep in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Stress and sleep deprivation can bring on episodes of
sleepwalking, said Roger Broughten, a sleep-disorders expert who
will also testify.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the murder, Falater was under stress from his job
as a products manager for Motorola's semiconductor unit, court
records say. He was told he might have to lay off as many as 20
people in the unit.
</P>
<P>
   To add to his stress, Falater was bothered by a malfunctioning
pool pump; on the night of the murder, he and Yarmila were awakened
by noise and suspected an intruder, court records say.
</P>
<P>
   According to the records, when police arrived, they found a
flashlight turned on near the pump and some of its wires were cut.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer said one theory is that Falater walked in his sleep to
the pool pump, picked up the knife and was interrupted by Yarmila,
Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   His client is ``devastated'' by the death of his wife, Kimerer
said. She was Falater's high school sweetheart and the mother of
his two children.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Falaters seemed to have an ideal family life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a totally loving couple,'' Kimerer said. ``He was
liked by his family, friends and everyone who knew him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had a history of violence or temper. He's a very
bright man who is very involved in the Mormon Church. He's just not
the type of person you'd think would commit a violent crime like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater converted to Mormonism after the two married, and
Yarmila joined the church a bit later. Falater traveled extensively
in his job, while Yarmila, an artist, taught church women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   Falater moved up from a counselor in one church to a member of
the high council over a stake of eight churches. He was a doting
father, and Yarmila was a Cub Scout den mother. Both of their
children are honor students.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Martinez, however, is expected to argue that all was
not as it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Yarmila had complained to friends over the years that Scott
wanted her to participate more in the church, court records show.
She resisted, and at one point disliked the church's influence so
much that she would leave the house when Scott's Mormon friends
came over.
</P>
<P>
   He also pressured her to have more children, a friend testified
in a court interview. Yarmila again resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Then when the church changed boundaries a few years ago, she was
cut off from old friends. She became depressed, court records said.
</P>
<P>
   Overweight and often unkempt, Yarmila did not seem to care about
her appearance, one friend testified. Then, shortly before her
death, she lost about 40 pounds, started riding her bicycle and
paying more attention to her hair and clothes, the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said in a court hearing that one of the Falaters sought
an examination for a venereal disease.
</P>
<P>
   And a psychologist who interviewed Falater after the murder
noted that Scott believed his wife had committed the
``unforgiveable sin'' and was not ``growing with him,'' Martinez
said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Violence during sleep is extremely rare, most experts agree. But
there are documented cases of people who have engaged in elaborate
behavior while in a sleeplike state.
</P>
<P>
   There are examples of people who have lashed out at someone or
thought they were being attacked while asleep, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   There are documented cases of sleepers who have walked out of
upper-story windows or through plate-glass doors and seriously
injured themselves. Some have thrown their children out of windows
and driven cars and killed pedestrians or people in other vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few have mounted successful sleepwalking defenses for
murder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, an Ohio man who said he'd been sleepwalking for years
was found innocent of beating and stabbing a man and trying to
choke the man's mother after testifying he had no memory of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Canadian Supreme Court upheld the acquittal of
Parks, who said he was sleepwalking when he drove 14 miles, stabbed
his mother-in-law to death and seriously injured his father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly publicized case in Arizona in the early 1980s,
attorneys for Steven Steinberg called psychiatrists to testify that
he may have been sleepwalking or in a ``dissociative mental state''
when he stabbed his wife 26 times.
</P>
<P>
   After jurors heard lengthy testimony that his wife, Elana,
nagged Steinberg and drove him mad by spending money faster than he
made it, Steinberg was found innocent on the grounds he was
temporarily insane when he killed her.
</P>
<P>
   If acquitted, is there a chance Falater could kill again if he
sleepwalks?
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer said that would be extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution though, Falater would likely take a drug that
prevents sleepwalking, Kimerer said. &QL;

AMATEUR HISTORIAN LOCATES, TRACKS RELICS OF BATTLESHIP USS
ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID PARRISH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When the battleship USS Arizona sank in 1941 during
the attack on Pearl Harbor, a treasured sculpture of a frontier-era
miner was presumed lost.
</P>
<P>
   A Sun City West grandmother found it.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Marks-Haislip, a 75-year-old widow of a &UR; former
crew &UR; member of the ill-fated warship, learned through tireless
research that the sculpture and other long-sought-after artifacts
were packed away and forgotten in a U.S. Navy warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since the amateur historian made the discovery,
the Arizona State Capitol Museum has been trying to cut through red
tape and have the 40-inch bronze miner returned to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also wants 23 sports trophies and two awards that
once were the pride of the ship's crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The miner definitely belongs to the state, because it was
given to the ship in 1916,'' Marks-Haislip said.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture was given to the USS Arizona shortly after the
ship was built to serve as a link between the state and the ship
that bore its name.
</P>
<P>
   During ceremonies, especially in foreign ports, the miner and
the state flag were prominently displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Few have worked harder or more effectively than Marks-Haislip to
locate USS Arizona artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Her deceased husband, Edward Marks, was a USS Arizona crew
member on leave when the ship was sunk. Charles Haislip, her
current husband, served on the ship before transferring to
submarine duty.
</P>
<P>
   After her first husband died in 1986, Marks-Haislip became the
historian for the USS Arizona Reunion Association, made up of
former ship crew members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   They meet annually around Dec. 7 in Tucson to honor those who
served and died aboard the legendary battleship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to retirement I couldn't see myself sitting down
and knitting,'' said Marks-Haislip, who has five daughters, seven
grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the years she has uncovered the ship's logs and
manifests, all once thought lost to time or the sea.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Marks-Haislip followed up a rumor that part of the
ship's superstructure still existed.
</P>
<P>
   She eventually found a section discarded in a jungle of weeds
near Pearl Harbor. A 500-pound section is now on display in the
State Capitol Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Marks-Haislip found the miner sculpture and the trophies through
a combination of persistence and luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bronze miner had not been seen since before the war,'' she
said. ``Those men who survived from the Arizona said they didn't
know what happened to the trophies; they thought they went down
with the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Marks-Haislip thought some sports trophies might still exist, so
she visited ports of call where the USS Arizona spent time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I checked in Long Beach, San Francisco and the Puget
Sound,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While touring a small naval museum in Bremerton, Wash., she
asked the volunteer on duty if she had ever seen a sports trophy
from the USS Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Yes, we have one of those,' '' Marks-Haislip
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For possible leads on the other trophies Marks-Haislip was told
to check with the Naval Historical Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   She called there, and an employee combed through the old
records, eventually finding the location where a collection of the
sports trophies were stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `By the way, I also have something here that seems to
belong to the state of Arizona,' '' Marks-Haislip said.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the bronze miner was found.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the USS Arizona sailed to its fate at Pearl Harbor,
the sculpture and the trophies were taken off the ship for safe
storage, Marks-Haislip said.
</P>
<P>
   With the sinking of the ship and the death of most of its
officers, the memory of that transfer was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Marks-Haislip isn't finished trying to track down pieces of the
USS Arizona's history.
</P>
<P>
   She also has found one of the ship's massive deck-gun barrels _
54 feet in length and weighing 63 tons _ in a Virginia storage
yard. The barrel has been there since about 1929, when the ship
underwent a refitting.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carman, State Capitol Museum director, said he has been
calling and writing the Naval Historical Center in Washington, D.C,
imploring officials to permanently loan the miner sculpture and
trophies to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any reluctance by the Navy,'' Carman
said. ``We are just not a high priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the massive deck-gun barrel by Marks-Haislip
presents an entirely different challenge for Carman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems is, what do I do with it, how do I get it out
here?'' laughed Carman. ``She's the type of volunteer that all
museum directors love to have in their corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the USS Arizona was sunk Dec. 7, 1941, in the surprise
attack that brought the United States into World War II, Arizona
has assumed the role of preserving the battleship's history and
honoring the 1,177 crew members who were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's anchor is on display at the Capitol's Wesley Bolin
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Arizona's elaborate silver service set _ financed in
part by donations from Arizona children _ is displayed in the State
Capitol Museum with other artifacts from the ship.
</P>
<P>
   They are on permanent loan from the Navy, which usually insists
on keeping ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago the Navy tried to reclaim some of the silver
service for the newly launched USS Tucson, but a local uproar
stopped that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors of the USS Arizona, such as Don Stratton of Yuma, said
the bronze miner and trophies belong in Arizona _ where they are
wanted _ not packed away inside an East Coast warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask kids today about Pearl Harbor, and no one knows
anything about it,'' said Stratton, who suffered burns over 60
percent of his body escaping the doomed ship. ``History gets lost
just like these artifacts, and everybody forgets about it.'' &QL;

BIDDING WAS WORTH CHECKING OUT AT LIBRARY FUND-RAISER

<P>
   OAK HARBOR, Wash. _ Lest anyone think the Friends of Oak Harbor
Library are dowdy, let it be known they served wine punch at their
Sunday afternoon celebrity book sale down at the Elks' Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The spiked punch may have been responsible for the heated
bidding war over the first edition of J.A. Jance's 1999 novel
``Breach of Duty,'' between bidder No. 39 _ Jenny Brown _ and
Bidder No. 24, whose name will be lost to the ages, much like his
bid.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding started at $15. It got tense in a hurry, observed in
silence by bidders who dropped out and by Clyde the nine-point elk,
whose stuffed head decorates the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen, $15, do I have $17.50, $17.50, yes, I have $17.50, do
I have $20, $20, yes I have $20,'' auctioneer Pat Gregory intoned,
goading four bidders to join the fray. ``It's only money _ and we
take credit cards so it's not really money at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the bids topped $35, only two remained.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, dressed in a black blouse and khaki pants, huddled over
her deviled eggs. She waved her auction paddle by raising her arm,
then extending it.
</P>
<P>
   Her competition was No. 24, a white-haired older man in sport
shirt and expandable pants. He had cookies in front of him,and held
his paddle to his chest, tipping it forward to signal his bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five, do I have $35? $35, do I have $37.50, $37.50?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown looked determined and kept raising her arm. Up and out. Up
and out. Mr. 24 scratched the table between his bids. Clyde the
nine-point elk seemed uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-five, $45, do I've have $45, $47.50, do I have $47.50,
come on you're doing this for the library.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty? Do I have $50?'' Tip of the paddle. ``Fifty-two fifty,
can I get $52.50?'' Up and out.
</P>
<P>
   And Mr. 24 blinked.
</P>
<P>
   The Jance book went to Brown, an Oak Harbor resident who said
``I'm just a big Jance fan. I've read all the books, but I haven't
read this one, and so that's a plus, and the autograph is a
bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   The bidders _ along with about 40 other people _ were there to
bid on popular novels that had been autographed by their authors as
a way to raise money for the Friends of the Oak Harbor Library.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a bolder, better fund-raiser than the
group's annual used book sale, which nets about $2,000 each year,
though total proceeds had not been counted last night.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly was louder than the used book sale.
</P>
<P>
   Various versions of the standoff between Brown and Mr. 24, with
Gregory egging them on, happened Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The group sent about 500 queries to authors its members selected
as worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Letters went to literary heavyweights such as John Updike and
Philip Roth, and more popular novelists, like Stephen Coontz and
O.J. Simpson attorney Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   The library received 179 autographed books back in return. Tony
Hillerman sent three. George and Barbara Bush autographed a Random
House pocket dictionary. Lord knows why.
</P>
<P>
   Children's writer Beverly Cleary sent a first edition of her
1987 book ``The Growing Up Feet,'' and the local Payless Shoes
store threw in a package of children's socks.
</P>
<P>
   Win the bidding on Earl Emerson's 1998 ``Catfish Cafe'' and get
a harmonica from the Whidbey Music Center.
</P>
<P>
   It was an eclectic mix, as eclectic as some of the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   A first edition of John LeCarre's 1996 ``The Tailor of Panama''
sold for $62. A deluxe, leather-bound first edition of Roth's
``Operation Shylock'' went for $42.50. Mario Cuomo's 1995 book
``Reason to Believe,'' sold for $30, the result of Gregory's
urging.
</P>
<P>
   The former New York governor and perennial speculative
presidential candidate's book was hailed as almost unreadable by
critics.
</P>
<P>
   But it had a nice inscription, and perhaps that's what sold it
to the bidder: ``Any friend of a library is a friend of mine. In
Friendship, Mario Cuomo, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-autographed dictionary? It was the top seller at $250.

COST OF TRADING A-ROD MORE THAN M'S CAN AFFORD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the context of the Mariners' season-long pitching
travails, Sunday's game stood out like Gandhi at a soccer riot.
</P>
<P>
   Unleashing his repertoire of marshmallows and sofa pillows,
Jamie Moyer threw eight shutout innings. Along with the offense's
nine timely hits, only one of which was a home run, the Mariners
had a 5-1 win, in a tidy 2 hours, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not a hint of hysteria anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   As you can imagine, it was no fun at all.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up 23 runs on 36 hits in the first two games of
this weekend series against the profoundly nondescript Kansas City
Royals, the expectation Sunday was that the Mariners would lead yet
another half-dozen rookie pitchers to slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer spoiled the bloodletting. If the Mariners' team ERA is on
course to mark the worst pitching staff ever in baseball _ and it
is _ how does a well-pitched game fit in to this eye-popping
pursuit of history?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was no way to build the momentum to trade Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   That is the only solution for Mariner pitching right now, isn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Mariners manager Lou Piniella, ``I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Yankees were in a similar situation, do you think they
would trade Derek Jeter? If the Red Sox were in a similar
situation, do you think they would trade Nomar Garciaparra?''
</P>
<P>
   But as Piniella knew well before the rebuttal came, the Mariner
franchise isn't the Yankee franchise. It isn't the Red Sox
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the point.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will never be a top-tier club until they stop being
the Mariners. They will stay bound to mediocrity, new stadium or
not, as long as they fail to break the historic pattern of bailing
on their game-breaking talent.
</P>
<P>
   In surrendering stars, recall what the Mariners did in:
</P>
<P>
   -- 1993, trading shortstop Omar Vizquel to Cleveland for DH
Reggie Jefferson and shortstop Felix Fermin.
</P>
<P>
   -- 1995, trading first baseman Tino Martinez and relief pitcher
Jeff Nelson to the New York Yankees for pitcher Sterling Hitchcock
and third baseman Russ Davis.
</P>
<P>
   -- 1997, trading outfielder Jose Cruz Jr. to Toronto for relief
pitchers Mike Timlin and Paul Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   -- 1998, trading pitcher Randy Johnson to Houston for pitchers
Freddy Garcia and John Halama and second baseman Carlos Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   What remains of nearly half an all-star team are the three
Houston players and Davis. That's all. Oh, one other thing _ a
reputation as a baseball laughingstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have taken it to another level if we had kept some of
the talent that's been in this clubhouse,'' Rodriguez said Sunday.
``Seems like everybody who's winning is doing it with players we
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the same owner/management team is in place that made all
those deals, why in the world is there talk that the Mariners would
get value for Rodriguez?
</P>
<P>
   Not only is management insufficiently competent to get full
value, and ownership too shortsighted to protect its current
investment by increasing player payroll, few if any teams in
baseball would part with market value, given that A-Rod will be a
free agent after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Most every other team runs the risk that Houston did in
acquiring Johnson _ sacrificing young talent for short-term gain.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Rodriguez for 1{ seasons is better than half a season.
But after this year, the new team has to consider locking him up
for the $100 million-plus contract or deal him below market to one
who would.
</P>
<P>
   Plain and simple, the Mariners will get hosed in any trade of
A-Rod. Now, and in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get Alex and Junior (Griffey) signed and build the
team around them,'' Piniella said with unusual emphasis. ``We have
other position players we can trade. Trading A-Rod is not the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the Seahawks trade their quarterback to get an offensive
lineman? Do the Sonics trade their good 7-foot-2 center because
they don't have guards?''
</P>
<P>
   While Piniella's rhetoric of comparisons sounds good, his
alternative doesn't hold out much hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to build a pitching staff for quite a few years, not
just one that's passing through,'' he said. ``At times, it will be
rough. We'll go through a few more (pitchers) before we're set. But
the strength of this organization is its young arms.''
</P>
<P>
   While that sounds swell, Piniella's optimism can be greeted only
with forehead-slapping skepticism by the longtime Mariners
follower, who has seen virtually no young pitcher develop and
flourish with the big club during Piniella's regime.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is a better choice than dealing Rodriguez. That
is a dead man's option taken too many times for a franchise now
entering its field of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership has little choice. Chris Larson, Howard Lincoln et al.
must do what most fans and others in baseball think is impossible _
make an all-out effort to sign Griffey and Rodriguez _ or do what I
suspect they planned to do for some time: Sell to an ownership who
can play in baseball's preposterous marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   And please don't buy the nonsense that such money isn't in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Rodriguez is a guaranteed loser. Any other alternative
at least comes without a guarantee.

SAMSONOV WAS FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The game was just a few minutes old when Sergei
Samsonov made a nifty move to set up a fine Bruins scoring bid by
Mattias Timander.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek stopped that one.
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't hold off Samsonov and his high-flying new
linemates _ Tim Taylor and Rob DiMaio _ for long.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes into the game Taylor passed to Samsonov, who
carried into the Sabre end and this time popped the puck back to
Don Sweeney. Sweeney beat Hasek for the first of four straight
goals that put the Bruins in control of Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov and Co. were on the ice for the first three Bruins
goals. Samsonov scored the next one himself, set up by Taylor from
behind the net after Taylor did a nice forechecking job on Alexei
Zhitnik.
</P>
<P>
   Timander stretched it to 3-1 midway through the period. That
goal was unassisted, but was also aided and abetted by Samsonov's
line, pestering the Buffalo defense down low. A Sabre tried to
clear it around the boards and Timander cut it off and fired it in.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor and DiMaio, usually defensive specialists when paired
with P.J. Axelsson, worked the puck down low, got it to Samsonov
and the new line _ for a night at least _ was an instant hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're two guys who like to pressure the puck,'' Samsonov
said. ``Everyone thinks they're a checking line, but I feel pretty
comfortable with them getting a lot of offense. It was really fun
to play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly looked it. The Samsonov gang was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting the puck, that's the difference,'' said Bruins
coach Pat Burns of Samsonov, the league's Rookie of the Year last
season. ``He has to have the puck. Playing with those two guys you
know one thing, he's going to get the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov got the puck. Made himself some space and then took
full advantage of it. And thanks largely to him and his linemates
the Bruins are headed back to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   This has not been the smoothest of sophomore seasons for
Samsonov. He has not done a lot of scoring in the last half of the
year. Consider: In the Bruins' first 38 games he had 15 goals and
18 assists. In his last 41 regular-season games he had 11 goals and
eight assists.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer skates on the Bruins' most feared offensive unit
with Jason Allison and Dmitri Khristich. And Sunday's goal and
assist marked his first 2-point game since Feb. 21. He did have two
goals against Carolina in the last playoff series and he had two
assists in this one entering Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov sat out Game 3 of this series with back spasms and said
he probably will take treatment on it Monday, but it feels pretty
good.
</P>
<P>
   With the team struggling to score and his own scoring down, he
didn't feel any added pressure, Samsonov said. Nor were there any
special secrets to his and the team's success.
</P>
<P>
   Just basic end-of-the-season-in-sight desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it could be your last game,'' he said. ``You're
probably a little afraid to lose. It keeps you going.''
</P>
<P>
   Going straight to Buffalo where you can expect to see Samsonov,
Taylor, and DiMaio together again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was flying, right from the get-go,'' said Taylor of
Samsonov. ``I could tell he had good legs and was right in the
game. It was a case of mixing things up and trying new things and
today it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Samsonov did change the line's approach a bit, Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, taking P.J. off the line does take away a little of
the defensive mind of it,'' he said. ``We had to make sure one guy
was back a little more, but it was good knowing we could go in real
hard and try to create turnovers and get Sergei the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   When they did, good things tended to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie and I realized that if we can get Sergei the puck, it's
in the net,'' Taylor said. ``So that's what we tried to do.''

PARMER'S SWEET CROSSOVER TO ELITE COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Changing a perception wasn't high on the
to-do list heading into his senior season, but there is no doubt
that Los Angeles Verbum Dei High point guard Marlon Parmer set out
to prove to his critics that he was more than capable of being a
true playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem stemmed from his junior season, when at
times he played like a point guard without the ``point'' in his
game. In other words, his shoot-first, pass-second style rubbed
scouts the wrong way, and had some questioning whether he was
merely an undersized shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   That perception went by the wayside in 1999, as the 6-foot-2,
185-pound star recorded a staggering 12 assists per game in leading
the Eagles to a second consecutive Division IV state title.
</P>
<P>
   Parmer still got his points, as his 30-points-per-game average
will attest. But becoming a better distributor of the ball, and a
string of super fourth-quarter performances that lifted him to cult
status among Eagles followers, made the floor leader one of the
most sought after players in the country during the late-signing
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought as far as performance, he had the best season of any
senior in Southern California,'' Joel Francisco of Los
Alamitos-based So. Cal's Finest Scouting Service said. ``Every
game, he just had ice in his veins. His passing ability improved
dramatically his senior year. He's still a scoring point guard, but
he can make the pass when it's there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like most is that Marlon doesn't care who he's
playing against, he always plays at the same level,'' Francisco
added. ``You know exactly what you're going to get from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Parmer, whose ability to take over games down the stretch
reminds some of the fourth-quarter magic performed by former
Inglewood star and 1994-95 BIW top vote-getter Paul Pierce, said he
just loves to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at everybody as a competitor, so I'm going to play hard
against whoever is out there,'' said Parmer, who recently turned
down Michigan, USC and UNLV to sign with New Mexico. ``Every time I
step on the floor, I try to put forth my best effort. And I don't
take anyone lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   BOOZER'S BIG DECISION
</P>
<P>
   Most prep athletes agree that the toughest part of the
recruiting process is deciding which college to attend. The proper
decision could help lead to a pro career and a contract worth
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Things were no different for Juneau, Alaska, Douglas star Carlos
Boozer, who is one of the most highly regarded prospects in the
country and a unanimous selection in this year's Best in the West
poll. Boozer trimmed his list of schools to three Duke, UCLA and
St. John's and while he was rumored to be headed to UCLA, he
actually spent most of his senior season agonizing over the choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult ... for a while, I didn't know where I
wanted to go,'' he said. ``But after looking at everything, I felt
Duke was the perfect place for me. It's a wonderful environment,
and they have Coach (Mike) Krzyzewski, who's the best coach in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Duke) was where he felt most comfortable,'' Douglas coach
George Houston
</P>
<P>
   said. ``He really liked Mike Jarvis and St. John's, and he spent
so much time around the UCLA program over the years, he felt real
comfortable there. But ultimately, he felt the best place for him
was Duke.''
</P>
<P>
   Boozer said Blue Devils' star power forward Elton Brand's
decision to enter the NBA draft had absolutely no effect on his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of wish he had stayed,'' Boozer said. ``I think
practicing against him would have been unbelievable. You can't get
any better than playing against the best player in college
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   With Brand gone, former BIW first-teamer Chris Burgess
(Woodbridge) transferring and talented freshman swingman Corey
Maggette announcing Saturday he is bolting to the NBA, count on
Boozer and fellow BIW teammate Michael Dunleavy playing big minutes
for the Blue Devils next season.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL TOWN, BIG GAME
</P>
<P>
   With a population of roughly 2,000, the city of Knappa isn't one
of the larger municipalities in Oregon. In fact, with one flashing
light, one restaurant and one store in town, those who blink twice
while driving down Highway 30 just might miss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking rural in every sense of the word,'' Craig Cokley
</P>
<P>
   said with a laugh. ``But it's a great place to raise a family,
and basketball is our passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cokley watched that passion swell the last two seasons while
coaching the Knappa boys basketball team. The school won 48
consecutive games on the way to capturing back-to-back Division 2-A
state titles.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for the success has been standout forward-center
Brian Jackson, who might be the sleeper of the national Class of
'99 and whom Cokley compares favorably to NBA star Keith Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some very unique skills for a 6-10 guy,'' Cokley said
of Jackson, who averaged roughly 28 points and 12 rebounds per game
this season. ``He has had no professional coaching or training, so
his upside is tremendous. He has the physicality, skill and heart
to play at the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Cokley also has no worries about whether his small-town stud can
make the transition to big-time basketball when he plays next
season at Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty big step ... from Knappa High to the Pac-10,''
Cokley said. ``But I'm excited about his potential, and I know
Brian will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   KEEP AN EYE ON ...
</P>
<P>
   Wonder who the top prospects in the West will be heading into
2000? While the top five prospects figure to be the subject of much
debate, there is no doubt Fresno Washington Union junior Deshawn
Stevenson stands head and shoulders above the rest of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, a muscular 6-5 shooting guard with a deadly outside
stroke and jaw-dropping athleticism, is a consensus top-five
prospect nationally and the West Coast's first serious national
Player of the Year candidate in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach Jordan's Travon Bryant, a 6-7 forward, is arguably
the second-best prospect in the West. Bryant is also considered one
of the top 25 seniors-to-be nationally heading into the crucial
summer evaluation period.
</P>
<P>
   Other top juniors include:
</P>
<P>
   Post players Keith Brooks
</P>
<P>
   (6-6, Compton Dominguez); Patrick Dennehy
</P>
<P>
   (6-9, Santa Clara Wilcox); Teyo Johnson

 (Subs 3rd graf to update with Knicks facing Hawks in second round
of playoffs) 
son KnicsSubs KNICKS ELIMINATE HEAT ON HOUSTON'S JUMPER IN LAST(rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ There was the deafening noise, and still Alonzo
Mourning's baritone voice was able to cut through a vibrating Miami
Arena, as he cried out: ``One stop. One stop.'' One surreal instant
later, Allan Houston put down a forceful dribble, curled around Dan
Majerle as tightly as a stripe on a candy cane and discovered a
shaft of light.
</P>
<P>
   With a clear view of the basket, Houston planted a foot on the
free-throw line, tilted forward and tossed destiny up in the air.
As his 10-foot jumper licked the front of the rim, bounced up and
hung as if filled with helium, there dangled Jeff Van Gundy's job
as the Knicks' head coach, Patrick Ewing's future and the path of
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Then, gravity brought down the Heat, and devastated coach Pat
Riley as Houston's shot touched the backboard and then fell softly
into the net with just eight-tenths of a second left. The lead,
Game 5, and another dramatic series with their loathed rival
belonged to the Knicks in an unfathomable 78-77 victory that
eliminated the Heat for the second time in three years. The Knicks
advanced t the second round of the playoffs and will play the
Hawks in a four-of-seven games series to begin Tuesday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about me,'' Van Gundy said. ``I didn't do anything
today. I just rode these guys. It says a lot about the character of
this team that they stuck with me. I'm thankful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it seemed fitting that it was one of Van Gundy's core
supporters, Houston, who shrugged off his flat start to this game
and delivered the game-winning shot that propped up a Knicks team
teetering on extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only put so much into a shot,'' said Houston, who made
just one of his first seven shots in the game but was 2 for 3 in
the fourth period. `'If we didn't get the bounce, we'd be talking
about something totally different right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the floor was open for a discussion about a Knicks team
that would not die, about a former outcast finding his niche among
the tenacious, and about an aging center standing up to his
Georgetown apprentice, Mourning, and beating pain.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. Breaks Down,'' Van Gundy said with a smile, referring to
Patrick Ewing. ``Amazing, but he came through again.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Latrell Sprewell and Ewing who allowed Houston to be in
the position to win the game. After the Heat took a 3-point lead
with 58.5 seconds left, Ewing fought off Mourning, grabbed an
offensive rebound and was fouled hard. With his right side aching
from a third-quarter rib injury, with his Achilles' tendon
throbbing through the tape, Ewing coolly hit two free throws to
pull the Knicks to within one point, 77-76 with 39.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tim Hardway, the bane of the Knicks during three straight
playoff meetings, dribbled the ball up the court and was beginning
to drive by Charlie Ward when Sprewell cleverly stuck his hand in
and poked the ball away from him with 19.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels bad,'' Hardaway said. ``I didn't come through,
especially at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a snapshot of the defensive intensity of this game
unfolded. Terry Porter harassed Sprewell, bumped and banged him
with his forearm and body. Sprewell tried to free himself for a
shot but Porter forced him toward the sideline. Sprewell lost the
ball, but the official ruled it went off of Porter with 4.5 seconds
left in the game. That was the prelude to the inbounds pass to
Houston and the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it hung for 2 minutes, not 2 seconds,'' Houston
said. ``It's the biggest shot ever for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It carried so much weight. It meant the Knicks became only the
second eighth-seeded team to beat a No. 1 seeded team. It left
Riley heartsick after another first-round exit at the hands of his
former team. It meant everything to Van Gundy's job stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the game, I just went in and told him, `Thanks for
staying with it,''' Van Gundy said of Houston. ``He did. He'd been
struggling. But he needed to be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to him were Ewing, Sprewell, Ward and Larry Johnson. Ewing
led the team with 22 points and 11 rebounds, Sprewell added 14
points off the bench and Johnson came up with 12 points. They were
the ones entrusted with the outcome of the game. But as wrenching
as the finish was, the Knicks may have won this game in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They were down 21-8 and on the verge of being knocked out of
this series-deciding game early, just as they had been in Game 7
two years ago. That was a game in which Houston started out 1 for
9, a game the Heat owned from the start. This time, Childs, limping
off the bench with a thigh contusion, pushed the ball, looked for
Sprewell running down the floor and took the Knicks on a 13-0 run
to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about what has happened in the past,'' Sprewell
said. ``But this time, we wanted it. We wanted it with everything
we had. When you're out there, you can't believe you're part of a
game like this. It was draining emotionally, physically,
everything. I've never been in a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd never seen one shot unleash so much pandemonium. As
Houston's jumper was swallowed by the net, Ewing let out a howl and
Sprewell ran in circles around the court with an elated Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping one of Charlie Ward's prayers would come
true when that shot went up,'' said Childs, referring to his devout
teammate. ``I hoped that would help in go in.''
</P>
<P>
   One more divine moment later, after Porter's desperation shot
bounded off the rim at the buzzer, Houston stood on the court as he
was hugged by his teammates and embraced by destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels good, well beyond that,'' Houston said. ``It's
all just so indescribable.''

BRUINS AVOID CZECHMATE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ And on the 10th day Dominik actually worked.
</P>
<P>
   He had put in some decent labor in Game 1. We'll give him that.
But Games 2, 3, and 4 represented little more than a paid vacation.
Dominik Hasek could have been sipping pina coladas and munching on
the nachos out there. The Bruins never bothered him.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Sunday they made the great man work up a sweat. And they
also did something else _ they drove him from the game.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK. That's an exaggeration. But let the record show that
after two periods of Sunday's series-extending 5-3 victory over the
Buffalo Sabres the Bruins led, 4-1, and coach Lindy Ruff decided
that it was better for his meal ticket to take a seat and start
thinking about Game 6 than to subject him to any more shots from
the aroused Bruins, who had been treating him as if he were _ are
you ready? _ mortal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's human,'' confirmed Kyle McLaren. ``He can be beat. We
proved that in Game 1, and I think we proved it again today.''
</P>
<P>
   In between was another matter. The winning Buffalo scores in
Games 2, 3, and 4 were 3-2, 3-1, and 3-0, respectively. When Don
Sweeney slapped one past him at 9:01 of the opening period Sunday,
it represented the first Bruins goal in 116 minutes 13 seconds.
This mortality thing comes and goes.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like we can start calling him The Sieve. ``Dom may not
have had his A game, but there were a couple of times the puck had
eyes,'' said Buffalo center Wayne Primeau. ``There was a two-on-oh
break,'' reminded Curtis Brown, ``and that should never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a Jason Allison-Dmitri Khristich
collaboration in the second period, when a Buffalo gamble turned
into a nice Bruins sashay into Dominik's living room. Allison, on
Hasek's right, put one right on Khristich's stick, and all the
maligned winger had to do was ram it home. There was not much
anyone could do about that, not even Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's goal had to have been a huge psychological lift for
the Bruins. If the scoreless streak had been allowed to drag into
the second period, it is quite possible the hometown team might
never have scored. But the redoubtable Bruins defenseman, who is in
the apparent process of transforming himself into the new Paul
Coffey, beat the great Czech goalkeeper with a wicked slapper for
his third goal of the playoffs. This matches a playoff career-high
goal count attained eight years ago at a time when he had sustained
about a zillion fewer hits and wasn't being listed as not just
game-to-game, but more like second-to-second with a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, as you may know, is not very good at this
self-promotion stuff. ``We just put more pressure on him today,''
he said. ``If we play the perimeter game and keep passing the puck
and not crash and bang, you're not going to score many goals
against Dominik Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one goal that demonstrated the fact that Hasek had
come with something less than his A game, it was a Sergei Samsonov
tally that made it 2-1 at 1:15 of period two. Samsonov simply beat
Hasek to the far side with a shot the great man usually gobbles up.
The fourth goal against Hasek was a long Mattias Timander slap shot
quite reasonably assumed to be a screen job.
</P>
<P>
   But when you are Dominik Hasek, you don't grab onto the ready
excuse known as a screen. That's why he's Dominik Hasek, who makes
routinely spectacular saves every game he plays and who believes
you either stop the puck or you don't. Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screen?'' he shrugged. ``I don't remember. The shot went in.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus was that the Bruins had gotten too cutesy after
taking that 1-0 series lead. Well-meaning people were trying to
make plays when they would have been better-advised to let the puck
rip. Let Hasek deal with some flying rubber. Stop allowing him to
bring the morning paper and a nice paperback novel to the job.
Remind him why he's there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot,'' smirked a feisty Bruins coach Pat Burns. ``Shoot.
That helps. It really helps. You don't have time to be picking
corners, and whatnot. Just shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Hasek wouldn't admit to being screened on the Timander
goal, so, too, would it have been absolutely ridiculous to ask him
about his left knee. The fact is he took one in a vulnerable area
off a Dave Ellett blast in Game 3, and he did not participate in
either the subsequent offday practice or the morning skate on the
day of Game 4. He did join his mates in Saturday's workout, but no
one did much of anything. It was clear that Ruff just wanted to get
his people out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? A slight lack of mobility could have been the key to
the Samsonov goal. When you're talking about Hasek, you've got to
look for reasons when things appear to be a bit funny. Again, not
that he would admit that anything is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, naturally, won't offer any clue. ``He was screened on
one,'' he declared. ``There was a two-on-none on another. I guess
you expect him to stop those, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek expressed no anger or embarrassment for being lifted in
favor of former UMass-Lowell goalkeeper Dwayne Roloson before the
third period. ``I did not play well,'' he admitted. ``There is
nothing I can do about it now. I just have to forget it and get
ready for the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Want a mortal lock bet for Tuesday night's Game 6? The Buffalo
Sabres will be ready. Dominik Hasek will really be ready. Did
someone say ``traffic'' in front of the net? If it doesn't look
like Boylston Street 20 minutes after a Red Sox game, the Bruins'
season definitely will be over.

WHISTLE-STOP TOUR CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Did someone mention the officiating? No? Didn't matter.
Pat Burns was primed to rant whether or not he was given the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Bruins' 5-3 victory over the Sabres Sunday at the
FleetCenter, which enabled them to extend this best-of-seven
Eastern Conference semifinal to a sixth game, Burns turned a
tangential question into a diatribe on the refereeing in general.
And when Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff, advised of his counterpart's
comments by those notorious provocateurs of the press, returned
fire, the series had a genuine subplot, if not a legitimate
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was asked about the impact of the Sabres' first goal, by
Joe Juneau on a power play just 37 seconds into the action, and
suddenly, he somehow had the makings of a federal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean the one that went off the referee's (Stephen
Walkom's) back?'' he said, his voice brimming with the sarcasm that
is his favorite weapon at many press briefings. ``Sometime things
like that have to happen in the playoffs for teams to have success.
Like that shorthanded goal (by Buffalo's Michael Peca in Game 4
Friday) a couple of days back where the puck hit something, nobody
knows what. The referee's back.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the officials' positioning that truly inspired his
vitriol. It was basically their position on penalties _ which he
considers heavily weighted in the Sabres' favor throughout the
series.
</P>
<P>
   And without further ado, or questioning, he was off on a
full-fledged harangue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting much help,'' he said. ``I stay away from
whining as much as possible. I leave that to Lindy _ he does a good
job of it. I sort of backed off and didn't say much.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the second efforts, the flying elbows, the punches upset
me . . . and if anybody here didn't see it, you're as blind as a
couple of guys on the ice today.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to name names, but he couldn't possibly have been referring
to Walkom and fellow referee Dan Marouelli, could he?
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Sabres are) getting away with a lot of things,'' Burns
continued without pause. ``. . . Robbie DiMaio got sent to the
penalty box for being punched. Peca gets away with whatever he
wants . . . and we say Ray Bourque gets away with anything he
wants. Peca gets away with murder. I mean murder . . . Peca dropped
his glove one time and took a swipe at Ray Bourque's head. Lucky he
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget the peripheral victims of arbitrary
justice, such as Bruins muscleman Ken Belanger.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Buffalo's Paul) Kruse goes out and runs guys, gets everybody
low,'' said Burns. ``I send Ken Belanger out there for one shift,
and the first guy he touches, he's gone. The poor guy can't play
one shift. Kruse can run around, attack guys behind the net,
cross-check them. Belanger steps out there, and automatically,
there are four sets of eyes looking at him. There can be all kinds
of stuff going on behind the play and it doesn't matter. As long as
Belanger is out there, `We're gonna get you, kid.' Kruse can run
around, (Erik) Rasmussen can run around, cross-check people . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those manipulative Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the game, I had to hang around the bench,'' said
Burns, ``because they wait for the referee to step off and then
they sit there crying to him for 15 minutes. Today I waited and
waited because I wanted to see exactly what happened. Sure enough .
. . I said, `There you go. That's exactly what happens.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately given the opportunity when he succeeded Burns at the
microphone, Ruff wasn't above taking the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Informed that Burns considers him a whiner, the Sabres coach
laughed heartily, the calm before his volley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to like Pat, I'll tell you,'' said Ruff. ``I was
worried some of our guys were going to get hit with cheap shots.
Bourque, the way he carries his stick, DiMaio . . . There were
enough cheap shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But not by his innocents, Ruff hastily added. ``I thought they
were good hits. Peca ran over Bourque. (Alexei) Zhitnik ran over
Bourque.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from Burns, Ruff turned an unrelated question _
why did he lift goalie Dominik Hasek after two periods with the
Sabres trailing, 4-1? _ into a plea to stop the insanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried about the cheap shots,'' he said. ``Belanger,
DiMaio, (Tim) Taylor . . . I was worried about somebody breaking
their stick over Dom.''
</P>
<P>
   Victim/villain Bourque evoked laughter when he was asked about
the elbowing by Peca and said, ``Which one?''
</P>
<P>
   The aggrieved Bourque went on, ``Yeah, it was an elbow. I don't
know what they see. The ref's right there and he's watching it. But
I don't wear the stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the accused, Peca, provided the only semblance of
perspective on the matter, with some sarcasm for seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody died out there, so I didn't get away
with murder,'' he said. ``I think both teams are getting away with
cheap shots. I think that comment is an injustice because both
teams are getting away with it. We'll see how much I get away with
Tuesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be Game _ or Round _ 6 in Buffalo. It may decide the
series, but that's trivial. Seeing how the referees call it will be
the main attraction. Just ask the coaches. In fact, you don't even
have to.

POOR START FINISHED SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ During a power play at 9:11 of the third period Sunday,
Sabres center Brian Holzinger raised his stick in triumph as the
puck went . . . oops, it went over the net. Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   That hardly was Buffalo's lone mistake of the afternoon at the
FleetCenter. Just about everything went wrong for the Sabres until
it was far too late. As a result, they were guilty of the one thing
they had vowed to avoid after assuming a 3-1 lead in this
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal: letting the Bruins off
the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's 5-3 victory, fueled by a three-goal second period that
built a 4-1 lead and chased wondergoalie Dominik Hasek from the
Buffalo net, emphasized to the Sabres a point that was long
overdue: A hockey game is not a faucet.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 3 Wednesday at Buffalo, they had overcome a dreadful
start with a dominant third period that produced a 3-2 victory. In
a similar position Sunday, they again revved up for the final 20
minutes, closing the deficit to 4-3 at one point. But this time two
lethargic periods were fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably had five or six guys give us that 80 percent,''
said coach Lindy Ruff. ``They said to themselves, `Dom played a
great first period (when the Sabres were in a 1-1 tie after being
outshot, 16-6). We can let it slide.' They played an easy game.''
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't get away with it in the second period, when Boston
took command with goals by Sergei Samsonov and Mattias Timander _
both set up on giveaways by defenseman Alexei Zhitnik _ and by
Dmitri Khristich after the Sabres lost the puck in the Bruins' zone
as a power play expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gambled,'' said Ruff, ``and maybe lost in our gambling a
couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that killing four penalties in a 14-minute
stretch after they took a 1-0 first-period lead didn't enhance the
Sabres' cause, but all in all, he wasn't pleased with his team's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the goals, we gave them pretty much every
chance they had,'' said center Joe Juneau. ``They didn't really
have to work for them. Breakdowns, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuttering starts are not unfamiliar to the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tendency to do that sometimes,'' said center Wayne
Primeau. ``We get lackluster in the third period, figure we can
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Sabres almost did after Ruff decided to send them a
message. He shortened his bench, ignoring forward Michal Grosek in
particular, in the third period ``and went with the guys who were
battling,'' said center Michael Peca.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres hope the message and momentum won't be forgotten
Tuesday in Game 6 at Buffalo _ when the Bruins get a second chance
the Sabres gave them when they knew they couldn't afford to.

WOMAN DEVOTES TWO YEARS OF LIFE TO FREE GRANDSON CONVICTED OF
MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELAINE PORTERFIELD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gladis Spencer stood on the street where Maya Streeter died and
wept.
</P>
<P>
   She wept for Streeter, dead at 23. She wept for Streeter's three
children, left motherless.
</P>
<P>
   And she wept for Derek Spencer, her 20-year-old grandson, who
she believes was wrongly convicted of shooting Streeter during an
East Tacoma party in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the jury after the verdict that God knows he didn't do
it _ that they didn't have the last word,'' Spencer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's beliefs have propelled the retired phone company
worker into a two-year odyssey to prove her grandson's innocence.
And whether Derek Spencer is in fact guilty of the charges of which
he was convicted _ first-degree murder and first-degree assault _
his grandmother has shown a zeal on his behalf seldom seen in the
families of defendants, say attorneys familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Washington state Court of Appeals will hear
Derek Spencer's request for a new trial based on several issues in
the case, including how he was sentenced. The arguments will not
touch on evidence or testimony in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But for Gladis Spencer, there are other burning issues in the
case, issues she will pursue if the appeal fails, despite diabetes
and a limited retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   She asserts there is no physical evidence tying her grandson to
Streeter's death, no fingerprints on the murder weapon, no tests
run on him after the shooting for gunpowder residue. Several of the
people who testified against him admitted to drinking or using
drugs before the shooting. And some of the witnesses, with criminal
records of their own, gave testimony that differed markedly from
statements they gave to police, she alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said at trial that Derek Spencer was a gang member
and was outside a party when members of a rival gang rolled up.
They say he pulled out a gun during a confrontation that followed.
</P>
<P>
   When someone suddenly tossed a bottle against a car, Derek
Spencer turned and recklessly fired into a crowd of people standing
next to the street, prosecutors allege. Maya Streeter, who was
getting out of a car parked at the curb, was shot through the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   And while the witnesses who testified against Derek Spencer may
not have had completely consistent testimony, it does not mean they
lack credibility, prosecutors said at trial. Such inconsistencies
are understandable based on the traumatic events of the evening,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   But Derek Spencer and his attorneys contend that while he was
indeed standing outside at the party, he did not have a gun. And
they say the trajectory of the bullet that killed Maya Streeter
could not have been fired from the spot where witnesses placed him.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Spencer is now a little less than two years into a 47-year
sentence for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Streeter's family could not be reached for comment. But Michael
Sommerfeld, a Pierce County prosecutor, said he believes Derek
Spencer's appeal has no merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly our office is extremely regretful about the
suffering Mr. Spencer's family has endured, but we obviously feel
the greater suffering was the loss of Maya Streeter's life ... and
the suffering felt by her family,'' Sommerfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladis Spencer says she can understand a little of how
Streeter's family must feel. She lost her own 23-year-old sister at
the hands of a murderer. And like Streeter, her sister also left
behind three children, children Spencer raised.
</P>
<P>
   But having the wrong man convicted in Streeter's death does her
memory no honor, Spencer insists.
</P>
<P>
   She has been joined in her quest by her daughter, Tammie
Jackson, Derek Spencer's aunt. Together, the pair managed to scrape
up $10,000 from savings and donations from family members to hire
the firm of Monte Hester, the most prominent criminal defense
lawyer in Pierce County, to handle an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still owe $618,'' said Spencer, who raised seven children
as a single parent. She will call more relatives, appealing for
them to reach for that extra dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer and Jackson have pored over all documents in the case,
including the 726-page transcript from Derek Spencer's trial, each
page neatly encased in a plastic sleeve. Testimony they believe is
inconsistent or untrue is highlighted; sticky notes remind them of
questions to ask their lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   They have sent letters to many prominent African Americans such
as Oprah Winfrey, Bill Cosby and Johnnie Cochran requesting their
aid in the case.
</P>
<P>
   They've called numerous television stations and newspapers,
begging them to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   And they've called some of the lawyers responsible for freeing
defendants wrongly convicted of child sex-abuse in Wenatchee.
</P>
<P>
   They've met with little success. The letters and pleas have gone
unanswered, their phone calls unreturned.
</P>
<P>
   But Gladis Spencer, driven by love and conviction, hasn't given
up. She is fortified by her faith in God that her grandson will be
freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Lord,'' she says simply. ``I believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who fiercely loves her nephew, has had a harder
struggle with her faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so hard to undo what has already been done,'' she says.
``Now two years of his life are gone and he can't get them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a bus driver, is the mother of two children, ages 8 and
14. She sometimes worries the campaign to prove her nephew's
innocence has shortchanged her own children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become my whole world,'' Jackson said. ``It's like my
whole life just stopped when this happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Fricke wrote the appeal for Derek Spencer and will argue
it before the Appeals Court Tuesday. He and his firm recently won a
major federal appeals case upholding a judge's decision to cut more
than seven years off the prison sentence of a woman who shot and
wounded her abusive husband on the Fort Lewis Army base.
</P>
<P>
   They took the case because they believe there are major legal
issues connected to the conviction, issues that demand attention
from the courts, Fricke says.
</P>
<P>
   Among other issues, Fricke alleges in his appeal that Derek
Spencer's constitutional right against double jeopardy was violated
by his conviction for both first-degree assault and first-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Derek Spencer was incorrectly ordered to serve
time on each conviction consecutively, rather than concurrently,
Fricke asserts in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Fricke says he feels positive about his legal arguments. But he
said it's always hard in court to surmount prejudice and negative
feelings connected to anyone convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about these kind of cases, we don't have the
emotions on our side,'' he said. ``You've always got to get above
that hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors assert in court papers that Derek Spencer did not
face double jeopardy for his twin convictions on both first-degree
murder and assault, saying that ``proof of either offense does not
necessarily prove the other ... the elements of the two crimes are
not at all the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, state case law permits Derek Spencer's 26{-year
sentence for murder and 10-year sentence for assault to run
consecutively, they say. Derek Spencer also faces two additional
five-year terms for use of a firearm in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Spencer was largely raised by Gladis Spencer after he was
born to her 16-year-old daughter. Jackson was 9 at the time, and
she, too, helped raise him. The family lived in Anchorage, Alaska,
for much of his childhood, moving to Tacoma in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In Anchorage he was a good student, and Spencer eagerly shows
his academic and skiing awards, honors she carries in a box along
with his court records. His Cub Scout scarf is draped over one of
his elementary-school photos on a wall in her apartment, alongside
numerous other family portraits.
</P>
<P>
   His family doesn't assert his conduct was completely angelic in
Tacoma. He hung out with a rough crowd, many of whom had gang
affiliations, and he didn't finish high school. But he had no
criminal background, they point out, and was never known to be
violent.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals case doesn't touch on all of the issues Spencer and
Jackson believe are so important, including their doubts about
quality of the evidence and testimony introduced at trial. Nor will
it address the issue of whether he received adequate representation
at trial, which Spencer and Jackson say was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Fricke said those issues may well be worth exploring. If they're
unsuccessful on appeal, they will have to go through a personal
restraint petition. Such a petition is a way to bring up issues of
newly discovered evidence, to explore whether Derek Spencer
received effective council at trial, and to examine whether
evidence was properly presented, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things that certainly has piqued my
interest, although it's not on appeal on this time,'' Fricke said.
``Whatever happens on appeal, it's not necessarily going to end the
case.''

ROBERTS MAKES FORTYSOMETHINGS EVERYWHERE PROUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
IRVING, Texas _ Youth will be served on this PGA tour, a couple of
kids named Sergio Garcia and Tiger Woods reminded us this weekend. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in the meantime, there is Loren Roberts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he had wondered. A golf professional since 1975,
the year that Woods was born, Roberts had missed successive cuts in
Florida at Bay Hill and Sawgrass then had trashed together
back-to-back 76s at the Masters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, not two months ago,'' Roberts said yesterday, ``I
was thinking that, 43 years old, and maybe I'm a little too old out
here now with all of these young guys.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to be a gentlemanly confession yesterday, after
Roberts and Steve Pate had gone middle-aged crazy and nearly lapped
Woods and the rest of the Byron Nelson Classic field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Together, Roberts and Pate, 37, finished the 72 holes at
18-under-par and seven Geritol-flavored strokes ahead of the
nearest scrum of challengers. Woods himself was nine behind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned was that you can bring in the
bulldozers and stretch the golf courses to Yellowstone lengths, but
sooner or later you're going to have to hit a few greens and sink
some putts.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so short that I can't get to the par 4s,'' Roberts
said. ``And I figure that if I can get it on the green, then
everybody, they're playing in my home stadium.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His roost is the putting green. Blame it on maturity. Attribute
it to his wise old nerves. Roberts' prowess with the putter has
earned him the tour nickname, ``Boss of the Moss.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a blustery final day at the TPC at Las Colinas course, where
the winds blew and caution reigned, Garcia, Woods and the other
pursuers never really had a chance. It was not the day to leapfrog
the field and close Roberts' sizeable gap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it would turn out, Roberts himself had the day's most
significant birdie, after he beamed a 3-iron on No. 15 to a scant
three feet. The birdie had been preceded by a wet double-bogey on
the par-4 14th, a turn of events that had pushed Pate into a brief
lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Knotted again, the two charged into sudden-death overtime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, they just walked.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who grew up in San Luis Obispo, Calif., teased about
his age but he admits that he is a golfing late bloomer of sorts.
He turns 44 next month, but in dogleg years, he didn't come of age
until the 1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His is not your basic, Tigeresque, ordained-from-birth resume.
He began playing the game in the 11th grade, but his high school
didn't have a golf team. He went on to college at Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, but the school dropped its men's golf team, blaming Title
IX. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roberts ended up working as an assistant club pro in his
hometown. Since the driving range was always busy, he whiled away
his hours on the practice putting green.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His golfing mentor, Jim Swagerty, finally pointed Roberts in the
right direction. If Loren had the dream, he should pursue the
dream, Swagerty told him. The practice range in San Luis Obispo
would still be there if things didn't work out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 19 years after he first turned professional and seven
years after he had to earn his tour playing card for the final
time, Roberts won his first PGA event, the Nestle Invitational at
Bay Hill. He had won four other tournaments before the Nelson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm not as broken down as I should be at my age,''
Roberts joked yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the doubts had begun to creep in, like mailings
from the AARP, and Roberts said, ``I wasn't questioning to the
point of thinking it's time to quit or anything. But I was
thinking, `Gosh, have you still got it anymore?' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a move that fortysomethings everywhere can appreciate,
Roberts went home and started digging through his old journals and
scrapbooks. He found a hint here, a reassurance there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a pretty big emotional swing from two months ago to
now,'' he said yesterday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' face showed it. In an emotional scene on the 18th
green, as he was presented with the championship trophy, Roberts
had embraced his 83-year-old father, Hugh. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Roberts men, Loren and Hugh, it has been a draining 2
1/2 years. Loren's mother, Joan Roberts, has been diagnosed with
Alzheimer's Disease and was admitted to a care facility two months
ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first week that he's been able to get out and come
to a golf tournament,'' Loren said. Hugh Roberts had never before
seen his son win a professional golf tournament.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Embracing after the playoff, Loren said: ``I just told him, `I'm
so thrilled you're here, dad, and I love you.' I said I know mom
was watching at home.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he had wondered. Silly ``old'' man. &QL;

ERSTAD`S DRY SPELL CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Last season Darin Erstad hit .316 with 17
homers and 57 RBI by the end of June. As of Sunday he was hitting
.243 with three homers and 12 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just trying to get some timing, stay inside the ball, all
those things you talk about,'' Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``Every time you're in a slump, you ask where are my hands,
where are my feet? Once in a while you need to take the approach of
going in the batter's box, see the ball, hit it. And work on the
little things. When you're a good hitter and you're not swinging
good, it's rough.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Moving swiftly along: The Angels barely had enough time to do
their laundry after returning early Friday morning from a 10-day
trip to the East Coast before returning East again.
</P>
<P>
   They leave this morning for a seven-day, six-game trip to
Baltimore and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say everybody's got to do it,'' Collins said of the
hectic travel schedule. ``But that doesn't make it right.
</P>
<P>
   These three games against Tampa Bay were the Angels' only home
dates in an 18-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
   __ Greene back behind plate: Todd Greene completed his
three-game suspension Saturday and started at catcher Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who was suspended for three days for charging Mariners
pitcher Brett Hinchliffe in a game April 18, will get some starts
in the outfield on the upcoming trip. Sunday, for the first time
since shoulder surgery, he threw out a baserunner trying to steal.
Four others have stolen successfully on him this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Schedule: The Angels are off today. They begin a three-game
series against the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards on Tuesday.
Chuck Finley (2-3, 4.89 ERA) will start for Anaheim against
Baltimore's Mike Mussina (5-1, 4.89).
</P>
<P>
   __ Also: Anaheim's Dave Silvestri, a 31-year-old utilityman,
made his first career outfield start in left field. Silvestri had
made five previous outfield appearances, the last on May 21, 1996,
with the Montreal Expos.

ANGELS HAVE DEVIL OF A TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ For the sake of perspective, consider Dave
Silvestri.
</P>
<P>
   Silvestri wasn't good enough to make the Tampa Bay Devil Rays'
major-league roster out of spring training. He played one game for
their Triple-A affiliate in Durham, N.C., before being released by
the organization altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, he was the Anaheim Angels' starting left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Devil Rays beat the Angels 7-4 in front of 35,064
at Edison Field, taking the series two games to one.
</P>
<P>
   In eight three-game sets this season, the Angels have won only
one _ their sweep of the Yankees last week. They've lost the other
seven.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Angels is they are only 4{ games out of
first place in the AL West. The bad news is it's a team that looked
more like an expansion team Sunday than did the expansion team in
the visitors' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays starter Wilson Alvarez (2-2) wasn't at his best,
according to Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild, but was good
enough against a lineup heavily dependent on Mo Vaughn. Perhaps too
dependent.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hit his eighth home run of the season in the fifth to cut
a 7-0 lead to 7-2. Garret Anderson and Todd Greene homered in the
eighth and ninth innings, respectively, to make it a little closer.
Vaughn has been hot since returning to the DH spot last week. In
six games there he's hitting .455 (10 for 22) with four homers and
14 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he is the key to our lineup,'' manager Terry Collins
said. ``If Todd (Greene) and Garret (Anderson) start swinging _ and
Garret has been _ they'll start picking up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing Mo does is he prepares so good. He goes up there
and looks for something and he doesn't miss it. One thing that's
happening right now (with everybody else) is I'm seeing a lot of
foul balls going straight back. That means we're getting pitches
but just missing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks (1-4) struggled again. He had thrown
two exceptional games but lasted only three innings in his most
recent start last week against the Yankees. He had trouble again
Sunday, giving up six runs and 10 hits in four-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks came out after allowing back-to-back homers to Dave
Martinez and Jose Canseco in the fifth, and Collins got out of the
dugout so fast after Canseco's homer he cut in front of Canseco as
he crossed the third-base line on his way to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had crossed it before the pitch crossed the plate,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Sparks' trouble is the nature of the knuckleball _
you never know what you're going to get. But Sparks wasn't buying
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the nature of the knuckleball,'' Sparks said. ``I
didn't do a good job of changing speeds with it. The bottom line is
I've got to do a better job of keeping the hitters off stride and
mixing up my pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez enjoyed Sparks' problems, hitting triples in his first
two at-bats before hitting his homer in the fifth. With 10 total
bases, Martinez set a Devil Rays record. However, it wasn't his
personal best _ while with the White Sox, Martinez had 11 total
bases in a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense got 10 hits but not when they needed them.
Greene, for example, stranded six baserunners in his first four
at-bats, then homered with nobody on in his fifth at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing balls we should be hitting,'' Greene said. ``I'm
hitting dumb right now. I'm making dumb mistakes. I was too excited
today (coming off a three-game suspension). I was jumping at balls.
Mo told me to realize the situation _ the pressure's on him. I just
need to relax.''

GANDHI'S PARTY LEADERS REVOLT, SAYING INDIAN-BORN SHOULD RULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The Congress Party's governing committee will
hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss an open revolt
within the party _ the first of its kind _ against the candidacy
for prime minister of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow who
inherited the mantle of India's founding political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Sharad Pawar, a powerful Congress Party leader from Maharashtra,
along with two other senior Congress officials, delivered an
extraordinary letter to Mrs. Gandhi late on Sunday night, calling
on her not to seek to become prime minister of this nation of 980
million people. Her foreign birth and her lack of political
experience are legitimate concerns for Indian voters, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In a party where the culture of serville flattery is powerful,
the letter was a stunningly open airing of the doubts that Congress
officials had only whispered about privately. Mrs. Gandhi, whose
husband, Rajiv Gandhi, and mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, both
served as prime ministers of India and both died at the hands of
assassins, has herself never held any elective office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Indian is not unreasonable in demanding that his
prime minister have some track record in public life,'' the party
rebels wrote. ``The Congress party needs to respect this very
justifiable expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   The views of Pawar, who led the opposition in the lower house of
Parliament, and of the two other signatories, P.A. Sangma and Tariq
Anwar, are especially damaging because they echo and legitimize
those made by the Congress party's main rival for power in the
coming elections, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
   BJP officials have been opening calling it a national disgrace
that India should even consider electing an Italian-born woman who
is a political neophyte. And they have held up their leader, the
caretaker prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee _ a veteran
parliamentary leader and an Indian - as the antithesis of Mrs.
Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition led by the Hindu nationalists lost a vote of
confidence by a single vote last month. The Congress Party
scrambled to put together an alternative government, but failed to
come up with a majority _ a failure that tarnished Mrs. Gandhi's
image for mature and cautious leadership. The country now faces
early elections in September.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, almost seven years after her husband was
assassinated as he campaigned to be prime minister, Mrs. Gandhi
agreed to take over as president of the Congress Party and had been
credited with bringing it back from the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   While praising Mrs. Gandhi for helping to revive the party,
Pawar and the other two leaders make it clear that they think
Congress was deeply mistaken to try to bring down the Hindu
nationalist-led coalition.
</P>
<P>
   And they were unequivocal that a native-born Indian must lead
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible that a country of 980 million, with a
wealth of education, competence and ability, can have anyone other
than an Indian born of Indian soil to head its government,'' they
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggested that Congress itself propose a
constitutional amendment requiring that the offices of president,
vice president and prime minister be held only by natural-born
Indian citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion by Pawar is particularly threatening, not only
because of the content of his missive, but also because he is truly
a powerhouse in the state of Maharashtra, whose capital, Bombay, is
India's financial nerve center.
</P>
<P>
   Maharashtra now provides the Congress Party with 33 of its 139
members of Parliament _ support the party cannot afford to lose if
it has any hopes of winning power after the elections. Pawar, a man
believed to have prime ministerial ambitions of his own, would see
the continued dynastic reign of Mrs. Gandhi _ and possibly her
children after her _ as shutting off all hope that he, or other
dynamic regional leaders in the party, could themselves ever rise
to the pinnacle of power.

CHARITY SCREENING OF NEW `STAR WARS' EPIC GENERATES RAVE REVIEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget the critics. The celebrities and other
lucky folks who attended a $500-a-ticket charity screening of
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' pronounced the movie
an overwhelming success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, it was great,'' said actress Jennifer Tilly said
after Sunday's screening. ``The special effects were really
fantastic. It really took you to other worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite moments: dizzying lightsaber fights between Jedi
knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan
McGregor) and their evil nemesis and some excellent laser
marksmanship by Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman).
</P>
<P>
   Any disappointments? No sex and no peek at McGregor's buff
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needed a little bit of sex,'' Tilly said. ``But I really
like it when the lightsabers come out. And there's a lot of that. A
guy in this one has two.''
</P>
<P>
   The premiere gave celebrities a rare chance to pan the critics,
who have pronounced ``Episode I'' a poorly directed but visually
intriguing film that fails to live up to its abundant prerelease
hype. The film opens on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just bitter,'' actress Christina Ricci said. ``People
who criticize `Star Wars' obviously just don't get the point.''
</P>
<P>
   The point? ``It's pure fantasy,'' she said. ``It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie delivered for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation, one of 11 charities nationwide chosen to host an
advance screening of the ``Star Wars'' prequel. Sunday's event
raised more than $1.2 million for the foundation _ all going for
pediatric AIDS research, said co-founder Kate Carr.
</P>
<P>
   The costs for the red-carpet screening and an elaborate
after-party at the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum were paid for with a
$250,000 check from corporate sponsor FlexJet.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the event sold out in 24 hours, filling three
theaters _ 1,400 seats _ at the GCC Avco Theater in Westwood. The
audience was a mix of corporate executives and several dozen
celebrities. Many sponsored kids and families who are dealing with
HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome _ really great. I really liked that robot
R2-D2. He's pretty funny,'' said 17-year-old Cameron, one of the
hundreds of AIDS Foundation kids who saw the movie and rubbed
elbows with celebrities at the ``Star Wars''-themed party. ``My
brother just saw Dustin Hoffman in the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities were glad to put their star power and checkbooks
behind the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful day,'' said former Los Angeles Lakers star
Magic Johnson, who has HIV. ``The sun is shining, and this has
raised more than a million dollars for pediatric AIDS. Elizabeth
Glaser must be smiling down from heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Episode I'' stars Jake Lloyd and Samuel L. Jackson turned out
for the screening. Lloyd said he's enjoying his moment as the
coolest kid in America, though he's trying not to let it go to his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like walking down a press line and having
everyone scream your name _ Jake, Jake, we want your picture. I
love it,'' he said, flanked by a trio of scowling bodyguards. ``But
the big ol' movie star thing doesn't really suit me. I'm going to
try and remain as normal as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The savvy 10-year-old also didn't forget the theme of the day.
``I'm very excited. All this money is going to pediatric AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite overwhelmingly negative reviews, few on Sunday were
disappointed in director George Lucas' latest addition to the
``Star Wars'' saga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was soooo good _ really exciting,'' said actress Fran
Drescher, whose sparkling rhinestone-studded Gucci pants rivaled
many of the movie's outlandish costumes. ``The fashions were
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see how a `Star Wars' fan can see it and say, I'm
disappointed,'' said actor Bruce Boxleitner, who tried out for the
role of Luke Skywalker in the original movie. ``The moment `Star
Wars' appears on the screen and the music starts, you say, I'm
home. If nothing else, it's a feast for the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Drew Carey agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worlds and creatures were amazing _ a lot of eye candy,''
he said. ``I'm glad I didn't pay attention to all the hype and
stuff. I was really surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Rob Schneider wasn't overwhelmed by ``Episode I,'' but
he thought it laid an excellent foundation for Episodes II and III.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the backlash is all B.S.,'' he said. ``It's
visually spectacular and a phenomenal piece of filmmaking, but
nothing can live up to this hype. I'm looking forward to a darker
film next time _ with less puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer Melissa Etheridge, who admits she was ``blown away'' by
the original ``Star Wars,'' went into the theater on Sunday
expecting to be pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not expecting to be lifted off the ground here,'' she
said. ``I'm expecting to see a good movie by an old friend.''
</P>
<P>
   More highlights and minutiae from Sunday's ``Episode'' I
screening:
</P>
<P>
   _ Indie film queen Ricci, who comes from a family of ``Star
Wars'' fans, confessed a dark obsession with Jabba the Hutt, the
corpulent, computer-generated crime lord who appears in ``Episode
I,'' ``Return of the Jedi'' and a computer-enhanced remake of the
original ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just so gross and icky,'' she said. ``It's sort of like
watching a car wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Basketball great turned businessman Johnson confessed that he
loved the original ``Star Wars'' so much he hid in a Lansing,
Mich., theater bathroom between shows so he could see it again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed all day from the very first movie to the last,''
Johnson said. ``This is one of those engaging movies that we're
always going to want to go see. We're hooked.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JOE Morgan was pleased to be the latest honoree at the Astros'
Sundays in the Park series, grateful for the gifts of a cap, a
replica of his old jersey with the shooting star on the front, and
a cake in the shape of the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   But purely as a fashion statement, Joe was appalled by the
throwback uniforms he and his teammates supposedly wore in that
historic year, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look how baggy those pants are,'' he complained. ``They must
think I played way, way back in the olden days. That's how the
players wore them in '35, not '65. Look at Derek Bell. His pants
are so baggy, he looks like Max Patkin.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to a well-known baseball clown who entertained
fans for at least four decades with his rubbery legs and slapstick
routines. I mean, being a clown was Patkin's real job, not a
commentary on his talent.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever accused Joe Morgan of associating with a circus, not
in his days with Cincinnati's Big Red Machine, or even in his
early, formative years in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our uniforms were more form-fitting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Smart, honest and custom-tailored, Joe would eventually make a
seamless transition to the broadcast booth, where today he analyzes
the action for ESPN. If all goes according to plan, he will soon
emerge as one of the new owners of the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   This is truly a Hall of Fame story that ranges from the basement
to the penthouse. It begins with his introduction to Houston fans
in an incident that led to his being compared not to a clown but to
a Little Leaguer. In September 1964, the Phillies were in Houston
to meet a team then called the Colt .45s, still suffering from
growing pains as an expansion club. With little else to occupy
their interest, the .45s were taking an early look at next year's
rookie crop.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, the Phillies were in the process of blowing the
pennant _ they led by 6{ games with 12 to play _ in one of
baseball's most historic crashes. Understandably, Gene Mauch, the
Phillies' manager, was not in bubbly good humor when the kid at
second base, Morgan, beat his team with a run-scoring single in the
last of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the visiting locker room, Mauch was enraged by the sight
of his players casually stuffing their faces at the buffet table.
Without a word, he approached the table and cleared it with one
sweep of his arm. Watermelon slices, barbecued chicken and spare
ribs went flying. The suits in two nearby lockers were splattered
with sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy,'' mumbled Phils outfielder Wes Covington, ``the food sure
goes fast around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauch stood there, his face reddening, and screamed at his
startled players: ``Have you no shame? You just got beat by a guy
who looks like a Little Leaguer!''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no record of his ever again inspiring a food
fight, Joe Morgan agitated more than his share of managers. The
downside of these Astros romps through yesteryear is the knowledge
that most of the players found their glory with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Many consider Morgan to have been the last missing piece that
gave ignition to the Big Red Machine. With Little Joe joining the
likes of Johnny Bench, Pete Rose, Tony Perez and Dave Concepcion,
the Reds won their division five times, the National League three
times and the World Series twice. Playing alongside those top guns,
Morgan won the Most Valuable Player award in 1975 and '76 and
carried off five Gold Gloves. He was the take-charge guy, a phrase
that has all but disappeared from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the record,'' he said before Sunday night's telecast, ``I
didn't want to leave here. When they made the trade, I said I hoped
I could come back someday and help Houston win a pennant. Well, I
did come back, and we won the division in 1980, but we fell a
little short.''
</P>
<P>
   At roughly 5-7 and 150 pounds, Morgan was himself judged a
little short _ by those who didn't look closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me he was never really a rookie,'' says his one-time
roommate, Jimmy Wynn. ``The way he handled himself, his poise, his
knowledge he had the look of a veteran player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the first time I knew he had a chance to be the
player he became. A slender, awesome lefthander for the Dodgers was
striking out everybody on our club. Sandy Koufax. But not Joe. He
stepped in there and just blistered an inside fastball, ripping it
over the scoreboard in right field, 10 rows deep in the red seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it, the quickness of it. This was Koufax.
In the dugout, I said, `My God, look at this kid. What have we
here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan went on to earn the Rookie of the Year Award in 1965, the
same season the Big Bubble opened. He played in 157 games, scored
100 runs, hit 14 homers and batted .271 in 601 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee one day, he went 6-for-6, a performance that earned
him an interview on his next trip to New York with a struggling
radio guy named Howard Cosell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard was nobody then,'' recalled Morgan. ``He interviewed me
on the corner of Madison Avenue and 55th Street. His first question
was, `With all your potential, how does it feel to be playing with
a bunch of losers?'''
</P>
<P>
   Little Joe gave him a tactful answer. He usually did. And still
does.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The end was frustrating. It was disappointing. The trials of the
season were discouraging, the playoff series with the Lakers often
disheartening.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But now, considering the events of the past four months,
considering the losses that put the Rockets in this situation and
the matchup that was against them from opening night, the end could
not be considered surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had become the fifth seed in the Western Conference
and were then beaten on schedule, in four games of the first round.
And though they left believing that at their best they could beat
any team, they knew the one that had shown them the door was
better.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it was not a sudden development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't just start in the playoffs,'' Rockets forward
Scottie Pippen said. ``We saw this happening through the regular
season. We were very inconsistent. We weren't winning the close
games. We allowed home-court advantage to slip away from us. You
could see bumps in the road along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The bumps were at times mountainous, made more obvious as they
came in tandem with their finest moments.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets ended March with a nine-game winning streak. But
they began April by blowing a 15-point fourth-quarter lead in Utah,
a loss that seemed to take weeks to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   They regrouped in Minnesota, recapturing the emotion of their
March run, and began playing some of their best basketball of the
season when they grabbed a 23-point first-half lead in San Antonio.
But they again were beaten at the buzzer, with ex-Rocket Mario Elie
making sure it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Having played the Jazz for a share of first in the Midwest
Division, they had played the Spurs for third in the Western
Conference. Losing that, they set their sights on at least holding
the home-court advantage in the first round. But in the weeks that
followed, they lost to the Mavericks at home twice, stumbled at the
Clippers and were routed in Phoenix to fall to the fifth seed,
forcing them to open the playoffs in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Rockets seemed to have regrouped again. During
their late-season slide, they beat the Lakers by 22. And in Game 1,
they took a lead into the last 10 seconds before a Pippen slip and
a controversial call against Sam Mack helped the Lakers take early
control of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a competitive team,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``On April 1, we were playing for first place in Utah. We had
our ups and downs during the year. We had some opportunities going
all the way to the opening game of this series when we could have
put ourselves in better position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over now. But I think if we would have taken care of the
first game, it changes the psychology of this whole deal,
especially where they were a team just regrouping. In their first
time out in a playoff game, if we could have won that one, it could
have changed it. It didn't happen, but we still had an opportunity
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't break the dam. We couldn't get over the
hump.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that of the last game. But he could have been talking
about the season.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Pippen said, the season will be remembered as one in
which he could not deliver on the promise he brought when he
carried his six-championship portfolio to the Rockets in a
sign-and-trade deal. He did not even mind that supposition, even
sharing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot on myself,'' Pippen said. ``I have to face our
management, our owner Les (Alexander), Robert (Barr), C.D. (Carroll
Dawson). Coming in, I felt like I was the one piece they needed to
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen was not a clear, well-defined piece to be plugged
into an obvious void. He did bring the variety of talents the
Rockets found so attractive. But he did not have a definitive
offensive style, pet moves or favorite plays to make the adjustment
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen never seemed at ease with the Rockets' offense or his
place in it. Almost two months after he went public with his
complaints in Phoenix, he went 0-for-7 and scored three points in
the Game 2 loss in Los Angeles. Ironically, he seemed to prove the
offense was not the problem when he led the Rockets to their lone
playoff victory, scoring 37 points without simply firing
3-pointers, in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie has to take some blame for that,'' Rockets forward
Charles Barkley said. ``He's got to be aggressive like he was in
(Game 3). Let's say I went to the Chicago Bulls. I wouldn't expect
them to change the triangle (offense). He just has to be more
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever difficulties the Rockets had adding their most
celebrated piece, none of their changes went easily or proved
enough. Centers Antoine Carr and Stanley Roberts had injury
problems that led to conditioning troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie backcourt of Cuttino Mobley and Michael Dickerson,
once it hit the playoffs, finally seemed to act its age, especially
when the Lakers refused to leave either open to double-team inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say our young guys struggled in the playoffs,''
Barkley said. ``I was hoping it wasn't true. But it came true.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some promise there. Michael Dickerson has a chance to
be a really good player. Cuttino, they have to find a position for
him. As well as he played, he's not a point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would help Scottie, too. Scottie expends so much energy
bringing the ball up the court all the time. Scottie would be more
integral in the offense if we get a guy who plays the point.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Pippen, the rookies and the other newcomers
seemed to need time the lockout-shortened season did not provide.
And if it seemed an odd mix to have an all-time top-50 front line
averaging 35 years old with an all-rookie backcourt, the Rockets
had a team that needed time to mature led by mature stars running
out of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' guard Brent Price, who had a breakthrough
season, said of promise he considered unfulfilled. ``I look at our
team, and we have a lot of weapons. We have some very explosive
guys offensively and defensively. It seemed like it was a battle
all year to get it all jelling, to get it all on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon, despite his matchup problems with Shaquille
O'Neal, and Barkley had solid seasons, certainly better and
healthier than a year before. But they remained the keys to the
Rockets' chances, perhaps too much so.
</P>
<P>
   And though Barkley argued they will get older, they seemed to
have gotten younger since last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an interesting year,'' Barkley said as he considered
making this season his last. ``I've never been through anything
like it. It was very monotonous, and time-consuming and tiring. It
was also fun. We had such good guys. Those rookies have great
personalities. They're fun to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a lot for me to come back and play basketball
again. We've talked a lot privately. I've talked with all my
friends. I can leave now in peace. Last year, we had a lousy team
and a lot of problems in the locker room. I really enjoyed this
team a great deal. I enjoyed playing with Scottie. Hakeem has
always been terrific. I thought the rookies did a great job under
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed it ended. I can honestly say we got beat by a
better team. But I enjoyed this year a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As rushed and too brief as it was, it at least was never dull.
But the Rockets left it, believing it could have been much more.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IN retrospect, it was a silly notion, assembling the Rockets in
such a strange fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly given the particulars of such an odd season.
</P>
<P>
   Zero experience in the backcourt plus almost a half century of
experience in the frontcourt equaled a 54-game exercise in
futility, which ended with a perfunctory first-round playoff loss
to the more traditionally structured _ albeit dysfunctional in
their own right _ Lakers. The NBA had never seen a lineup of
extremes quite like Houston's, and now we know why.
</P>
<P>
   The youngsters and the codgers wouldn't mix much better than oil
with water over the compressed course of the lockout-shortened
schedule. The combination never clicked.
</P>
<P>
   It might, might, have had a chance under normal circumstances,
with 82 tipoffs and liberal amounts of teaching time in preseason
camp plus regular-season practices. But the mad sprint to the
finish line did the Rockets no favors.
</P>
<P>
   Just when we thought the kids were all right, the playoffs
started, and everybody got a jolting reminder of how the second
season is the cruelest season for those who are unprepared for its
rigors, more mental than physical.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley and Michael Dickerson, offensive busts against
the Lakers, won't be blindsided in the future. They both figure to
have long and prosperous careers, as should the third training
wheel, Bryce Drew, who could be the best of the lot in the end. But
that fact does them not a bit of good for the present as they sit
around wondering what hit them.
</P>
<P>
   What hits some of the rest of us, in our 20-20 hindsight, is how
valuable a battle-proven veteran guard (hint: His initials are
K.J.) might have been to stabilizing the Rockets' dichotomous
recipe. With every killing jumper the Methuselan Derek Harper
swished for LA on Saturday afternoon, the more of a yearning we
felt for Charles Barkley's unemployed former teammate, Kevin
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Johnson wouldn't have helped, but today it's an intriguing
question to ponder. Moot, but intriguing nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Rockets won a championship with a rookie guard, Sam
Cassell, taking their reins in the fourth quarter. However, Cassell
could do that then because the man in the center of it all, Hakeem
Olajuwon, was at the absolute apex of his career. He was the NBA's
most dominant player, making everyone around him a notch or two
superior simply by association.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Against a Shaquille O'Neal _ Olajuwon's heir, nothing
apparent about him _ Hakeem was a borderline liability. As Mobley,
Dickerson and Drew ascend, Olajuwon is descending, perhaps
precipitously. There's no chance the former trio and the latter
hero will be in the right place at the right time together.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Sir Charles seems inclined to take his leave. He is
a realist. He can read the handwriting on the wall without reaching
for his bifocals. While Barkley acknowledges the rookies have
bright futures, he can't speak so emphatically for himself, Dream
or the enigmatic Scottie Pippen, upon whose shoulders the
short-term future of the Rockets must rest.
</P>
<P>
   (A scary thought, that, given the flickering fire in Pippen's
belly this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chuckster wanted to leave on a high note, and if he is
indeed out of here, then he succeeded _ at least personally. His
effort against the Lakers was phenomenal, if ultimately futile.
Alas, subtracting him from the equation takes away more than a
single husky torso. He provided the Rockets with a preponderance of
what leadership, direction and inspiration they had. The stuff of
which he's made isn't easily replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley has threatened retirement before, so maybe it's just
talk. Olajuwon, for one, said he ``can't imagine Charles not being
here'' next season. What Barkley is asking of the Rockets in
return, though, is a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   He requires some tangible proof they will be significantly
improved next fall. Where remains to be seen, given anticipated
payroll constraints. A significant free-agent acquisition is almost
mandatory, yet the huge sum they have tied up in Pippen _ never
mind Olajuwon _ creates a bucks bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
   And picking up the paltry million dollars Barkley would leave on
the table is almost laughably irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets probably should be in a rebuilding mode. Instead,
they are trapped somewhere between contending and starting over, in
a special kind of purgatory that doesn't figure to satisfy anyone
without a major surprise or two along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Had they been able to acquire, instead of the 33-year-old
Pippen, a strapping young star on the rise such as Antonio McDyess
to complement the neophytes on the perimeter, there might appear to
be more method than madness in their intentions. As it stands, the
ratio looks shaky.

NOW the real work begins.
</P>
<P>
   Not making excuses or rationalizations, but plans to pick up the
pieces of a broken season and finding a way to rearrange the
puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the Rockets who went down in four games to the
Lakers will be the same Rockets returning for training camp in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, including Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to doubt the sincerity of his words or the depth of
his emotional hurt when in the aftermath of Saturday's elimination
he brought up the subject of retirement again.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that nobody plays the game harder or with more of a
sense of personal passion than Barkley, and that means nobody takes
losses more to heart.
</P>
<P>
   The Chuckster finished up his 16th NBA season with a black eye
and a 36-year-old body that had been pushed to the breaking point
with that amazing 30-point, 23-rebound performance in Game 3. And
the natural reaction, at his age, is to ask himself if he can make
the commitment to do it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Does he want to work diligently to get his aging body into shape
for one more run? Does he want to subject himself to a grueling,
non-lockout, 82-game regular season to take one more shot at a
championship?
</P>
<P>
   They are the questions that led John Elway to walk away from the
Broncos, and they are legitimate. But it says here that Barkley
will ultimately make a different decision than Elway for two
reasons:
</P>
<P>
   Despite his protestations, he desperately wants a title to cap
off his Hall of Fame career.
</P>
<P>
   He, as much as anyone, influenced Scottie Pippen to sign with
the Rockets and will not walk out on him after just one abbreviated
season, Pippen's own finger-pointing playoff betrayal
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you give him the $14 million that is allowable under terms
of the new collective bargaining agreement. Because those same
rules prohibit you from offering that money to another free agent
and also because he was the Rockets' best player this season. By
far.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, it might have been hitting bottom in Games 1
and 2 that finally flipped the switch in Pippen's confused mind
about his role. Even while struggling with his shot once more in
Game 4, he was the active, aggressive force the Rockets need him to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in order for Pippen to expand his game and thrive
next season, there will have to be adjustments made in the offense,
mainly in shifting the primary focus away from a double low post
with Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident from his play against the Lakers that Olajuwon
would be the first to welcome such a change. The torch as the
game's most dominating center wasn't passed, but snatched away by
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon cannot win a toe-to-toe inside battle with Shaq, who
has not been given enough credit for working hard to expand and
improve his game. And there are other younger big men _ Tim Duncan,
Alonzo Mourning _ who can beat him down low. But Olajuwon, who says
he wants to play just two more years, is no worse than the
fourth-best center in the league and still possesses enough skills
to be effective. Rudy Tomjanovich must utilize him facing up to the
basket, shooting jumpers from near the free-throw line or along the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff has to find a way to mine the extraordinary
physical gifts of Michael Dickerson on a consistent basis. He has
all the skills of a young Clyde Drexler. The question is whether he
has Drexler's drive not only to play the game but to excel. In a
word, he is soft.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley has all the sharp, hard edges but not the
instincts of a point guard. That job should belong to Brent Price,
who has overcome so much and has the outside shooting skills.
</P>
<P>
   This is a franchise walking a tightrope between having an
outside chance and being over the hill. But that choice was made
when Pippen was signed. The intent was to take advantage of
Olajuwon's twilight years.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the Rockets must commit themselves to the regular
season and stop falling back on the crutch of the 1995 miracle run
from the No. 6 seed. They set themselves up as first-round fodder
when they couldn't finish the job this year, failing to overtake
the Spurs for the No. 3 spot and then losing to Dallas (twice) and
the Clippers to give the Lakers the No. 4 seed and home-court
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, when San Antonio beat Utah in the 1996 playoffs,
people said that was the end for the Malone-Stockton regime. Now
here's the Jazz, taking a run at a third straight trip to the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not too late for these Rockets. If they're now
willing to do the real work.
</P>

GUATEMALANS DENY CHANGES FOR INDIANS AND THE ARMY

   CHIMALTENANGO, Guatemala _ Guatemalans on Sunday appeared to
have voted down constitutional changes to recognize officially for
the first time the rights of the country's Mayan majority, a
rejection that supporters of the measures said would set back
efforts to consolidate peace after a 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral officials said on Sunday night that turnout for the
referendum was extremely poor, about 21 percent of Guatemala's 4
million registered voters, because of Guatemala's high illiteracy
rate and the scarce effort to inform residents about the proposals.
But preliminary results for Guatemala City, where nearly half of
all eligible voters reside, indicated a vote of 77 percent to 23
percent against 50 amendments to the Guatemala constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the indigenous majority has faced genocide
and poverty and long been excluded from power, the reforms would
have declared Guatemala ``multiethnic'' and for the first time
granted equal status to the languages, religions and customary laws
of the Mayan peoples, who account for about 60 percent of the
population. The proposals would have also reined in the role of the
military and overhauled the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   The vote posed what President Alvaro Arzu Irigoyen had called
``a decisive test'' in Guatemala's willingness to build a more just
society after decades of war between the government and leftist
guerrillas that killed about 200,000 people. The proposals also
would have made the first tangible changes in the army and the
government called for by peace accords signed in 1996 and that
supporters consider crucial to the country's lasting transformation
to an inclusive, democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the reforms, including business people, politicians
and intellectuals, said they mainly objected to the decision by the
Guatemalan Congress, which devised the measures, to divide a wide
range of amendments among four ballots and make voters decide on
blocks of changes rather than each one individually. But the
opposition also underscored deep racial divisions, with many
warning of the danger of ``Balkanizing'' the country by granting
legal privileges to some ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can bring about another war,'' said Roberto Orozco, 50, a
businessman in the department of Sacatepequez, east of here, who
said he voted against all 50 changes. ``We're going to turn into
Kosovo, with each tribe taking up arms to go to war.''
</P>
<P>
   European diplomats and U.N. officials monitoring the peace
process here had said a ``no'' vote would set back the political
momentum for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vote would tell us how many people support the broad
mandate of democratization,'' Jean Arnault, the U.N. special
representative here, said during an interview a few days ago. ``I
can't say the referendum speaks for the people as a whole, but it
represents the views of those prepared to be politically active at
this stage. It will mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional amendments, however, also counted on the
support of the leadership of of major political parties, including
the ruling National Advancement Party, known as PAN. Oscar Berger,
Guatemala City's mayor and a presidential candidate for PAN in this
November's elections, said in an interview that, if elected, he
would find other ``mechanisms'' to pass the reforms required by the
peace agreements, such as a constitutional assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments would restrict the army to territorial defense
and end its control of internal security, a role that has led to
scores of political killings and human rights abuses. The
Presidential General Staff, the military unit found to have engaged
in many abuses, would be replaced by civilians. The post of defense
minister could then also be filled by a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Other important changes aim to increase checks on the executive
branch and reform the judicial system, which has routinely allowed
much crime to go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wide range of the proposals, public debate before
the vote focused almost exclusively on the handful of amendments
that recognize the rights of Guatemala's indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, they have been excluded from government and
relegated to alarming rates of poverty and illiteracy in a country
where wealth and power have been dominated by the Ladinos, the
mostly white and mestizo minority.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment would define this country of 11 million as
``multiethnic, multicultural, multilingual,'' specifically
acknowledging not only the Mayan majority but also minorities like
the Garifunas, descendants of Caribbean blacks, and the Xinca, a
nearly extinct indigenous group.
</P>
<P>
   Another would grant official status to 24 indigenous languages,
a change whose effect in making education, health care and other
public services available in languages other than Spanish will
depend largely on bringing indigenous people into civil service
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms would boost a Mayan movement that has become more
united and organized over the last decade, bringing together
hundreds of groups despite language and other differences.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
There was no second-guessing by the Astros on Sunday night.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker made the call.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio put down the bunt.
</P>
<P>
   And the San Francisco Giants snapped the Astros' season-high
five-game winning streak with a 5-4, 11-inning victory before a
turn-back-the-clock crowd of 29,671 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the top of the 11th, Armando Rios delivered the
decisive run with a pinch-hit solo homer off Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers led off the bottom of the 11th with a walk off
rookie Joe Nathan, bringing Biggio to the plate. Instead of
allowing Biggio, who rarely hits into a double play, to swing away,
Dierker called for a bunt.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Scouting reports indicated Giants rookie reliever
Joe Nathan had a quick delivery to the plate, which would make
attempting a steal difficult for Spiers or, if he reached on a
fielder's choice, Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have jobs to do. We're not here to question
(decisions),'' said Biggio, who in his previous at-bat had
delivered a game-tying two-run double. ``That's the way he wanted
to play it, so I did what I was told.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell followed with a groundout to shortstop, and Nathan, a
fireballing rookie, struck out Jeff Bagwell with Spiers at third
base for his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could bunt or not bunt,'' Dierker said. ``The (scouting)
report was he was quick to the plate, and it wouldn't have been
easy to steal. I figured we could get the man in scoring
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Elarton (2-1) allowed one run and two hits in one inning. Rios'
homer off him was the rookie's third in 14 career pinch-hit
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Elarton before in the minors,'' Rios said. ``He
worked me away to start and then came back with a cutter. It had
movement, and that's what I was hoping for.''
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen (1-1) pitched 2 scoreless innings, allowing one hit
while striking out two.
</P>
<P>
   Nen did, however, blow a save opportunity. The Astros trailed
4-2 in the eighth before Biggio tied the game with his two-out,
two-run double off the left-field wall vs. Nen.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo led off the inning with a double, and Giants
reliever John Johnstone then walked Tony Eusebio. Russ Johnson laid
down a sacrifice before reliever Rich Rodriguez struck out Spiers.
Biggio followed with a shot that was so close to being a home run
that the fireworks at the Astrodome went off prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it pretty good,'' Biggio said. ``That wall helps our
pitching staff, and it sometimes hurts us. Tonight it hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, whose shooting-star uniforms were replicas of those
worn by the team in its first Astrodome season of 1965, concluded
their nine-game homestand 6-3. They batted .314 (102-for-325) over
the nine games and outscored the opposition 64-34.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good homestand, but I don't think anybody is thinking
about that after losing (tonight),'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took a 3-1 led in the sixth on a two-run homer by
Rich Aurilia, his sixth of the season, off Astros starter Sean
Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sliced the deficit to 3-2 in the sixth on Eusebio's
two-out RBI single to center field, but the Giants went back in
front by two runs on Brent Mayne's run-scoring single in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio and Carl Everett accounted for four of the Astros' nine
hits in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bergman allowed four earned runs and eight hits over six-plus
innings. At one point, he retired 12 straight batters and limited
the Giants to two hits through five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Giants starter Russ Ortiz held the National League's top-hitting
team to seven hits and two runs over 6 innings. He has not allowed
more than three earned runs in any of his last six starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros wasted a golden opportunity to put some runs on the
scoreboard when they left the bases loaded in the seventh. Spiers
walked to lead off the inning, stole second and advanced to third
on a wild throw by catcher Mayne. One out later, Derek Bell walked
to put runners at the corners. Johnstone relieved Ortiz and hit
Bagwell on the left hand to load the bases. But the Astros failed
to come up with a timely hit as Ken Caminiti struck out and Everett
flied out to left field to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros stranded 11 runners, giving them 290 for the season,
fourth-highest in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had so many chances,'' Dierker lamented.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gingrich's drivel resurfaces
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is scarier than Newt Gingrich in office? Newt Gingrich out
of office.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had been little heard from since the bollixed
Republican congressional campaign last fall chased him from the
House and its speakership, but he came roaring back last week in
Washington, with a speech that was red meat to the lionesses of the
Republican Women Leaders Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich says he had to choose between work as House CEO or as a
visionary and picked visionary. Gingrich's visions remain pretty
much as they always have been _ of liberal academic, political and
media elites who menace the country like monsters from a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrich most voters learned to dislike as speaker was in
fact the cleaned-up version of the firebrand Gingrich of the
Republican far right. The speakership forced occasional moderation
on the temperamentally immoderate Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   With the wraps off again, Gingrich, who in the past blamed
Democrats for Susan Smith drowning her two little boys and for
Woody Allen running off with Soon-Yi, now blames the Columbine
school massacre on a ``35-year experiment in a unionized,
bureaucratic, credentialed, secular assault on the core values of
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazenly comparing himself to French writer Emile Zola, who
bravely accused his nation's powers of anti-Semitism in the
notorious Dreyfus case, Gingrich says he will henceforth similarly
challenge America's liberal elites.
</P>
<P>
   Unions and credentialed teachers, he says, ``have driven
knowledge out of the classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich just minutes later would sneer at Democrats as ``the
party of trial lawyers'' but first suggests liability litigation
could be used to force Hollywood to make only decent movies _
presumably as Newt Gingrich defines decent.
</P>
<P>
   Charging that ``as good liberals,'' President Clinton and Vice
President Gore ``don't believe in a strong America leading the
world,'' Gingrich, shockingly, wonders why the Joint Chiefs of
Staff haven't resigned over the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   What's new in the unleashed Gingrich is the degree to which he
is working the God hustle. In the past, Gingrich, not famously
devout, contented himself with the usual political pieties.
</P>
<P>
   Now he demands prayer in public classrooms, dares Gore to say
whether he wants ``God or psychobabble'' in the schools and says,
``God has been driven out of the classrooms. We see the result in a
secular, atheistic system in which God is not allowed to exist.''
(It must come as news to God that he's kaput.)
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich says (wrongly) that students are not being taught the
Declaration of Independence because (wrongly II) the word
``Creator'' is in it.
</P>
<P>
   All this in reference again to Columbine, though it is clear to
anyone who has been paying attention that Littletown is a
thoroughly churched town. Its students refer often and easily to
God, Jesus and faith. Gingrich seems to doubt their sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's political tent is very much open for business again,
and he's hammering home the ideological wedges that have always
been his tent stakes.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fear of June brings May's gloom
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Parents and children have mirror-image
countdowns to school's end and summer's start.
</P>
<P>
   The period from the May 19 Star Wars National Holiday to the
last day of classes is, for students, the time of the Last Big Push
followed by steadily slower days of coasting.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, by contrast, coast along until the fear of summer
and the belief that everybody else has figured out summer for the
kids induce panic.
</P>
<P>
   These curves of anxiety intersect sometime around mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   A generalization, to be sure, but not an unreasonable one. Yes,
some schools provide meaningful and stimulating instruction to
motivated pupils until the last bell of the school year sounds.
Yes, some parents mail in summer camp deposits as soon as the
Thanksgiving turkey is cleared off the table and the last guest
heads for the door and has his concealed weapon returned.
</P>
<P>
   But more common is a feeling of stomach-gripping shock when you
lift the May calendar page and find nothing but June on the next
leaf. It seems a cruel prank.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't finished the year's second box of ice cream
sandwiches but somehow it's already summer.
</P>
<P>
   This is so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are parents alone in their surprise. Teachers rush to
shoehorn in the last few things before school ends. This is an
academic pattern I have experienced from kindergarten to graduate
school.
</P>
<P>
   History teachers gallop across centuries in these weeks. English
teachers will order a forced march of a final dozen writers and
avoid works too much longer than a haiku. Math teachers will
introduce the last few concepts as though they were familiar actors
bowing for a curtain call. Science teachers will allude darkly to
information contained in the clean, new-looking pages in the last
quarter of the textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Then the grades are compiled and videotapes and endless
discussion sessions are the rule for the final couple of weeks. The
concluding week is a mere cooling-off period and the school is one
big holding cell. During this time, little constructive work is
accomplished but students are held under close watch lest their
premature release imperils the natural order.
</P>
<P>
   And then it's summer and it's the parents' turn.
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I intend to give my children the full benefit of an
enriching summer experience. It will be a time of leisure
punctuated by the enrichment of new ideas and experiences. A time
when they retain what they learned in the past year, and move
forward to prepare for the next.
</P>
<P>
   And all I need to accomplish this is three months off from work
at extra pay and to find no more than a half dozen camps, classes
and special programs with reasonably priced yet exciting activities
that don't have waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I might just let them vegetate, sleep in,
graze out of the refrigerator, watch reruns of the Jerry Springer
Show, and listen to bad rock from bands that take their name from
loathsome diseases until I get home from work.
</P>
<P>
   They will lie about in August like lizards sunning themselves on
rocks, exerting themselves only to complain that ``there's nothing
to do.'' All abstract thought will dry out of their heads under the
beach's big sun.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these summers will it be? I can't wait to find out. I
do, however, have my suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are a summer people, deciding to become a country in
the middle of summer vacation. A time when the people charged with
running us probably were out of town and stunned to find out what
happened while they were away from the office.
</P>
<P>
   So we pay particular honor to the season and insist on the
shortest school year of any industrialized people on the planet.
And for large chunks of that time, most working families and single
parents have only a vague notion of what they're going to do with
the kids.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a fear of summer so paralyzing that I can't make
myself flip ahead in my organizer. Normally blank pages speak of a
life that's placid and under control. For the next few chapters in
this book, though, each blank page inspires a paralyzing fear of
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing it's not June yet.

 &HT;    A reporter remembers Columbine
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Rachel Sauer, along with Patrick Cleary and Chris
Barker, covered the Columbine High School shootings for The (Grand
Junction, Colo.) Daily Sentinel last month. They all said it was
the toughest story they have ever covered. What follows is Sauer's
recollections of that week in Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ John Tomlin was one of the 12 students
murdered in the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School. His
name was released the Thursday after the shootings, so I looked up
his Littleton address in a phone book and drove to it unannounced,
and I cried the whole way there.
</P>
<P>
   When I got there, John's grandfather was standing in the
driveway smoking, so I approached him and he started talking about
his slain grandson and we stood together crying. Then he went
inside to ask if Michelle Oetter, John's girlfriend, would talk to
me and she agreed.
</P>
<P>
   She and I went to the cluttered basement and sat on the couch.
She told me good memories and funny stories about John, and pretty
soon Brandon Sokol, John's best friend, wandered down, and soon
after that John's brother and sister, Patrick and Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   We talked and laughed, and they climbed all over each other to
get to the punch line of certain John stories first.
</P>
<P>
   After we were done I walked upstairs to reassure Michelle's
mother I would write a good story and send her a copy after it ran.
When I got to the top of the stairs I saw John and Doreen Tomlin,
John's parents, standing still in an impossibly tight hug. Doreen
had her face buried on John's shoulder and they both cried the
enduring tears of parents who lose a 16-year-old son. They
whispered things to each other about John _ what a good son he was,
how much they loved him _ and told each other they were so, so
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   And I had no right to be there seeing that. And I knew I had a
closing for the story I would write about John, a few
heart-bruising paragraphs so readers could see how tremendous and
personal and unbearably sad this situation is.
</P>
<P>
   The whole week Chris Barker, Pat Cleary and I spent in Littleton
was like that: People sobbed and wilted and held on to each other,
and we took notes on how they looked, what color coats they wore,
how tightly they closed their eyes, what mementos they laid on the
memorials. If we were lucky, people laid open their hearts, talking
about sorrow and loss, anger and fear and 15 deaths, and we wrote
it into stories that went national.
</P>
<P>
   People pleaded for space, or time, or privacy, and we couldn't
give them much of any. We had deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   The response to what happened at Columbine High School _ one of
the worst school shootings in U.S. history _ was enormous. More
than 300 members of the media descended on Littleton from around
the world. Most were sympathetic and professional; some were a
disgrace. Tens of thousands came to Clement Park, most to mourn,
think and pray, some to grandstand and promote personal agendas.
</P>
<P>
   It was a challenge to sort through it all: The new information
being released hourly by beleaguered Jefferson County employees,
the throngs of reporters crowding around the compelling stories,
the heavy, wet snow that fell all week and turned Littleton into
mud, the waves of emotion that followed the first explosion and
gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   That probably presented the biggest challenge, seeing the
suffering, confusion and anger and asking ourselves where we
stopped being reporters with certain obligations to professionalism
and started being just people who didn't want to do this anymore.
</P>
<P>
   I never quite figured it out. I don't think Chris or Pat did,
either. One night Pat called his wife and three daughters while we
were at dinner and his oldest, Kieran, 7, asked him if the parents
of the kids who were killed got to hug their babies before they
died. Chris, who grew up in Denver, stayed with his mom and watched
her worry about her students at the Denver public school where she
teaches.
</P>
<P>
   We heard and saw things so sad our hearts wobbled and wavered
and broke a thousand times. One Columbine sophomore told me, in
explanation of kids made into outcasts, ``You have no idea how hard
it is to find a place to hide and eat lunch because you don't want
anyone to see you have nobody to sit with.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tomlin told me he missed his son.
</P>
<P>
   I hope I never hear things like that again, but I probably will
because tragedies happen and the media report them. That's how it
works. But if I have to report on another tragedy I hope it's
followed by the immeasurable sympathy, support and unity that
poured into Littleton from around the world. I hope I see that
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday after the shootings, I saw a note on one of the
growing Clement Park memorials that was written by Sam and Nick in
red crayon on yellow construction paper. With very young spelling
and just-learned-to-write letters they said they were sorry this
happened, sorry two big bullies did this. They told the killers
they could not believe it and reassured the parents of the victims
that their children are safe in heaven, and they ended with
``Sorry!''
</P>
<P>
   I thought Sam and Nick got it right.

 &HT;    If you catch me being weird, don't worry _ that's my job
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The morning bell hasn't rung yet, so most of
my eighth-graders are hanging out in the hall catching up on the
latest gab. Bobby wanders in, pulls over a chair, and gets in my
face. ``Ms. Schuett,'' he begins as he eyeballs the graded essays
piled on one corner of my desk to see if he can catch a glimpse of
his latest contribution to the world of adolescent literature, ``I
don't mean to be rude or nothin'. ...'' I correct his double
negative and he begins again. ``OK. I don't mean to be rude or (SET
ITAL)anything(END ITAL), but you're weird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what's your point?'' I ask, not looking up from the middle
desk drawer where I've initiated a last-ditch search for my
favorite red pen _ the one I've been warned not to use by education
experts because I'm liable to damage some adolescent psyches as I
point out grammar lapses and run-on sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write little notes in the margins with a blue or black pen,''
the simpering edu-guru tediously explained to a captive audience of
tired teachers one dismal afternoon. ``Only suggest where there
(SET ITAL)might(END ITAL) be a problem and the student will find it
and make the necessary repairs. Your youthful writers mustn't be
discouraged by ugly red marks on their work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman just got off the boat from Oz,'' I muttered to a
nearby colleague who was doing her best to catch 40 winks with both
eyes still open.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby gabs on as I dig. ``You write funny stuff on our papers.
It used to make some of us mad. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Angry,'' I correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another thing _ you correct our grammar the whole time
we're in class, even while we're just talking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job,'' I remind him. ``That's why the Brinks truck
backs up here every other Friday _ to help me carry my big fat
paycheck (the one I get for picking on you) to the bank.'' Bobby
snickers and tells me I'm doing that weird thing again. I deny it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't even know when you're doing it. All the kids say
you're funny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny _ odd, or funny _ ha ha?'' Bobby says probably both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby,'' I begin as the pen search moves to another drawer,
``why are we having this conversation? Can't you see I'm really
busy here?'' He asks doing what. I tell him my red pen is gone. He
says it's up front, on the podium next to the stapler. I accuse him
of hiding it from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, you know when you'd holler,
`Bobby! Shut up and write!' I thought you were being rude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No you weren't. You were being weird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you tell the difference?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you don't hate us.'' I ask him how he knows that and
he says it's just a kid thing. ``We can tell when a teacher hates
us, even if she's talking real sweet.'' He thinks for a moment
before he adds (with a sly grin), ``But
</P>
<P>
   you're still W-E-I-R-D.''
</P>
<P>
   I commend his spelling of a tricky word and reach for my morning
can of V-8. I ask him if he wants one. He grabs his nose between a
thumb and forefinger and makes gagging noises. I ask him if that's
a ``No, thank you'' and he says it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Bobby, are we over the `weird' conversation here?'' Bobby
turns to look at the clock over his shoulder, and says it's almost
time but he has to stay another two or three minutes. I ask why.
``Are we being timed? Am I a social studies assignment?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he giggles, ``I just needed a place to hang out until
the bell rings because if I go out in the hall, Teddy is going to
move my nose over to my left ear. He said so on the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have gone to the office with that,'' I tell him. He
shakes his head and says that's not a cool thing to do. I suggest
neither is having his nose rearranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be OK, Ms. Schuett,'' Bobby assures me. ``Teddy'll be
over it by lunch and I'll still be cool because I didn't tell on
him.'' I remind him he's telling me but he says that's OK. ``The
kids know you're weird _ and that's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   I slap Bobby on the shoulder and tell him thanks a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime,'' he grins.

 &HT;    Computer experts quiet the alarm bells
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine Paul Revere jumping down from his horse and
shouting, ``Never mind! The British aren't coming after all.''
</P>
<P>
   For many who have been following the computer software problem,
commonly called the Y2K bug, that is exactly what has happened this
spring. The ``Paul Revere'' of computer glitches _ consultant and
author Peter De Jager _ has dismounted and stopped sounding alarms.
He now believes enough progress has been made on fixing Y2K flaws
that earlier end-of-the-world predictions no longer make sense.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, De Jager has booked a flight to London on Dec. 31,
1999. When the date flips to 00:00, 01/01/00 Greenwich Mean Time,
he'll be toasting the New Year somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   With seven months to go before the full brunt of the Y2K problem
is expected to hit, many software experts are joining De Jager in
saying that the worst-case scenarios, such as widespread power
outages and bank collapses, will not come true.
</P>
<P>
   So has the Y2K panic ended ever before it began? Can we throw
out the canned goods and dried soup mix and start planning a big
New Year's Eve bash? Maybe not. Despite his rising optimism, even
De Jager is not yet ready to proclaim the coast entirely clear.
Many small businesses and local governments have plenty of
headaches ahead. And even major corporations and the federal
government have a long way to go to be fully bug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is a pervasive programming flaw that could cause many
computers to misread the date when the calendar changes to 2000.
That's because the original programs were designed to read only the
last two digits of a date, making 1999 read as 99. When 2000
arrives, older computers may read the date as 00 and interpret it
as 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the flaw is time-consuming, labor-intensive and
expensive. Virtually all Y2K experts agree that even under the
rosiest scenario, many small businesses and state and local
governments will have significant computer problems in January
because they lack the money to attack the problem this year. Larger
firms have been spending vast sums. For example, Merrill Lynch, the
brokerage and mutual fund company, said it is spending $425 million
on fixing date-sensitive computer glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K remediation effort began when De Jager published a
ground-breaking article called ``Doomsday 2000'' for Computer World
on Sept. 6, 1993. But this March on his Web site, De Jager
published a new article, ``Doomsday Avoided,'' saying ``we've
finally broken the back of the Y2K problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, just as computer experts are becoming less afraid,
new Paul Reveres are saddling up to different sound alarms. In a
speech in Chicago earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said he fears the media and its coverage of Y2K: ``I know
the evening news is going to play it as though we are looking at an
asteroid which is about to hit us.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fears could prompt millions of people to take money out of
their bank accounts, touching off a crime wave as thieves try to
get the cash stashed in mattresses. ''The safest thing to do,'' he
said, ``is to keep your money in the bank'' where the federal
government insures it.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Rejoining workforce an adjustment for stay-at-home
moms
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ You can get into some pretty serious conversations
on the sidelines of kids' soccer games. Not long ago, a
stay-at-home mom who was thinking about re-entering the work force
asked me how I made the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you suddenly see yourself as a professional after
being at home for so long?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just bluff your way through it until it begins to feel
normal,'' I joked.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's some truth to that, it is a question worth
thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who spent years at home nursing, feeding, burping,
reading to, playing with and rearing our children made a conscious
choice _ if we had the good fortune to be able to choose at all.
And I will argue that nothing is more ``professional'' or profound
than raising the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   We do ourselves a grave injustice, then, when we underestimate
what we can bring to the ``professional'' world. Show me a woman
who can organize a PTA project or charity fund-raiser and I'll show
you a top-flight manager. Show me the woman who can mediate the
neighborhood children's after-school playtime free-for-all, and
I'll show you a crackerjack human resources director.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when we re-enter the work force, we encounter a major
paradigm shift. After spending years in our ``own space'' at home,
we suddenly find ourselves in a new space that isn't ours at all.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to work last year, the first thing I did was
personalize my office. I brought in family pictures and plants. A
friend gave me was a beautiful stained-glass cross that I hung in
my office window. Whenever I felt like an stranger in a strange
land during those first weeks, I would look at that cross and
instantly feel reconnected and loved.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, you adjust. You find your own pace and rhythm. You
establish new rituals that seem insignificant but nevertheless are
comforting. You learn to tackle overwhelming projects ``one bite at
a time.'' You also learn when to spit it out and start all over.
And you learn that making a mistake isn't the worst thing that can
happen. You're not an unproven, immature kid anymore; you've
experienced real life and survived. With that comes confidence.
</P>
<P>
   As I was considering all these things, my friend asked me,
``What did you have to give up?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we do have to make tough choices. I'm not as intimately
involved with my children's after-school hours as I used to be.
Given the mood they're usually in when they get home, that's not
necessarily a bad thing. Instead, we make more of an effort to
connect once I do get home.
</P>
<P>
   I've given up some of my volunteer activities. I'm not quite as
active in church work, although I still manage to teach a Sunday
school class each week.
</P>
<P>
   Although I've given up some things, I've gained others. I have
dusted off and put to use skills that had lain dormant for years,
and they came back in good stead. I have a new sense of
accomplishment and pride in what I do. I have broadened greatly my
circle of acquaintances, many of whom have become new friends.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the underlying question here is ``How hard is change?''
It's what we all fear to a certain extent _ leaving the known and
comfortable and jumping into the new and untested. We must put
ourselves to the test once again to see if we measure up.
</P>
<P>
   When I first started back to work, I bemoaned to my eldest son
that I was having to prove myself once again in midlife.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a major change of his own _ college _ he looked at me
with no small amount of exasperation and said, ``That's what life
is, Mom. Get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   You know, he's right.

 &HT;    Wired schools get graded by FamilyPC
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How wired is your school? Now you can compare, using
the latest issue of FamilyPC magazine. The May issue includes a
list of what the magazine considers the top 100 wired high schools.
Among those that qualified were Armada Senior High School in the
town of the same name in Michigan. Others were Hunterdon Regional
High School in Fleming, N.J., Ketchikan High School in the Alaskan
town of the same name and Mashpee High School in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of FamilyPC takes a look at what, if any, role
the Internet played in the tragedy in Littleton, Colo. It offers a
package of articles examining the Internet, violent software and
the effectiveness of programs that filter Net content. Not
surprisingly, the magazine concludes that it's hard, if not
impossible, to understand whether the Internet played a decisive
role in the school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The school year is ending, but that doesn't mean your kids have
to stop learning. Microsoft has released a collection of
educational software for elementary school kids. The package of
computer CDs is called ``My Personal Tutor: Grades 1st and 2nd.''
The software offers educational games designed to help kids sharpen
their math, reading and thinking skills. Its available only for
Windows PCs and workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic artists, take note. Deneba Software in Miami has
released the latest version of its graphic design program Canvas 6.
This version blends illustration, photo editing and typography into
one package. The program also includes 30,000 clip art images and
2,450 fonts. Available for both Macs and PCs, Canvas 6 retails for
$375. Upgrading an earlier version costs $200.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Workshop, producer of ``Sesame Street'' and other
popular kids' shows, has created a Web site designed for mothers
with babies and toddlers. The site provides advice on caring for
young kids and keeping them busy in healthy ways. It also offers
scads of other links to useful sites. You'll find this site, called
Baby Workshop, at www.ctw.org/babyworkshop/.

 &HT;    Site encourages kids to read
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If your child has not taken to reading with the same
enthusiasm and skill as he has taken to video games, there's a new
Web site that might help.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.bookadventure.com, is brought to you by the Sylvan
Learning Foundation, the same folks who developed Sylvan Learning
Systems, which operates about 750 learning centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is part of a free reading program. Kids can set up
an account for use at home and at school. Kids create reading lists
from a collection of more than 3,000 titles and then log on to take
quizzes on what they've read.
</P>
<P>
   The site is aimed at elementary school students, who, in
general, are reading less and reading poorly.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Education, three out of
every four fourth-graders read below their grade level. Some 60
percent of fourth-graders watch between three hours and six hours
of television each day, yet only 46 percent read daily, according
to the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Registering at the site is simple. Just log on to
www.bookadventure.com, click on ``kids,'' then on ``school play''
and then on ``new user.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids are required to enter their first name and last initial, to
create an online name and a password, and to come up with a
question to which the password is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have mixed feelings about kids exploring Internet
</P>
<P>
   Parents see the Internet as a way to help their kids. But they
also see it as a way their kids can be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   This push-pull appeal of a parent's view of the Internet is part
of a study on the Net and the American family. The study was
conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University
of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the increasing number of PCs in homes and
their growing popularity comes despite the concerns of parents
about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are similar to _ but not mirrors of _ concerns
voiced during the introduction of movies, television and cable
television, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Unique to the Web is its wide-open nature _ easy access to
sexuality, values that seem questionable to many families and
commercialism. And another difference is the Web's interactivity,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that 70 percent of parents with computers
in their homes see the Internet as a place for their kids to
discover fascinating, useful things, and 60 percent say kids
without access to it are at a disadvantage compared to kids with
it. But more than 75 percent of parents polled said they are
concerned their kids might give out personal information and view
sexually explicit images on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   About 32 percent of parents use software to filter what their
kids can see on the Internet, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study divided parents into three types: online worriers,
disenchanteds and gung-hos. The gung-hos, the most positive group,
make up 39 percent of online parents.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the study found that parents' views of the
Internet are not influenced by their access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Parents with home computers without Internet access fall into
groups that are similar to the online parents' groups.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the level of income and education do not indicate whether
a parent is likely to have Internet access, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The most important predictor of a parent's tendency to have
Internet access at home is the parent's experience with the
Internet outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released earlier this month, included interviews with
1,102 parents in homes with at least one working computer and at
least one child between ages 8 and 17. The interviews were
conducted in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   The entire study can be read online at www.appcpenn.org.

 &HT;    Claris Home Page offers clear, easy program
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Claris Home Page, making a Web site is as easy as
designing a flier or newsletter with a word processor.
</P>
<P>
   The program successfully hides and automates all the cumbersome
encoding involved in making Internet documents. All the user has to
worry about is design.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're not particularly good at design, the program
comes with lots of templates. You can either fill them in with your
own information or change the templates as you see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Home Page, though, is not just for novices. The program will let
advanced users see and edit the HTML code that controls Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a novice or expert, you'll find Home Page easy to
navigate, fast and responsive. It works, in short, in the tradition
of most Claris products.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Claris no longer exists. Apple Computer spun it off
last year. The company is now called FileMaker Pro, and Home Page
has been redesigned to work seamlessly with the database program of
the same name. More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   When you fire up Home Page, what you see is the standard empty
document window of a word processor. There is a difference, though.
</P>
<P>
   The toolbar that tops the page sports buttons related to
creating a Web page. There's a button for creating hyperlinks to
other files and Web pages. Other buttons let you add tables and
frames that a Web browser can read.
</P>
<P>
   These buttons are part of Home Page's graphical approach to Web
design. What you see on your screen is pretty much, although not
exactly, how your page will look on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   To see exactly how your page will look, Home Page lets you test
it live in either of the two major browsers. There's a button for
that in the toolbar. Testing a design is important, because the
look of a page can differ among browsers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the coolest tricks of Home Page is its ability to use a
database created by FileMaker Pro 4.0. Home Page does it through a
feature called FileMaker Pro Connection Assistant. For it to work,
FileMaker Pro must be installed on the server that houses your Web
page.
</P>
<P>
   Home Page is much more than a page designer. The program also
includes tools that let you manage your site. These, too, are easy
to understand and operate.
</P>
<P>
   Home Page retails for about $100. You can download a free 30-day
trial of the program from the FileMaker Web site at
www.filemaker.com.

 &HT;    The downside of e-commerce
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The force was not with me. I simply cannot believe the
Internet let me down.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, by the time you read this, I will have some tickets
to see ``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have taken me 34 weeks to see the first ``Star Wars''
movie (and I know it was 34 weeks because the marquee on the
theater read ``It's STILL Here! Star Wars 34th Week!''), but I was
pretty naive then and thought that ``Star Wars'' was just some
dorky space movie watched endlessly weekend after weekend by the
dorky boys in my earth science class.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now I know better. I realize that ``Star Wars'' is an
artistic and cultural phenomenon, a 20th century landmark,
something that has shaped the lives and values of millions of
people all over the world. I mean if Entertainment Weekly says so,
then it must be true, right?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so while my friends were busy programming the number of the
local megaplex on their speed dials and zipping out of work late
Wednesday afternoon to try to snag tickets in person, I just sat at
my desk, working away.
</P>
<P>
   I was so smug. I was going to buy my tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fools,'' I thought to myself. ``Using phones, standing
in line, how quaint, how 20th century can you possibly be?'' You
can just log on the Web, type in MovieFone.com, click on ``Star
Wars,'' and voila! _ instant tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Around 4:30 p.m., I finally got around to logging on to
MovieFone to order my tickets. I got into the MovieFone Web site,
clicked on the ``Star Wars'' logo and waited. I waited some more. I
stared at the little hourglass. Then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   That horrid little gray box popped up. ``There was no response.
The server could be down or not responding,'' it said. What do you
mean ``not responding''? How dare you not respond! I tried again.
And again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   I could not log on to the MovieFone Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, so many people flooded the MovieFone Web site
in search of ``Star Wars'' tickets that it practically shut the
online ticketing service down. A MovieFone spokeswoman insisted
that everything was going along beautifully. ``Thousands of
transactions are being conducted every minute,'' she told The
Associated Press. ``But people are getting through, and we are
processing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to those of us who are not getting in? ``Keep
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, keep trying. Who knew my browser's ``reload button''
would become the online equivalent to my telephone's redial button,
and in a situation like this, about as useful.
</P>
<P>
   Major news Web sites, like CNN, MSNBC and ABCNews.com, know to
clear the decks for breaking news events. Experience has shown them
that thousands of people will all be storming online at once. They
strip down their pages to the least number of images possible, so
the pages will load quickly and make a number of internal
adjustments so every user who wants to access the pages will be
able to.
</P>
<P>
   Now, MovieFone is not just a Web site. It's a Web site whose
primary business is selling movie tickets. If you have never
visited the site, it's filled with lots of bright graphics, images
and text. It has a funky style that suits a site that's all about
movies and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's an accident waiting to happen, if half the online
population suddenly decides to order tickets all at once on the
same day. It's not as if MovieFone didn't have any advance warning
to prepare for that fateful Wednesday. It knew when the tickets
were going on sale. They should have known that a science fiction
movie like ``Star Wars'' would likely have a disproportionate
number of computer-literate fans who would most likely take to the
Net to order tickets. For first-time users, the MovieFone
experience was probably unpleasant enough to put people off on
using MovieFone ever again.
</P>
<P>
   So many Web sites seem to be caught unawares in recent days,
whether it's Amazon.com underestimating demand for books or
MovieFone unable to cope with the ``Star Wars'' onslaught. Charles
Brewer, who runs the Internet service provider MindSpring, often
says the Internet will be the prime telecommunications service of
the future. I would like to suggest that maybe we're halfway there
today.
</P>
<P>
   News outlets already know how many people look to the Web for
quick information. Why can't online retailers and merchants
understand that a significant number of people look to the Web to
buy things, like movie tickets or other specific items, quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I am consoled by a poll in the ``Star Wars'' section
of Snap.com, which says 45 percent of the people surveyed wouldn't
even dream of waiting in line to see ``The Phantom Menace'' on
opening weekend. There are also plenty of sites with movie reviews,
articles and, of course, official merchandise to keep me going
until I do get some tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it took me 34 weeks to see it the first time. With a little
willpower, I can probably wait that long the second time around.

 &HT;    Design Shop builds Web sites well
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anyone wishing to make a no-holds-barred Web site
without learning HTML code ought to consider investing in a program
called Internet/Intranet Design Shop Gold.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to have to invest in something if you want a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get Web site builder, and Design Shop is
the best I've seen. It not only does the job, it comes with just
about all the bells and whistles you'd want to add to your site.
</P>
<P>
   As a sort of by-the-way feature, it will also do posters,
banners, certificates and calendars for printing on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Because Design Shop is powerful, one needs to go through the
tutorial and keep the manual close at hand for a while. It's not
really a difficult program to use, but its many features lead to
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat like Microsoft's Front Page, it provides various views
of the Web site being created, all of them selected from a screen
called the Site Manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Physical Layout view presents the site in a tree-like
structure. Most of the work will be done from the Logical Layout,
which presents each page with its relationship to others. The
Navigate Layout screen shows all connections, chiefly to let the
user hunt for any missing or broken links.
</P>
<P>
   There are controls that make it simple to keep a standard look
from page to page in the site, but these controls are also easily
overridden if you want to get crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Creating frames is quite simple, and you can stuff a bunch of
them on a page if you wish. Tables are also easy to handle, and can
be expanded to cover an entire page and used to keep bulleted items
in order. As in a word processor, standard headers and footers can
be created and the program will place them on each page.
</P>
<P>
   Design Shop comes with 45,000 images, sound clips, videos and
animations that can be used in a Web site; there is also a powerful
graphics editor and 25 separate types of business charts. There are
a bunch of templates _ basically, ready-made items _ for every
function of the program, including Web sites. Good for those who
want to do something, but don't know what or even why.
</P>
<P>
   A one-button click gives you a preview of any page at any time.
</P>
<P>
   I tried hard to find something to carp about here, and all I
could come up with concerns the icons on the multitude of menu
bars. They are rather obscure and unintuitive. So there.
</P>
<P>
   Internet/Intranet Design Shop Gold is made by Boomerang
Software, and it retails for $139. It ought to be generally
available, but if you can't find it at a store, go to the Web site
www.boomerangsoftware.com.

 &HT;    Computer, Internet privacy starts with the basics
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Can we have some privacy?
</P>
<P>
   That's what folks will tell you, if you ask about the fears they
have of the Internet and the Web. Most people will tell you they
are scared to death that some 13-year-old evil hacker genius will
steal their credit card information and use it to buy a Lear Jet;
or that some nut basket in New Jersey will make copies of all their
e-mail and send it to all the country music stations on the eastern
seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder just how serious these people are when
they fret over the possibility of a cyber-criminal breaking into
their computers. If they protected their homes with the same level
of security as their home computers, they might as well hang a sign
on the front door saying: ``Come in and take what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of worrying, let's talk about some of the really
basic things you need to know to keep your computer _ and the
information it transmits and contains _ safe. Before you start
worrying about fancy programs that can worm their way in and take
control of your computer, let's fix the obvious problems first.
Just as most burglaries are done by amateurs, most computer
break-ins take advantage of some really obvious security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with passwords. Don't use your birthday, your dog's
name, a child's name or something that obvious as a password. I
feel silly saying something so obvious, but my buddies who work for
Internet companies and who administer business computer networks
swear that this advice is still needed. Use a combination of
letters and numbers and avoid any words that would be found in the
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   If people you don't know well or don't trust have access to your
computer at home or at work, be careful of stored passwords. Even
if the password is stored in an encrypted file, it can easily be
discovered. I know it's a lot more work to type out the password
each time, but you wouldn't leave the combination to a safe taped
to its side, and it's dumb to leave your passwords sitting around
where others can get to them.
</P>
<P>
   One last bit of password advice: Most of us log onto work
systems, personal e-mail accounts and also use passwords for voice
mail and for pay Web services. Avoid using the same password for
everything. It's like using a master key for all your locks. If you
do slip up and lose that key, then every lock you have is
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about chat rooms. I don't much care if you think
that they are warm and inviting places where really interesting
people gather to engage in deeply meaningful conversations, or
whether you think that they are works of the devil where the
tattoo-to-person ratio exceeds that of the U.S. Navy of 1941. We're
not here today to talk about your private life, or even to take
sides as to whether you ought to have one. Instead let's talk about
computer security.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out on an IRC channel is very much like wandering down a
dark street with $20 bills taped to your body. We don't have time
to cover every possible opportunity that chat rooms offer even the
slowest-witted cyber-invader. But I promise you that IRC chats are
the modern day equivalent to wearing a sign that says ``kick me.''
If you want to chat and care about privacy, buy a rocking chair and
get some friends.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if your life is such that chat rooms offer your only chance
for contact with humanity, then at least consider avoiding the IRC
channels and use AOL or Web-based chat instead.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, try to avoid falling for any of the really stupid
tricks you'll see on the Internet. Don't tell someone your
password, even if they claim that they've been appointed lord over
all the Internet; don't lend your password or an e-mail account to
a friend.
</P>
<P>
   None of these tips will turn your PC into the cyber equivalent
of Fort Knox. But they do serve as important first steps in making
it safe from casual intruders.

 &HT;    A new generation of kids will get to consider good vs. evil
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Along time ago, in a decade far, far away _ the 1970s!
_ kids the same age as you lined up for a new movie called ``Star
Wars.'' At the time, few probably thought the fantasy film they
were waiting to see would become one of the most popular movies
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Kids around the world loved ``Star Wars'' and its sequels, ``The
Empire Strikes Back'' and ``Return of the Jedi.'' The movies had it
all: good guys to root for, bad guys to boo, exciting battles,
monsters, funny sidekicks and even a beautiful princess. The world
created on-screen seemed like nothing we'd ever experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Star Wars'' tells a very old story, but in a new
way. We see variations on the series' characters in everything from
the centuries-old legend of King Arthur and his Knights of the
Round Table to fairy tales and even Disney movies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a new generation of kids will flock to theaters to
see the ``prequel'' to ``Star Wars,'' called ``Star Wars: Episode I
_ The Phantom Menace.'' (Prequel means that the action takes place
before the time shown in the original movie.)
</P>
<P>
   So, what characters will return from ``Star Wars'' and who will
be new? We've provided a list. See if you can find similar
characters in other stories. Who are the good guys, or heroes, in
the legend of King Arthur? Who is the bad guy, or villain, in the
story of Peter Pan? Who are the funny sidekicks in ``Alice in
Wonderland''?
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, it'll give you something to think about while
you're waiting in line for ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HEROES
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars''
</P>
<P>
   _ Luke Skywalker _ A young farmhand on the planet of Tatooine
who joins the Rebel Alliance to fight the Evil Empire.
</P>
<P>
   _ Han Solo _ A smuggler and pilot of the Millennium Falcon. He
helps Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia battle the Evil Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace''
</P>
<P>
   _ Obi-Wan Kenobi _ Jedi Knight and mentor to Anakin Skywalker,
who later joins the Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   _ Qui-Gon Jinn _ A Jedi Master who travels the galaxy protecting
citizens of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   THE VILLAINS
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars''
</P>
<P>
   _ Darth Vader _ Robed in black, his head covered by a scary
helmet and face mask, Darth Vader is one of the most feared leaders
of the Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace''
</P>
<P>
   _ Darth Maul _ His face has ugly black and red marks. He fights
with a double-sided light saber, and he's out to get Qui-Gon Jinn
and Obi-Wan Kenobi.
</P>
<P>
   THE ROYAL LADIES
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars''
</P>
<P>
   _ Princess Leia _ One of the galaxy's most respected leaders,
Leia aids the rebels in fighting the Empire. But Darth Vader orders
her capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace''
</P>
<P>
   _ Queen Amidala _ As leader of the planet Naboo, Amidala risks
her life to save her people when evil forces launch an invasion.
</P>
<P>
   THE SIDEKICKS
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars''
</P>
<P>
   _ R2D2 and C-3PO _ The bickering ``droids'' get into all sorts
of scrapes as they accompany Luke Skywalker in battle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chewbacca _ Han Solo's furry Wookie friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace''
</P>
<P>
   _ Jar Jar Binks _ A very clumsy alien who latches onto the brave
Qui-Gon Jinn. The odd Jar Jar looks a little bit like a walking
iguana.
</P>
<P>
   MONSTERS
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars''
</P>
<P>
   In the original movie, savage Sand People prowled the deserts of
Tatooine and a mysterious slimy thing almost killed Luke Skywalker
in the Death Star's trash compactor. ``Return of the Jedi''
introduced the blobby Jabba the Hutt and his horrible pet Rancor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phantom Menace''
</P>
<P>
   Expect to see giant, space-ship eating fish and several
dinosaur-like creatures.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER NAMES TO KNOW IN ``THE PHANTOM MENACE''
</P>
<P>
   Remember all the weird names in ``Star Wars?'' Luke Skywalker's
home planet was called Tatooine, but there's no planet by that name
in our solar system. Hans Solo visited the dangerous city of Mos
Eisley, but you won't find that name on any map.
</P>
<P>
   These names were made up by the people who made ``Star Wars'' to
describe the fantasy world they created. More new phrases pop up in
``The Phantom Menace.'' Here are a few you need to know:
</P>
<P>
   Coruscant: A skyscraper-covered world that serves as the center
of power for the Old Republic. Corscant is home to the headquarters
of the Jedi Knights.
</P>
<P>
   Naboo: This small, green planet is inhabited by two advanced
civilizations along with many exotic creatures, including the Nuna,
which looks like a cross between a turky and a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Theed: The capital of Naboo, site of the beautiful Theed Palace,
where Queen Amidala lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Galactic Senate: The ruling body of the Republic. More than
a thousand senators from all over the galaxy gather in the Main
Senate Chamber on Coruscant to discuss problems and pass laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mos Espa: A spaceport on the dry, dusty planet of Tatooine, it
is the home of young Anakin Skywalker (later Darth Vader).
</P>
<P>
   Naboo Royal N-1 Starfighter: A sleek spaceship designed for use
by Queen Amidala's Honor Guard on patrols and escort missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Gungans: A race of lizard-like beings on Naboo that lend
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn a space vessel to help fight
invaders.

 &HT;    First lady visits refugees

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visited with Kosovar
refugees in Macedonia last week.
</P>
<P>
   She told them the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO,
allies will help them return home to Kosovo, a region of
Yugoslavia. She stressed the United States would not abandon the
780,000 refugees who were driven from their homes by the Serb amy.
(Serbs run the Yugoslavian government.)

   Meanwhile, NATO bombing pounded the country's three largest

   Beloved author dies
</P>
<P>
   Readers around the world were saddened last week by the death of
author Shel Silverstein. He wrote such children's favorites as ``A
Light in the Attic'' and ``Where the Sidewalk Ends.''
</P>
<P>
   He was 67 when he died of a heart attack in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Kids loved Silverstein's poems, which he illustrated with
pictures of characters like walruses with braces. Silverstein also
wrote songs and plays. Here's an example of one of his poems titled
``Listen to the Mustn'ts''.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the MUSTN'TS, child,
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the DON'TS
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the SHOULDN'TS
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Listen to the NEVER HAVES
</P>
<P>
   Then listen close to me _
</P>
<P>
   Anything can happen, child,
</P>
<P>
   ANYTHING can be.
</P>
<P>
   Bank uses eye-scan to ID customers
</P>
<P>
   A Texas bank is competing with Austin Powers and James Bond for
the coolest gadget. The Bank United of Texas in Houston has placed
an eye scanner on its ATMs to identify its customers. The scanner
examines the iris and compares it to a photo in its database.
</P>
<P>
   A person's iris is even more distinct than his fingerprint. It
contain 266 measurable characteristics, while a fingerprint
contains about 35. It can even tell the difference between
identical twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a very high cool factor,'' said Ron Coben, a bank
official. ``We think of it as James Bond-meets-stocks-and-bonds.''

 &HT;    Mercedes S-Class gets an update, still epitomizes luxury
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If having it all is what a true premium luxury car is
really all about, then Mercedes-Benz's S-Class may be on a page by
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The totally new body design 2000 S-Class boasts one of the most
extensive lists of safety, performance, comfort and convenience
features.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the S-Class has been perceived as a very
``masculine'' automobile: heavy, cosmetically conservative and
physically bulky. The new S-Class offers an attractive package that
has trimmed 500 pounds. This results in the S-Class being slightly
shorter, lower and narrower than its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all it has lost, the new S-Class has gained in other
areas, including interior space.
</P>
<P>
   The old S-Class has long been recognized as one of the few
vehicles that can accommodate a wedding dress. The lighter, slimmer
2000 S-Class actually provides increased rear legroom. Six-footers
will be able to cross their legs in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, all S-Classes will be powered by V-8
engines. The S430 will feature a 275-horsepower 4.3-liter, while
the S500 gets a 302-hp 5.0-liter version. Both will be linked to a
five-speed, driver-adaptive automatic transmission equipped with
TouchShift that allows the driver to manually control upshifts and
downshifts.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is aware that safety features have become a
major factor in the purchase process.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dual front air bags and the standard four
door-mounted air bags, the S-Class adds a side-curtain-type air bag
that _ working in conjunction with the door-mounted bags _ is
capable of reducing upper body injuries by as much as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Petite drivers and those with adolescent children will
appreciate that the front air bags incorporate smart-air-bag
technology. This means the bag inflates according to the severity
of the collision.
</P>
<P>
   The S-Class also uses sensors to determine if someone is seated
in each particular seat and deploys the air bags only if it is
occupied. That can result in major savings in the cost of accident
repair.
</P>
<P>
   Included is a console-mounted navigational and information
screen that can tell you just about everything except what to cook
for dinner. Every U.S. market S-Class comes standard with the
Global Positioning Satellitenavigational system. You'll never have
to ask directions again.
</P>
<P>
   Working in conjunction with the cell phone, the system has the
ability to send for emergency help when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanical problems? The Protection One Operations center will
dispatch the necessary help. A life-threatening emergency? Just
depress the S-Class' rearview-mirror-mounted SOS button, and the
center will call for emergency care. In the event of an accident
that deploys the front air bags, the S-Class' systems
(navigational, GPS and cell phone hookup) work in concert to
request emergency help to the specific location.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it has all the expected goodies such as a Bose
stereo, voice-activated phone system that actually understands
dialects and accents, anti-lock brakes, traction and stability
control, leather interior, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls,
14-way powered adjustable front seats, integrated garage door
opener, and power windows.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about the new 2000 S-Class is driving it. It
rides like a luxury car, handles like a sports sedan and feels like
wearing a new Armani or Versace outfit to your most important gala.

 &HT;    Wired schools get graded by FamilyPC
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How wired is your school? Now you can compare, using
the latest issue of FamilyPC magazine. The May issue includes a
list of what the magazine considers the top 100 wired high schools.
Among those that qualified were Armada Senior High School in the
town of the same name in Michigan. Others were Hunterdon Regional
High School in Fleming, N.J., Ketchikan High School in the Alaskan
town of the same name and Mashpee High School in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of FamilyPC takes a look at what, if any, role
the Internet played in the tragedy in Littleton, Colo. It offers a
package of articles examining the Internet, violent software and
the effectiveness of programs that filter Net content. Not
surprisingly, the magazine concludes that it's hard, if not
impossible, to understand whether the Internet played a decisive
role in the school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   The school year is ending, but that doesn't mean your kids have
to stop learning. Microsoft has released a collection of
educational software for elementary school kids. The package of
computer CDs is called ``My Personal Tutor: Grades 1st and 2nd.''
The software offers educational games designed to help kids sharpen
their math, reading and thinking skills. Its available only for
Windows PCs and workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic artists, take note. Deneba Software in Miami has
released the latest version of its graphic design program Canvas 6.
This version blends illustration, photo editing and typography into
one package. The program also includes 30,000 clip art images and
2,450 fonts. Available for both Macs and PCs, Canvas 6 retails for
$375. Upgrading an earlier version costs $200.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Children's Workshop, producer of ``Sesame Street'' and other
popular kids' shows, has created a Web site designed for mothers
with babies and toddlers. The site provides advice on caring for
young kids and keeping them busy in healthy ways. It also offers
scads of other links to useful sites. You'll find this site, called
Baby Workshop, at www.ctw.org/babyworkshop/.

 &HT;    Site encourages kids to read
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If your child has not taken to reading with the same
enthusiasm and skill as he has taken to video games, there's a new
Web site that might help.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.bookadventure.com, is brought to you by the Sylvan
Learning Foundation, the same folks who developed Sylvan Learning
Systems, which operates about 750 learning centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is part of a free reading program. Kids can set up
an account for use at home and at school. Kids create reading lists
from a collection of more than 3,000 titles and then log on to take
quizzes on what they've read.
</P>
<P>
   The site is aimed at elementary school students, who, in
general, are reading less and reading poorly.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Education, three out of
every four fourth-graders read below their grade level. Some 60
percent of fourth-graders watch between three hours and six hours
of television each day, yet only 46 percent read daily, according
to the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   Registering at the site is simple. Just log on to
www.bookadventure.com, click on ``kids,'' then on ``school play''
and then on ``new user.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids are required to enter their first name and last initial, to
create an online name and a password, and to come up with a
question to which the password is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Parents have mixed feelings about kids exploring Internet
</P>
<P>
   Parents see the Internet as a way to help their kids. But they
also see it as a way their kids can be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   This push-pull appeal of a parent's view of the Internet is part
of a study on the Net and the American family. The study was
conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University
of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the increasing number of PCs in homes and
their growing popularity comes despite the concerns of parents
about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are similar to _ but not mirrors of _ concerns
voiced during the introduction of movies, television and cable
television, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Unique to the Web is its wide-open nature _ easy access to
sexuality, values that seem questionable to many families and
commercialism. And another difference is the Web's interactivity,
the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that 70 percent of parents with computers
in their homes see the Internet as a place for their kids to
discover fascinating, useful things, and 60 percent say kids
without access to it are at a disadvantage compared to kids with
it. But more than 75 percent of parents polled said they are
concerned their kids might give out personal information and view
sexually explicit images on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   About 32 percent of parents use software to filter what their
kids can see on the Internet, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The study divided parents into three types: online worriers,
disenchanteds and gung-hos. The gung-hos, the most positive group,
make up 39 percent of online parents.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the study found that parents' views of the
Internet are not influenced by their access to it.
</P>
<P>
   Parents with home computers without Internet access fall into
groups that are similar to the online parents' groups.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the level of income and education do not indicate whether
a parent is likely to have Internet access, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The most important predictor of a parent's tendency to have
Internet access at home is the parent's experience with the
Internet outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released earlier this month, included interviews with
1,102 parents in homes with at least one working computer and at
least one child between ages 8 and 17. The interviews were
conducted in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   The entire study can be read online at www.appcpenn.org.

 &HT;    Design Shop builds Web sites well
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anyone wishing to make a no-holds-barred Web site
without learning HTML code ought to consider investing in a program
called Internet/Intranet Design Shop Gold.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to have to invest in something if you want a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get Web site builder, and Design Shop is
the best I've seen. It not only does the job, it comes with just
about all the bells and whistles you'd want to add to your site.
</P>
<P>
   As a sort of by-the-way feature, it will also do posters,
banners, certificates and calendars for printing on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Because Design Shop is powerful, one needs to go through the
tutorial and keep the manual close at hand for a while. It's not
really a difficult program to use, but its many features lead to
complications.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat like Microsoft's Front Page, it provides various views
of the Web site being created, all of them selected from a screen
called the Site Manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Physical Layout view presents the site in a tree-like
structure. Most of the work will be done from the Logical Layout,
which presents each page with its relationship to others. The
Navigate Layout screen shows all connections, chiefly to let the
user hunt for any missing or broken links.
</P>
<P>
   There are controls that make it simple to keep a standard look
from page to page in the site, but these controls are also easily
overridden if you want to get crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Creating frames is quite simple, and you can stuff a bunch of
them on a page if you wish. Tables are also easy to handle, and can
be expanded to cover an entire page and used to keep bulleted items
in order. As in a word processor, standard headers and footers can
be created and the program will place them on each page.
</P>
<P>
   Design Shop comes with 45,000 images, sound clips, videos and
animations that can be used in a Web site; there is also a powerful
graphics editor and 25 separate types of business charts. There are
a bunch of templates _ basically, ready-made items _ for every
function of the program, including Web sites. Good for those who
want to do something, but don't know what or even why.
</P>
<P>
   A one-button click gives you a preview of any page at any time.
</P>
<P>
   I tried hard to find something to carp about here, and all I
could come up with concerns the icons on the multitude of menu
bars. They are rather obscure and unintuitive. So there.
</P>
<P>
   Internet/Intranet Design Shop Gold is made by Boomerang
Software, and it retails for $139. It ought to be generally
available, but if you can't find it at a store, go to the Web site
www.boomerangsoftware.com.

 &HT;    Computer, Internet privacy starts with the basics
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Can we have some privacy?
</P>
<P>
   That's what folks will tell you, if you ask about the fears they
have of the Internet and the Web. Most people will tell you they
are scared to death that some 13-year-old evil hacker genius will
steal their credit card information and use it to buy a Lear Jet;
or that some nut basket in New Jersey will make copies of all their
e-mail and send it to all the country music stations on the eastern
seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder just how serious these people are when
they fret over the possibility of a cyber-criminal breaking into
their computers. If they protected their homes with the same level
of security as their home computers, they might as well hang a sign
on the front door saying: ``Come in and take what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of worrying, let's talk about some of the really
basic things you need to know to keep your computer _ and the
information it transmits and contains _ safe. Before you start
worrying about fancy programs that can worm their way in and take
control of your computer, let's fix the obvious problems first.
Just as most burglaries are done by amateurs, most computer
break-ins take advantage of some really obvious security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with passwords. Don't use your birthday, your dog's
name, a child's name or something that obvious as a password. I
feel silly saying something so obvious, but my buddies who work for
Internet companies and who administer business computer networks
swear that this advice is still needed. Use a combination of
letters and numbers and avoid any words that would be found in the
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   If people you don't know well or don't trust have access to your
computer at home or at work, be careful of stored passwords. Even
if the password is stored in an encrypted file, it can easily be
discovered. I know it's a lot more work to type out the password
each time, but you wouldn't leave the combination to a safe taped
to its side, and it's dumb to leave your passwords sitting around
where others can get to them.
</P>
<P>
   One last bit of password advice: Most of us log onto work
systems, personal e-mail accounts and also use passwords for voice
mail and for pay Web services. Avoid using the same password for
everything. It's like using a master key for all your locks. If you
do slip up and lose that key, then every lock you have is
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about chat rooms. I don't much care if you think
that they are warm and inviting places where really interesting
people gather to engage in deeply meaningful conversations, or
whether you think that they are works of the devil where the
tattoo-to-person ratio exceeds that of the U.S. Navy of 1941. We're
not here today to talk about your private life, or even to take
sides as to whether you ought to have one. Instead let's talk about
computer security.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out on an IRC channel is very much like wandering down a
dark street with $20 bills taped to your body. We don't have time
to cover every possible opportunity that chat rooms offer even the
slowest-witted cyber-invader. But I promise you that IRC chats are
the modern day equivalent to wearing a sign that says ``kick me.''
If you want to chat and care about privacy, buy a rocking chair and
get some friends.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if your life is such that chat rooms offer your only chance
for contact with humanity, then at least consider avoiding the IRC
channels and use AOL or Web-based chat instead.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, try to avoid falling for any of the really stupid
tricks you'll see on the Internet. Don't tell someone your
password, even if they claim that they've been appointed lord over
all the Internet; don't lend your password or an e-mail account to
a friend.
</P>
<P>
   None of these tips will turn your PC into the cyber equivalent
of Fort Knox. But they do serve as important first steps in making
it safe from casual intruders.

 &HT;    New camera simplifies taking good pictures
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you were lucky enough to give birth on
Mother's Day, the coincidence probably made an already magical
event even more special.
</P>
<P>
   The people at Kodak want to help you celebrate the occasion by
sending you a free camera to capture images of the new addition to
your family.
</P>
<P>
   And the camera they're offering is one of the sweetest little
gadgets I've seen in years. Kodak sent a sample of its Advantix
T550 camera, and I took it along on a recent assignment to cover
the Star Wars Celebration in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The camera is incredibly simple to use, it takes good pictures
under a variety of conditions, it's smaller than a pack of
cigarettes and about as lightweight, and it takes pictures in three
formats: classic, group and panoramic.
</P>
<P>
   The camera uses drop-in Advantix film cartridges. To load, you
flip a switch and a port pops open. Drop the cartridge into place
and the camera threads itself and sets up for the first picture.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has automatic focus features and allows distant shots
or close-ups from as near as 16 inches. The built-in flash also is
automatic and has red-eye reduction circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   The T550 can be set to stamp the time and date automatically on
the backs of prints. It also comes with special-occasion captions
such as birthday or vacation that can be automatically stamped on
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The T550 doesn't have the flexibility of more complicated
cameras. It doesn't have shutter speed or aperture adjustments, for
example, and it can't zoom in and out to get close-ups from a
distance or wide-angle shots.
</P>
<P>
   But for photographers who are intimidated by complexity, it's a
capable device.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit expensive, however. The T550 package offered to
mothers has a roll of film with free processing, a battery and a
coupon for a free picture CD and has a value of $150, according to
Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Processing also is a bit pricey. To get double prints on a roll
of 15 shots cost me about $9, including an index print.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't give birth on Mother's Day, and you're interested
in buying the camera, it is a new model that is still difficult to
find. Keep an eye on the camera departments of department stores,
discount stores and electronic retailers for the T550 and similar
models. You're less likely to find Advantix cameras in photographic
specialty stores.

 &HT;    Online TV listings go far beyond daily schedules
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, it was considered a technology that
had the potential to tear apart the American home.
</P>
<P>
   Parents worried that kids would get the wrong ideas from it.
Some people spent way too much time using it and _ in the process _
lost opportunities to take part in real life. Some experts wrote
long articles praising it, saying that the technology would change
education and bring arts to the masses. Others said it was the tool
of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about television. Long before there was an
Internet, many of the same fears and hopes were fanned by the other
box that invaded the home. Obviously, these two technologies have a
lot more in common than their flickering monitors. So it's only
fitting that we spend today talking about how to use the Net to
make TV watching more fun and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   At the most basic level of the marriage between PC and Web,
there are the online listings for programming. Several sites offer
listings, but one of the best comes from the folks at Yahoo! You'll
find the listing at tv.yahoo.com/yahoo/moretopics.dpg.
</P>
<P>
   It's a well-designed service. On that page, you'll find about 30
topic areas, including romance, science-fiction, adventure, comedy,
religion and movies. To show you how the listings work, click on
``movies'' and see what happens. You're zapped to a page that looks
very much like a newspaper listing of TV movies. It automatically
pops on the screen for today's date, but you can use pull-down
menus to change the date or the way the information is presented.
Once you have set up the page to suit your taste, you can browse
the movies on tap for that day from AMC, TBS, TNT or any of the
networks or programming services that offer movies.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a movie you like, you can click on the title and get
a mini-review. You'll also find links on this page that will take
you to listings for the major satellite TV services including USSB
and DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, however, that you want your TV listings served up
according to where you live and the cable TV provider that serves
that area. Simply stick with Yahoo! but go to tv.yahoo.com/. Enter
your ZIP code and you'll get the listings (if there is more than
one provider serving your area, you'll get a pull-down menu that
lets you pick the cable company).
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of giving too much space to Yahoo!, let's take a
look at one other service provided by the search engine: a soap
opera update that you'll find at tv.yahoo.com/soaps/soap.dpg?d
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 1&AMP;wk &QC; 1. If, for instance, you forgot to tape last week's ``The
Bold and the Beautiful,'' you can simply click on the listing for
that soap opera to get the latest details. This is detailed, if
drably written, stuff. For instance, a recent summary explained:
``Rick tells himself over and over again that he is married to
Amber and they have a son. Brooke confronts Amber and her mother
and boasts that she knows the terrible secret about the baby and
why Amber couldn't give birth with anyone around.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the idea that Yahoo! is the only place to get TV
listing information. Here's a page with links to almost any TV
listing service you can name: www
</P>
<P>
   .buttle.com/tv/schedule.htm. And, since it offers worldwide
television listings, you may enjoy browsing the listing services
for South American and European networks.

flip a switch and a port pops open. Drop the cartridge into place
and the camera threads itself and sets up for the first picture.
</P>
<P>
   The camera has automatic focus features and allows distant shots
or close-ups from as near as 16 inches. The built-in flash also is
automatic and has red-eye reduction circuitry.
</P>
<P>
   The T550 can be set to stamp the time and date automatically on
the backs of prints. It also comes with special-occasion captions
such as birthday or vacation that can be automatically stamped on
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The T550 doesn't have the flexibility of more complicated
cameras. It doesn't have shutter speed or aperture adjustments, for
example, and it can't zoom in and out to get close-ups from a
distance or wide-angle shots.
</P>
<P>
   But for photographers who are intimidated by complexity, it's a
capable device.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit expensive, however. The T550 package offered to
mothers has a roll of film with free processing, a battery and a
coupon for a free picture CD and has a value of $150, according to
Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Processing also is a bit pricey. To get double prints on a roll
of 15 shots cost me about $9, including an index print.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't give birth on Mother's Day, and you're interested
in buying the camera, it is a new model that is still difficult to
find. Keep an eye on the camera departments of department stores,
discount stores and electronic retailers for the T550 and similar
models. You're less likely to find Advantix cameras in photographic
specialty stores.

 &HT;    Claris Home Page offers clear, easy program
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Claris Home Page, making a Web site is as easy as
designing a flier or newsletter with a word processor.
</P>
<P>
   The program successfully hides and automates all the cumbersome
encoding involved in making Internet documents. All the user has to
worry about is design.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you're not particularly good at design, the program
comes with lots of templates. You can either fill them in with your
own information or change the templates as you see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Home Page, though, is not just for novices. The program will let
advanced users see and edit the HTML code that controls Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a novice or expert, you'll find Home Page easy to
navigate, fast and responsive. It works, in short, in the tradition
of most Claris products.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Claris no longer exists. Apple Computer spun it off
last year. The company is now called FileMaker Pro, and Home Page
has been redesigned to work seamlessly with the database program of
the same name. More on that later.
</P>
<P>
   When you fire up Home Page, what you see is the standard empty
document window of a word processor. There is a difference, though.
</P>
<P>
   The toolbar that tops the page sports buttons related to
creating a Web page. There's a button for creating hyperlinks to
other files and Web pages. Other buttons let you add tables and
frames that a Web browser can read.
</P>
<P>
   These buttons are part of Home Page's graphical approach to Web
design. What you see on your screen is pretty much, although not
exactly, how your page will look on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   To see exactly how your page will look, Home Page lets you test
it live in either of the two major browsers. There's a button for
that in the toolbar. Testing a design is important, because the
look of a page can differ among browsers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the coolest tricks of Home Page is its ability to use a
database created by FileMaker Pro 4.0. Home Page does it through a
feature called FileMaker Pro Connection Assistant. For it to work,
FileMaker Pro must be installed on the server that houses your Web
page.
</P>
<P>
   Home Page is much more than a page designer. The program also
includes tools that let you manage your site. These, too, are easy
to understand and operate.
</P>
<P>
   Home Page retails for about $100. You can download a free 30-day
trial of the program from the FileMaker Web site at
www.filemaker.com.

 &HT;    The downside of e-commerce
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The force was not with me. I simply cannot believe the
Internet let me down.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, by the time you read this, I will have some tickets
to see ``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have taken me 34 weeks to see the first ``Star Wars''
movie (and I know it was 34 weeks because the marquee on the
theater read ``It's STILL Here! Star Wars 34th Week!''), but I was
pretty naive then and thought that ``Star Wars'' was just some
dorky space movie watched endlessly weekend after weekend by the
dorky boys in my earth science class.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now I know better. I realize that ``Star Wars'' is an
artistic and cultural phenomenon, a 20th century landmark,
something that has shaped the lives and values of millions of
people all over the world. I mean if Entertainment Weekly says so,
then it must be true, right?
</P>
<P>
   OK, so while my friends were busy programming the number of the
local megaplex on their speed dials and zipping out of work late
Wednesday afternoon to try to snag tickets in person, I just sat at
my desk, working away.
</P>
<P>
   I was so smug. I was going to buy my tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fools,'' I thought to myself. ``Using phones, standing
in line, how quaint, how 20th century can you possibly be?'' You
can just log on the Web, type in MovieFone.com, click on ``Star
Wars,'' and voila! _ instant tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Around 4:30 p.m., I finally got around to logging on to
MovieFone to order my tickets. I got into the MovieFone Web site,
clicked on the ``Star Wars'' logo and waited. I waited some more. I
stared at the little hourglass. Then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   That horrid little gray box popped up. ``There was no response.
The server could be down or not responding,'' it said. What do you
mean ``not responding''? How dare you not respond! I tried again.
And again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   I could not log on to the MovieFone Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, so many people flooded the MovieFone Web site
in search of ``Star Wars'' tickets that it practically shut the
online ticketing service down. A MovieFone spokeswoman insisted
that everything was going along beautifully. ``Thousands of
transactions are being conducted every minute,'' she told The
Associated Press. ``But people are getting through, and we are
processing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice to those of us who are not getting in? ``Keep
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, keep trying. Who knew my browser's ``reload button''
would become the online equivalent to my telephone's redial button,
and in a situation like this, about as useful.
</P>
<P>
   Major news Web sites, like CNN, MSNBC and ABCNews.com, know to
clear the decks for breaking news events. Experience has shown them
that thousands of people will all be storming online at once. They
strip down their pages to the least number of images possible, so
the pages will load quickly and make a number of internal
adjustments so every user who wants to access the pages will be
able to.
</P>
<P>
   Now, MovieFone is not just a Web site. It's a Web site whose
primary business is selling movie tickets. If you have never
visited the site, it's filled with lots of bright graphics, images
and text. It has a funky style that suits a site that's all about
movies and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's an accident waiting to happen, if half the online
population suddenly decides to order tickets all at once on the
same day. It's not as if MovieFone didn't have any advance warning
to prepare for that fateful Wednesday. It knew when the tickets
were going on sale. They should have known that a science fiction
movie like ``Star Wars'' would likely have a disproportionate
number of computer-literate fans who would most likely take to the
Net to order tickets. For first-time users, the MovieFone
experience was probably unpleasant enough to put people off on
using MovieFone ever again.
</P>
<P>
   So many Web sites seem to be caught unawares in recent days,
whether it's Amazon.com underestimating demand for books or
MovieFone unable to cope with the ``Star Wars'' onslaught. Charles
Brewer, who runs the Internet service provider MindSpring, often
says the Internet will be the prime telecommunications service of
the future. I would like to suggest that maybe we're halfway there
today.
</P>
<P>
   News outlets already know how many people look to the Web for
quick information. Why can't online retailers and merchants
understand that a significant number of people look to the Web to
buy things, like movie tickets or other specific items, quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I am consoled by a poll in the ``Star Wars'' section
of Snap.com, which says 45 percent of the people surveyed wouldn't
even dream of waiting in line to see ``The Phantom Menace'' on
opening weekend. There are also plenty of sites with movie reviews,
articles and, of course, official merchandise to keep me going
until I do get some tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it took me 34 weeks to see it the first time. With a little
willpower, I can probably wait that long the second time around.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: My girlfriend wants to know what the alcohol content of fully
cooked frijoles borrachos is. _ Norman H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Most recipes for beer beans call for the beer to be added at
the beginning of the process. Beans come to a boil, then cook for
several hours. By then, says Travis County Extension Service's
Ramona Kellam, alcohol boils and dissipates in the steam. You do
not need to worry about the alcohol content of these flavorful
pinto beans. Q: I am unable to afford high prices for a lawyer. Can
I write my own will? Does it have to be notarized? What does a
lawyer charge? _Billy R. A: Properly dated holographic wills _
written entirely by the person whose will it is _ in Texas do not
require witnesses. Other wills must be properly executed, witnessed
and signed by two people in the presence of the person whose will
it is, says attorney Sara Atkins of Saunders &AMP; Norval, LLP. When
writing your will, be as specific as possible and remember most
wills are probated, so appoint an independent executor to serve
without bond. There are many ways to cause problems for heirs. Why
not spend a few hundred dollars up front to make sure the will is
properly drawn?
</P>
<P>
   Q: My daughter teaches third grade and they are struggling with
learning the 50 states. She remembers a song from her school days
named ``Fifty Nifty United States,'' but she doesn't remember all
of the words. Could you help us locate it? _ D.V. Parsons
</P>
<P>
   A: This catchy ditty was written and arranged by Ray Charles, no
less. The song is a great teaching tool: ``Shout 'em, scout 'em,
Tell all about 'em. One by one 'til we've given a day, To ev'ry
state in the USA ...''
</P>
<P>
   For a copy of the choral music ($1.50), contact Shawnee Press at
(800) 962-8584.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I attempted to park at a parking meter located in front
of a popular Austin restaurant, I was told to move by the
restaurant's valet parking service. The service said they had
exclusive rights to the spaces. How can a private company have the
right to run me off from a space paid for with my tax dollars? I've
also noticed that these same valets will double-park cars on the
streets in front of the restaurants, causing traffic jams. Where is
the Austin Police Department? _ R. Walker
</P>
<P>
   A: Show them this column. The company does not have a right to
metered spaces. Even a sign indicating a passenger loading zone
means everyone _ valets and customers alike _ may use the space.
Alan Hughes, city traffic engineer, says we do not have valet
parking zones. Both valet parking services I quizzed (VIP Valet
Parking and Valet Parking Service Inc. of Texas) do not allow
valets to shoo away anyone from metered spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Should double-parked cars cause a problem, call 911 to have an
officer dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have accidentally spilled some brown hair dye, Just for
Men, on almond-colored painted wood and a dark blue carpet. I have
not been able to clean off the stains using ordinary cleansers. I
am considering bleach or paint thinner, but I want to avoid harming
the painted surfaces and bleaching the carpet. I would rather not
have to repaint. _ J.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oops. This is a dye, so whatever is tried may only have
marginal success. Combe Inc., makers of Just for Men, predicts you
will have to repaint the wood. Try the paint thinner _ you have
nothing to lose. The carpet may be saved by using a half
ammonia-half water solution on the stain. (Try it on an unobtrusive
spot first to test for colorfastness). Others report success with
Resolve carpet cleaner. Need more from Combe? Call (800) 431-2610.
Some men use this line to order the product directly rather than
face the prospect of a public purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in knowing when you may use ``Junior'' after
a name. How can you use the ``II''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ruth Maxfield
</P>
<P>
   A: Follow closely _ these are murky waters, says David A. Baskin
of the Texas State Library and Archives. Junior always denotes
descent. A man can call himself Jr. when he has exactly the same
name as a living father _ or grandfather, if the father has died.
When the father or grandfather dies, the Jr. is dropped. When a
grandson bears the Junior appellation, any of his younger cousins
with the same name uses II. There may be more than one II in the
same generation. By the way, when someone is named for his uncle,
he is II and never Jr. With me? Someone who shares a name with both
his living father and grandfather is called III. When the
grandfather dies, he becomes Jr. Q: Who can change the foot pedals
to hand controls on the dash of a car? I am going to have an
amputation soon but still need to be able to drive a car a while
longer. I am on Medicaid. I have heard they can handle that, but
whom do I ask to make sure? _ E. Smith
</P>
<P>
   A: The conversion can be done locally by outfits such as Para
Driving Aids (385-0808). A set of hand controls runs about $545 _
less if you elect to have portable controls, which require more
strength. Unfortunately, Nancy Nichols of the Texas Department of
Health says this expense is not a federally allowable benefit of
Medicaid. For more information on Medicaid call (800) 252-8263.
Details on recovery programs are available from the Texas
Rehabilitation Commission inquiry line at 424-4060. Q: I bought a
letter signed by Joan Fontaine and I would like to know where to
request a picture. _ Joe V.
</P>
<P>
   A: Contact the star of Hitchcock's ``Suspicion'' and, my
favorite, ``Jane Eyre'' in care of Gage Group, 9255 Sunset Blvd.,
515, Los Angeles 90069. Born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland, young
Joan took the name Fontaine on the advice of a fortune teller. Q:
My best friend and I disagree on something and I told her you would
know the answer. I was recently invited to a bridal shower and
wedding. I purchased a gift for both occasions. My friend said if
you buy a shower gift you are not expected to buy a wedding gift.
What is proper etiquette? A lunch may ride on the answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teresa Adams
</P>
<P>
   A: Get ready for a free lunch. Two events, two gifts. The
wedding gift is your main offering to the couple. The shower gift
may be just a token _ a framed photo of you and the bride, for
example. Brides and grooms need to be mindful of how many
gift-giving opportunities (showers) there are and how often each
name appears on these lists. Q: I am looking for a product by
Oral-B called Interdental Woodsticks. They are like toothpicks but
work better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helen Reed
</P>
<P>
   A: This round-ended device is used in addition to flossing. Pick
up a package of 100 at Wal-Mart or Kmart or order by calling (800)
765-2959.
</P>
<P>
   Upshot/Update/Uproar:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some readers find powdered ginger capsules prevent motion
sickness. They take these over-the-counter capsules, found in the
vitamin section, and say their world is a little more stable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anniversary lovers will enjoy these terms from the Suburban
Library System: 10 years, decennial; 15, quindecennial; 20,
virgintennial (proposed); 30, trigentennial; 40, quadragennial; 50,
jubilee or quinquagenary; and (should it come to this) 15,000
years, quindecimillenial.

 &HT;    Online TV listings go far beyond daily schedules
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, it was considered a technology that
had the potential to tear apart the American home.
</P>
<P>
   Parents worried that kids would get the wrong ideas from it.
Some people spent way too much time using it and _ in the process _
lost opportunities to take part in real life. Some experts wrote
long articles praising it, saying that the technology would change
education and bring arts to the masses. Others said it was the tool
of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about television. Long before there was an
Internet, many of the same fears and hopes were fanned by the other
box that invaded the home. Obviously, these two technologies have a
lot more in common than their flickering monitors. So it's only
fitting that we spend today talking about how to use the Net to
make TV watching more fun and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   At the most basic level of the marriage between PC and Web,
there are the online listings for programming. Several sites offer
listings, but one of the best comes from the folks at Yahoo! You'll
find the listing at tv.yahoo.com/yahoo/moretopics.dpg.
</P>
<P>
   It's a well-designed service. On that page, you'll find about 30
topic areas, including romance, science-fiction, adventure, comedy,
religion and movies. To show you how the listings work, click on
``movies'' and see what happens. You're zapped to a page that looks
very much like a newspaper listing of TV movies. It automatically
pops on the screen for today's date, but you can use pull-down
menus to change the date or the way the information is presented.
Once you have set up the page to suit your taste, you can browse
the movies on tap for that day from AMC, TBS, TNT or any of the
networks or programming services that offer movies.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a movie you like, you can click on the title and get
a mini-review. You'll also find links on this page that will take
you to listings for the major satellite TV services including USSB
and DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, however, that you want your TV listings served up
according to where you live and the cable TV provider that serves
that area. Simply stick with Yahoo! but go to tv.yahoo.com/. Enter
your ZIP code and you'll get the listings (if there is more than
one provider serving your area, you'll get a pull-down menu that
lets you pick the cable company).
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of giving too much space to Yahoo!, let's take a
look at one other service provided by the search engine: a soap
opera update that you'll find at tv.yahoo.com/soaps/soap.dpg?d
</P>
<P>
   &QC; 1&AMP;wk &QC; 1. If, for instance, you forgot to tape last week's ``The
Bold and the Beautiful,'' you can simply click on the listing for
that soap opera to get the latest details. This is detailed, if
drably written, stuff. For instance, a recent summary explained:
``Rick tells himself over and over again that he is married to
Amber and they have a son. Brooke confronts Amber and her mother
and boasts that she knows the terrible secret about the baby and
why Amber couldn't give birth with anyone around.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the idea that Yahoo! is the only place to get TV
listing information. Here's a page with links to almost any TV
listing service you can name: www
</P>
<P>
   .buttle.com/tv/schedule.htm. And, since it offers worldwide
television listings, you may enjoy browsing the listing services
for South American and European networks.

 &HT;    Gallaga: How to play the game at E3
 &HT;    By Omar Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What's the hardest part about the video game
business?
</P>
<P>
   Forget about bringing bloodthirsty aliens to life or building
virtual worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of the business may be convincing folks in the
real world to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   In today's competitive gaming world, game makers have got to
convince hard-core gamers that they're not just selling a shameless
rip-off (even if it is a sequel) or something that's as boring as a
modern-day Pong.
</P>
<P>
   You've also got to be at the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're George Lucas, the best place to sell the game hype
is at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, which wraps
up today after three days. How's the game played at E3, as the expo
is known?
</P>
<P>
   Learn from the folks at Austin-based Iguana Entertainment and
its parent, Acclaim Entertainment, who let me spend some time with
them at E3:
</P>
<P>
   _Create the illusion of exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim's booth was a circular structure with a single entrance.
Anyone who wanted to see the inside, including its upcoming games,
had to get past security.
</P>
<P>
   _Throw a party, but keep people out of it.
</P>
<P>
   A party scheduled for after the show for Acclaim was restricted
to VIPs. Likewise, Eidos Interactive whetted attendees' appetites
by sending out hundreds of invitations in advance to a House of
Blues party that featured Everclear and David Bowie, then turned
away half the crowd when the place got too full. And a VERY private
party thrown by game developer Psygnosis at the Playboy Mansion was
a distant dream for hopeful E3 attendees _ it was booked up before
E3 began.
</P>
<P>
   _Get some celebrity endorse- ments.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim brought in motocross racer Jeremy McGrath to sign
autographs. Electronic Arts hosted wrestlers from the WCW and Bowie
was guest of honor with Eidos. Acclaim makes the Jeremy McGrath
Supercross game.
</P>
<P>
   _Get some sexy celebrity endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim welcomed buxom personality ``Debra'' from the World
Wrestling Federation to sign autographs too. Strangely, her line
was longer than McGrath's. Acclaim produces WWF Attitude.
</P>
<P>
   _Announce important-sounding news.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim announced Thursday that it was changing the names of the
companies it owns. So, after this week, Iguana will cease to exist.
It will be called Acclaim Austin. Releasing news during E3 gives
the appearance that a company is a mover and shaker. And it makes
it so much easier to distribute those pesky press releases.
</P>
<P>
   _Remember that floor space equals buzz.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest names at E3 had the biggest booths. Sony. Sega.
Nintendo. Microsoft and Electronic Arts. Acclaim claimed a huge
chunk of space for a relatively small area of game demonstrations.
But because of the security mentioned earlier, the general E3
public didn't know that, and had to wonder what kinds of goodies
were inside.
</P>
<P>
   _Give out free stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaim and Iguana handed out stickers to publicize the new
Chef's Luv Shack game that Iguana produced in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   _Oh yeah, the games.
</P>
<P>
   Have at least some games available to players.
</P>
<P>
   If they're good, the players will come.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TETOVO, Macedonia _ In a dingy office at the foot of still
snow-capped mountains, Baton Haxhiu has revived a dream that seemed
a casualty of Slobodan Milosevic's repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In exile, Baton, as everyone calls him here, has re-created the
irreverent and militant newspaper that published in the Kosovar
capital, Pristina, until Yugoslav forces began expelling hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   With financial backing from the British Foreign Office, donated
office space, and 12 journalists, the 16-page Koha Ditore (Daily
Times) covers Kosovo-related news from many sides of the conflict.
The newspaper is distributed for free in the nine refugee camps in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the newspaper to be a bridge between the people here
and those in Kosovo,'' said Baton, 33, lanky with a red beard and
darting green eyes. NATO had mistakenly reported him killed near
the start of the 54-day air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The vacuum in the political leadership for the ethnic Albanians
``was the motive to restart Koha Ditore,'' he said. The newspaper
in exile published its first edition April 26 with the headline,
``KOSOVO MUST BE THE WINNER IN THIS WAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping ethnic Albanians informed, he said, will help to calm
Macedonia, where tensions have exploded several times not only over
the influx of refugees but because of opposition to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably no better place inside Macedonia to start his
project than Tetovo, a western region of the country where 47,000
Kosovar Albanians with contacts and money have found refuge. Unlike
their poorer cousins in the camps near the Macedonian capital of
Skopje, most refugees here are living with other ethnic Albanians,
who make up nearly 83 percent of Tetovo's 130,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Baton hid in nine basements in as many days before he escaped
from Kosovo into Macedonia. He left without his wife and 3
1/2-year-old son, but that is a sacrifice he says he made for
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Between bites of a chocolate-covered sundae in a restaurant
across the street from his office, Baton explains that his
newspaper is keeping the same iconoclastic tone it had in Pristina.
The paper challenges not only the Yugoslav regime but the policies
of pacifist Kosovar leader Ibrahim Rugova. It also takes aim at the
inexperienced political leadership of the Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   These perceived leaders, he says, have ceased to exist in the
minds of most ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a morally bankrupt political structure,'' Baton said.
Rugova betrayed his people, Baton says, when he met Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president, last month. He should have refused, sacrificing
his personal needs for the greater good of Kosovo, Baton says. On
the other hand, the KLA's poorly planned tactics have failed to
protect the Kosovar Albanians, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of political leadership is creating confusion and
desperation among the refugees, who, in addition to a myriad of
worries, are torn between remaining until the end or leaving for
another country and effectively accepting Milosevic's ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no political voice to tell these people that everyone
must make sacrifices for Kosovo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering seems more distant in this picturesque town than
in Kosovo or the camps. Many refugees in Tetovo, like Baton and his
journalists, sit in cafes sipping cappuccinos or eating ice cream.
They are middle-class professionals, affluent business owners and
intellectuals who had the means and the contacts to avoid the
camps. This picture of normalcy is an illusion made more profound
by people who feel too helpless to do anything but sit at cafes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going crazy,'' he said. ``Look at that young Kosovar
Albanian girl over there. She looks like she's on holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Impatient for a broadening of the NATO campaign, Baton says his
newspaper will stop publishing July 1 to protest the international
community's reluctance to send in ground troops.

   On May 5, President Clinton issued a proclamation designating
May 6 as a National Day of Prayer. Governors of 48 states followed
with their own prayer day proclamations. Fortunately, few Americans
paid attention _ the government has no business poking its nose
into religion, or exhorting its citizens to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer day has been an annual event ever since Congress gave it
a seal of approval in 1952 and then the backing of law in 1988,
establishing the first Thursday of May as National Day of Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Congress also passed a resolution in 1988 that
states: ``religion is most free when it is observed voluntarily at
private initiative, uncontaminated by government interference and
unconstrained by majority preference.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson, who wrote Virginia's Statute for Establishing
Religious Freedom, refused to issue prayer proclamations when he
became president because he believed to do so is unconstitutional
and that it would sow dissention among the citizens of the nation.
Jefferson wrote, ``every one must act according to the dictates of
his own reason, and mine tells me that civil powers alone have been
given to the president of the United States and no authority to
direct the religious exercises of his constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in his presidency, James Madison noted that the government
does not have the moral authority to ``speak to the faith and the
consciences of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable, then, with this tradition in Virginia,
that its governor refrained from issuing a proclamation declaring a
day of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura surprised many by also refusing to
sign a proclamation making May 6 a day of prayer. The Associated
Press quoted Ventura saying: ``I believe in the separation of
church and state. We all have our own religious beliefs. There are
people out there who are atheists, who don't believe at all.
...They are all citizens of Minnesota, and I have to respect
that.'' Ventura had an arm lock on the real issue and refused to
let go. And he is right.
</P>
<P>
   There are well over 100 religious groups in the United States
today represented by more than 300,000 churches. Religion thrives
in the United States precisely because of our freedom from
religious coercion.
</P>
<P>
   As the French social philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville pointed
out long ago in his book, ``Democracy in America,'' ``every man is
allowed freely to take that road he thinks will lead him to
heaven.'' We don't need government authority to point us to
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The founders, like Jefferson, Madison and James Mason, took
seriously the tenet that religious belief is a natural right
bestowed upon an individual's conscience and cannot and should not
be the subject of government interference.
</P>
<P>
   This year a group calling itself the National Day of Prayer Task
Force sent out a ``resource manual'' of instructions that states a
prayer day ``volunteer must be a Christian who has a personal
relationship with Christ.'' Further, the manual instructs that in
these prayer ceremonies: ``the only people who get to the
microphone are those we know have a personal relationship with
Christ.'' The manual also makes it clear that Mormons and Muslims
and other religious groups are not invited to these National Day of
Prayer ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the NDP Task Force manual could be confused
to be endorsed by the U.S. government. The group held a prayer
event in the U.S. House of Representatives' Cannon Office Building.
A number of elected and public officials attended. Mormons and
Muslims were excluded. By allowing a prayer ceremony that excludes
a large diversity of religious beliefs to be held in a federal
building, the House leadership has given such exclusion its
blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the NDP Task Force is affiliated with James Dobson of
Focus on the Family and other leaders of the Religious Right, like
Gary Bauer who is campaigning to be the Republican Party's
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Americans United for Separation of Church and
State, a church-state watchdog group based in Washington, D.C., the
NDP Task Force scheduled its events at government buildings and
sought the ``endorsements and participation by governors, mayors
and other elected officials, thus giving the events the appearance
of official sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Barry Lynn, Americans United executive director, concluded,
``Most Americans are sure to think this Christian prayer event is
sponsored by the government and that sends a negative, exclusionary
message to religious minorities who are being told they are not
welcome.`` Lynn urges Congress to repeal the National Day of
Prayer, so that religious leaders of all beliefs can set their own
special days of prayer _ without government meddling.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Walker, general counsel for the Baptist Joint Committee, a
coalition of Baptist organizations, said in an interview Friday,
``The National Day of Prayer has been used as part of the political
agenda of the far right.'' He stressed the point that Jefferson had
made long ago, ``Civil magistrates shouldn't be leading us to
national prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Religious Right are using prayer day to
discriminate against religions that are in the minority in the
nation. They pretend to have the imprimatur of federal and state
governments. They sow the seeds of divisiveness that could fracture
our society along religious lines. They play a dangerous game.
</P>
<P>
   If you did not remember that May 6 was national prayer day,
suffer no guilt or regrets. Disregarding prayer day may be the best
way to ensure religious liberty in our nation and safeguard our
religious beliefs _ no matter how diverse they are.

WAR WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 23)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Every sailor enforcing a blockade knows the term of art for the
warlike act of stopping a ship suspected of carrying contraband:
 &UR; board and search &LR; . However, in cutting off the supply of oil to
Serbia, NATO's crack nomenclature specialists devised a more
blockade-runner friendly term so as not to offend vessels being
frisked. The new, sugarcoated pill of war:  &UR; search and visit &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   As Naval Reserve Officer Seth Cropsey pointed out in The
Washington Times,  &UR; board and search &LR;  ``is an invasive maneuver in
which an armed naval vessel trains its weapons on the merchant ship
and radios for it to stop and allow sailors to board to search. The
sailors make their way by small craft ... armed and loaded. It is
not a relaxing situation.'' But Cropsey notes that `` &UR; search and
visit &LR;  sounds like what most of us do when we are on vacation in an
unfamiliar place.''
</P>
<P>
   Every war develops its own set of terms. The leader of the enemy
requires consistent derogation. In the Persian Gulf war, Saddam
Hussein of Iraq was a  &UR; bloodthirsty dictator &LR;  and the  &UR; butcher of
Baghdad &LR; , similar to the  &UR; genocidal madman &LR;  often applied to Adolf
Hitler. Although many critics of Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia
called him a  &UR; war criminal &LR; , that term was unavailable to anyone in
officialdom, because it prejudged a potential prosecution and also
might make it awkward to negotiate with the one so called.
</P>
<P>
   The castigation of choice is  &UR; thug &LR; . In 1991, The Boston Herald
was first to refer to ``Slobodan Milosevic, the Stalinist  &UR; thug &LR; 
who rules Serbia.'' Three years later, Anthony Lewis in The New
York Times castigated ``aggression by a  &UR; thug &LR; , Slobodan
Milosevic.'' This year, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas joined many
other presidential candidates in using the phrase ``a  &UR; thug &LR;  like
Milosevic.'' In the Dow Jones database, the name of the Serb leader
and the word  &UR; thug &LR;  appear near each other 343 times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Thug &LR;  may be the earliest word of terrorism, perhaps predating
 &UR; assassin &LR; , a member of the hashish-smoking terror group that
struck at the Crusaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindi  &UR; thag &LR;  is the root, meaning ``deceiver,'' from the
Sanskrit  &UR; sthaga &LR; , ``thief.'' The  &UR; Thugs &LR;  were an organization of
murderers and thieves in India who specialized in strangling
travelers. The purpose of strangulation was to preserve the
victim's blood, symbolically offered as a sacrifice to Kali, often
called the Hindu goddess of destruction and pictured as a
three-eyed deity smeared with blood and sporting a necklace of
severed heads. Many Hindus consider this grisly portrayal
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Thugs &LR; , its membership said to number 10,000 at its peak,
practiced their predatory system of  &UR; Thuggee &LR;  for at least six
centuries, killing more than a half-million people, making them
history's longest-lasting terror group. In 1833, the British
governor-general of India launched a campaign that captured 3,200
of the murderous cult's members, hanged several hundred and
effectively ended the terror.
</P>
<P>
   The historian Thomas Carlyle in 1839 was first to extend the
term beyond India by decrying ``the Glasgow  &UR; Thugs &LR; ,'' and he also
coined  &UR; thuggery &LR; . The adjective  &UR; thuggish &LR;  was not minted until
1953 by William Burroughs in his novel ``Junkie.'' The `` &UR; Thug &LR; 
Life'' was a best-selling 1994 album by the rap group of the same
name, whose young star, 2Pac, was gunned down in a gang killing two
years later. So much for the word  &UR; thug &LR; ; what about the word
 &UR; core &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   We've heard it a thousand times to define an international force
that would ensure the safety of the Kosovar homeless when they
return. At first, that was a ``NATO force''; then it fell back
slightly to ``a NATO-led force,'' and then, as the Russians started
to broker a deal between the warring parties, it became ``an
international force with NATO at its  &UR; core &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The center of a piece of fruit containing seeds is the  &UR; core &LR; ;
by association with the French  &UR; coeur &LR; , it has come to mean ``the
heart of the matter,'' and the noun can be used as a modifier, as
in  &UR; core values &LR; . Because it also has a connection to the French
 &UR; corps &LR; , ``body,'' Pentagon officials can paraphrase Gen. Douglas
MacArthur's farewell to West Point by saying, ``My last conscious
thoughts of NATO in the occupying force will be of the  &UR; core &LR; , the
 &UR; core &LR;  and the  &UR; core &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   What is the term of art for the altercation between NATO and
Serbia involving warplanes, surface-to-air missiles, prisoners of
war, propaganda, population removal, blockades and promises of
prosecution of war criminals? Not  &UR; war &LR; . That nasty term has legal
overtones, including declarations, rights and obligations of
belligerents and neutrals, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Some use has been made of  &UR; international armed conflict &LR; , as in
``the Korean  &UR; conflict &LR; ,'' which was the official U.S. designation
of the Korean War. (For a time, President Harry Truman referred to
it as a  &UR; police action &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the circumscribed nature of the  &UR; conflict &LR;  with
Serbia, rather than call it a  &UR; limited war &LR; , which has a
connotation of quagmires, the choice of NATO word warriors has been
 &UR; campaign &LR; . This has a general meaning of ``a series of military
battles during a phase of a war,'' and in the case of the current
semi-rubblization process, a specific meaning of the sustained NATO
 &UR; bombing campaign &LR; . However, in light of the coming political
campaign, notably what critics have called President Clinton's
``permanent campaign,'' this word lost favor in Washington to the
neutral  &UR; military operation &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it was we were fighting, Defense Secretary William
Cohen hedged: ``We're certainly engaged in  &UR; hostilities &LR; ; we're
engaged in  &UR; combat &LR; . Whether that measures up to a classic
definition of  &UR; war &LR; , I'm not qualified to say.''

BIANCA JAGGER SPOTLIGHTS PLIGHT OF KOSOVARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Even now, her T-shirt smeared with grime, her
fingernails rough from work, Bianca Jagger is haunted by her
ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   It's been forever since she was married to Mick, but she did
keep the last name of the Rolling Stones's lead singer _ a name
that brings her celebrity and snickers. Strangers who spot her in
Albania wonder what she is doing here and who she brought along to
pamper her.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Jagger _ the human rights campaigner _ packs her
own suitcases. She wears a touch of makeup, even in the midst of
war, but otherwise dresses down appropriately. And she doesn't
demand private helicopters, suffering the nerve-rattling eight-hour
drive from Tirana to the border town of Kukes like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might surprise people who only recognize me from my
marriage. But that's not all I am,'' said Jagger, 49, who put in
more than a few appearances at New York's Studio 54 when it was the
late 1970s hot spot, but also studied at the Institute of Political
Science in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger doesn't want to name names, but she does say that she
resents being lumped in with celebrities who show up in hot spots,
grab some attention, then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like being put in the same category as people who
don't really know the situation,'' said Jagger. ``For them it's
like a photo opportunity. People spend one day and then they go.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jagger recently spent five days in Albania and was headed to
Macedonia for another two or three. As a representative of the Save
the Children organization, she said her aim was to document the
plight of Kosovar children living in the refugee camps and focus
international attention on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
ethnic cleansing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community needs to decide what its aims
should be: To save and protect the civilian population in Kosovo,
to stop the genocide and ethnic cleansing, to do what?'' said
Jagger. ``It's clear they're not succeeding. To allow the
deportation and murder and atrocities in Kosovo is unconscionable.
We should be ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Having seen war up close before _ in her Nicaraguan homeland and
other Central American countries, as well as in Bosnia and other
Balkan countries _ Jagger speaks knowledgeably about the
effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, of airstrikes alone. She talks
for 15 minutes about Milosevic and war tribunals and holding war
criminals accountable for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   She cites statistics, pulls a dog-eared map out of her bag to
illustrate her point. She also insists that she is a pacifist, even
as she insists that the only way to end the Kosovo tragedy is to
send in US troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is amazing to a lay person like me is how could they not
have a contingency plan,'' said Jagger, who speaks often on behalf
of the Washington-based College of International Justice and has
testified before Congress. ``I'm not an advocator of military
intervention; I've said so all my life. But I think if we had said
we will use any means necessary, we might not have needed to send
in ground troops. There comes a moment when you see atrocities and
you have to take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jagger, however, wasn't in Albania to air her views on war
strategy. She was in Tirana and border towns to make a film for
Save the Children.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, Jagger recounts, she personally took a young boy
she found on the street into a refugee camp. The 17 other members
of his family, however, refused to let him go alone. She says she
persuaded the camp, run by Doctors Without Borders, to take in all
of them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is human rights, of course,'' Jagger said before
heading off to Macedonia. ``And that includes the rights of
refugees and children during conflict. This is what I do now, who I
am.''

ERRORS SPOTLIGHT NATO'S TARGETING PROCEDURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a week of disastrous errors in NATO's air war over
Yugoslavia. First, bombs slammed into a building in Belgrade that
turned out to be the Chinese Embassy. Then, bombs dropped on Kosovo
accidentally hit a village, killing at least 80 ethnic Albanian
civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, NATO officials sent regrets, noted that mistakes
will happen, and added that the mistakes to date have been
remarkably few.
</P>
<P>
   However, more significant conclusions about the war's direction
might be drawn from looking at the targets that NATO's strategists
meant to hit in these attacks, and the weapons they used for those
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Chinese Embassy, they dropped laser-guided
bombs on what they thought was Yugoslavia's federal procurement
agency. The weapons chosen were the right ones for an urban target,
but even if they had hit what the pilots thought they were hitting,
the question must be asked: What kind of target is that?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Kosovar civilians, three F16 planes dropped
two laser-guided and six ``dumb bombs'' on what they thought was a
Serbian army formation. The targets chosen were the right ones for
this war, but the question must be asked: Why did they use these
weapons?
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, why did they drop the bombs from 15,000 feet,
the normal altitude of F16s, too high for pilots to see just what
they are bombing?
</P>
<P>
   Destroying the federal procurement agency, at most, might have
made it a bit harder for Slobodan Milosevic to order arms from
other countries, arms that would take months to arrive in Serbian
soldiers' hands, in any event.
</P>
<P>
   It would have had little impact on the Serbs' ability to wage
war and terror on Kosovo in the next few months or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You select targets to follow your war aims,'' said William M.
Arkin, a former US Army intelligence officer. ``Given the aims of
this war, selecting the federal procurement agency as a target
makes no sense in any way. This just shows that the people running
this war have lost their ability to distinguish high-value targets
from low-value targets.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon analyst, who asked not to be named, said of NATO's
strategists, ``They're floundering.'' In the first week of the
bombing, back in March, the analyst said, ``You'll know it's not
working if they start expanding the target-list.''
</P>
<P>
   If, well into the second month of the war, NATO is aiming at
something so peripheral as the procurement agency, then the target
list has apparently expanded quite a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of targets,'' said Robert Pape, professor of
national security studies at Dartmouth College and author of a
history of air warfare. ``We've hit all the main ones. There's not
much left to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing continues nonetheless. Targets are found to
accommodate all the bombs. And so, one day, the procurement
agency's number came up.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin said, ``There's a database of something like 3,000
`strategic targets,' '' meaning fixed objects that have some
connection to the political or military leadership of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   When an air war is being planned, the officers who pick the
targets conduct ``nodal analyses,'' finding the key nodes, the
objects of central importance, to a regime. Destroy those nodes,
the theory goes, and the regime unravels.
</P>
<P>
   If the nodes are destroyed but the regime is left standing, it
will not necessarily be brought to its knees simply by dipping into
the database and finding more targets to hit.
</P>
<P>
   In planning the 1991 Persian Gulf War, US officers found a dozen
bridges for the movement of Iraqi troops in and out of Kuwait. US
planes bombed those bridges over and over, with little effect. So
they bombed every bridge in Iraq, 160 in all, about two-thirds of
them far from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, all bridges were seen and treated equally.
Similarly, now in Belgrade, it seems, all military agencies are
seen and treated as if they were of equal importance.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced last week that three-quarters of the
targets hit in this air war, 270 out of 380, have been ``strategic
targets.'' Only 110 have been directly connected to the soldiers
and militias in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs dropped on what NATO pilots thought were Serbian army
sites may reflect a shift of emphasis in the war. But the results
show the peril of dropping unguided bombs on areas where civilians
are wandering as well, especially from high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``F-16 pilots, flying 400 to 500 miles per hour, 15,000 feet up,
really can't tell the difference between civilian and military
vehicles,'' Pape said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf War, most of the damage to the Iraqi Army was done
by A-10s, which can fly lower and slower because they are built of
tougher material and are harder to shoot down. F-16s did much
damage in the Gulf as well, but only after US and allied planes had
decimated enemy antiaircraft weapons, which, apparently, has not
yet happened in this war.

WHAT'S FAIR IN WAR?

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   CAPE TOWN _ Genocide. Torture. Rape of civilians. Forced
removals of whole populations.
</P>
<P>
   Horrors like these aren't supposed to happen anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, the international community has
adopted an ever-growing canon of principles to govern combat and
protect civilians from abuses by governments _ their own or those
of others. There are now 374 conventions that deal with 25
categories of international, humanitarian, and criminal law, from
drug trafficking to the torture of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the past half century has witnessed, according to one study,
more than 250 conflicts that have claimed _ by one careful estimate
_ up to 170 million lives. Kosovo is but the latest on a long list
of tragedies; the killing fields of Cambodia and Rwanda, brutal
repression in Chile and South Africa, the massacre at My Lai are
among the many more.
</P>
<P>
   So have these laws of civilized conflict done any good at all?
And is there any way to make them more effective?
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross is trying to find
out. On the eve of the 50th anniversary in Aug. 12 of the signing
of the Geneva Conventions _ the cornerstones of international
humanitarian law _ the Red Cross is attempting to increase
awareness of the rules of war and to mobilize public pressure
against states and combatants that disobey them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``People on War'' study spans a dozen countries affected by
war, and six others at peace. In El Salvador and Somalia, Georgia
and the Philippines, the project has assembled focus groups of
either soldiers or civilians to relate their experiences amid war,
state repression, and other violence. To encourage a frank
exchange, participants' names were kept confidential. Washington
pollster Stanley Greenberg will draw together an analysis of the
country-by-country reports later this year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the research suggests that even if people do not know
the specific terms of international humanitarian law, most seem to
believe that certain principles of fair play should apply in
conflicts.
</P>

   ``Overall I get the impression that there is a fair awareness of
at least the spirit of the Geneva Conventions and that people do
see that the `rules of war' were designed to assist them,'' said
Kim Gordon-Bates, the international spokesman for the Red Cross
study. ``There is, of course, some element of doubt as to their
efficiency _ especially in places like Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   International humanitarian law covers armed conflict, genocide,
and crimes against humanity. Enacted on Aug. 12, 1949, the original
four Geneva Conventions seek to limit suffering in time of war.
Some 188 countries are now party to the codes, which bind them to
safeguard wounded armed forces on land or at sea, prisoners of war,
and civilians. Most of those states have also signed the 1977
protocols _ added rules to protect victims of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
   And new laws are being added from time to time. Earlier this
month, parties to the 1997 Land Mine Ban Treaty convened their
first meeting to review its implementation in Maputo, Mozambique.
The treaty has been signed by 135 nations, although the United
States is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the US has a less-than-stellar record when it comes to
such matters. ``The US has signed virtually none of the major human
rights conventions,'' said Makau Mutua, a visiting professor of
international law at Harvard University. ``The US has the worst
record for ratifying interntional human rights agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   But, leaving aside US reluctance to participate, why have such
laws not resulted in a safer world? A major reason is the weakness
of the enforcement mechanisms. The six-year-old International
Tribunal on war crimes in The Hague and last year's treaty creating
an International Criminal Court represent the first real mechanisms
to enforce compliance. Few law schools teach international law, and
the field is little understood by the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, says Cherif Bassiouni, a scholar on humanitarian
law at Depaul University, is that governments apply the rules of
war differently depending on who the adversary is, and rebel
movements often don't observe them at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Militaries have a strong incentive to comply with the Geneva
Conventions if they confront another military. They have a mutual
interest,'' said Bassiouni, who last year conducted the study of
conflicts since World War II. But armed conflict is increasingly a
domestic phenomenon, resulting in a ``complete breakdown of such
laws in these situations.''
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, national militaries and police forces end up
warring against their own people rather than protecting them. And
insurgents, expecting no mercy at the hands of the state, feel
little imperative to practice higher principles.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Twala understands what Bassiouni means. A youth who grew
up amid South Africa's violent township upheavals of the late
1970s, Twala joined Umkhonto we Sizwe, the African National
Congress's military wing, so he could kill the whites who were
oppressing his people. By the time he went into action as part of
an urban sabotage unit after nearly two years of political and
military training in exile, his target was no longer white people,
but the structures of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were imbued with a capacity to understand that we had a
system that was a crime against humanity, and we needed to crush
the system,'' Twala said in an interview after a Red Cross focus
group on Robben Island _ a discussion that examined whether it is
possible to adhere to humanitarian principles while fighting an
enemy that blatantly disregards them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle was guilty of excesses,'' he said. ``But to say
that the ANC violated human rights is too sweeping: It fails to
account for the pressures we faced. The apartheid system never
inculcated humanitarian principles on that side. Those guys had
carte blanche.''
</P>
<P>
   But the boundaries of acceptable conduct in war can look just as
blurred from the other side. In a focus group held in Bosnia,
soldiers talked of their responses to civilians who become
participants in conflict. One told the story of a villager who led
a group of enemy soldiers into an ambush in which six of them were
killed. For that soldier, telling the story, the civilian's action
made him a legitimate target.
</P>
<P>
   Other focus group discussions have wrestled with difficult
questions concerning the rules of war. In Colombia, a group of
rebels grappled with the ethics of land mines. One said if he laid
a device to blow up a military convoy and a bus ran over it
instead, the civilian casualties would not be his fault. Another
objected, and a lively debate followed. In Lebanon, participants
said they could justify the use of violence to retaliate against
Israeli attacks, but they could not rationalize kidnappings,
torture, and the use of terrorism in their own civil war.
</P>
<P>
   By stirring debate across the lines of past conflicts the Red
Cross, which monitors the Geneva Conventions, hopes to raise public
intolerance for the kind of gross violations of human rights now
unfolding in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a correlation between the ethos of any given society
and the way warriors behave,'' Gordon-Bates said. ``Hopefully the
project will contribute to raising the humanitarian content of this
social ethos'' _ and raise the standards of conduct for all armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, focus only on the wholesale bloodshed of the past 50
years is to miss the reality that thanks to the Geneva conventions,
norms have changed. Although war remains a common feature in human
relations, Mutua, the visiting professor of international law at
Harvard University, sees important advances in how states relate to
their citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both human rights and international humanitarian law are
recent international phenomena which, in terms of their
constructive enforcement, are still in their infancy,'' said Mutua.
``But there is no question today that what a state does within its
own borders is not its own business. No state today would boast of
violating human rights. There is now a substantial body of
humanitarian norms _ where 50 years ago there was a blank slate.''
</P>
<P>
   But inscribing that slate was just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   On the western edge of Cape Town, on the slope of Table
Mountain, a single white church rises from a conspicuously barren
stretch of land. It is one of the few original buildings spared in
the demolition of District Six, a thriving interracial community
that was systematically destroyed by the apartheid government,
starting in the late '60s. On a recent Saturday afternoon, former
residents of District Six gathered in the church, now a museum to
their lost neighborhood, to share their stories with the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Schaffers walked across a wide floor map of the old
community to the street where he was born. When the apartheid
police came through, he said, they tortured people and shot at
children. They tore down everything _ houses, shops, and theaters
with beautiful facades _ and dug up the streets. Residents were
scattered to poorly developed townships.
</P>
<P>
   International law was supposed to prevent such atrocities, he
said, but even today, it seems to make little difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is NATO in Kosovo now? Because the Geneva Conventions were
being contravened,'' he said. ``But they have come in at a late
stage. It was the same in Rwanda. They waited. What happened here
was a total violation of human dignity. It shouldn't have been
done. But nobody came to stop it.''

   1. CLONING THE WOOLLY MAMMOTH If you thought reproducing sheep
and mice was a leap ahead, you won't believe what the Japanese have
in mind : cloning a woolly mammoth that last walked the earth

unbelievable, but there is no science to deny the viability of the
idea. The only catch is finding a small bit of well-preserved
mammoth tissue containing normal DNA. To what lengths will the
Japanese team go to realize their cloning dream? By Richard Stone.

GUN-SHY LEGISLATURE SHORTCHANGING PUBLIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Senate was less a lawmaking body than
a theater of the absurd last week when Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower
Mound, offered a bill to prohibit vendors at flea markets from
selling certain health-related items.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which would have banned the sale of infant formula,
over-the-counter medicine and contact lenses, was probably a good
idea. The object was to protect people from unknowingly risking
their health by purchasing outdated products in an unregulated
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, meanwhile, had an even better idea.
He proposed that anyone trying to buy an assault weapon at a flea
market be required to submit to a criminal background check.
</P>
<P>
   West also was trying to protect the public health. But when he
tried to attach his proposal as an amendment to Nelson's bill, one
would have thought he was trying to burn the U.S. flag.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate almost erupted into a full-fledged fight before Lt.
Gov. Rick Perry intervened and West withdrew his amendment and
Nelson withdrew her bill.
</P>
<P>
   Although I don't want to downplay the potential health risks of
bad medicine on an unsuspecting public, it is impossible to
overestimate the health risks of an assault weapon getting into the
wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to law enforcement officers, that frequently
happens at flea markets and gun shows, which are exempted from the
criminal background checks that the federal Brady law requires of
people purchasing guns from licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Nelson nor any other member of the Legislature wants
criminals to use guns to kill people, but each time lawmakers kill
reasonable gun-control safeguards, they are increasing that
likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   All the over-the-counter medicine in the world _ purchased from
a flea market or a grocery store _ isn't going to repair the damage
from a direct hit by an assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Yes! I also know that all the laws and regulations in the world
aren't going to keep criminals from getting _ and using _ guns.
</P>
<P>
   But government, including the Texas Legislature, can do a better
job of making it as difficult as possible for them to acquire the
deadly tools of their trade.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, someone with a criminal record could skirt a background
check by arranging with a seller to purchase a gun across the
street from the flea market.
</P>
<P>
   Someone also could buy bad baby formula the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Nelson shouldn't try to protect the public health
by banning baby formula sales from flea markets? I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   Any law the Legislature passes can and will be circumvented or
violated. But that doesn't mean lawmakers shouldn't do their best
to protect the public health and safety. People, unfortunately,
violate laws against murder and robbery every day, but no one has
ever proposed that we legalize those acts.
</P>
<P>
   If the logistics of conducting criminal background checks at
flea markets would be too cumbersome, a simpler approach would be
to ban the sale of assault weapons entirely at such events.
</P>
<P>
   Any law-abiding citizen who believes he or she really needs an
assault weapon could still buy one from a licensed dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protestations of the National Rifle Association,
whose influence obviously is very strong in Austin, West's proposal
didn't represent a threat to the Second Amendment or this year's
hunting trip.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did a broader bill, which died earlier this spring, that
would have required criminal background checks of all weapons
purchased at gun shows in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, in a news conference following the Colorado
school shootings, endorsed criminal background checks at gun shows.
But he never tried to get the bill passed, and the measure already
had been killed by a House committee only hours before the governor
finally spoke out.
</P>
<P>
   Pressured by gun-control advocates to try to revive the bill,
Bush replied that the measure was flawed. He said background checks
for gun show purchases should be addressed in federal law.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress began debating federal gun show legislation last
week, Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm asked if the
Republican governor had called U.S. senators, urging them to
support the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very good question.
</P>

FLEA BEETLES HARM VARIETY OF VEGGIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Something is chewing small holes in the leaves of my
vegetables. I have looked closely to try to find an insect, and
something appears to hop away when I move the leaves. Any clue as
to what this is?
</P>
<P>
   A: Flea beetles are minuscule insects _ adults are about 1/16
inch long and black or greenish-black _ that appear in spring and
leap among plants and chew numerous, small holes in leaves. They
hop like fleas, therefore their common name. If there are enough of
them, they can do considerable damage. Leaves may wilt and turn
brown, and the plant may die.
</P>
<P>
   There are several species of flea beetles that damage vegetables
and ornamentals. Among those that visit here are the tobacco flea
beetle, the potato flea beetle and the eggplant flea beetle, which
prefer nightshade-family plants such as eggplant and tomatoes. You
may find flea beetles in your arugula, broccoli and corn, as well.
</P>
<P>
   This pest is an accidental import, thought to have arrived in
North America in the early 1900s, probably from Europe or Asia.
Adult flea beetles hibernate in the soil, then lay eggs in the soil
or around the base of a plant. In a week or so, larvae are feeding
on plant roots before pupating and emerging as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly overnight, flea beetles recently visited our garden,
peppering the leaves of two fuchsias with so many small holes that
they left mere outlines of the foliage. If you are an organic
gardener, you need quick hands to catch and squish these agile
pests, as they bound away with the slightest hint of your approach.
They can slip underneath a leaf before you bat an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Like other beetles, they are hard-bodied, and this, coupled with
their acrobatic ability, makes it tough to easily nab them with a
pesticide. The pesticide needs to make good contact with the
beetles, so you may be looking at more than one application. Some
of the chemicals commonly used around the garden target the pests.
So do products that contain neem, a botanical pesticide. Rotenone
and pyrethrum products can work, too.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to eliminating as many of the enemy as possible with
speedy fingers, the organic gardener has additional options: Use
row covers to keep the pests off spring vegetables; repel them with
garlic and hot pepper sprays; or capture them on white or yellow
sticky traps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you give me some advice on the care of my bearded iris?
I have four different beds with different varieties and differing
amounts of sunlight. All bloom poorly.
</P>
<P>
   What fertilizer should I use? When and how often? Do these
irises require an acid or alkaline soil? I water them regularly
from early spring to late summer. Then they get only rainwater
until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   When I separate them and give them to friends, these irises
bloom quite well.
</P>
<P>
   A: I am not sure which bearded iris you have, but I have found
the easiest to be the large-flowered, fragrant ``early purples,''
believed to be a form of ``Iris x germanica,'' or German irises.
``Iris x albicans,'' the cemetery whites, are another group of more
easily grown bearded iris.
</P>
<P>
   I have learned from growing these that they prefer to be planted
shallowly, demand good drainage and like sun. And, as you've found,
division encourages better flowering. This is often necessary every
three years.
</P>
<P>
   A well-prepared, raised bed of soil enriched with compost or
well-rotted manure is important, as well. These irises tolerate a
soil pH between 6 and 9, preferring a soil that is slightly
alkaline.
</P>
<P>
   I understand a low-nitrogen formula, such as a 6-10-6, is best,
as too much nitrogen can lead to rhizome rot. Apply such a
fertilizer in the fall and after flowering. An application of a
superphosphate in late February, before flowering, can be
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   I also have found these bearded irises to be surprisingly
drought-tolerant once established. Give them adequate moisture, but
don't overdo it, especially if the soil is slow to drain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My magnolia is dropping leaves. What's the problem?

   A: Magnolias, although called ``evergreen,'' must drop old
leaves to make room for new. Those in our neighborhood are shedding
like crazy.
</P>
<P>
   By late winter, magnolia leaves, having been on the tree for a
growing season, often look weary. They may be scorched, and even
have fungal spots. Then, in late April and May, the tree drops
these leaves. If your tree is replacing these with fresh, healthy
leaves, don't worry.
</P>
<P>
   Magnolias may also drop leaves at other times during the year.
Keep trees watered well. The roots are especially shallow, and
long, hot summers are tough. A layer of organic mulch beneath the
canopy is a good idea as it helps preserve soil moisture and keeps
soil temperature down. It also boosts the soil when it breaks down.

COURT STRIKES DOWN CALIFORNIA WELFARE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday struck down as a
``discriminatory scheme'' a 1997 California law that would have
granted the state's newcomers lower welfare benefits than those
received by residents who have lived there longer.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' 7-2 decision said California's limit on benefits
for new residents violates the constitutional right to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the
right to choose to be citizens of the state wherein they reside,''
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court. ``The states,
however, do not have any right to select their citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``California's legitimate interest in saving money
does not justify this discriminatory scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision will force California to restructure
its welfare policy. The state has the nation's largest number of
welfare recipients _ about 2.6 million _ and a $6 billion budget to
aid them.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also will affect other states that have enacted
similar laws under the welfare restructuring law that Congress
passed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was enacted, California, like 14 other states,
redesigned its welfare system to pay new residents _ those in the
state less than a year _ who apply for aid only as much as they
would have received in their former states. Newcomers could receive
full California benefits after one year of residency.
</P>
<P>
   Since California ranks sixth highest among the 50 states in
welfare benefits, the vast majority of newcomers would have
received far less money than longer-term residents. For example,
California would have paid $673 a month to a family of four who had
been in the state more than a year, but if that family had recently
arrived from, say, Mississippi, it would have received $144 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the two-tier system to prevent states with
higher benefits from becoming ``welfare magnets'' that would
attract migrating poor people. Many lawmakers said that if such a
migration were to happen, states might engage in a ``race to the
bottom'' to lower their benefits and make themselves less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Before the California law went into effect, however, a single
woman and a family of welfare recipients challenged the law, saying
the limit on benefits _ along with California's high cost of living
_ could deprive them of the basic necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
   The family, listed under the fictitious name of the Roes, had
moved to Long Beach, Calif., from Oklahoma and would have received
$307 per month compared with the in-state resident benefit of $565.
The anonymous woman, called Anna Doe, had moved to Los Angeles from
Washington, D.C., when she was six months pregnant and would have
received $330 per month compared with an in-state resident benefit
of $456.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court ruled on April 1, 1997 _ the first day
that the California law would have become effective _ that it was
unconstitutional. The court said the law penalized migration
between states in violation of the equal protection clause of the
14th Amendment. The next year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   During his arguments before the high court in January,
California Deputy Attorney General Theodore Garelis argued that
while the law might have impeded migration to California, it would
not have prevented freedom of travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move for a host of reasons, with welfare benefits being
only one,'' Garelis said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the law would not have ``hurt'' newcomers because
they would have received some benefits and those payments would
have risen to California levels after a year. ``In the end, they're
no worse off than if they had stayed in their original state,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens wrote on Monday that while it may be reasonable to
assume that some people might move to a state to receive higher
welfare benefits, ``the empirical evidence ... indicates that the
number of such persons is quite small _ surely not large enough to
justify a burden on those who had no such motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the two, Rehnquist called the California law a
``reasonable measure falling under the head of a `good-faith
residency requirement.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other states with lower welfare benefits for newcomers are
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Several of those laws have been
challenged in court and have been barred from taking effect.

 Includes a color slide of Natalie Portman in a scene from ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sometimes a lightsaber is your only hope. Other times, a No. 2
pencil comes in handier.
 &HT;    On May 19, while the rest of the world is lining up for ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' Natalie Portman won't be seeing the
film she stars in. She's got bigger things to worry about.
 &HT;    ``On the day `Star Wars' opens,'' she says, ``I'll be taking my
biology final.
 &HT;    ``I would love to get out there and see the movie with my
friends,'' the 17-year-old says, ``but I'll be sitting at my desk
and not worrying about the box office. My biggest concern that
weekend will be getting at least a 95 percent on the test.''
 &HT;    As Queen Amidala of the planet Naboo, she battles alongside Jedi
knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan
McGregor) to save her people from the evil Trade Federation, but in
real life Portman has more modest goals.
 &HT;    ``In my life, `Star Wars' is important, but equally big is that
the prom is right around the corner,'' she says, giggling and
sipping bottled water.
 &HT;    Sitting for an interview at New York's Regency Hotel, Portman
easily could pass for a queen, or at least a princess. Long,
flowing brown hair cascades over her shoulders, while large,
doe-like eyes shimmer warmly.
 &HT;    Not your typical high-school student, in short.
 &HT;    ``My life is much stranger than a normal teen-ager,'' she says.
``For instance, it said in my Vanity Fair article that I didn't
have a prom date _ but they interviewed me in February. Obviously,
I didn't have a date back then.''
 &HT;    For the first time all morning, she sounds rattled.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' she says, ``it made me sound like a big dork.''
 &HT;    Not to worry _ this summer, Portman pretty much has cornered the
market on cool. ``Star Wars'' can do that for you, even if the
actress wasn't originally sure she wanted anything of the kind.
 &HT;    ``It's always a concern when you do something like `Star
Wars,''' she explains, ``because you worry that people will forget
you also do other stuff.''
 &HT;    For the record, she does. Her track record includes a starring
role in ``The Professional'' (1994) and working with Al Pacino in
``Heat'' (1995). She displayed the charm and vulnerability of a
young Audrey Hepburn as a lovestruck kid next door in ``Beautiful
Girls'' (1996).
 &HT;    And now ``Star Wars,'' in a role which writer/director George
Lucas offered her the first time they met.
 &HT;    ``George was just so real and sweet,'' she recalls. ``Initially
we just sat and talked for a long time.''
 &HT;    The director offered her the role at that first lunch, but
Portman didn't immediately say yes.
 &HT;    ``Of course, I was honored and flattered,'' she says. ``But I
had to think about it because of the size of the film. Plus I had
to sign on to do three prequels. It's hard to sign on for eight
years of work when you're only 14 years old.
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought, `What if I don't even want to be an
actress eight years from now?'''
 &HT;    Another concern was what she calls ``the recognizability
factor.'' The notoriously private Portman _ she won't reveal her
hometown, her school or her real last name _ didn't want to be the
new poster girl for sci-fi freaks.
 &HT;    ``I knew they would suddenly be interested in every aspect of my
private life,'' Portman says.
 &HT;    Besides, doing the film involved an arduous shoot deep in the
Tunisian desert.
 &HT;    ``On an average day it was 150 degrees in the shade,'' the
actress says. ``It was exhausting. Plus I had to wear these
incredibly heavy robes and gowns, plus headpieces that gave me a
constant headache.''
 &HT;    During one battle scene Portman was injured in a mistimed
explosion _ a widely reported incident which, she says, was wildly
exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``This spark went near my eye,'' she says. ``It wasn't really a
big deal. I went to a doctor and he just washed the debris out.''
 &HT;    She shakes her head.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people had it much worse than me,'' she adds. ``There
was fainting in the desert. One person had a heart attack. But that
was their own thing _ I don't think it was `Star Wars'-related.''
 &HT;    It wasn't all gloom and doom, though. Portman and co-stars
Neeson, McGregor and young Jake Lloyd could get downright silly at
times.
 &HT;    ``One day it was so hot that we decided to see if we could fry
an egg on R2-D2's head,'' she recalls, adding that it worked.
 &HT;    Did Lucas mind?
 &HT;    ``No,'' Portman says, giggling. ``R2's head has a Teflon
surface. The egg came right off.''
 &HT;    Egg-frying may not be a typical movie-star pastime, but it's not
so surprising for a younger-than-she-seems actress whose parents
still drive her to school and pack peanut-butter-and-jelly
sandwiches for her lunch _ she's a strict vegetarian.
 &HT;    ``I have a very stable family life,'' Portman says. ``I go to a
public high school. My friends are regular people and they're each
outstanding in some field, whether it be music, science or writing.
I have these people around me who treat me like any other girl.''
 &HT;    Born in Jerusalem, Portman is the only child of a
fertility-specialist father and a full-time mother. A brief
modeling career, which began when a talent scout spotted the
10-year-old at a Long Island pizza parlor, led her into acting. She
made her movie debut at age 11 in ``The Professional,'' as a waif
who bonds with a hired killer (Jean Reno).
 &HT;    Portman went on to appear in ``Mars Attacks!'' (1996) and as
Pacino's daughter in ``Heat,'' before stealing scenes from Uma
Thurman, Timothy Hutton and Matt Dillon in ``Beautiful Girls.'' On
the stage, the young actress won rave reviews as the star of a
Broadway revival of ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1998).
 &HT;    Next up is a whole new challenge _ college.
 &HT;    ``When I go home from this interview, I have to study for my
first college-placement exams,'' the actress says with a sigh.
 &HT;    ``It's never been an issue for me whether or not I'd go to
college,'' Portman adds. ``I don't feel ready to enter the world. I
don't have enough education.''
 &HT;    She won't say what school she'll be attending, though she
reportedly has been accepted at several Ivy League colleges, and
she hasn't settled on a major, though she says she's interested in
politics and foreign policy.
 &HT;    Not drama?
 &HT;    ``At 20 I might say, `I've had enough of acting,''' Portman
says.
 &HT;    For now, though, she's keeping her hand in. This fall she'll be
seen in the mother-daughter drama ``Anywhere But Here'' with Susan
Sarandon, and her school vacations in 2000 and 2002 will be spent
filming the next two ``Star Wars'' episodes.
 &HT;    She scoffs at rumors that James Van Der Beek will play the
teen-age Anakin in the next installment.
 &HT;    ``Do the math,'' she says. ``Anakin is younger than the queen,
and he's three years older than me.''
 &HT;    Actually, Portman adds, she thinks all the ``Star Wars'' hype is
sort of ridiculous.
 &HT;    ``You get to this point where you start to think that the whole
world revolves around a big movie,'' she says. ``But you know what?
For most people, movies are a weekend thing. That's real life.''

THE ROMANCE IS BACK FOR HUGH GRANT 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Hugh Grant in a scene from ``Notting
Hill.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hugh Grant wants you to know who he isn't.
 &HT;    When the charming, witty British actor became an overnight star
with the release of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' (1994),
everyone compared him to another actor with a similar name _ Cary
Grant.
 &HT;    Hugh Grant didn't know what to say.
 &HT;    ``The awful thing was that I was so cinema-illiterate then that
I didn't quite know who Cary Grant was,'' Grant admits. ``Now I've
watched a lot of his films, and I'm humbled and humiliated that
people said that. He was good, really good.
 &HT;    ``I've seen Cary Grant, and I'm no Cary Grant.''
 &HT;    Ah, there's that Brit wit, a mix of charm, self-deprecatory
humor and an awkward quality which is infallibly winning. Toss in
his catnip-for-paparazzi relationship with head-turner Elizabeth
Hurley, and it's no wonder that Grant's appeal has survived several
resounding box-office flops and even some unwanted Divine
intervention.
 &HT;    Actually, Grant may soon be more popular than ever, as he
returns to romantic comedy _ the genre most favored by his fans _
for ``Notting Hill,'' opening May 28 and co-starring Julia Roberts.
A Mafia comedy ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' will follow later in the
summer.
 &HT;    ``Notting Hill'' has all the hallmarks of another ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral,'' a thought which doesn't entirely delight
the actor.
 &HT;    ``I suppose it could start all over again,'' Grant says,
wincing. ``We'll see.''
 &HT;    For the last few years Grant has been absent from movie screens,
which many have attributed to an effort to let the scandal over his
arrest for patronizing a prostitute blow over.
 &HT;    ``People write such crap,'' he says. ``I just didn't want to do
any films. I'm not the world's keenest actor, and I don't like
living the life where you're permanently on E!
 &HT;    ``I wanted a normal life,'' he adds. ``I knocked around. I
worked behind the scenes on `Mickey Blue Eyes,' helping with the
script, even getting caught up in picking the crew hats.''
 &HT;    ``Notting Hill'' returns Grant to his ``Four Weddings'' persona
as a charming-albeit-bumbling English lad. He plays William
Thatcher, proprietor of a struggling bookshop in the Notting Hill
section of London, whose mundane existence turns upside down when
Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), the world's most famous actress,
wanders into his store.
 &HT;    ``Notting Hill's'' ``Four Weddings'' touch isn't surprising,
since it reunites several alumni of that film, including Grant,
producer Duncan Kenworthy and screenwriter Richard Curtis.
 &HT;    ``Richard told me about `Notting Hill' during `Four Weddings,'
so I always assumed it was coming,'' the affable Grant says during
a conversation at London's Dorchester Hotel. ``It took forever for
Richard to finish writing, though, because he got involved in
trivial things like saving the world's starving and having
children.
 &HT;    ``Then it was written and I wasn't really offered it right
away,'' he adds. ``I never knew what happened, but it finally came
together.''
 &HT;    Both Grant and Roberts have had their share of the troubles that
come with fame, but he insists that the movie isn't any kind of
revenge. Nonetheless, he admits that its look at the tabloid press
and the paparazzi hit home for him.
 &HT;    ``It's very difficult for celebrities to sit and say, `Uh, it's
a nightmare in our lives. It's inhuman what the media do to us,'''
Grant says. ``That always sounds unattractive and looks bad,
because we're earning all this money and flying around on the
Concorde.
 &HT;    ``The film says some very difficult things,'' he concludes.
``I'm glad that Richard says them for us, and he says them in a way
that might jolt people a bit.''
 &HT;    Roberts denies that her performance in ``Notting Hill'' is
autobiographical, but Grant dismisses her dismissal.
 &HT;    ``She claims Anna is not her, but I think she's lying,'' he
says. ``I think there's a lot of her in the part, and that's why
she's so effective. She bares her soul _ you get to see a Julia you
haven't seen before on film.''
 &HT;    The two stars actually met years ago, when an unknown Grant was
invited for a 1991 audition with Roberts for a film called
``Shakespeare in Love.''
 &HT;    ``I was one of many actors paraded in front of her to play
Shakespeare,'' Grant says. ``We were all thrown away like so much
trash. Nevertheless, I got on quite well with Julia and went back a
second time.
 &HT;    ``The film never happened,'' he says, ``but years later, after
`Four Weddings,' I was doing `The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill'
(1995) at Pinewood Studios. I was standing in the carpark having a
cup of tea, and two great big Range Rovers screeched to a halt next
to me.
 &HT;    ``And out jumped Julia, who gave me a big hug. She was shooting
on a neighboring soundstage, and was pleased for me about `Four
Weddings.'
 &HT;    ``It was an incredibly friendly thing to do,'' he says, ``and it
was fantastic for my credibility with the other actors on
`Englishman.' Of course, I was still terrified of her when she
arrived on `Notting Hill,' but I got over it.''
 &HT;    Grant's next film, ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' casts him opposite an
actor who's intimidating in a different way _ James Caan, best
known as Sonny Corleone in ``The Godfather'' (1972).
 &HT;    ``Just the idea of me with Caan, I think, is ridiculous,'' Grant
says. ``We're the odd couple, but we got on very well.''
 &HT;    The film casts Grant as an Englishman living in New York who
falls in love with a Brooklyn girl (Jeanne Tripplehorn). The only
catch: Her father (Caan) is a mobster.
 &HT;    ``It's a fish-out-of-water story, with me dealing with the Mob
coming into my life,'' Grant says. ``It doesn't have anything
important to say, but it's bloody funny.''
 &HT;    Grant and Hurley co-produced ``Mickey'' through their company,
Simian Films, and he says they spent time in New York hobnobbing
with real-life mobsters.
 &HT;    ``Elizabeth absolutely adores them,'' Grant says, ``and they
worship the ground she walks on. She was out every night with them.
 &HT;    ``Everywhere she goes now in New York, two or three big guys are
around her, and they'll do anything for her,'' he adds.
```Elizabeth, anything you want, anything you need, you just tell
us.'
 &HT;    ``It's nice to know, especially if we're being tabloided in
England,'' he says, tongue in cheek. ``Who knows? Maybe one day
there'll be a knock on somebody's door.''
 &HT;    Come the fall, Grant will jet back to New York to star in Woody
Allen's next film, playing a sophisticated Englishman struggling to
instill some class in a vulgar, nouveau-rich couple (Allen and
Tracey Ullman).
 &HT;    One can never be sure with the Woodman, but it sounds like a
comedy, which should please his fans. Grant likes to stretch _ his
credits include the gay-themed drama ``Maurice'' (1987), the Jane
Austen adaptation ``Sense and Sensibility'' (1995), Roman
Polanski's sex saga ``Bitter Moon'' (1992) and the medical thriller
``Extreme Measures'' (1996) _ but his fans like him best when he
shuns drama for romantic comedy.
 &HT;    Actually, the same is true of Roberts, who has rarely scored
with anything but comedies.
 &HT;    ``Julia and I didn't discuss that while we were doing `Notting
Hill,''' Grant says. ``I do feel a little locked in sometimes, but
just a little bit. As I say, though, I'm really not the keenest
actor in the world, and I've never needed to do a million different
things.
 &HT;    ``Really, I'm not desperate to play some psychopath in a
wheelchair in darkest Africa.''

JUST CALL IT MUSIC: EMMYLOU HARRIS KEEPS ON NUDGING MUSICAL
BOUNDARIES

 Includes a color slide of country/folk singer Emmylou Harris. 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Three decades after she began recording, Emmylou Harris has
found herself labeled ``the Queen of Contemporary Folk.''
 &HT;    Whatever that is.
 &HT;    ``I guess I'm just getting into this now,'' the 51-year-old
Harris says with a laugh. ``I spent the last 25 years trying to
figure out what country music is.''
 &HT;    Whatever the genre may be, though, Harris is clearly among its
leading lights. Her last studio album, ``Wrecking Ball'' (1995),
won a Grammy Award as Best Contemporary Folk Recording. And her new
live album, ``Spyboy'' (1998), was up for that same award this
year. She lost out to Lucinda Williams on that one, but did share a
Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for her work in
``Same Old Train.''
 &HT;    Its queen isn't entirely sure what contemporary folk is, but
that doesn't bother her much,
 &HT;    ``I think the category has just come into its own because there
are a lot of artists who are making music that can't be
categorized,'' she says. ``So contemporary folk is a catchall, and
thankfully it's there to give recognition to some albums that can't
seem to be placed anywhere else.
 &HT;    ``But you know what?'' Harris adds. ``To me music is music, and
a good song is a good song. Because I don't come from a country
tradition or a folk tradition, I just got turned onto music. So
maybe I'm breaking the rules, but I'm not doing that in a
rebellious way. It's because I just don't know what the rules
are.''
 &HT;    Harris began 1999 on a high note, with the long-awaited release
of ``Trio II'' (Asylum Records), the sequel to her platinum 1987
collaboration with fellow songstresses Linda Ronstadt and Dolly
Parton.
 &HT;    Teamwork continues to be the theme, as a duets album with
Ronstadt is slated to be issued in July. Harris will tour in August
and September, and is also putting the finishing touches on an
all-star tribute album to her mentor, Gram Parsons, on which she
and Beck join forces for ``Sin City.''
 &HT;    Some of her fans will see the music she sings as country, some
as folk and some as something else. But according to Buddy Miller,
the songwriter/producer who also plays guitar in Spyboy, Harris'
band, that's not all that important.
 &HT;    ``What I like is how she keeps herself open to everything,''
Miller says. ``A lot of people think of Emmylou and they think of
her as a country artist. She's always been so open to and searching
for just soulful music, wherever it is. I know that, through
playing with her, I've been exposed to a lot of things I wouldn't
normally have been exposed to on my own.''
 &HT;    In a sense, the contemporary folk designation brings Harris full
circle. It was folk music that lured the Birmingham, Ala.-born
singer/songwriter _ raised in North Carolina and Virginia, where
she was a beauty queen and a saxophonist in the high-school band _
away from her drama studies at Boston University and into the folk
scene in New York's Greenwich Village.
 &HT;    There she hung out at legendary clubs such as Gurley's Folk
City, the Gaslight and the Bitter End, soaking in the influences of
Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and the other 1960s regulars, as well as
performing on her own.
 &HT;    ``I started out doing folk music, but it's just because I was
afraid of drummers in the beginning,'' Harris says with a laugh.
``Folk music always focused on the lyrics, because it's a kind of
storytelling. I got into the lyrics early on, which is what drew me
into folk music. So that's always been an extremely important part
of how I picked songs _ it's all pretty much lyrics first.''
 &HT;    After the failure of Harris' first album, ``Gliding Bird''
(1969), she divorced songwriter Jon Slocum and, with the first of
her two daughters, moved first to Nashville and then to her
parents' farmhouse in Maryland.
 &HT;    Eventually proximity drew her into Washington's lower-profile
but still vibrant folk community, and it was there that she met
Parsons.
 &HT;    He had pioneered a fusion of rock and country, first with the
Byrds on their landmark album ``Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' (1968)
and then with his own group, the Flying Burrito Brothers. Impressed
with the young singer's voice, Parsons used her prominently on his
two solo albums, ``GP'' and ``Grievous Angel.'' After he died of a
heroin overdose in 1973, Harris vowed to continue the spirit of his
work.
 &HT;    ``I think I learned to be a singer by singing harmony with Gram
Parsons,'' Harris says. ``Now that's just as natural for me as
breathing.''
 &HT;    Her major-label debut, ``Pieces of the Sky'' (1975), launched a
bold and challenging career. Much to her surprise, however, she
found that the rock-oriented musical establishment didn't know what
to do with her. She found herself pigeonholed as a country singer,
which at the time meant very few opportunities for mainstream radio
play.
 &HT;    ``Nobody has ever told me what to do,'' Harris says. ``I've
always been working in a collaborative way with people who I think
are of the same mind and heart as far as what we're going for.
Radio is the last place it ends up, and they certainly tossed
enough things back at me over the years.
 &HT;    ``But fortunately I have an audience that has sought me out
regardless of whether I'm on the radio or not,'' she concludes,
``and I'm very grateful for that.''
 &HT;    If it appears that Harris has kicked into overdrive this year,
it's partly an illusion. ``Trio II'' was actually recorded four
years ago, she explains, but abandoned when the three singers'
schedules interfered with promoting it. Each took a few tracks for
her own albums and, Harris says, all three were surprised when
Asylum contacted them about finally putting out the album itself.
 &HT;    ``I didn't think it was ever going to come out, because it was a
very expensive record to make, and I didn't think any record
company would want to touch it,'' she says. ``But they said, `We
don't care. We just want this record,' even though we weren't going
to promote it extensively. So we said `Well, OK, we love it and
want to see it come out.'''
 &HT;    Her duet album with Ronstadt, Harris says, is simply ``a bunch
of really good songs produced by Glyn Johns,'' including originals
by both Harris and Patty Griffin, as well as covers of songs by
Bruce Springsteen and Leonard Cohen.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't say it falls in any category,'' she adds. ``It's
not a traditional record, and it's not particularly a country
record. It's just two women who have always been in love with a
song getting together and singing.''
 &HT;    Which, Harris notes, is the way she's always gone about things
in her genre-defying career.
 &HT;    ``I'm just not going to let anything stand in the way of me
singing a song that I like to sing,'' she says. ``I'll leave it up
to other people to decide what it is and what category it's
supposed to be.''

 Includes a color slide of Patricia Richardson with Tim Allen in a
scene from ``Home Improvement.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much like the show she stars in, Patricia Richardson has never
really been given her due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Pat Richardson there would be no `Home Improvement,'''
Tim Allen said at the 1999 People's Choice Awards.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, while the media has spent eight years focused on
Allen's every move, Richardson has quietly bloomed in the
background. Along the way she's survived a divorce, successfully
raised three kids and even made her directorial debut earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   With the show's final episode set to air on May 25, Richardson
admits that she's had little time to reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a wreck,'' she says during an interview on the show's
set, shortly before filming the finale. ``I keep telling myself
that I'm happy for it to be ending _ I think it's the perfect time.
But it's been so stressful. The last two episodes have been
constantly in flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also,'' she adds, ``for the last couple of months I've been
single-parenting my kids seven days a week, because my ex-husband
(actor Ray Barker) and I share custody, but he is in New York doing
a play. So I'm totally stressed and exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children are taking the end of the series hard, the actress
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is devastating for them,'' she says. ``My son (Henry) was
6 when it started, now he's 14. And the twins (8-year-olds Roxanne
and Joseph) have never known me not to be working on this show.
It's finally starting to sink in that Mommy is not going to be
doing this any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has been such a fixture in their lives,'' she says
with a laugh. ``They're going to have a hard fall when they have to
go back to the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was widely reported that ABC executives _ as well as many at
Disney, the network's parent company _ were upset by the decision
of Allen and Richardson not to continue ``Home Improvement'' for a
ninth season, despite having achieved some of the show's highest
ratings in its eighth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Disney and ABC aren't really happy with us for
making that decision,'' Richardson concedes. ``They thought they
should get another year out of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think we did them a huge favor,'' she says with a
smile. ``They would have paid so much to get us back next year, and
we would have been like `Mad About You' _ they would have spent all
that money and we would have been down in the 40s or 50s (in the
ratings).
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they'd feel like fools, because they'd be paying all that
money for what?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Richardson didn't really need the money. ``Home
Improvement'' has left her financially secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something an actor never expects,'' she says, ``and, as a
single parent, I really, really appreciate it. If I'm careful and
invest right, I've done well enough to never have to work again.
The really great gift, though, is having money for my children's
education, because the one thing that no one can take away from you
is what you've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress has signed to do a couple of films for Disney, but
not right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' she says, ``I really want to just lie down and
take a lot of naps. I'm taking the summer off and renting a house
in Malibu _ I'd like some time to just walk on the beach and think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to put my whole life together,'' she adds. ``I've been
through a divorce, and I know that losing the show is going to
reawaken those feelings of loss.''
</P>
<P>
   While Allen has lived the high-profile life of a television
megastar, complete with tabloid hype about a long-ago prison term
and continuing problems with alcohol abuse, Richardson has managed
to fly under the media radar, for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim flies around in jets and has three houses,'' the actress
says with a laugh. ``He has a whole different deal, and is in
another world than I'm in, which has its price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I really manage to have a normal life,'' she says.
``Here in L.A. it's kind of cool to not pay attention to
celebrities, so you really can pretend that you're a normal person.
I have a very well-paid, fun job _ other than that, I live like
other people do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretend I'm a normal person to such a degree that I'm still
surprised when someone does come up and speak to me,'' she adds.
``It sounds stupid, but I still find myself taken aback. It can be
really jarring.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson claims not to have a favorite ``Home Improvement''
moment, either for her or for her character, but she's proud of
Jill and what she's represented to many viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a favorite child, and I don't have a favorite
episode,'' she says. ``When I try to think of my favorite times on
the show, it all becomes a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel such pride in the work that all of us have done here,
and I really do feel proud about Jill,'' she adds. ``I was a
feminist going into the show, still am. But I've always prided
myself on not being a defensive feminist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few times during the run of the show I did become
defensive,'' she admits, ``simply because I felt a little
overwhelmed by the testosterone levels on the other side of the
table. But I worked really hard to never have Jill be abrasive in
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Allen, she says she doesn't expect to miss him. But no,
not the way that sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving Tim is not that hard,'' she explains, ``because we
both live in L.A. and I know he'll continue to be an ongoing person
in my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you one unique thing about him that I will always
cherish,'' she says. ``It's his laugh. You don't see it much in the
show, but you see it in a lot of the outtakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has this kind of bark, this laugh that comes out like an
explosion. It is so infectious. For me, it's his defining
characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked so hard to get him to laugh like that,'' she
concludes, ``because it was such a reward to hear it. It was always
a real joy.''

THE GIRL WHO WOULD BE QUEEN: NATALIE PORTMAN TALKS `STAR WARS'

 Includes a color slide of Natalie Portman in a scene from ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Sometimes a lightsaber is your only hope. Other times, a No. 2
pencil comes in handier.
 &HT;    On May 19, while the rest of the world is lining up for ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace,'' Natalie Portman won't be seeing the
film she stars in. She's got bigger things to worry about.
 &HT;    ``On the day `Star Wars' opens,'' she says, ``I'll be taking my
biology final.
 &HT;    ``I would love to get out there and see the movie with my
friends,'' the 17-year-old says, ``but I'll be sitting at my desk
and not worrying about the box office. My biggest concern that
weekend will be getting at least a 95 percent on the test.''
 &HT;    As Queen Amidala of the planet Naboo, she battles alongside Jedi
knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan
McGregor) to save her people from the evil Trade Federation, but in
real life Portman has more modest goals.
 &HT;    ``In my life, `Star Wars' is important, but equally big is that
the prom is right around the corner,'' she says, giggling and
sipping bottled water.
 &HT;    Sitting for an interview at New York's Regency Hotel, Portman
easily could pass for a queen, or at least a princess. Long,
flowing brown hair cascades over her shoulders, while large,
doe-like eyes shimmer warmly.
 &HT;    Not your typical high-school student, in short.
 &HT;    ``My life is much stranger than a normal teen-ager,'' she says.
``For instance, it said in my Vanity Fair article that I didn't
have a prom date _ but they interviewed me in February. Obviously,
I didn't have a date back then.''
 &HT;    For the first time all morning, she sounds rattled.
 &HT;    ``You know,'' she says, ``it made me sound like a big dork.''
 &HT;    Not to worry _ this summer, Portman pretty much has cornered the
market on cool. ``Star Wars'' can do that for you, even if the
actress wasn't originally sure she wanted anything of the kind.
 &HT;    ``It's always a concern when you do something like `Star
Wars,''' she explains, ``because you worry that people will forget
you also do other stuff.''
 &HT;    For the record, she does. Her track record includes a starring
role in ``The Professional'' (1994) and working with Al Pacino in
``Heat'' (1995). She displayed the charm and vulnerability of a
young Audrey Hepburn as a lovestruck kid next door in ``Beautiful
Girls'' (1996).
 &HT;    And now ``Star Wars,'' in a role which writer/director George
Lucas offered her the first time they met.
 &HT;    ``George was just so real and sweet,'' she recalls. ``Initially
we just sat and talked for a long time.''
 &HT;    The director offered her the role at that first lunch, but
Portman didn't immediately say yes.
 &HT;    ``Of course, I was honored and flattered,'' she says. ``But I
had to think about it because of the size of the film. Plus I had
to sign on to do three prequels. It's hard to sign on for eight
years of work when you're only 14 years old.
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought, `What if I don't even want to be an
actress eight years from now?'''
 &HT;    Another concern was what she calls ``the recognizability
factor.'' The notoriously private Portman _ she won't reveal her
hometown, her school or her real last name _ didn't want to be the
new poster girl for sci-fi freaks.
 &HT;    ``I knew they would suddenly be interested in every aspect of my
private life,'' Portman says.
 &HT;    Besides, doing the film involved an arduous shoot deep in the
Tunisian desert.
 &HT;    ``On an average day it was 150 degrees in the shade,'' the
actress says. ``It was exhausting. Plus I had to wear these
incredibly heavy robes and gowns, plus headpieces that gave me a
constant headache.''
 &HT;    During one battle scene Portman was injured in a mistimed
explosion _ a widely reported incident which, she says, was wildly
exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``This spark went near my eye,'' she says. ``It wasn't really a
big deal. I went to a doctor and he just washed the debris out.''
 &HT;    She shakes her head.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people had it much worse than me,'' she adds. ``There
was fainting in the desert. One person had a heart attack. But that
was their own thing _ I don't think it was `Star Wars'-related.''
 &HT;    It wasn't all gloom and doom, though. Portman and co-stars
Neeson, McGregor and young Jake Lloyd could get downright silly at
times.
 &HT;    ``One day it was so hot that we decided to see if we could fry
an egg on R2-D2's head,'' she recalls, adding that it worked.
 &HT;    Did Lucas mind?
 &HT;    ``No,'' Portman says, giggling. ``R2's head has a Teflon
surface. The egg came right off.''
 &HT;    Egg-frying may not be a typical movie-star pastime, but it's not
so surprising for a younger-than-she-seems actress whose parents
still drive her to school and pack peanut-butter-and-jelly
sandwiches for her lunch _ she's a strict vegetarian.
 &HT;    ``I have a very stable family life,'' Portman says. ``I go to a
public high school. My friends are regular people and they're each
outstanding in some field, whether it be music, science or writing.
I have these people around me who treat me like any other girl.''
 &HT;    Born in Jerusalem, Portman is the only child of a
fertility-specialist father and a full-time mother. A brief
modeling career, which began when a talent scout spotted the
10-year-old at a Long Island pizza parlor, led her into acting. She
made her movie debut at age 11 in ``The Professional,'' as a waif
who bonds with a hired killer (Jean Reno).
 &HT;    Portman went on to appear in ``Mars Attacks!'' (1996) and as
Pacino's daughter in ``Heat,'' before stealing scenes from Uma
Thurman, Timothy Hutton and Matt Dillon in ``Beautiful Girls.'' On
the stage, the young actress won rave reviews as the star of a
Broadway revival of ``The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1998).
 &HT;    Next up is a whole new challenge _ college.
 &HT;    ``When I go home from this interview, I have to study for my
first college-placement exams,'' the actress says with a sigh.
 &HT;    ``It's never been an issue for me whether or not I'd go to
college,'' Portman adds. ``I don't feel ready to enter the world. I
don't have enough education.''
 &HT;    She won't say what school she'll be attending, though she
reportedly has been accepted at several Ivy League colleges, and
she hasn't settled on a major, though she says she's interested in
politics and foreign policy.
 &HT;    Not drama?
 &HT;    ``At 20 I might say, `I've had enough of acting,''' Portman
says.
 &HT;    For now, though, she's keeping her hand in. This fall she'll be
seen in the mother-daughter drama ``Anywhere But Here'' with Susan
Sarandon, and her school vacations in 2000 and 2002 will be spent
filming the next two ``Star Wars'' episodes.
 &HT;    She scoffs at rumors that James Van Der Beek will play the
teen-age Anakin in the next installment.
 &HT;    ``Do the math,'' she says. ``Anakin is younger than the queen,
and he's three years older than me.''
 &HT;    Actually, Portman adds, she thinks all the ``Star Wars'' hype is
sort of ridiculous.
 &HT;    ``You get to this point where you start to think that the whole
world revolves around a big movie,'' she says. ``But you know what?
For most people, movies are a weekend thing. That's real life.''

THE ROMANCE IS BACK FOR HUGH GRANT

 Includes a color slide of Hugh Grant in a scene from ``Notting
Hill.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hugh Grant wants you to know who he isn't.
 &HT;    When the charming, witty British actor became an overnight star
with the release of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' (1994),
everyone compared him to another actor with a similar name _ Cary
Grant.
 &HT;    Hugh Grant didn't know what to say.
 &HT;    ``The awful thing was that I was so cinema-illiterate then that
I didn't quite know who Cary Grant was,'' Grant admits. ``Now I've
watched a lot of his films, and I'm humbled and humiliated that
people said that. He was good, really good.
 &HT;    ``I've seen Cary Grant, and I'm no Cary Grant.''
 &HT;    Ah, there's that Brit wit, a mix of charm, self-deprecatory
humor and an awkward quality which is infallibly winning. Toss in
his catnip-for-paparazzi relationship with head-turner Elizabeth
Hurley, and it's no wonder that Grant's appeal has survived several
resounding box-office flops and even some unwanted Divine
intervention.
 &HT;    Actually, Grant may soon be more popular than ever, as he
returns to romantic comedy _ the genre most favored by his fans _
for ``Notting Hill,'' opening May 28 and co-starring Julia Roberts.
A Mafia comedy ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' will follow later in the
summer.
 &HT;    ``Notting Hill'' has all the hallmarks of another ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral,'' a thought which doesn't entirely delight
the actor.
 &HT;    ``I suppose it could start all over again,'' Grant says,
wincing. ``We'll see.''
 &HT;    For the last few years Grant has been absent from movie screens,
which many have attributed to an effort to let the scandal over his
arrest for patronizing a prostitute blow over.
 &HT;    ``People write such crap,'' he says. ``I just didn't want to do
any films. I'm not the world's keenest actor, and I don't like
living the life where you're permanently on E!
 &HT;    ``I wanted a normal life,'' he adds. ``I knocked around. I
worked behind the scenes on `Mickey Blue Eyes,' helping with the
script, even getting caught up in picking the crew hats.''
 &HT;    ``Notting Hill'' returns Grant to his ``Four Weddings'' persona
as a charming-albeit-bumbling English lad. He plays William
Thatcher, proprietor of a struggling bookshop in the Notting Hill
section of London, whose mundane existence turns upside down when
Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), the world's most famous actress,
wanders into his store.
 &HT;    ``Notting Hill's'' ``Four Weddings'' touch isn't surprising,
since it reunites several alumni of that film, including Grant,
producer Duncan Kenworthy and screenwriter Richard Curtis.
 &HT;    ``Richard told me about `Notting Hill' during `Four Weddings,'
so I always assumed it was coming,'' the affable Grant says during
a conversation at London's Dorchester Hotel. ``It took forever for
Richard to finish writing, though, because he got involved in
trivial things like saving the world's starving and having
children.
 &HT;    ``Then it was written and I wasn't really offered it right
away,'' he adds. ``I never knew what happened, but it finally came
together.''
 &HT;    Both Grant and Roberts have had their share of the troubles that
come with fame, but he insists that the movie isn't any kind of
revenge. Nonetheless, he admits that its look at the tabloid press
and the paparazzi hit home for him.
 &HT;    ``It's very difficult for celebrities to sit and say, `Uh, it's
a nightmare in our lives. It's inhuman what the media do to us,'''
Grant says. ``That always sounds unattractive and looks bad,
because we're earning all this money and flying around on the
Concorde.
 &HT;    ``The film says some very difficult things,'' he concludes.
``I'm glad that Richard says them for us, and he says them in a way
that might jolt people a bit.''
 &HT;    Roberts denies that her performance in ``Notting Hill'' is
autobiographical, but Grant dismisses her dismissal.
 &HT;    ``She claims Anna is not her, but I think she's lying,'' he
says. ``I think there's a lot of her in the part, and that's why
she's so effective. She bares her soul _ you get to see a Julia you
haven't seen before on film.''
 &HT;    The two stars actually met years ago, when an unknown Grant was
invited for a 1991 audition with Roberts for a film called
``Shakespeare in Love.''
 &HT;    ``I was one of many actors paraded in front of her to play
Shakespeare,'' Grant says. ``We were all thrown away like so much
trash. Nevertheless, I got on quite well with Julia and went back a
second time.
 &HT;    ``The film never happened,'' he says, ``but years later, after
`Four Weddings,' I was doing `The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill'
(1995) at Pinewood Studios. I was standing in the carpark having a
cup of tea, and two great big Range Rovers screeched to a halt next
to me.
 &HT;    ``And out jumped Julia, who gave me a big hug. She was shooting
on a neighboring soundstage, and was pleased for me about `Four
Weddings.'
 &HT;    ``It was an incredibly friendly thing to do,'' he says, ``and it
was fantastic for my credibility with the other actors on
`Englishman.' Of course, I was still terrified of her when she
arrived on `Notting Hill,' but I got over it.''
 &HT;    Grant's next film, ``Mickey Blue Eyes,'' casts him opposite an
actor who's intimidating in a different way _ James Caan, best
known as Sonny Corleone in ``The Godfather'' (1972).
 &HT;    ``Just the idea of me with Caan, I think, is ridiculous,'' Grant
says. ``We're the odd couple, but we got on very well.''
 &HT;    The film casts Grant as an Englishman living in New York who
falls in love with a Brooklyn girl (Jeanne Tripplehorn). The only
catch: Her father (Caan) is a mobster.
 &HT;    ``It's a fish-out-of-water story, with me dealing with the Mob
coming into my life,'' Grant says. ``It doesn't have anything
important to say, but it's bloody funny.''
 &HT;    Grant and Hurley co-produced ``Mickey'' through their company,
Simian Films, and he says they spent time in New York hobnobbing
with real-life mobsters.
 &HT;    ``Elizabeth absolutely adores them,'' Grant says, ``and they
worship the ground she walks on. She was out every night with them.
 &HT;    ``Everywhere she goes now in New York, two or three big guys are
around her, and they'll do anything for her,'' he adds.
```Elizabeth, anything you want, anything you need, you just tell
us.'
 &HT;    ``It's nice to know, especially if we're being tabloided in
England,'' he says, tongue in cheek. ``Who knows? Maybe one day
there'll be a knock on somebody's door.''
 &HT;    Come the fall, Grant will jet back to New York to star in Woody
Allen's next film, playing a sophisticated Englishman struggling to
instill some class in a vulgar, nouveau-rich couple (Allen and
Tracey Ullman).
 &HT;    One can never be sure with the Woodman, but it sounds like a
comedy, which should please his fans. Grant likes to stretch _ his
credits include the gay-themed drama ``Maurice'' (1987), the Jane
Austen adaptation ``Sense and Sensibility'' (1995), Roman
Polanski's sex saga ``Bitter Moon'' (1992) and the medical thriller
``Extreme Measures'' (1996) _ but his fans like him best when he
shuns drama for romantic comedy.
 &HT;    Actually, the same is true of Roberts, who has rarely scored
with anything but comedies.
 &HT;    ``Julia and I didn't discuss that while we were doing `Notting
Hill,''' Grant says. ``I do feel a little locked in sometimes, but
just a little bit. As I say, though, I'm really not the keenest
actor in the world, and I've never needed to do a million different
things.
 &HT;    ``Really, I'm not desperate to play some psychopath in a
wheelchair in darkest Africa.''

JUST CALL IT MUSIC: EMMYLOU HARRIS KEEPS ON NUDGING MUSICAL
BOUNDARIES

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of country/folk singer Emmylou Harris. 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Three decades after she began recording, Emmylou Harris has
found herself labeled ``the Queen of Contemporary Folk.''
 &HT;    Whatever that is.
 &HT;    ``I guess I'm just getting into this now,'' the 51-year-old
Harris says with a laugh. ``I spent the last 25 years trying to
figure out what country music is.''
 &HT;    Whatever the genre may be, though, Harris is clearly among its
leading lights. Her last studio album, ``Wrecking Ball'' (1995),
won a Grammy Award as Best Contemporary Folk Recording. And her new
live album, ``Spyboy'' (1998), was up for that same award this
year. She lost out to Lucinda Williams on that one, but did share a
Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for her work in
``Same Old Train.''
 &HT;    Its queen isn't entirely sure what contemporary folk is, but
that doesn't bother her much,
 &HT;    ``I think the category has just come into its own because there
are a lot of artists who are making music that can't be
categorized,'' she says. ``So contemporary folk is a catchall, and
thankfully it's there to give recognition to some albums that can't
seem to be placed anywhere else.
 &HT;    ``But you know what?'' Harris adds. ``To me music is music, and
a good song is a good song. Because I don't come from a country
tradition or a folk tradition, I just got turned onto music. So
maybe I'm breaking the rules, but I'm not doing that in a
rebellious way. It's because I just don't know what the rules
are.''
 &HT;    Harris began 1999 on a high note, with the long-awaited release
of ``Trio II'' (Asylum Records), the sequel to her platinum 1987
collaboration with fellow songstresses Linda Ronstadt and Dolly
Parton.
 &HT;    Teamwork continues to be the theme, as a duets album with
Ronstadt is slated to be issued in July. Harris will tour in August
and September, and is also putting the finishing touches on an
all-star tribute album to her mentor, Gram Parsons, on which she
and Beck join forces for ``Sin City.''
 &HT;    Some of her fans will see the music she sings as country, some
as folk and some as something else. But according to Buddy Miller,
the songwriter/producer who also plays guitar in Spyboy, Harris'
band, that's not all that important.
 &HT;    ``What I like is how she keeps herself open to everything,''
Miller says. ``A lot of people think of Emmylou and they think of
her as a country artist. She's always been so open to and searching
for just soulful music, wherever it is. I know that, through
playing with her, I've been exposed to a lot of things I wouldn't
normally have been exposed to on my own.''
 &HT;    In a sense, the contemporary folk designation brings Harris full
circle. It was folk music that lured the Birmingham, Ala.-born
singer/songwriter _ raised in North Carolina and Virginia, where
she was a beauty queen and a saxophonist in the high-school band _
away from her drama studies at Boston University and into the folk
scene in New York's Greenwich Village.
 &HT;    There she hung out at legendary clubs such as Gurley's Folk
City, the Gaslight and the Bitter End, soaking in the influences of
Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and the other 1960s regulars, as well as
performing on her own.
 &HT;    ``I started out doing folk music, but it's just because I was
afraid of drummers in the beginning,'' Harris says with a laugh.
``Folk music always focused on the lyrics, because it's a kind of
storytelling. I got into the lyrics early on, which is what drew me
into folk music. So that's always been an extremely important part
of how I picked songs _ it's all pretty much lyrics first.''
 &HT;    After the failure of Harris' first album, ``Gliding Bird''
(1969), she divorced songwriter Jon Slocum and, with the first of
her two daughters, moved first to Nashville and then to her
parents' farmhouse in Maryland.
 &HT;    Eventually proximity drew her into Washington's lower-profile
but still vibrant folk community, and it was there that she met
Parsons.
 &HT;    He had pioneered a fusion of rock and country, first with the
Byrds on their landmark album ``Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' (1968)
and then with his own group, the Flying Burrito Brothers. Impressed
with the young singer's voice, Parsons used her prominently on his
two solo albums, ``GP'' and ``Grievous Angel.'' After he died of a
heroin overdose in 1973, Harris vowed to continue the spirit of his
work.
 &HT;    ``I think I learned to be a singer by singing harmony with Gram
Parsons,'' Harris says. ``Now that's just as natural for me as
breathing.''
 &HT;    Her major-label debut, ``Pieces of the Sky'' (1975), launched a
bold and challenging career. Much to her surprise, however, she
found that the rock-oriented musical establishment didn't know what
to do with her. She found herself pigeonholed as a country singer,
which at the time meant very few opportunities for mainstream radio
play.
 &HT;    ``Nobody has ever told me what to do,'' Harris says. ``I've
always been working in a collaborative way with people who I think
are of the same mind and heart as far as what we're going for.
Radio is the last place it ends up, and they certainly tossed
enough things back at me over the years.
 &HT;    ``But fortunately I have an audience that has sought me out
regardless of whether I'm on the radio or not,'' she concludes,
``and I'm very grateful for that.''
 &HT;    If it appears that Harris has kicked into overdrive this year,
it's partly an illusion. ``Trio II'' was actually recorded four
years ago, she explains, but abandoned when the three singers'
schedules interfered with promoting it. Each took a few tracks for
her own albums and, Harris says, all three were surprised when
Asylum contacted them about finally putting out the album itself.
 &HT;    ``I didn't think it was ever going to come out, because it was a
very expensive record to make, and I didn't think any record
company would want to touch it,'' she says. ``But they said, `We
don't care. We just want this record,' even though we weren't going
to promote it extensively. So we said `Well, OK, we love it and
want to see it come out.'''
 &HT;    Her duet album with Ronstadt, Harris says, is simply ``a bunch
of really good songs produced by Glyn Johns,'' including originals
by both Harris and Patty Griffin, as well as covers of songs by
Bruce Springsteen and Leonard Cohen.
 &HT;    ``I couldn't say it falls in any category,'' she adds. ``It's
not a traditional record, and it's not particularly a country
record. It's just two women who have always been in love with a
song getting together and singing.''
 &HT;    Which, Harris notes, is the way she's always gone about things
in her genre-defying career.
 &HT;    ``I'm just not going to let anything stand in the way of me
singing a song that I like to sing,'' she says. ``I'll leave it up
to other people to decide what it is and what category it's
supposed to be.''

 Includes a color slide of Patricia Richardson with Tim Allen in a
scene from ``Home Improvement.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much like the show she stars in, Patricia Richardson has never
really been given her due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Pat Richardson there would be no `Home Improvement,'''
Tim Allen said at the 1999 People's Choice Awards.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, while the media has spent eight years focused on
Allen's every move, Richardson has quietly bloomed in the
background. Along the way she's survived a divorce, successfully
raised three kids and even made her directorial debut earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   With the show's final episode set to air on May 25, Richardson
admits that she's had little time to reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a wreck,'' she says during an interview on the show's
set, shortly before filming the finale. ``I keep telling myself
that I'm happy for it to be ending _ I think it's the perfect time.
But it's been so stressful. The last two episodes have been
constantly in flux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also,'' she adds, ``for the last couple of months I've been
single-parenting my kids seven days a week, because my ex-husband
(actor Ray Barker) and I share custody, but he is in New York doing
a play. So I'm totally stressed and exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   Her children are taking the end of the series hard, the actress
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is devastating for them,'' she says. ``My son (Henry) was
6 when it started, now he's 14. And the twins (8-year-olds Roxanne
and Joseph) have never known me not to be working on this show.
It's finally starting to sink in that Mommy is not going to be
doing this any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place has been such a fixture in their lives,'' she says
with a laugh. ``They're going to have a hard fall when they have to
go back to the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was widely reported that ABC executives _ as well as many at
Disney, the network's parent company _ were upset by the decision
of Allen and Richardson not to continue ``Home Improvement'' for a
ninth season, despite having achieved some of the show's highest
ratings in its eighth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that Disney and ABC aren't really happy with us for
making that decision,'' Richardson concedes. ``They thought they
should get another year out of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I think we did them a huge favor,'' she says with a
smile. ``They would have paid so much to get us back next year, and
we would have been like `Mad About You' _ they would have spent all
that money and we would have been down in the 40s or 50s (in the
ratings).
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they'd feel like fools, because they'd be paying all that
money for what?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Richardson didn't really need the money. ``Home
Improvement'' has left her financially secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something an actor never expects,'' she says, ``and, as a
single parent, I really, really appreciate it. If I'm careful and
invest right, I've done well enough to never have to work again.
The really great gift, though, is having money for my children's
education, because the one thing that no one can take away from you
is what you've learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress has signed to do a couple of films for Disney, but
not right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' she says, ``I really want to just lie down and
take a lot of naps. I'm taking the summer off and renting a house
in Malibu _ I'd like some time to just walk on the beach and think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to put my whole life together,'' she adds. ``I've been
through a divorce, and I know that losing the show is going to
reawaken those feelings of loss.''
</P>
<P>
   While Allen has lived the high-profile life of a television
megastar, complete with tabloid hype about a long-ago prison term
and continuing problems with alcohol abuse, Richardson has managed
to fly under the media radar, for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim flies around in jets and has three houses,'' the actress
says with a laugh. ``He has a whole different deal, and is in
another world than I'm in, which has its price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I really manage to have a normal life,'' she says.
``Here in L.A. it's kind of cool to not pay attention to
celebrities, so you really can pretend that you're a normal person.
I have a very well-paid, fun job _ other than that, I live like
other people do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretend I'm a normal person to such a degree that I'm still
surprised when someone does come up and speak to me,'' she adds.
``It sounds stupid, but I still find myself taken aback. It can be
really jarring.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson claims not to have a favorite ``Home Improvement''
moment, either for her or for her character, but she's proud of
Jill and what she's represented to many viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a favorite child, and I don't have a favorite
episode,'' she says. ``When I try to think of my favorite times on
the show, it all becomes a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel such pride in the work that all of us have done here,
and I really do feel proud about Jill,'' she adds. ``I was a
feminist going into the show, still am. But I've always prided
myself on not being a defensive feminist.

   ``A few times during the run of the show I did become
defensive,'' she admits, ``simply because I felt a little
overwhelmed by the testosterone levels on the other side of the
table. But I worked really hard to never have Jill be abrasive in
that way.''

not the way that sounds.

   ``Leaving Tim is not that hard,'' she explains, ``because we
both live in L.A. and I know he'll continue to be an ongoing person
in my life.

   ``I will tell you one unique thing about him that I will always
cherish,'' she says. ``It's his laugh. You don't see it much in the
show, but you see it in a lot of the outtakes.

<P>
   ``He has this kind of bark, this laugh that comes out like an
explosion. It is so infectious. For me, it's his defining
characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked so hard to get him to laugh like that,'' she
concludes, ``because it was such a reward to hear it. It was always
a real joy.''

U.S. NEEDS TO TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT CHINA POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When Chinese students, carrying placards
emblazoned with their demands, rallied for democracy 10 years ago
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, they gathered around a scaled-down
version of the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, the statue's symbolism struck home. While few
Americans could read the words proclaimed on the banners, each one
could instantly grasp the aims of Beijing students because of that
model of Lady Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Overcome was a difficult language barrier as well as vast
cultural and political differences, so that we appeared to
understand each other. A decade later, the Beijing students
apparently no longer look to America as the emblem of the freedom
to which they aspire.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the bombing by U.S.-led NATO planes of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, in which three Chinese died and some
20 were wounded, came student demonstrations of a scale not seen in
China since Tiananmen Square. This time the students equated
America not with Liberty but with oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, their banners made clear, the Nazi kind. This
time, as well, the government carefully modulated the violence,
which put under siege the American Embassy and consulates.
</P>
<P>
   We are informed by press reports out of China that resentment of
the United States as a world power, and even of things American
from Coca-Cola to KFC, was always just below the surface. All the
while, probably most Americans in their optimism assumed that a
good relationship was being constructed incrementally over the past
quarter century or so.
</P>
<P>
   All that it took for the true feelings of the Chinese to surface
was the bombing incident, for which NATO and the United States
apologized and to which Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
President Clinton added their personal expressions of profound
regret.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese dismissed the apologies and the explanation of
the bombing as a tragic mistake. The Chinese president at first
wouldn't pick up the telephone when Mr. Clinton called.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese can hardly be blamed for refusing to accept the
excuses so far offered. On their face they do look rather
ridiculous. For the bombing to have resulted from not having
updated maps to conduct what is hailed as precision bombing, means
one of two things. Either the United States has incompetents
running the intelligence establishment or the bombing was an
attempt by one element of the U.S. government to sabotage Clinton
administration policies.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as the Chinese want a more thorough investigation and to
be told of its findings, the American people should require no
less. But the Chinese government wants a good deal more than what
passes for equity when events of this kind occur between reasonably
friendly countries. They want to defeat American policy in the
Balkans and they want concessions from Washington in order to
obtain membership in the World Trade Organization. They also
apparently want a halt to the newspaper and congressional
complaints about the theft by China of American nuclear weapons
secrets for a large number of years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ostensibly inner and disguised animosity against
America that the Chinese people all along retained hasn't impeded
the flow of their students into American university graduate
programs. Nor has it interfered with the development of economic
relations that have made China, in a handful of years, a major
exporter of consumer goods to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, if instead of developing growing
nation-to-nation cordiality, the Chinese in their heart of hearts
still consider us the implacable enemy, then the United States has
to respond to that reality.
</P>
<P>
   The concessions we have made over the years to Beijing,
including the one-China policy that sacrifices the future
independence of Taiwan to Chinese hegemony, need to be revisited.
It was one thing to reach that position, however painful, to
accommodate new ties that would reshape the face of the
geopolitical world. It is another thing entirely, when we find out
that nothing really has changed, except that we have been taken for
fools.
</P>
<P>
   What goes for America's compromise on Taiwan is redoubled for
selling China the kinds of sophisticated technologies that, it
turns out, might very well be used against us down the road. What
is the sense of bartering our scientific advantages, that the
Chinese either buy or steal from us, for the sake of some
corporations' bottom lines?
</P>
<P>
   What values does that reflect?
</P>
<P>
   By calling the embassy bombing a war crime, the Chinese
obviously are attempting to trivialize what a war crime
constitutes, and thereby deflect an accusing finger from their own
more seriously violative behavior in Tibet and Cambodia, not to
mention running tanks over their own citizens. The United States
owes itself a sobering review of its China policy with a vigorous
emphasis on our own national interests and security. That analysis
should be shaped by the now-revealed understanding that China
regards us not merely as a rival, but as an enemy.

UNC HONORS ITS GRADS WHO DIED FOR DIXIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Memorial days come early in the South _ a
month earlier, like the greening of the land itself, than up north.
</P>
<P>
   And here, on the campus of the University of North Carolina, on
an almost New England-like morning early this month, the mall lined
with 19th-century college buildings, they gave a cathedral-like
solemnity to one of the memorial observances scattered throughout
the former Confederate states.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small event _ no bands, no rifle-fired salute, barely
even an audience. So small an event, it was, that were it not for
the unlikely appearance in that setting of four middle-aged,
business-suited men carrying furled flags and a younger man lugging
a laurel wreath, it could have passed without notice.
</P>
<P>
   With the absence of a single regionwide Confederate memorial
day, memorial services in the South tend to be low-key, according
to Patrick Griffin, commander in chief of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans. Often, Griffin said, they commemorate a Civil War event
that occurred in the local camp's community, or honor that
community's veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the memorial ceremony honored the university's 257
Confederate dead _ ``the flower of Tarheeliana,'' as Nicholas Ladd
of the local Sons of Confederate Veterans camp described them in a
reference to the state's nickname.
</P>
<P>
   It took place before a memorial statue quite unlike the Civil
War monuments familiar from New England greens and commons. The
soldier figures on northern monuments are most often in a solemn
parade-rest position _ symbolizing ``preparedness,'' rather than
``militancy,'' as Kirk Savage has said in his study of Civil War
monuments, ``Standing Soldiers, Kneeling Slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of North Carolina's idealized soldier-figure _
``Silent Sam,'' as he is known on campus _ is carrying his rifle in
the port-arms position, as if advancing into action with shoulders
squared, chin lifted, advancing into the death and glory of the
lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the visiting northerner who came upon it by chance, the
ceremony began as if it would follow in the pattern familiar from
more-familiar Memorial Day observances _ a few opening remarks, an
invocation, the Pledge of Allegiance. But that was followed
immediately _ and without the slightest sense that it was anything
exceptional _ by a ``salute to the Confederate flag'' which had, by
then, been unfurled along with the United States flag, the North
Carolina state flag, and the state's secession flag.
</P>
<P>
   And in an odd way, the brief remarks that followed seemed
directed particularly to that northern visitor _ although Ladd had
written them out beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The Confederate flag, Ladd wanted to make clear, ``is not a
racist symbol'' _ although, he added, some have used it that way.
``By today's standards,'' he acknowledged, slavery is ``morally
repugnant.'' But while it was the economic system suited to the
South's agricultural economy, Ladd noted, ``the vast majority'' of
those who fought for the Confederacy were not slave owners, had
little interest in slavery, but were fighting ``to defend their
homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then began a reading of the names, the flag-holding men stepping
forward in turn. They read them out by university class, starting
with Leonidas Polk, class of 1821, a graduate also of West Point
and an Episcopal bishop. To the South, a bishop's taking up arms
was seen as evidence of divine support for the cause. But he was
not much of a general, by most accounts, and was cut down by
artillery fire during the skirmishing before the Battle for
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the list went, captains, lieutenants, privates, a naval
ensign and two surgeons. One name that stood out was that of J.
Johnson Pettigrew, class of 1843, who led the North Carolina troops
who valiantly charged the entrenched Union positions at Gettysburg
and died of wounds received there. And finally, William H.C. Webb,
class of 1864, a lieutenant who was mortally wounded at Gettysburg
in July 1863. He was 20.
</P>
<P>
   And when all 257 names had been read out, the entire assemblage
sang ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the sprightly ``Dixie'' familiar from Boston Pops July
Fourth concerts, but the saddest, slowest ``Dixie'' you could ever
expect to hear. Slow as a funeral dirge, with the final words,
``Away. Away. Away down South in Dixie'' stretching out slowly into
silence.

RUBIN'S LEGACY: A PROSPERITY NOT SEEN SINCE THE '60S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- On his way out of town, Robert Rubin is
performing one final public service. That would be a blunt reminder
of the fundamental place of the economy in our political life.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the outgoing treasury secretary and leader of
President Clinton's economic policy team wouldn't know how to
approach an issue as a partisan. But his huge accomplishments are
the main reason the president was reelected and maintained a
powerful position through last year's impeachment madness.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with as carefully planned and nurtured a succession as
has ever been seen around here, that lesson is being transmitted
forward.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but notice that some of Vice President Gore's
closest associates began sending signals almost immediately that
designated replacement Larry Summers would most definitely be a
strong candidate for treasury secretary should there be a Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The relevant fact is not Summer's frequent, if private, role of
late as the person advising Gore on economic matters. Rather, it
was a rare example of what Gore's campaign insists is its top
priority _ maintaining and broadening the decade's astonishing
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's handling of Rubin's departure and Summer's
ascension, and even Summer's replacement as No. 2 by the competent
and experienced Stuart Eizenstat, reeked of continuity politics.
</P>
<P>
   The moves had been in the works for more than two years. And it
was no mere Clinton operation; the only person as firmly convinced
as the president and Rubin that the 45-year-old Summers is ready
for the responsibility is Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was also instructive. When Rubin told Clinton more
than two weeks ago that the moment had come, the remaining flash
point on the fragile international finance scene (Brazil) had
calmed. At last, from Rubin's perspective, there was nothing left
that could be called pressing, much less crisis material.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of complete continuity in policy is everything to
Clinton and Gore. The hand Gore is fated to play with is a strong
one, certainly better than what George Bush was playing with at
this point in 1987, and a far cry from the mess Richard Nixon
wrestled with in 1959. At the margins, it is probably made a bit
stronger by the fact that there's no denying Gore's role at the
apex of decision making in the Clinton government.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, history doesn't enshrine the economy as the sole
force in presidential politics. And you can just as obviously find
numerous wishful but serious thinkers close to Bill Bradley and the
Republican candidates who have theories why economics won't matter
next year.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is a fact that since World War I, the question of
whether the ``in'' party holds the White House has been answered in
the affirmative whenever people's incomes after inflation are
rising at least moderately and they have confidence in the future.
Other variables come and go, but those have been constant.
</P>
<P>
   The point is especially important as the 2000 election looms
because what the government did that mattered greatly in the 1990s
will also matter greatly in the next decade. When Clinton took his
oath in 1993, he had already veered sharply from what most people
heard during his campaign _ talk of using federal spending and a
tax cut for the middle class to jump-start a stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
   When he took office, the tax cut was missing and the so-called
stimulus was a puny $16 billion, and Bob Dole beat him fair and
square on that with a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   In their place was an assault on the budget deficit, then
totally out of control and set to hit close to $300 billion that
year. The program was pushed not only by Rubin on his way to
setting up the new National Economic Council, but by incoming
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The argument was that a gradual return to fiscal sanity would
not be conservative, but stimulative. By not borrowing hundreds of
billions of dollars from private savings, those immense sums would
be available for productive investment in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   And there would be a double stimulus because a return to sanity
would cut more than enough off long-term interest rates to give an
extra boost to corporate and home-buying borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, and its dividend can be seen in 1996s electoral
college numbers. But the basic idea is also central to the future _
zealously guarding budget surpluses, paying down the huge national
debt, and leading the world toward greater growth, depoliticized
currencies, and sensible financial practices.
</P>
<P>
   Continuity may sound boring. But when it means sound economic
policies that have contributed to prosperity not seen since the
'60s, it is the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't hurt Al Gore to repeat some version of that mantra
every day for the rest of his quest.

A PATENT THAT COULD HELP HALT COUNTERFEITING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The advent of super-high-quality color photocopiers has led to
an apparent boom in counterfeiting of money, particularly in
economically destabilized countries such as Russia, where by some
estimates 20 percent of the US currency circulating is bogus.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12-month period ending last October, authorities
seized $153 million worth of counterfeit bills, including just
under $70 million in the US. Worldwide, more than $200 million of
fake American legal tender _ about $1 of every $1,800 circulating _
is thought to be counterfeit, and relatively cheap color copiers
have now made it worthwhile for people to forge $5 and $10 bills
they can more easily pass off than fifties and hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Besides prompting the US Treasury Department to launch a
controversial redesign of currency, including most recently the $20
bill sporting an enlarged, off-center portrait of President Andrew
Jackson, the problem has encouraged inventors to develop a host of
new machines to detect fake bills.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a veteran electrical engineering professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, George W. Pratt of
Wayland, Mass., won patent 5,899,313 for such a device.
</P>
<P>
   Many existing systems rely on a visual inspection of bills or
test the ink used in printing portraits and borders of to make sure
it is properly magnetic. In contrast, Pratt's system checks whether
the paper it is printed on is the real stuff used by currency paper
maker Crane &AMP; Co. of Dalton, near Pittsfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiching a bill between two electrically charged plates,
Pratt's machine measures the ``dielectric properties'' of the
paper, or the way electricity flows through it. Real Crane paper,
which is heavy in cotton content, has what could be called a unique
electric signature compared to other kinds of paper, and fakes can
be identified in a matter of seconds.
</P>
<P>
   So far Pratt has what he calls a ``Rube Goldberg lab-type
prototype'' that has worked well enough in tests helped by the
Secret Service that it has elicited strong interest from
manufacturers he met through MIT's industrial liaison program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to have a gadget to test bills that is cheap,''
Pratt said. ``I want something I can put in a laundromat or at a
cash register.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, an MIT graduate who has been on the faculty since 1960,
has some other inventions to his credit, including a sonic device
manufactured by Waltham-based Hologic that measures bone density in
people with osteoperosis. Notably, the device originated in his
interest in race horses and desire to make a system identifying
horses with weak bones.

 TAKES-BOS  
 (Includes errors list and website info list)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When electrical engineer William Beaty was working on the design
of an electricity exhibit for the Boston Museum of Science, he
decided to check out some elementary school science textbooks in
search of good ways to communicate fundamental concepts on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   What he found was a morass of misconceptions, mistakes and
misinformation in one text after another. Not one of the books, he
found, even contained what he considered to be a valid definition
of what electricity is, much less how it works. And he discovered
something else: Even his own understanding of the subject, despite
his years in the profession, was flawed; he was still the victim of
deeply-help misconceptions that he had learned in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of my misconceptions had been specifically taught
to me,'' he said. ``(They) were in my science textbooks long ago,
and they were still in most modern textbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what Beaty found is not at all unusual.
Scientists and educators say that many of the textbooks used today
in US elementary and high schools contain significant errors,
fabricated history, erroneous diagrams and misleading explanations.
</P>
<P>
   Beaty, in a lengthy Web page he set up to try to dispel
scientific misinformation, cites examples of the kind of misleading
claims about electricity found in numerous textbooks. For example,
many texts describe an electric circuit as consisting of charges
that come from a battery, flow through a wire, turn into light
inside a bulb, and then flow into the battery's other terminal.
</P>
<P>
   There are several things wrong with that story, Beaty explains.
The charges are already inside the wire, not supplied by the
battery, and they are not turned into light; if they were, they
couldn't keep flowing. And this version leaves out the connection
through the battery, where charges flow through and back out again.
</P>
<P>
   Beaty suggests that a better approach is to use analogies that
help clarify the fundamental concepts, such as this: ``A battery or
generator is like your heart: it moves blood, but it does not
create blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambiguous or incorrect explanations of scientific phenomena may
help explain why one new study, which has been submitted to the
journal Science Education, found that students who had taken high
school physics classes that used textbooks did substantially worse
in college physics than those whose high school classes used no
textbooks at all.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier study by the same researcher, Philip Sadler of the
Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics, found that in some high-school science
classes, students at the end of the year scored worse on their
understanding of basic science concepts than they had before the
class began. In typical high school classes, he said, ``The
learning is minimal, and in some cases negative. Some kids have
more misconceptions at the end of a course than at the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sadler said, at the end of the year in one class,
more students than at the year's beginning thought that the sun was
sometimes directly overhead in their town _ despite the fact that
there is no place in the continental United States where this is
true (In fact, it only happens in the tropics.) And more students
at the year's end than at the start thought the moon's phases were
caused by Earth's shadow. (In fact, they're caused by the angle of
the sun's illumination.)
</P>
<P>
   Overall, as Sadler reported in the earlier study published in
The Physics Teacher, whether students took high school physics or
not had virtually no effect on college physics grades.
</P>
<P>
   Some educators have traced the transmission of errors from one
textbook to another and compare the process to the spread of a
virus through a population. ``As in epidemics,'' wrote Beaty on his
Website, ``a particular piece of information can spread
exponentially: The more textbooks it occupies, the more likely
other textbooks will be to acquire it.. . . The bad information can
be spread just as easily as the good.''
</P>
<P>
   The paleontologist and author Stephen Jay Gould wrote about the
same problem a few years ago, referring to it as the ``cloning'' of
bad information from one book to another. And it's not just the
information itself, right or wrong, that gets copied, but often the
sequence and the structure of a lesson, and even the use of
specific comparisons. Even when not wrong, such copying can impede
learning, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he cites the fact that virtually every textbook
chapter on evolution begins by describing Lamarck's discredited
ideas, even though most students may never have heard of the 19th
century biologist, and ends by using giraffes' necks as an instance
of natural selection, even though this is a dubious example.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is certainly not a new problem. James Michener
complained about the way school textbooks were written after a
brief stint as a schoolbook editor back in the 1930s, writing that
``the entire educational process was watered down, level by
level.'' And Richard Feynman wrote memorably of his experience with
bad science texts in the 1950s in his bestselling memoir ``Surely
You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!'' After working with a California
committee evaluating textbooks, he found ``that's the way all the
books were: They said things that were useless, mixed-up,
ambiguous, confusing, and partially incorrect. How anybody can
learn science from these books, I don't know, because it's not
science.''
</P>
<P>
   But the remarkable thing is that despite decades of efforts at
reform in science education, many scientists and educators charge
that the situation does not seem to have changed much. In fact,
some think the overall quality of textbooks has, if anything,
declined.
</P>
<P>
   And preliminary assessments from a study that will be published
in the early fall, conducted by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science's ``Project 2061'' to develop better
textbooks, indicates that at the middle-school level, reviewers
were unable to find even a single set of textbooks that satisfied
their criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on preliminary data,'' said the study's director,
biochemist and former teacher Jo Ellen Roseman, ``they don't look
very good. None of them . . . are likely to promote student
learning'' of the key concepts that educators have agreed such
classes should convey.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the current textbooks, Roseman said, are ``a mile wide
and an inch deep. The subjects are treated so superficially that
all students can do is memorize the terms and parrot the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some very good, carefully-tested new books for some
grade levels have arrived on the scene _ mostly from smaller,
specialty or academic publishers _ and are being used in some
schools. But most American public schools still use a variety of
textbooks from the major publishers that independent reviewers _
including scientists, educators and concerned parents _ have found
to be plagued with errors.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Howard Lyon, a musician in Erie, Pa. who majored in
science before switching to music, found when he looked at his
daughter's science book, ``Exploring Physical Science,'' a few
years ago. He started finding errors in the book; he kept looking
until eventually he had compiled a list of errors that grew to 45
single-spaced pages, and included instructions for lab experiments
that were physically impossible to carry out as described.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are far more'' errors than those on his original list,
just in that one book, Lyon said in a recent interview. ``I found
hundreds more since then.'' Eventually, Prentice Hall, publisher of
the ``Exploring Physical Science'' book (and now a division of
Pearson Education), agreed to pay for the copying of a separate
list of corrections that Lyon and others had compiled, to be
distributed to all the students in that school district along with
the book itself.

<TEXT>
<P>
   But ``Exploring Physical Science'' remains one of the nation's
leading high-school science texts, and no other school districts
have been given those corrections. A new 10-page list of
corrections compiled by the company has, however, been posted on
its Web site for teachers and students to download. Pearson
spokeswoman Maggie Rohr said that the company and its consultants
disagreed with some of the corrections included in Lyon's list,
saying that some were simply matters of opinion, such as how much
detail to include. (For example, whether to specify exactly when
Archimedes lived, instead of simply saying ``thousands of years
ago.'')
</P>
<P>
   A new edition has some of the mistakes corrected, but most were
left unchanged, according to Lyon. At a meeting with the
publishers, he said, representatives of the school district did a
spot check of 30 items from their list; two had been corrected, one
was changed but a new error was introduced, and 27 were untouched.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rohr claims that all of the clearly erroneous
information was corrected. For example, an experiment that was
physically impossible to carry out the way it was described in the
text has now been eliminated, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has clearly been stung by some of the criticisms
of their books, which included a scathing report last month on the
ABC-TV program ``20/20.'' Pearson's chief executive officer Peter
Jovanovich recently acknowledged the factual mistakes in the book
``Exploring Physical Science,'' and said ``I greatly regret that it
took the Prentice Hall School division longer than it should have
to fix them.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing a new goal of ``100 percent factual accuracy'' in
Pearson's 45,000 textbooks and materials, Jovanovich said ``we will
conduct a thorough review of every one of our school textbooks and,
through the Internet, post any changes that need to be made.'' He
added that a thorough review of all the company's books will be
completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers aren't the only ones doing the evaluating. In
addition to the massive review of textbooks being carried out by
the AAAS as part of its ``Project 2061,'' there are independent
groups made up of parents and educators that constantly review and
evaluate the books that are available.
</P>
<P>
   One of these, an independent California-based group called The
Textbook League, publishes a bimonthly newsletter with reviews that
are often vitriolic. Even the headlines tell the story: On
``Exploring Physical Science,'' they wrote that ``educators should
avoid this book like the plague''; a review of an Addison-Wesley
book called ``Exploring Matter and Energy,'' was titled ``phony
`science' and nonsensical numbers in a brainless book''; and a
review of Prentice Hall's ``Heat Energy'' was titled simply ``I
weep for the students.''
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter is published by William Benetta, an engineer and
writer, who says that overall, his impression is that textbooks
``are getting lighter and fluffier,'' jazzed up with fancy graphics
designed to appeal to superficial evaluations by school boards and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something changes,'' Benetta suggested in an interview,
``ten years from now, the books will come packaged with baseball
cards and bubblegum.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHERE THE BOOKS WENT WRONG: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few specific examples of the kinds of errors that
have been found in many currently-used science textbooks:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Prentice Hall's middle school text ``Heat Energy,'' a
false-color thermogram of a girl and a dog is paired with a
photograph of burning coals, and a caption says in both images that
red shows the hottest areas, blue the coolest. That's true in the
false-color image, but in the real world (as in the coals photo)
blue would be hottest, red least hot.
</P>
<P>
   _ An experiment for students in Prentice Hall's ``Exploring
Physical Science'' asks them to attach a pin to a tuning fork with
candle wax (it won't work; the wax doesn't stick) and uses a
diagram showing the pin pointing in the wrong direction for the
experiment. The whole experiment has been deleted from the latest
edition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prentice Hall's ``Motion, Forces and Energy'' describes the
way a shower curtain moves inward when the water is on as an
example of the Bernoulli effect, and important concept in fluid
dynamics. But it isn't. As several scientists have demonstrated,
it's just a result of the hot steam rising, drawing in cold air at
the bottom, and has nothing to do with the Bernoulli effect.
</P>
<P>
   _ Addison Wesley's ``Exploring Matter and Energy'' has a passage
that implies that the Earth's atmosphere does not move with the
ground below it, and implies that a plane flying eastward will
never be able to move forward because of Earth's rotation in the
other direction. The same book asks students to do calculations
based on a chart of the growth of a pair of twins, but the chart
implies that at birth, the twins had a length of 0, and by age five
were 18 inches long _ less than the average length of a newborn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many textbooks show a now-standard diagram of how a simple
lens works to form an image, but the diagram fosters many serious
misconceptions. By showing rays crossing behind the lens and then
forming an inverted image, it falsely implies that there is a
special crossover point, that the image is not inverted before that
point, that the distance to the object doesn't affect focus, that
if half the lens were covered half the image would disappear, and
that lenses are fundamentally different from simple pinholes.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Merrill Life Science'' describes five different ``orders of
birds'' that have nothing to do with the way biologists actually
classify birds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INFORMATION ON THE NET &QL; 
 &QL; 
There is a wealth of useful information on the Internet about
errors in textbooks as well as scientific misinformation in
general, with detailed reviews of books, explanations of incorrect
concepts and exactly what is wrong with them, and good explanations
of how things really do work. Here are a few sites, some of which

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ One administrator told them they were a
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The 69 young black women made up 10 percent of the Smith College
Class of '74, the largest group of blacks this prim Seven Sister
campus would ever see. Their arrival would have been unusual on any
college campus in 1970, but it was especially so here, amid the
Mary Margarets and Crickets with their Ivory Girl faces, their
horses and maids at home.
</P>
<P>
   The black women were informed they were merely guests, and they
themselves resisted becoming ``Smithies.'' They teased out their
Afros to frighten the white girls and refused to wear caps and
gowns to graduation, instead donning orange or red dresses so no
one could ignore their color or their sass.
</P>
<P>
   And they have harbored more than the usual dose of ambivalence
toward the formative college years _ despite how they cherished the
bonds among them, despite their striking success in fields not
traditionally open to women, much less black women.
</P>
<P>
   As they gathered here for their 25th reunion this weekend, these
women might have been expected to indulge in a bit of nostalgia.
But the black women of '74 also came with a mission: to hold
themselves up as examples _ to young black Smith students, to the
college, and to the nation _ of the power of diversity and open
doors. Now surgeons, bank executives, lawyers, PhD's, they have
been out long enough to appreciate the chance Smith gave them, and
they want to give back, with money, with mentoring, and by example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a commitment to the experiences we would like to
see other young black women have,'' said Linda Smith Charles, chief
organizer behind the reunion blitz of teas, lunches, and pajama
parties. ``Twenty-five years out, we find ourselves in positions
where we can give back, and we are prepared to step up to the
plate. If we can see volumes of black women doing that, we can
really influence change.''
</P>
<P>
   Their return was inspired in part by what has changed. Smith had
a male president when they were here; now it is a black woman. But
they also came because of what hasn't changed: the numbers of
blacks at Smith remain at about 4 percent, and colleges across the
country are struggling for diversity in a post-affirmative-action
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to share our history, set the tone, challenge the
black women at Smith today to assume the same responsibility,''
Charles said. ``There's a spirit about us, and we want to keep that
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Spirit seems an understatement, seeing the energy at a weekend
event ill-described by its official title as a ``tea.'' The room
becomes a swirl of hugs, exclamations, and shrieks of embarrassment
as the old photos come out. (``My blue suede hot pants!'' cried Amy
Robertson Goldson, a Washington lawyer whose clients include the
Congressional Black Caucus.)
</P>
<P>
   This group's bonds started before they arrived as freshmen in
the fall of 1970. The women came from a range of backgrounds. Some
applied to Smith because their parents had wanted their daughters
to attend a Seven Sisters school. Others were encouraged by
teachers, some by the Urban League, which paid their application
fees. But most didn't expect to end up at an all-women school in
the sticks of Western Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It all changed at an event in the spring of 1970 officially
known as Prefreshmen Weekend, but still recalled here as The Party
of Life. Black students from Smith had invited blacks from half a
dozen other campuses in the Northeast in the hopes of convincing a
sizable group of them to attend the next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It dispelled two reservations: one that there wouldn't be
other black folks around, two that there wouldn't be any men,''
said JoAnne Lyons Wooten. ``It showed me that there really was an
opportunity to be part of a community with people who shared my
culture, my political viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges were eager to increase their numbers of minorities,
which in those days meant almost exclusively blacks. Smith lured
them with hefty scholarships, and arranged for them to live
clustered in three dorms. The black students were given privileges
that now seem extraordinary: a credit card, a van for trips to
classes on other campuses or late-night runs to Friendly's Ice
Cream. When a few students asked for a course in jazz, the school
flew in Miles Davis and Archie Shepp to teach it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what the students wanted more than anything was to be
treated normally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't about going to class and being recognized as a
student,'' said Gail Lewis Lewis, now the special assistant for
medical residency programs at the Los Angeles County Health
Department. ``It was about going to class and being recognized as
just a student, and not as a black student.''
</P>
<P>
   Going unnoticed would not be easy. Many of the white students
said it was the first time they'd been around blacks. They wanted
to touch the black girls' hair and skin. They called them ``the
dressy-up ones.'' The black students had their own questions, like
how a freshman girl could afford a Mercedes, why the white girls
walked barefoot in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   The black students felt antipathy, too, from administrators and
the faculty, which at that time included no blacks. Several women
recalled how the director of financial aid called them one by one
into her office to explain that they had calculated their
admissions offers so that only about 30 blacks would accept; they
hadn't expected so many of the black women to attend.
</P>
<P>
   They sensed the increasing campus security for their parties,
which included black students from campuses across New England.
Store owners in Northampton's quaint downtown would trail the black
students as they browsed. A black student once arrived home from
class to a black national flag burned on her door.
</P>
<P>
   Most people acted not out of racism, but out of ignorance. Lewis
recalled how she wanted to take a horseback-riding class. But, a
college administrator replied, ``You didn't bring your horse!''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the black students considered leaving, but few did.
At least at Smith, there was strength in numbers. They used that to
their advantage, fighting for black faculty and a black studies
major.
</P>
<P>
   They came out with the closest of friends, and a degree that
allowed them to defy anyone who suggested there was anything they
couldn't do. The experience also trained them to be, in the words
of one alum, ``foreigners,'' which was a role they would play again
in the wider world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still facing many of the same issues we had at Smith,''
said Portia Gordon Ketosugbo, a research scientist at Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York. ``I've always been the
only African-American in my lab, and I'm constantly feeling I have
to prove myself more than anyone else. I've been there because I've
been very good. But it's a constant struggle to prove that.''
</P>
<P>
   Being out in the world has softened their bitterness toward
Smith; the experience there might have given them a taste of
ignorance, but they have seen worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smith took a chance on us, and we're thankful for that,''
Goldson said. ``We think we've represented Smith well, too, and we
want to show that.''
</P>
<P>
   As they hear the national debate on affirmative action and
diversity, they can't help but think of their own experience, and
where they would be without their Smith degree, where they might
have ended up if colleges had not opened their doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirmative action didn't mean that we didn't have the grades
to get in here, we did,'' Goldson said. ``What it meant was
leveling the playing field, reaching out and making the opportunity
visible.''
</P>
<P>
   The women might not have expected the numbers of black students
to rise after they left _ the national average was less than 8
percent black students when they graduated. But they were
disappointed to discover the numbers decreasing so sharply.
</P>
<P>
   They have stayed close outside of Smith, several traveling to
the Virgin Islands for a collective 40th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But with the inauguration of Ruth Simmons as Smith president
four years ago, they began to think about what they could do for
the college. The first black woman president of any Seven Sister or
Ivy League school, she has lit a spark under them, talking to
audiences across the country about the importance of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Planning this year's reunion, they sent out a letter urging
their black classmates to think of what each could do to make Smith
``the type of institution where all women can grow, learn, and
realize that there are no limits to their potential.''

<P>
   In three months, they raised $30,000 in scholarship money, with
29 of the original class donating, compared to six donations and a
total of less than $3,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when people felt quite anxious about things
like this,'' Simmons said. ``The notion was somehow that you ought
to march off into the great beyond, nobody should be identified as
black, everybody was part of the same big happy family. The reality
is, the experiences that one goes through shape you, and you want
to share those memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend has been a reminiscence of what was, and a
recognition of how far this class has come. Presenting Simmons with
the check, Benita Jo Walton, a reconstructive surgeon, cried and
noted that Ruth Simmons was the first president she could call by
her first name. The Class of '74 urged the Class of '99 not to wait
25 years to ''reengage and reconnect.''

<P>
   They laughed recalling how they refused to dress like everyone
else on their graduation day 25 years ago. And Saturday morning,
they joined with Smith tradition by dressing in white and red and
marching in the Ivy parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure if it says that we have accepted Smith, or that
Smith has accepted us,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking a minute, she decided it was both.

GIVING SHORT WEIGHT TO AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the failure of prevention. It may be American health
care's biggest flaw. And its consequences are especially dire for
elders.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, doctors are failing to prescribe the tests, pills,
and lifestyle changes known to lower mortality and avoid needless
suffering. Despite libraries full of weighty tomes telling
physicians how to minimize the toll of heart disease, high blood
pressure, cancer, diabetes and other killers, medicine's full
potential lies tantalizingly out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many gaps in care that are so maddening,'' says
Dr. Thomas H. Lee, whose job is to figure out how to fill those
gaps for the more than 1.2 million patients who get their care
through Partners Community Healthcare &UR;  &LR; in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The care gaps are ``pretty pervasive, pretty striking and pretty
distressing,'' agrees Dr. Joseph P. Frolkis of the Cleveland
Clinic. ``People are struggling with this problem all across the
country,'' adds Dr. David E. Wennberg of the Maine Medical
Assessment Foundation and Dartmouth Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study documents the problem. Last month, for
instance, Wennberg and his Dartmouth colleagues published an annual
``atlas'' of US health care for elderly Medicare beneficiaries
showing, among other things, that:
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one-third of older American women get mammograms
every two years, as they should; only 12 percent of elders are
checked in a two-year period for colorectal cancer; and among
elderly diabetics, fewer than half have eye exams to detect early
disease that leads to blindness if left untreated.
</P>
<P>
   That just scratches the surface of what many call the
``prevention gap.'' When people hear ``prevention,'' they often
think of lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation, healthier
diets, weight loss, and regular exercise. These are matters of
personal habit that are largely the patient's responsibility,
ideally with a nudge from the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a large realm of prevention that requires medical
intervention. One sort, which doctors call ``primary prevention,''
encompasses measures to detect early disease in individuals without
symptoms. This includes mammography for breast cancer; rectal exams
and monitoring of enzyme levels to pick up prostate cancer; and
diagnostic tests for colon cancer. Primary prevention also includes
vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring lapses in preventive medicine, however, involve
``secondary prevention,'' which focuses on the millions of
Americans with ailments such as high blood pressure, heart disease,
and diabetes. Overwhelming evidence shows the health care system is
doing a poor job of applying measures known to prevent serious
disability and death _ often things as simple as prescribing a
beta-blocker drug following a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Take high blood pressure, for instance. With effective control
through diet, exercise, and medication, its worst downstream
effects _ heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease _ can be reduced
by as much as 50 to 75 percent. Yet among the 50 million Americans
with hypertension, the proportion who are aware of their problem
has actually declined over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most disturbing recent evidence on the prevention
gap concerns heart disease, the nation's leading killer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Pearson, chairman of preventive and community
medicine at the University of Rochester, recently concluded a study
of 5,620 patients admitted to 50 US hospitals because of a heart
attack, worsening cardiac symptoms, or the need for a coronary
bypass or angioplasty procedure. These people are at high risk of
death or disability.
</P>
<P>
   Such patients typically have at least two major risk factors _
red flags signalling the need for medical intervention. But Pearson
found that heart specialists typically did not note risk factors in
medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Only half of those with high cholesterol had it recorded, along
with fewer than half with diabetes, and less than a third with high
blood pressure, pearson reported at a recent conference in Waltham
sponsored by the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown was not simply a matter of record-keeping. At
hospital discharge, only 42 percent of these typical heart patients
went home with recommendations for cholesterol-lowering drug
treatment. This is despite strong evidence that lowering ``bad
cholesterol''levels reduces the chance of a second heart attack or
death by 25 to 40 percent _ a benefit, Pearson notes, that ``rivals
or exceeds'' costly bypass and angioplasty procedures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unchecked diabetes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such missed opportunities are not restricted to heart disease.
``The majority of diabetes patients referred to me have not had
most of the five or six things that should be checked regularly,''
says Dr. David M. Nathan, chief of Massachusetts General Hospital's
diabetes center. ``Sometimes it's pretty frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of disconnect,'' observes the Cleveland
Clinic's Frolkis. ``Physicians, when interviewed, support the idea
of prevention and are often quite knowledgeable about the content
of specific guidelines. But they follow them only 20 to 60 percent
of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the fault is the physician's. The patient is to blame,
of course, if she or he fails to take the prescribed medication or
follow dietary orders. Of the three billion US prescriptions
written annually, only half are thought to be filled and taken as
directed. Nearly 90 percent of patients with hypertension taking
their pills within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet is this always the patient's fault? Among 3,260 Medicare
enrollees, more than a third of English-speakers and 54 percent of
Spanish-speakers were found to be ``medically illiterate'' in a
recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medically illiterate'' doesn't necessarily mean patients can't
read, but rather that they cannot grasp doctors' instructions and
health messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing a good job of communicating with patients,''
says Dr. Harlan Krumholz of Yale University. ``For instance, I
recently saw a 77-year-old black woman with a history of heart
attack. She didn't know what blood pressure was, what her blood
pressure target should be, what relationship blood pressure has to
heart disease. She couldn't name foods high in fat, salt, or
cholesterol.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A word of advice
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of patients' education level, research shows they
need clear information and encouragement to stick with chronic
treatment regimens.
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologist Richard Pasternak and his colleagues at
Massachusetts Genral Hospital are launching a program to telephone
elderly patients who have not filled their prescriptions. And
Cleveland Clinic doctors are beginning to send heart patients home
from the hospital with written treatment instructions, since they
found that heart specialists weren't addressing post-hospital
treatment _ even when prompted.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe major gaps in preventive care will narrow only when
patients take a more active role, such as pressing their doctors
about a mammography or prostate exam, a blood pressure reading,
cholesterol test, or an eye exam if they haven't had one in awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, experts are doing more than wringing their hands over
the situation. Momentum is building behind major efforts to close
health care's prevention gaps. But those who have tried warn that
it won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Counting heads
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The argument has often been made that managed care plans will
improve care because they have a stake in keeping patients healthy
_ especially within ``capitated'' plans that put doctors at
financial risk if their patients fall ill and consume more
resources. But many now doubt that premise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capitation has not been a friend of prevention,'' says MGH's
Pasternak. Tina Brown Stevenson, a Partners vice president, agrees:
``No one wants to invest in prevention. The payoff is way down the
line when someone doesn't have a stroke or kidney disease. Most
health plans say, `In three years the patient will be with another
plan.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is some evidence that health professionals do respond
to concerted efforts _ especially when the stakes include monetary
rewards and public disclosure of their performance. When Tufts
Health Plan offered Partners a $400,000 bonus if they could raise
the rates of mammograms and flu shots among the elders in the
Tufts' Secure Horizon's plan, Partners doctors hustled _ and
exceeded the 20 percent improvement target.
</P>
<P>
   There are major efforts at the national level too. The federal
Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, is
embarking on a campaign to get doctors to prescribe more aspirin
and beta-blocker drugs to heart attack patients. ``We think we
might be able to reduce mortality from a repeat heart attack on the
order of 3,000 lives a year at the end of the three-year period,''
says Dr. Stephen Jencks, the agency's director of quality
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA), a
voluntary group that tries to improve care in health maintenance
organizations, has begun to require health plans to measure and
publicly report what proportion of their subscribers have their
cholesterol below specified targets and, next year, how many have
their blood pressure under control.
</P>
<P>
   Because competition among HMOs is so keen, the hope is that
public disclosure of performance on these measures will get care
providers' attention as nothing else has. ``In terms of public
health, we all feel this will have more impact than anything we've
been involved with in our careers,'' says Lee, the Partners
official, who is on the NCQA committee. ``These measures will save
many, many lives.''

SAN FRANCISCO CITY HALL AWES AND SUBTLY INSPIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- When Oscar Wilde visited this city 100 years
ago, he made the usual remarks. ``San Francisco is a really
beautiful city,'' he said, ``the most artistic town I have ever
come across.'' The Irish playwright added the observation that San
Franciscans ``have determined that they will have nothing about
them that is not beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude persists in spite of fire, flood, and earthquake.
Mostly earthquake. On April 18, 1906, the earth shook for 48
seconds, registering 8.25 on the Richter scale. The damage and
subsequent fire killed 700 people and destroyed 28,000 buildings,
including City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting a plan by Daniel Burnham, the city planned a civic
center with a new City Hall in the Beaux-Arts style, its dome
rising 307 feet above Van Ness Avenue, 40 feet higher than the US
Capitol. From 73 entries, the winners were John Bakewell Jr. and
Arthur Brown Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Their curlicues and cornucopias of marble and granite greet
visitors today. Finished in 1915 at a cost of $4 million, it is one
of the grandest public structures on this continent. City Halls in
Albany and Minneapolis have their charms, but this one awes and
subtly inspires.
</P>
<P>
   When its city council, the Board of Supervisors, meets to decide
about stop signs and one-way streets, it gathers in a chamber fit
for a medieval monarch. Ornate columns of Manchurian oak soar above
the bureaucratic babble.
</P>
<P>
   A ceremonial staircase, featured in several movies, rises under
the dome, leading to the office where 10 mayors enjoyed the view
until the evening of Oct. 17, 1989, when a 7.1 magnitude earthquake
struck in Loma Prieta. Although the death and damage did not match
that of 1906, City Hall was declared unsafe and forced to close.
San Franciscans had to decide what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Seismic retrofitting would be expensive. Hoisting a 90,000-ton
structure onto the equivalent of roller skates would also take
time. The building now rests on 600 ``base isolators,'' allowing 26
inches of lateral movement. Workers spent years hauling 30,000
pieces of carved marble to warehouses, returning them to
steel-reinforced upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's politicians have always been adept at wangling
federal funds, so $78 million for earthquake damage became
available, along with $27 million from the state of California. To
finance the rest of the $300 million project, citizens had to
approve a bond issue of $293 million for seismic repair of public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Had the vote been taken in one of California's other 57
counties, the result may have been a low-rise trailer park
dedicated to the instincts of taxophobia. San Franciscans approved
the bond issue, staying true to their belief ``that they will have
nothing about them that is not beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mayor James (Sunny Jim) Rolph placed the cornerstone in
1913, he said, ``This an event made possible by the liberality,
optimism, pride, and confidence of our own citizens in their own
city.'' The current mayor, Willie L. Brown Jr., was told when he
was elected in 1995 that his office would not be ready until the
next century. Like many successful mayors, he is obsessive and
urgent. Brown replied, ``That project will be finished in my first
term.''
</P>
<P>
   City Hall re-opened early this year, with user-friendly touches.
In hearing rooms, padded seats protect spectators. Two ``light
courts'' have been restored on the first floor, once honeycombed
with desks and low ceilings. Sunlight floods a 60-by-120-foot
chamber where visitors enjoy a cafe and memorabilia shop.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions San Franciscans have made give the city an
architectural dignity and unity that is almost Parisian. Aesthetics
and politics blend happily here. Mayor Brown is an
African-American. Architect Arthur Brown, who also designed Coit
Tower and other notable buildings, was not. Say, Mr. Mayor, are you
guys related? Willie's cool reply: ``We're checking the DNA.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... right price.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There are some,'' Sillerman says in response to concerns like
this, ``who say `I am afraid of the SFX presentation' and I say to
them: `See what the other 90 or 95 percent of the people who are
willing to work with us _ and continue to work with us _ say. Be
open-minded and do what's best for you and your fans.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But is SFX itself doing what's best for concertgoers? Or is
Sillerman building this empire only to sell it, as he did with SFX
Broadcasting? And to sell it, perhaps, to one of the media
mega-conglomerates like Disney or Time Warner?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never founded a company for the purpose of selling it,'' he
responds. ``I happen to be the largest shareholder in this
company,'' with a reported 9 percent of the stock. ``If somebody
came in and said `Here's $200 a share,' if I didn't agree to that
I'd be sued and maybe killed.'' (SFX currently trades at around $60
a share.) But in the meantime, ``we're operating the company as if
it's going to be here forever,'' says Sillerman, adding that he
fantasizes about the day when his daughter Mckinley, now 6, might
take over.
</P>
<P>
   Pollstar's Bongiovanni is not convinced Sillerman is around for
the long haul. ``A lot of people expect that (selling out) is his
real endgame. Time will tell. He's had great taste in the assets
he's bought. But he's carrying a huge debt load'' _ $742 million,
according to published reports _ ``and I'm not sure they can
challenge that with concert business. The rule of thumb is most of
the money goes to the artist and representative and the risk goes
to the promoter. You may make 5 or 10 percent on a sellout.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, of course, the bottom line is ticket prices, and
the concern is that a near-monopoly like SFX will raise them. A box
office manager whose company is now part of the SFX chain says we
should look for more and more corporate boxes and worse seats for
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what you are asking in terms of pricing,'' says
Sillerman, ``so I'm by no means avoiding the question. But when one
has a certain financial capability, it does provide you with the
ability to take more risk, and no individual event becomes that
important. . . . We presented 13,000 events last year . . . and
from our point of view, a show doesn't need to make money in
Boston, it needs to make money'' nationally.
</P>
<P>
   A time of fear
</P>
<P>
   Says Metropolitan's Scher: ``I think the consumer has a great
deal to fear and we are living that fear right now. It's a topic of
conversation all the time. Contrary to Economics 101, where a
monopoly reduces the price to the talent, they, not yet being a
monopoly, are trying to exclude competitors. . . . On that basis,
they're significantly overpaying talent.''
</P>
<P>
   People paid $150 to see Neil Young recently. Top price is $115
to see Bob Dylan and Paul Simon this summer; the best seats for
Cher _ Cher! _ will cost $75. Is this the future of paying to hear
``superstar'' acts?
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman: ``First of all, I don't set the ticket prices. It's a
misnomer that the promoter does that. There has been no analysis of
supply and demand. Last summer we surveyed five shows in nine
amphitheaters, 45,000 tickets, and found for the front 1,000 of any
of those shows none of the people paid face value. They bought them
through scalpers and ticket agencies. Whether it's a blockbuster or
a lesser show, there is a core group of people that will pay an
increased amount of money. The fact that that money was not
captured by the artist or the promoter actually inflated the price
of the other tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, if X amount of money is needed to cover the costs, why
not have the high rollers pay a big chunk of it directly, rather
than have the scalpers and ticket agencies siphon off the money?
``Then,'' says Sillerman, ``the back rows are going to be priced
less expensively. This `auction process,' if you will, is taking
money away from (artists) and precluding us from lowering prices
elsewhere. One hundred percent of our amphitheaters are going to be
tiered so that there will be more expensive tickets, but there will
be many more that are less expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman says the Tweeter Center, for example, should have
three or four different tiers. ``It doesn't make any sense that
most shows were the same price,'' he says. ``Clearly, different
acts have different appeal, so therefore what we're going to do is
what Sam Walton clearly approved of: Lowering prices is brilliant,
and we'll get more people in the amphitheaters. That is in our best
interest and the artist's best interest. If there's 1,000 tickets
where prices are increased, there'll be 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000
where they are decreased.''
</P>
<P>
   Bongiovanni says the public shouldn't fear SFX, but says,
``There's no doubt we've seen a dramatic increase in pricing levels
in the last several years for the best seats at the biggest
concerts _ at least for the ones that draw an older demo, with the
presumption being that the audience can pay for it. That trend
predates SFX's entrance into the marketplace, but it's pretty clear
they've embraced it. Concert tickets are a volatile commodity, it's
a supply-and-demand economy, and the public has already dictated
that concert tickets are undervalued by its wilingness to pay
ticket brokers exorbitant fees. You're a schmuck if you don't do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little more cynical'' about multitiered pricing,
Bongiovanni adds. ``Artists want to make as much as they can and
also want to play to a full house. It's a delicate balance. A lot
of times, the hardest tickets to sell are the cheap seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us full circle to Sillerman's question: Why talk to
him about the concert business? Does Robert F. X. Sillerman know
what he's doing?
</P>
<P>
   The QB approach
</P>
<P>
   At the companies SFX has bought, apparently, it's pretty much
business as usual. To that extent, it would seem, Sillerman hasn't
made much direct difference. Says one higher-up at such a company:
``We're like today's quarterbacks in the NFL. We're running the
plays, but we're not calling them.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, the man who is calling them delivered that keynote
speech to his colleagues in the business. It was a rambling,
somewhat puzzling speech that was criticized by some in the
industry for its vagueness. Sillerman championed the communal value
of the concertgoing experience in an Internet age _ pretty much ABC
stuff. ``It was amazing,'' says one promoter. ``He's in a roomful
of promoters explaining why it's important to do live shows.
(itals)They already know.(unitals) He's obviously a smart guy, but
everyone was waiting to hear what the point was, and he's trying to
be one of the boys, but it backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   Added another industry source: ``He's not one of the boys.''
</P>
<P>
   And as to SFX's plans _ what everybody really wanted to know _
Sillerman didn't say much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Moses coming down from the mountain revealing the
tablets,'' says Werlin, of Great Northeast, of the anticipation in
the room. ``Here's a man who has so much influence, and it was
astonishing he would impart so little useful information about his
intentions or whatever his dream is _ good, bad, or indifferent.
It's what he didn't say _ like in jazz, the space between the notes
is resonant.''
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman says he was operating under strict guidelines not to
say much, because of a pending business deal. ``But if people
expected us to come out and say `This is how it is going to be
different and this is what we are going to do that is going to
change your lives, and it is either going to be better or worse,' I
have no such statements to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fundamentally good and sound business,'' he
concludes, one that would benefit from ``the integration of
previously disparate and sometimes inefficient'' companies.

DEFENSIVE AT DEFENSE: MAKE APOLOGIES, NOT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ We are watching Defense Secretary William Cohen
on C-SPAN and talking about how much things have changed in the war
department.
</P>
<P>
   Says my friend, who served in the peace-time Navy: ``I think I
liked it better when we didn't apologize and make excuses. What do
people think war is these days? Can you imagine William
Westmoreland saying, `I'm sorry,' and promising to investigate
every bomb that hit the wrong target?''
</P>
<P>
   When I say ``the war department,'' by the way, I mean it
generically, not as a reference to the long-gone U.S. Department of
War. Since 1947, America officially makes defense, not war.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, we seem to make particularly defensive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, sorry about that convoy of ethnic Albanians, that
hospital, that train of civilians, that Chinese Embassy. We have
soda straw views from 10,000 feet, you know. And old maps. Really
sorry. Oops.
</P>
<P>
   On C-SPAN, Cohen and his much-decorated chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Henry Shelton, are asking the Senate
Budget Committee for billions of dollars for the Department of Make
Defense Not War.
</P>
<P>
   What Cohen and Shelton want is not as much as some senators
think they should have but more than a few want to give. Because
several senators have asked, Cohen defends defense efforts in
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there have been some mishaps, he says, but they must be
looked at in context: 18,000 missions in 45 days, 4,000 of them
attack missions. Some 10,000 munitions have been dropped even
though bad weather has provided NATO air forces with only five or
six ``really clear'' days.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, says Cohen, has lost 100
percent of his oil refining capability, 60 percent of his
ammunition production facilities, nine of his 14 MIG-29s, 30 to 40
percent of his existing ammunition, two of his own residences and
multiple headquarters of such entities as his army, air force and
political party.
</P>
<P>
   As for the United States, adds Cohen, we have lost a couple of
Apache helicopters, a couple of planes and no lives.
</P>
<P>
   I try to picture Robert McNamara or Melvin Laird _ the
secretaries of Make Defense Not War when Gen. Shelton was a Green
Beret platoon leader in Vietnam _ cast in this role.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's voice is soft and careful. His sensitive, always
startled-looking eyes seem especially wounded as they make contact
with the likes of Sens. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Judd Gregg,
R-N.H. Try as he might to present a poker-face to senators, his
whole body seems to register every lukewarm compliment, every
subtle put-down, every overt insult.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, during his Senate confirmation hearings,
Cohen was considerably less defensive. Facing the Armed Services
Committee on which he'd served for three terms, he said he wanted
the world to know that all U.S. troops would be out of Bosnia after
June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to end at that point,'' Cohen said. ``We are not
and cannot become the world's policeman, neither can we become a
prisoner of world events, isolated and tucked safely away in a
continental cocoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Milosevic missed that speech. It is nearly June 1999
and we are deeper than ever into the Balkans; we are both the
world's police and the prisoner of its events.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps toughest of all for Cohen and Shelton, we are making war
on Serbia, but we are not fighting a war.
</P>
<P>
   How many reporters asked if it was absolutely necessary to
destroy all of Dresden? How many misdirected U.S. bombs killed how
many Vietnamese civilians? How many ``oops'' were shuffled out the
back door of even Desert Storm by the Pentagon's sophisticated
media-briefing machine?
</P>
<P>
   Today, nothing gets lost in the shuffle. There is no chaos of
war because there is no war. Thanks to CNN and the Internet, every
mishap and mistake stick out like neon-lit tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's motive is suspect _ even the generals' _ and every
move is second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my friend's nostalgia, I'll bet that we will be a
better, more peaceful people for these changes. Some day.
</P>
<P>
   But the transition period may be long and awkward. Especially
for the people who work in the no-win Department of Make Defense
Not War.

ON GUN CONTROL, GOP LISTENS TO `POWER,' NOT PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is anything to be learned from the tragic shootings at
Columbine High School last month, it's the need for serious,
genuine gun control.
</P>
<P>
   However, given their conduct in the US Senate last week toward a
very reasonable gun control measure, the Republicans apparently
still have a lot of learning to do.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the chamber approved an amendment by Idaho
Republican Larry Craig, a member of the National Rifle
Association's board of directors, to make instant background checks
of private sales at gun shows voluntary _ not mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the majority Republicans tried _ unsuccessfully _
to stop a measure aimed at prohibiting the import of high-capacity
ammunition clips, which was not included in a 1994 assault weapons
ban.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, and apparently worried about the political fallout of
their earlier votes, senators pushed through a measure they said
would indeed require background checks on buyers at gun shows,
contrary to Wednesday's vote. But on closer examination, the bill
was harshly criticized by President Clinton as full of ``high
caliber loopholes'' and by some Democrats as a rather phony effort
at real gun control legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who apparently know a weak gun control bill when they
see one, pointed out that, under the measure, a gun sale would be
automatically approved if the background check was not completed
within 24 hours, instead of the three days under current law. They
also noted the bill would require no background check for a person
who pawns a gun and then reclaims it.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the week's votes on gun control show that GOP members
still don't get it, even as polls show strong public support for
gun control, especially after the Colorado shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Such votes lend credibility to Democrats and other gun control
advocates who say much of the Republican Party is still under the
influence, if not the outright control, of the NRA _ despite strong
protests from Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Orrin Hatch of
Utah that the NRA ``hasn't had a thing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the Republican Party to ``get real'' with gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans and NRA members apparently see no connection
between the need for tougher gun control laws and the number of
children killed by guns. Yet this country continues to lead the
industrialized world in firearms-related deaths of children. Our
death rate is 12 times that of the next 25 nations combined,
according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   As the study further points out, not all of that can be blamed
on violence-prone youths. In the past 10 years, more than 2,300
children 14 or younger have been shot and killed accidentally.
Overall, since 1960 more than 750,000 Americans of all ages have
died of gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the United Nations found that of 1,107 children killed
around the world by firearms in 1994 and 1995, 86 percent died in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The number of adult deaths by firearms is also startling.
Consider a comparison with Japan, which had 93 firearm deaths in
the same year that the United States registered 35,957. While a
difference in population explains some of that disparity, it cannot
mask for the fundamental truth: There is something very wrong in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita, the US rate of firearms deaths is more than three
times that of the next closest nation, Canada, according to the UN
research. Ernie Chavez, a University of Colorado specialist on
violence, noted in a recent news article that, in one year alone,
Los Angeles County had more murders than Canada. He further noted
in the Denver Post article, ``I'd be hard-pressed to think of any
country not in the midst of a revolution that has more violence and
weaponry than us.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest estimates suggest that there are between 230 million
and 250 million firearms in the United States. It's almost as if
this country, with this proliferation, is at war with itself, and
losing.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide reports suggest that most countries, after they face a
tragedy such as the one at Columbine High School, immediately take
action that results in stronger handgun control laws. So far, the
United States is not one of those.
</P>
<P>
   As Mark Pertschuk, the Washington-based legislative director for
the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said, there are two things that
are true around the world but not here. The first, he said, is that
``they have licensing and registration of firearms.'' The second is
``they have radically lower levels of deaths.'' There is no
disputing that the second fact is the result of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have determined that access to firearms is one of
the reasons America's rate of violent death is at epidemic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   There is overwhelming evidence that tougher gun control laws
would reduce the number of gunshot deaths in the United States.
Yet, there are still too many US lawmakers, including most GOP
senators, who prefer to maintain their relationship with the NRA
than to muster the courage to do the right thing _ support strong
gun control laws that may save the lives of thousands of children
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   If these Republicans need a reason to justify their move to
actual gun control laws, all they have to do is say, ``Let's do it
for the children.'' It just may work.

RABBI DRAWS ON JEWISH TRADITIONS TO HELP COUPLES IMPROVE SEX LIVES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Rabbi Shmuley Boteach believes sex is dead. That's why
he is working passionately and religiously to resurrect romance and
love in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old, bearded, bespectacled rabbi, who married the
only girl he ever dated, is the author of ``Kosher Sex''
(Doubleday, $19.95). Dispensing wry humor, pop psychology
statistics and thoughtful observations from Jewish tradition,
Boteach (BO-te-ya) is crusading against the decline of marriage and
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex is dead because a fulfilling sex life cannot be had
without (emotional) intimacy,'' said Boteach, a London-based rabbi
who lectured in Houston recently. ``Today people are making love
with an emotional condom.''
</P>
<P>
   Boteach rattles off statistics and observations:
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of single men and women over 40 have not had sex
in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Married people have sex twice a week that lasts 5 1/2 minutes
at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes six minutes to brew a good cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Boteach focuses on enduring relationships as a result of his
parents' breakup when he was 8. He has made it a life's work to
find qualities that make marriage both permanent and happy.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the genders today are characterized by
bed-hopping, casual sex, lack of commitment _ and much unhappiness,
said Boteach, who is a family counselor as well as a chaplain at
Oxford University. He and his wife have six children.
</P>
<P>
   Too many young men are afflicted with emotional distance even if
they are living with very compatible women, he said. And some
women, failing to have their emotional needs met, resort to
coercive or obsessive acts to force a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more she pushes him, the more he withdraws. Both sexes are
responsible for the downward spiral of this gap and divide
separating the sexes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unhappiness is evident in marriage. ``How can (American)
society sustain a 50 percent divorce rate?'' he said. ``And let's
not forget that the divorce rate does not acknowledge how many
people break up before they marry.''
</P>
<P>
   One survey found that American men and women averaged six
serious breakups before marrying. ``That is a heart that has been
broken a lot of times,'' he said. ``The result is that people are
afraid of falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Marriage today often includes prenuptial agreements, separate
bank accounts and separate names.
</P>
<P>
   Boteach said premarital sex is part of the problem. Men and
women have become experts in sex. They wind up rating each other,
ratings that can turn a promising relationship into a sex derby, he
said. But great sex doesn't mean the couple is benefiting from
emotional sharing and bonding.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are connecting but remaining strangers to each other,'' he
said. ``On an intimacy scale of 1 to 10, you may physically be at
10, but emotionally only at a 2 or 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis on sex results in men and women focusing on their
bodies rather than their inner characters and attributes. ``If you
continue to have passionate sex and no intimacy or no closeness, if
you just rub bodies together and create friction ... you are going
to go off the whole sexual thing,'' he said. ``Sex will die.''
</P>
<P>
   But a fulfilling life of shared emotional intimacy between a man
and a woman cannot be sustained without passionate sex, he writes
in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only sex has the power to call forth our deepest, most
powerful emotions,'' he writes. ``Sex and commitment are the
ultimate forms of human closeness, and we cannot be close and
distant at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Boteach pointed out that one of the biblical words for sex is
``to know,'' as in ``Adam came to know his wife Eve'' (Genesis
4:1). It is that intimate knowledge of the other that solidifies
husband and wife, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boteach provides several suggestions for husbands and wives to
avoid destructive boredom and routine. One is based on the Orthodox
Jewish ban on intercourse during menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that couples voluntarily abstain from sex for two
weeks and focus on sharing activities and building good
friendships. That will prepare them for passion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He advocates the return to modest dressing: ``An immodest
generation loses the right of attraction to the human body.''
</P>
<P>
   All human senses need to be involved in the relationship,
Boteach said _ not just sight. Hearing, smell and touch should be
part of a couple's intimate moments. And he advises people to keep
their eyes open during sex: ``We close our eyes during sex; what
we're trying to do is tune out our partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance is not going to go well in the bedroom if it is not
going well in the living room,'' he said. Too many couples regard
sex as the relationship's goal rather than the culmination of
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the book's advice is rather direct, which has caused
some conservative-minded Jews to be critical of his candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe 10 percent of Jews are afraid of modernity and believe
that sex is something dirty that should not be discussed in
public,'' he said in response.
</P>
<P>
   While a devout Jew, Boteach does not use religion to cause
guilt. He avoids negative concepts such as sin in favor of positive
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to ``Kosher Sex'' convinces Boteach that a sexual
counterrevolution is under way. The book has been well-received in
England, the United States and South Africa. It is being translated
into French, German, Spanish and Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are feeling the crisis in intimacy,'' he said. ``They
are tired of being strangers; it has become a very lonely world.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants the religious community to deal with sexuality and
sexual morality more openly with similar books. Religion, he said,
has allowed the secular community to take the lead on sexuality.
``What has happened is that we let sex be discussed by purveyors of
sleaze rather than sanctity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His fans turned out for his lecture at the Jewish Community
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In modern America, people go from relationship to relationship
to relationship and get involved sexually very quickly,'' said
Holly Cin, a married Rice University graduate student in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The book) addresses why you shouldn't do that and about the
practice of monogamy,'' Cin said. ``It is old advice, but not
common advice anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Relationships are in trouble,'' said a psychologist who asked
not to be identified. ``He makes some very good observations about
relationships today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he said anything entirely new, but he has a way
of saying it that makes you want to listen,'' the psychologist
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Jew who lives in the perimeters of Houston should have
been here, including the rabbis,'' Berte Toppell said. ``He said it
so deliciously, `Don't go by the surface.'''
</P>
<P>
   Toppell lost her husband after 52 years of marriage and was
delighted to hear Boteach advise spouses that a little jealousy
doesn't hurt. ``I adored my husband, and I was so jealous of him,''
she said joyously.
</P>
<P>
   Dorit Golan, a single mother of three and twice divorced, came
to hear ``how to keep a relationship going with a man the
old-fashioned way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 10-year-old daughter,'' Golan said. ``I want her to
learn what my mother never taught me: how to have a relationship
with a man and not have sex before you get married. ... That's
where my generation needs to go.''

FOR CATS, BALD IS BEAUTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I &UR;  &LR; see the producers of the upcoming movie ``Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me,'' have high hopes for Mr. Bigglesworth,
fearless furless feline companion of Dr. Evil, Powers's nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   An item in a recent Entertainment Weekly reported that New Line,
the studio releasing the ``Austin Powers'' sequel, has launched a
plush (but, I assume, not too plush) toy in the likeness of the
film's ``bald baddie,'' portrayed by a cat actor named Mel Gibskin.
Other Mr. Bigglesworth products may be forthcoming, among them Evil
Cat Chow.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Mr. Bigglesworth can supplant
Gidget, the Taco Bell dog, as top pop-culture creature of the
moment. Hairless cat vs. (nearly) hairless dog? Bald is indeed
beautiful, among celebrity animals at least.
</P>
<P>
   Cats magazine named Mr. Bigglesworth Cat of the Year. Cat Fancy
magazine recently profiled Bigglesworth's breed, the sphynx. And
fans of the comic strip ``Robotman'' know that another hairless
cat, Fleshy, is also a media star, a key player in several story
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Even a determined cat lover may have reservations about the
sphynx. I met my first at a recent cat show. He looked like a cat.
He sounded like a cat. But he was totally bald. I wanted to pet
him, but touching the entries is bad cat-show form. I asked his
owner what he feels like. ``A warm peach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sphynx breed is very controversial, according to Desmond
Morris's ``Cat World: A Feline Encyclopedia.'' It's a fairly recent
breed, having arisen from a mutation, a hairless kitten born in
Toronto in 1966. Morris notes that it has been called ``the ugliest
cat alive,'' but that other people have said the cat is ``so ugly
it's beautiful.'' Sphynx fanciers, he notes, believe that its
unusually sociable and affectionate nature more than compensates
for its bizarre appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Kelly of Kelly Cattery in Dighton, Mass., who breeds the
sphynx, vouches for their friendliness. ``They're very outgoing,
very people-oriented, very playful,'' she says. ``They like to jump
on your shoulder and balance there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly points out another reason for the growing popularity of
the breed: they're hypo-allergenic. Most people who can't tolerate
cats can live quite happily with a sphynx, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also breeds bengals, spotted cats that originated as a
cross between a domestic cat and the wild Asian leopard cat. She
was looking for another unusual breed when, almost 20 years ago,
she saw her first sphynx. At that time the cat was quite rare. Ten
years passed before Kelly was able to acquire a breeding female.
</P>
<P>
   The sphynx is not the easiest cat to rear because the kittens
are very vulnerable to cold. ``They have to be kept very warm in
the first weeks or they'll die,'' Kelley says. ``The babies are
very fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   The adult cats, too, require a warm environment. Kelly advises
sphynx owners who don't want to keep their homes at at 80 degrees
or higher to make sure their cats wear sweaters. ``You can make
them out of sweat shirt sleeves,'' she says. ``The cat's head goes
through the cuff, and you cut little holes for the legs.''
</P>
<P>
   When a sphynx is cold it tends to grow fur, ``a little fuzz,
like a kiwi fruit,'' Kelley says. (Apparently these cats are
destined to be compared with various fruits.) The more fur, the
less valuable the cat. But fuzzy or not, the sphynx is expensive. A
show-quality cat can cost $2,500, a pet quality animal $700.
</P>
<P>
   If Mr. Bigglesworth prompts a sphynx boom will we eventually see
lots of hairless cats in shelters? Kelly doubts it. ``There aren't
that many breeders,'' she says. ``This is one cat that can't be
mass-produced.''

THE FULLER BRUSH MAN SURVIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yup. He's still around.
</P>
<P>
   He's still walking neighborhood sidewalks, ringing doorbells,
pulling out his wares from a satchel.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he's become increasingly obsolete over the years. But not
in Newton, Mass., where Al Cohen pounds the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   At age 47, Cohen is a six-day-a-week door-to-door Fuller Brush
salesman. Or as he puts it when he knocks on doors: ``Hello, Fuller
Brush man here.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who came of age any time from the '30s to the early
'60s, those words bring back memories of the friendly fellow who
came to front doors with a case filled with mops and brooms and
brushes. A fellow almost as endemic to the neighborhood as the
milkman.
</P>
<P>
   But that was back when most women were housewives. Keeping the
home clean was a top priority, and they were always looking for new
products to achieve their goal. Plus, it was a time when locks were
rarely turned, on house or car doors, and neighborhoods were more,
well, neighborly.
</P>
<P>
   So how can Cohen survive in today's world of women in the work
force, how can he compete with sprawling suburban shopping malls,
the Internet, the Home Shopping Network, and the millions of
catalogs that flood American mailboxes? And now that the streets of
suburbia are a bit meaner and doors are locked and often stay
locked even when folks are home _ just who keeps this brushman in
business?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the last of a dying breed,'' admits the 30-year sales
veteran, who is short, jocular, and dressed in a red windbreaker, a
checkered shirt, striped tie, and gray pants. ``But I have a
customer base of about 1,000 that I've built up over the years and
I enjoy serving them. Many of them are retired, but I've got a lot
of boomers, too. What's most difficult is that people have so
little free time these days. And it's hard to catch them at home.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement. Drive along any street in his
territory _ Newton and the southern part of Brookline _ and the
curbs and driveways are carless. Houses sit with blinds drawn and
little red alarm buttons signal that they're armed and empty. There
are no kids or bikes on the lawns, nor women hanging laundry on the
backyard clotheslines of yesteryear. There's just an eerie
stillness as Cohen steers his small red Toyota along the barren
streets _ hoping he'll find a car in a driveway and thus a human at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not always the key,'' says Cohen, who started
selling Fuller Brush products in Hull during the summer he turned
16. ``Some people actually put their cars in their garages. So I
stop and knock on doors even when there aren't any cars around.''
</P>
<P>
   In and out. In and out. Cohen gets in and out of his car dozens
of times a day. When he leaves home, he selects a neighborhood,
then a street. He parks his car. He gets out. He opens the back of
his hatchback. He grabs his satchel and a carpet sweeper. He locks
the car, walks up to a house, and rings the doorbell. Only twice,
never three times _ he doesn't want to be bothersome. If no one is
home, he retraces his steps and heads for the next house. He always
carries his bag of products and trusty carpet sweeper.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an exciting job, but it can be a dangerous one.
Several years ago, Cohen was bitten in the stomach by a customer's
overprotective German shepherd. It can also be a cold and windy
job. To avoid a repeat performance and the jaws of two Doberman
pinschers, Cohen conducted business with a client while shivering
in the driveway of her home one winter day _ the two pointy-eared
beasts barking at him from the warmth of their living room. And it
can be a conspiratorial job. He helped a customer hide $100 worth
of purchases in the basement _ all the better to keep the stash
hidden from her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gray, vice president of consumer sales and marketing at
Fuller Brush, a division of CPAC, a chemical manufacturing firm
headquartered in Leicester, N.Y., says Fuller Brush is ``alive and
well.'' ``There are an estimated 10,000 independent Fuller Brush
distributors nationwide,'' says Karen McCulley of CPAC's
marketing/media department. ``But that figure fluctuates from month
to month.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 10,000 representatives do not all work full time, like
Cohen. The majority, says Earl Goff, 71, of Rehoboth, who is
celebrating his 50th year with Fuller Brush, are women who do not
go door to door but sell part time to friends, friends of friends,
and co-workers. Although Goff made a good living and supported his
family through his sales, Cohen says he takes home only $15,000 to
$17,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have made more if I recruited people to work under me,
but I like being independent,'' says Cohen, who grew up in Hyde
Park and moved to Newton, where he lives with his parents. ``And I
like my customers. After all these years, I pretty much know what
people need and want, so I don't mind leaving a catalog under their
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Such catalogs are relatively new. Fuller Brush first began to
print them in 1988. Since then, the company has also opened 10
factory outlets and plans to expand its Web site _ but must be
careful not to interfere with the sales of loyal local
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Hartford, Conn. in 1906 by Somerville, Mass. native
Alfred C. Fuller, the company became a household name during the
'30s and '40s. It became synonymous with the image of the
suitcase-toting door-to-door salesman. But with and the growth of
malls and women in the workplace in the '60s and '70s came a
rapidly shifting sales territory. And Fuller Brush went the way of
many small companies: It was bought by Consolidated Foods in 1968
and in 1994 by CPAC.
</P>
<P>
   It was also in 1968 that Cohen began his trekking for Fuller
Brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at my parents' summer home in Hull and we were talking
about the job I'd lined up for the summer. I was going to start the
next day at Nemo's hot-dog stand in Paragon Park,'' says Cohen, who
during the summer still sells in Hull, a resort area just outside
Boston, and lives in a basement apartment in his parents' cottage.
``While we were talking, the Fuller Brush man came to the door and
overheard us. He said, `Do I have a job for you!' And he signed me
right up.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked on and off for Fuller for 20 years and full time since
1989. Cohen worked in his father's appliance store for 10 years and
then owned his own businesses in Boston and suburban Norwood before
high rents sent him back to Fuller Brush full time. ``There are no
sales territories today, so I have Newton to myself. I think I've
knocked on every door in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of my clients are 45 and up,'' says Cohen, who
averages 300 miles a week on his rounds. A lot of young people
aren't familiar with the name. He hits the homes of regular
customers once or twice a year, or he'll go more often if they call
with an order. January is his slowest month. From October until the
holidays is his busiest time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a door slammed in my face,'' he says, adding
that he's even dated a couple of his regular customers' daughters,
but has never married. ``I don't feel at all nervous about knocking
on doors cold _ I've been at this too long.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent crisp, sunny morning, Cohen heads for Newton's Oak
Hill neighborhood. He knocks on 14 doors before he gets a hit _ 2
of the 14 doors were opened by women who were ``too busy'' to talk.
At the 15th house, the customer buys three mop sponges.
</P>
<P>
   At the next house he's greeted by ``Oh Al, I've been waiting for
you. I need some kind of brush to clean the tiles in my bathroom.''
Cohen has the ``perfect'' product, he says, and makes a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, a retired male customer greets Cohen by name
and buys almost $70 worth of merchandise. This is second-generation
selling _ Cohen used to sell to the man's mother. At the next
house, things look good. The woman is interested in a pair of
poultry shears, but when she shows them to her husband, she comes
back and shakes her head. No sale. Still, she takes a catalog.
Cohen is confident he'll get a call. She's bought from him before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he's such a very nice young man,'' Vivian Graham, one of
Cohen's longtime customers, says during a phone conversation.
``I've been buying from him for 10 or 12 years. He's not pushy and
(is) so polite. I've bought several of those little carpet sweepers
_ one for my home here, one for our Maine house, and one for my
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also sells to small businesses _ insurance agencies, hair
salons, and restaurants. Mary English, an administrator for Hammond
Realty in Newton, has been buying from Cohen for about eight years.
``He's so sweet,'' says English. ``He's happy when you buy
something from him and just as pleasant if you don't. He's not one
of these high-pressure types. He comes by the office three or four
times a year and we all buy something from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he'll continue his door-to-door career, Cohen
pauses and says he's not sure. ``I got my real estate license
several years ago, but most places want me to work 60 hours a week
and on weekends. I'm not used to that. I don't want to work those
kind of hours.''

DAVID BREASHEARS TAKES READERS TO `HIGH' PLACES

HIGH EXPOSURE 
An Enduring Passion for Everest and Unforgiving Places 
By David Breashears 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 319 pp., illustrated, $26 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Breashears, mountaineer and cinematographer, is one of
those rare people who turns a childhood dream into reality. The
Brighton resident became widely known after his IMAX film team
became involved in the 1996 Everest disaster. Breashears, 43, had
already achieved prominence in climbing and film circles, but with
the subsequent large-format blockbuster ``Everest,'' he became
hero, sex symbol, and adventurer extraordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't address that sudden fame in his captivating
autobiography, ``High Exposure,'' but he does offer up other
intimacies _ about his violent father, a failed marriage, and his
own difficulties with anger and control.
</P>
<P>
   His father, an Army officer, left the family of three sons and a
daughter when Breashears was 10. He writes: ``It was during this
bleak time that I discovered the book `Mountains' and the photo of
the Sherpa Tenzing Norgay atop Mount Everest. I was transfixed.
Tenzing's pose on that barren slope of rock and snow _ the highest
point on the face of the earth _ bespoke honor and hope and
transcendence. It imparted directly to me a promise that up there,
on that forbidding mountain, lay a path of clean and simple
nobility.'' And so Breashears took a pilgrimage to Everest, first
in his heart and later in reality (he has now reached the summit
four times) to find the sanctuary and security that was snatched
from him as a child.
</P>
<P>
   His first foray into climbing was in high school in Wyoming
(he'd lived in several states and overseas): He and his buddy Danny
used hemp rope and knew next to nothing about safety precautions.
He was able to get a scholarship to the National Outdoor Leadership
School, and his climbing education began in earnest. In his senior
year, the family moved to Denver. While other kids were playing
football, listening to Pink Floyd, and doing drugs, he found his
high at Boulder Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   This early part of Breashears's book is sweet and moving, and
includes wonderful family and climbing photos. Here's a teenage boy
obsessed with climbing and Everest well before mountaineering was a
cool thing to do, even in Colorado. His defining moment came after
completing a route that other more experienced climbers could not.
``The moment lifted me off the earth and elevated me into their
rarefied realm. At last I belonged.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his filmmaking career began by accident (he served as a
gofer, hauling camera equipment and provisions), once the bug bit
him he attacked the craft much as he had mountaineering, by
learning from anyone who would teach him and by taking calculated
risks. In 1986, he took on an assignment from the BBC, in search of
the body of George Mallory and his camera. Finding an undeveloped
summit photo would prove that Mallory had beaten Norgay and Edmund
Hillary to the top of Everest. The mission was unsuccessful. (Just
two weeks ago, climbers retracing the route found Mallory's body
lying on a windswept ledge, frozen there since 1924.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Breashears blames himself for the breakup of his
marriage to Veronique Choa, an independent and adventurous woman,
he doesn't delve deeply into the relationship. In fact, he skims
over much of his adult emotional life and focuses on the physical.
</P>
<P>
   The final quarter of the book is devoted to the 1996 Everest
assignment, including some stupendous photos. By now, most everyone
knows the story of how the IMAX team not only dropped what they
were doing to help with the rescue but also gave out valuable
supplies, such as bottled oxygen, that were to be used for their
own ascent to the summit _ to help victims and other rescuers. When
you read the painstaking preparation that went into the $7 million
project before Breashears even left for the Himalayas, you see what
a sacrifice that really was. After much experimentation, IMAX
redesigned its original 70-pound large-format camera (lovingly
called ``The Pig'' because it eats 5.6 feet of film per second ) to
weigh 42 pounds and withstand temperatures to minus 50. And, of
course, the air at 29,028 feet made every physical feat that much
more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   Breashears mourns those who died on the mountain but busies
himself with the rescue work, including a gripping narrative of
helping the severely frostbitten and nearly dead Beck Weathers:
``He braced his forearms on my shoulders as we started down. One
glance to my left or right and I was staring at Beck's frozen
claws, just inches away. The sight of those useless appendages and
the utter helplessness of the man was deeply unnerving. . . . He
didn't complain. He was so thankful. He had a profound effect on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX team eventually decided to carry on with the film after
the accident because, Breashears explains, ``I wanted to prove that
Everest was _ in its grandeur _ an affirmation of life, not a
sentence of death.'' As with most everything else he sets out to
do, Breashears succeeds.

   People who understand the West beyond the Dakotas will tell you
that the place is bigger than darkness itself and half again as
cruel _ high plains and rattlers and a wind that can kill you just
by wearing you down. It's also a place of such unearthly beauty, of
staggering skies and stars and so much romance, that you love it
more than any fool ought to and will commit acts of madness in
order to stay. This lunatic spirit is what settled the big sky
country of Wyoming and Montana and what defines it still, at least
so far as its human inhabitants are concerned. Which, it must be
mentioned, don't seem as though they amount to much in the relative
scheme of things. When you've just witnessed an August snowstorm
that took down a hundred of your herd, then left you with a perfect
afternoon, it's hard to believe that any grand design had you
positioned at the head of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Proulx, whose bleak poetic prose has snared the icy
coastline of Newfoundland as well as northern Vermont, seems to
know Wyoming as only the wandering artist or devoted transplant
can: seems born to the place and yet far enough away to grasp its
glorious contradictions. She resettled there several years ago, in
the aftermath of the acclaim she received for her 1992 novel, ``The
Shipping News,'' but the witness listening to how these people talk
could have been eavesdropping in the state all her life. More
startling is the psychic and physical milieu captured in the
stories in ``Close Range,'' the standoff between geographical and
human hubris that most natives couldn't put into words. When it
comes to the land, Proulx may be the most onomatopoeic writer in
America, and her prose begs to be read aloud: Her stony cliffs
sound like rock-hard places on the tongue; her geysers and rivers
and wide morning sun soar with the cadences of water and light.
Good thing all that beauty is around, given what she's describing.
This is a bright, hard corner of the world where a knife fight can
signify an act of love and a cut fence is far worse than aggravated
assault. No romantics here, and no innocents, either. Evil may not
go by that name in Proulx's Wyoming, but it sleeps in the shadows
of everyone's barn.
</P>
<P>
   Few writers feel equally at home in the novel and the short
story, and in the acknowledgments of ``Close Range,'' Proulx admits
that ``short stories are very difficult for me.'' That hardship may
be worth the struggle, because these stories, all written in the
past few years, are tough as flint and on occasion breathtaking;
together, they stand with Proulx's best work. John Updike included
``The Half-Skinned Steer'' in Houghton Mifflin's recent ``Best
American Short Stories of the Century,'' and ``Brokeback
Mountain,'' which broke a lot of hearts when first published in The
New Yorker, has already been anthologized as well. I'm always
startled by the relentless cruelty in Proulx's fiction, though I'm
not sure why; certainly there's nothing coy about the way she
introduces her version of the truth. It's probably a matter of
timing: We know from the outset (hell, from the title) that ``The
Half-Skinned Steer'' is going to be a terrible thing to behold, but
two readings of it had me still unprepared for the shiver-inducing
ending. ``People in Hell Just Want a Drink of Water'' warns you
with its opening line _ ``You stand there, braced.'' And yet this
story about two families pushed to the brink by trouble and
bad-tempered weather is as tension-packed as summer thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the ferocious impact of Proulx's writing comes from her
precision of form, as free-fall confident as a jazz saxophonist.
``The Mud Below,'' which beautifully captures the lure and agony of
riding bulls, has the nerve to deliver what is essentially a
30-page riff _ all in the name of telling us about the slump
Diamond Felts got himself into on the rodeo circuit. Such moments
are dazzling without being showy, and they bestow a special
pleasure to the reading of ``Close Range,'' for behind every tall
tale or killer story, there's an homage to the language that
encompasses it. The method is one of stripped-down poetry, hard
meter without a wasted word. Here's a guy hitching a ride into the
Big Horn Mountains just before dawn: ``the big car slingshot at the
black hump of range, dazzle of morning an hour behind the rim, not
a dozen words exchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Love is a harsh but necessary commodity in ``Close Range,'' no
more trustworthy than Wyoming weather and about as likely to take
you down as to bless your day. The women are hard and resigned,
like Mrs. Freeze, the bourbon-sipping ranch forewoman in ``Pair a
Spurs,'' or sometimes just half-wild from fighting life, like the
barstool queen of ``A Lonely Coast.'' The men tend toward sinew and
silence, though not of the introspective sort _ living among the
seasons of birth and death, there's just not all that much to say.
But psychological revelation is not what one looks for in ``Close
Range''; it's instead a roughshod testament to the land, an account
of the human bedlam that goes on beneath that frighteningly
infinite sky. Such elemental stakes tend to make you mean or give
you a fine sense of humor; Proulx's fiction manages some of both.
In ``The Bunchgrass Edge of the World,'' an old tractor proves to
be smarter than any of its mortal owners; in ``Pair a Spurs,'' it's
a pair of hand-tooled silver riding spurs that ultimately calls the
shots. As in Proulx's most recent novel, ``Accordion Crimes,'' here
the object becomes the symbolic link among love and death and
serendipity, somehow finding a connecting design within the
day-to-day chaos of getting through.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a friendly book. It's full of broken bones, seething
grudges, and unexpected deaths, and it's about as sentimental
toward the West as a broken whiskey bottle on a Saturday night. The
Wyoming of the past two decades has seen the influx of millionaire
cowboys, ecofreaks, survivalists, and land-use outrages, all of
which Proulx attends to with splendid irony. If her Car Scropes,
the antagonist of ``Pair a Spurs,'' is a comic nod to Faulkner's
famously awful Snopeses, two brief stories _ ``The Blood Bay'' and
``55 Miles to the Gas Pump'' _ are blackly funny evidence of the
lunacy the West can spawn. But the gorgeously painful ``Brokeback
Mountain,'' about the decades-long love between two range riders,
does some of the best things a story can do. It abolishes the old
West cliches, excavates and honors a certain kind of elusive life,
then nearly levels you with the emotional weight at its center. It
may be 400 miles of forever between Cody and Cheyenne, but Annie
Proulx has driven it alone and unafraid.

 DOES YOUR CHILD HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM?

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (The following is a sample column by Dr. T. Berry Brazelton,
America's favorite baby doctor and longtime columnist for The New
York Times Syndicate. Dr. B.'s Q&AMP;As and essays are a magnet for

 &UR; By T. BERRY BRAZELTON, M.D. &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Parents often worry about whether or not their baby's hearing is
normal. There is certainly reason for concern. Lack of hearing can
greatly interfere with an infant's development.
</P>
<P>
   Profoundly deaf babies are slowed down in all areas. They are
likely to appear depressed and unreactive _ slow to develop motor
skills and to reward parents' attempts at interaction. They may lie
in their cribs passively, or they may develop autisms _ such as
head rolling or other repetitive behaviors _ as if to fill up empty
space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their other senses, such as sight and touch,
become heightened. This can make a baby hypersensitive and easily
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways to test the hearing of a baby. I
find it is best to do it when she is asleep or as she is just
rousing. I use a soft rattle and a bell, in a quiet room. After
several startles, a baby with normal hearing will shut out or
ignore either of these sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet room is one of the keys to this assessment. If I test a
baby in a noisy environment, she may have already shut out auditory
input. Then she can appear to be deaf, even though she's not. The
reason for the two stimuli is to test the range of her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another test would be to give the baby a chance to respond to my
voice when she's awake and looking at the ceiling. If she quiets
and slowly turns to my voice, I know that she hears me. If her
mother and I compete on either side of her, she should choose the
higher-pitched female voice.
</P>
<P>
   If there is concern about a baby's hearing, the primary
physician usually refers the child to an otolaryngologist (ear and
throat specialist), who can examine the ears and upper respiratory
tract. If the cause is a temporary condition, the otolaryngologist
will provide treatment. If the hearing loss seems permanent, the
child may be referred to an audiologist who can perform further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tests, such as auditory evoked responses (AER), can detect major
hearing impairment in babies _ before it interferes seriously with
the child's development. If there is any indication that a baby is
not hearing or hears in certain ranges but not in all, I'd suggest
a complete evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss may become more obvious in the second year, as a
child who is beginning to speak garbles words in a regular fashion.
I would always be aware of hearing impairment as a possibility in a
child who is not developing properly, particularly in areas of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Otitis media (infection of the middle ear) can threaten a
child's hearing. Many infants develop a tendency to chronic otitis
media. After an acute earache, the pressure and the discharge seem
to linger despite antibiotics. Otitis media is sometimes called
glue ear _ as if the ear contained glue that was hard to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic infection of the middle ear can cause hearing
impairment. Infants in group care or infants with older siblings in
school who are exposed to many different infections are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ear infections may follow colds as often as every two weeks.
Each ear infection becomes more difficult to treat. Parents and
physicians get discouraged. The baby's general condition is often
affected; she seems to become rundown and vulnerable to everything.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, an ear and throat specialist should be consulted.
It may be necessary to use tubes in the child's eardrums. They
allow drainage, reduce pressure in the inner ear and prevent
hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Following the development of speech and other forms of
communication is the most important way of determining whether
there is hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   With an older child, if you are concerned about hearing, try
whispering in one ear or the other. Be sure to whisper something to
which you know she will want to respond, since there are many
periods in a child's development when ``selective attention'' can
be operating. Whisper a welcome question, such as, ``Do you want to
go to town with me?'' or ``Do you want a cookie?''
</P>
<P>
   In my office, I put my finger in one of the child's ears and
whisper in the other, ``Do you want a lollipop?'' This is almost
sure to get a response. If there are no responses and/or speech is
developing inappropriately, I refer the child for evaluation by an
otolaryngologist or testing by an audiologist.
</P>
<P>

from readers. Questions or comments should be addressed to Dr. T.
Berry Brazelton, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Dr. Brazelton regrets

<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very friendly and enjoys
playing with other kids, but she has no friends. She calls kids on
the phone, but they don't call back. She has had classmates come
over to our house, but no one invites her to theirs. She is in
extracurricular activities such as Girl Scouts and dancing class,
but she does not see anyone after these activities are over.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't complain, but I know she longs for a playmate and
friend. Any suggestions? _ L.K., Leesburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Maybe this is revealing something about your
daughter that you don't see yourself. If you could understand why
other children aren't attracted to her, you would be better able to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   When other children can't or won't relate to a child, that child
may have a deeper problem. For example, your daughter may bully
other children or try to control them because she feels insecure
herself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I would take this situation seriously. Consult her
teachers or a psychologist who can evaluate her. Meanwhile, try to
find your daughter a child who is like her in temperament. Woo the
other child by taking them to a museum or a movie. Try to get them
together regularly for something they can enjoy. If your daughter
can make one friend, it will be easier for the two of them to enter
a peer group _ together.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a single mom of a 2-year-old son. He was 4 months
old when I left my husband and moved from Arizona to Tennessee so
that my parents could help me raise him. My ex-husband never
contacts us anymore, and I have no idea where he is living now.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I will soon be moving back to Arizona. I have always
been open with him about his daddy, telling him, ``Every child has
a mommy and a daddy; yours just lives in another state.'' But when
he gets older and starts to understand more, how do I explain to
him that his dad just couldn't handle the responsibility of raising
a child? I don't want him to think he is the reason he has no daddy
_ or blame me! _ No Name, Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: You may never be able to explain it
satisfactorily to him. A child will always long for the other
parent. He is likely to blame himself (and you) for losing his
father: ``If I were a better boy, he would have never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   You need to be ready to repeatedly reassure him that his
father's abandonment had nothing to do with him. Tell him that you
and his dad couldn't make it together. You need to assume the blame
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   You should also assure him that you will never leave him. A
child without one parent always fears the loss of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Is it necessary for you to leave your supportive family now?
Being a single parent can certainly be difficult, and it may be
hard for your son to be without an extended family or close friends
as cushions when stressful times hit.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very loud when she eats or
drinks. The sound she makes is like a moaning/heavy breathing. It's
nearly impossible to get through a meal without telling her to
quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   Should I ignore this and hope she grows out of it, or keep
reminding her about it so she doesn't embarrass herself at social
functions? Could this be a health problem? _ R.T., Clinton
Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: I am not familiar with a physical reason for her
heavy breathing at mealtimes, but I suggest that you consult her
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no physical reason for the breathing, she may be
trying to get a response out of you. If this is the case, ignoring
it is the best way to diminish it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to let her know that others may find the heavy
breathing socially unacceptable, say that once _ and then shut up.
More pressure from you may just cause her to repeat it.

   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very friendly and enjoys
playing with other kids, but she has no friends. She calls kids on
the phone, but they don't call back. She has had classmates come
over to our house, but no one invites her to theirs. She is in
extracurricular activities such as Girl Scouts and dancing class,
but she does not see anyone after these activities are over.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't complain, but I know she longs for a playmate and
friend. Any suggestions? _ L.K., Leesburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Maybe this is revealing something about your
daughter that you don't see yourself. If you could understand why
other children aren't attracted to her, you would be better able to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   When other children can't or won't relate to a child, that child
may have a deeper problem. For example, your daughter may bully
other children or try to control them because she feels insecure
herself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I would take this situation seriously. Consult her
teachers or a psychologist who can evaluate her. Meanwhile, try to
find your daughter a child who is like her in temperament. Woo the
other child by taking them to a museum or a movie. Try to get them
together regularly for something they can enjoy. If your daughter
can make one friend, it will be easier for the two of them to enter
a peer group _ together.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a single mom of a 2-year-old son. He was 4 months
old when I left my husband and moved from Arizona to Tennessee so
that my parents could help me raise him. My ex-husband never
contacts us anymore, and I have no idea where he is living now.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I will soon be moving back to Arizona. I have always
been open with him about his daddy, telling him, ``Every child has
a mommy and a daddy; yours just lives in another state.'' But when
he gets older and starts to understand more, how do I explain to
him that his dad just couldn't handle the responsibility of raising
a child? I don't want him to think he is the reason he has no daddy
_ or blame me! _ No Name, Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: You may never be able to explain it
satisfactorily to him. A child will always long for the other
parent. He is likely to blame himself (and you) for losing his
father: ``If I were a better boy, he would have never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   You need to be ready to repeatedly reassure him that his
father's abandonment had nothing to do with him. Tell him that you
and his dad couldn't make it together. You need to assume the blame
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   You should also assure him that you will never leave him. A
child without one parent always fears the loss of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Is it necessary for you to leave your supportive family now?

BATTLE LINES FORM OVER SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA AND TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Legislature this week begins
debating a bill to deny legal recognition to same-sex marriages,
taking on an issue that has opened a new battle front between gay
activists and religious conservatives across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, advocates on both sides, including Christian, Jewish,
and Muslim leaders, will converge on Beacon Hill for a State House
hearing on the state's Defense of Marriage Act.
</P>
<P>
   For a large coalition of religious leaders, the bill, which in
its first draft excluded same-sex marriages from official
recognition in Massachusetts, will firmly define the act of
marriage in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The current version states that the state will recognize
marriages only between men and women. Governor Paul Cellucci has
publicly voiced his opposition to gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be religious groups all standing up and saying the
same thing _ that the Commonwealth should hold the definition of
marriage as a union of a man and woman,'' said Matt Daniels,
president of the conservative Massachusetts Family Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels has organized religious leaders who will hold a news
conference hours before what is expected to be an intense
legislative hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are speaking for what we believe the biblical view of
marriage is, and that's between a man and a woman,'' said the Rev.
Ray Hammond, pastor of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal
Church in Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., is scheduled to
join religious leaders in declaring support for the bill, Daniels
said.
</P>
<P>
   For gays and lesbians, the right to marriage has emerged as a
critical gauge of whether they will be treated as equals in
American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue, more than any other in the gay community, is one
that is not political, but comes from our hearts,'' said Denise
Fetonte, a member of the Pride Interfaith Coalition, a Boston-based
advocacy group for gays and lesbians of faith. ``Many of us want to
have the rights and responsibilities of a recognized marriage as an
expression of our love and commitment. I've been married to the
same person for 26 years in every way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of gay marriages say recognizing them threatens
the very foundation of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage is intended by nature and we believe by God to be
between a man and a woman in a monogamous relationship which is
open to new life, which means, of course, children,'' said John
Walsh, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.
``It has nothing to do with oppression of people. It's just we
believe that is what is best for society.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the leaders of the four Catholic dioceses in
Massachusetts _ possibly Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston _ is
expected to speak in favor of the bill, according to Jerry
D'Avolio, executive director of the Massachusetts Catholic
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The bill filed last December by State Representative John H.
Rogers, a Democrat, was never intended to oppose gay rights, but to
strengthen the state statute on marriage, said Jeff Mahoney, a
spokesman for Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the initial draft, which was later amended, stated: ``A
purported marriage contracted between persons of the same sex shall
be neither valid nor recognized in the Commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The language of the bill was a mistake,'' Mahoney said. ``But
it was never intended to offend anyone. . . . Some people have
tried to make it an anti-gay marriage bill but we are trying to
define marriage and trying to make it a positive piece instead of
prohibitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists, however, say despite the change in wording, the
essence of the bill remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill is clearly about divisiveness, intending to divide
people, because there is no need for it since gay marriages are not
legal in any state,'' said Jeremy Pittman, chairman of the Lesbian
and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of gay marriages broke into the spotlight three years
ago after the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that barring homosexuals
from receiving marriage licenses was unconstitutional sex
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The decision unleashed a backlash from conservative forces,
particularly religious groups, who base their opposition to gay
marriages, in part, on biblical passages they say describe
homosexuality as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Christian groups were key to helping win the
passage of a national Defense of Marriage Act in Congress in 1996.
The bill, signed by President Clinton, denies federal recognition
to gay marriages and permits states to ignore the union of gay
couples married in other states.
</P>
<P>
   So far 29 states have passed laws banning homosexual marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In response, gay and lesbian advocates, legal advocates, and
religious advocates have launched the Freedom to Marry Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, nearly 200 clergy and religious activists have
signed a declaration supporting the right of gays to marry. These
clergy and activists say they are driven by their biblically rooted
belief in social justice and human dignity.

 DOES YOUR CHILD HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM?

</P>
<P>
   Parents often worry about whether or not their baby's hearing is
normal. There is certainly reason for concern. Lack of hearing can
greatly interfere with an infant's development.
</P>
<P>
   Profoundly deaf babies are slowed down in all areas. They are
likely to appear depressed and unreactive _ slow to develop motor
skills and to reward parents' attempts at interaction. They may lie
in their cribs passively, or they may develop autisms _ such as
head rolling or other repetitive behaviors _ as if to fill up empty
space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their other senses, such as sight and touch,
become heightened. This can make a baby hypersensitive and easily
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways to test the hearing of a baby. I
find it is best to do it when she is asleep or as she is just
rousing. I use a soft rattle and a bell, in a quiet room. After
several startles, a baby with normal hearing will shut out or
ignore either of these sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet room is one of the keys to this assessment. If I test a
baby in a noisy environment, she may have already shut out auditory
input. Then she can appear to be deaf, even though she's not. The
reason for the two stimuli is to test the range of her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another test would be to give the baby a chance to respond to my
voice when she's awake and looking at the ceiling. If she quiets
and slowly turns to my voice, I know that she hears me. If her
mother and I compete on either side of her, she should choose the
higher-pitched female voice.
</P>
<P>
   If there is concern about a baby's hearing, the primary
physician usually refers the child to an otolaryngologist (ear and
throat specialist), who can examine the ears and upper respiratory
tract. If the cause is a temporary condition, the otolaryngologist
will provide treatment. If the hearing loss seems permanent, the
child may be referred to an audiologist who can perform further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tests, such as auditory evoked responses (AER), can detect major
hearing impairment in babies _ before it interferes seriously with
the child's development. If there is any indication that a baby is
not hearing or hears in certain ranges but not in all, I'd suggest
a complete evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss may become more obvious in the second year, as a
child who is beginning to speak garbles words in a regular fashion.
I would always be aware of hearing impairment as a possibility in a
child who is not developing properly, particularly in areas of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Otitis media (infection of the middle ear) can threaten a
child's hearing. Many infants develop a tendency to chronic otitis
media. After an acute earache, the pressure and the discharge seem
to linger despite antibiotics. Otitis media is sometimes called
glue ear _ as if the ear contained glue that was hard to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic infection of the middle ear can cause hearing
impairment. Infants in group care or infants with older siblings in
school who are exposed to many different infections are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ear infections may follow colds as often as every two weeks.
Each ear infection becomes more difficult to treat. Parents and
physicians get discouraged. The baby's general condition is often
affected; she seems to become rundown and vulnerable to everything.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, an ear and throat specialist should be consulted.
It may be necessary to use tubes in the child's eardrums. They
allow drainage, reduce pressure in the inner ear and prevent
hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Following the development of speech and other forms of
communication is the most important way of determining whether
there is hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   With an older child, if you are concerned about hearing, try
whispering in one ear or the other. Be sure to whisper something to
which you know she will want to respond, since there are many
periods in a child's development when ``selective attention'' can
be operating. Whisper a welcome question, such as, ``Do you want to
go to town with me?'' or ``Do you want a cookie?''
</P>
<P>
   In my office, I put my finger in one of the child's ears and
whisper in the other, ``Do you want a lollipop?'' This is almost
sure to get a response. If there are no responses and/or speech is
developing inappropriately, I refer the child for evaluation by an
otolaryngologist or testing by an audiologist.

   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very friendly and enjoys
playing with other kids, but she has no friends. She calls kids on
the phone, but they don't call back. She has had classmates come
over to our house, but no one invites her to theirs. She is in
extracurricular activities such as Girl Scouts and dancing class,
but she does not see anyone after these activities are over.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't complain, but I know she longs for a playmate and
friend. Any suggestions? _ L.K., Leesburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Maybe this is revealing something about your
daughter that you don't see yourself. If you could understand why
other children aren't attracted to her, you would be better able to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   When other children can't or won't relate to a child, that child
may have a deeper problem. For example, your daughter may bully
other children or try to control them because she feels insecure
herself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I would take this situation seriously. Consult her
teachers or a psychologist who can evaluate her. Meanwhile, try to
find your daughter a child who is like her in temperament. Woo the
other child by taking them to a museum or a movie. Try to get them
together regularly for something they can enjoy. If your daughter
can make one friend, it will be easier for the two of them to enter
a peer group _ together.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a single mom of a 2-year-old son. He was 4 months
old when I left my husband and moved from Arizona to Tennessee so
that my parents could help me raise him. My ex-husband never
contacts us anymore, and I have no idea where he is living now.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I will soon be moving back to Arizona. I have always
been open with him about his daddy, telling him, ``Every child has
a mommy and a daddy; yours just lives in another state.'' But when
he gets older and starts to understand more, how do I explain to
him that his dad just couldn't handle the responsibility of raising
a child? I don't want him to think he is the reason he has no daddy
_ or blame me! _ No Name, Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: You may never be able to explain it
satisfactorily to him. A child will always long for the other
parent. He is likely to blame himself (and you) for losing his
father: ``If I were a better boy, he would have never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   You need to be ready to repeatedly reassure him that his
father's abandonment had nothing to do with him. Tell him that you
and his dad couldn't make it together. You need to assume the blame
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   You should also assure him that you will never leave him. A
child without one parent always fears the loss of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Is it necessary for you to leave your supportive family now?
Being a single parent can certainly be difficult, and it may be
hard for your son to be without an extended family or close friends
as cushions when stressful times hit.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very loud when she eats or
drinks. The sound she makes is like a moaning/heavy breathing. It's
nearly impossible to get through a meal without telling her to
quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   Should I ignore this and hope she grows out of it, or keep
reminding her about it so she doesn't embarrass herself at social
functions? Could this be a health problem? _ R.T., Clinton
Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: I am not familiar with a physical reason for her
heavy breathing at mealtimes, but I suggest that you consult her
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no physical reason for the breathing, she may be
trying to get a response out of you. If this is the case, ignoring
it is the best way to diminish it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to let her know that others may find the heavy
breathing socially unacceptable, say that once _ and then shut up.
More pressure from you may just cause her to repeat it.

 DOES YOUR CHILD HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM?

   &UR; (The following is a sample column by Dr. T. Berry Brazelton,
America's favorite baby doctor and longtime columnist for The New
York Times Syndicate. Dr. B.'s Q&AMP;As and essays are a magnet for

</P>
<P>
   Parents often worry about whether or not their baby's hearing is
normal. There is certainly reason for concern. Lack of hearing can
greatly interfere with an infant's development.
</P>
<P>
   Profoundly deaf babies are slowed down in all areas. They are
likely to appear depressed and unreactive _ slow to develop motor
skills and to reward parents' attempts at interaction. They may lie
in their cribs passively, or they may develop autisms _ such as
head rolling or other repetitive behaviors _ as if to fill up empty
space.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their other senses, such as sight and touch,
become heightened. This can make a baby hypersensitive and easily
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are ways to test the hearing of a baby. I
find it is best to do it when she is asleep or as she is just
rousing. I use a soft rattle and a bell, in a quiet room. After
several startles, a baby with normal hearing will shut out or
ignore either of these sounds.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet room is one of the keys to this assessment. If I test a
baby in a noisy environment, she may have already shut out auditory
input. Then she can appear to be deaf, even though she's not. The
reason for the two stimuli is to test the range of her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Another test would be to give the baby a chance to respond to my
voice when she's awake and looking at the ceiling. If she quiets
and slowly turns to my voice, I know that she hears me. If her
mother and I compete on either side of her, she should choose the
higher-pitched female voice.
</P>
<P>
   If there is concern about a baby's hearing, the primary
physician usually refers the child to an otolaryngologist (ear and
throat specialist), who can examine the ears and upper respiratory
tract. If the cause is a temporary condition, the otolaryngologist
will provide treatment. If the hearing loss seems permanent, the
child may be referred to an audiologist who can perform further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Tests, such as auditory evoked responses (AER), can detect major
hearing impairment in babies _ before it interferes seriously with
the child's development. If there is any indication that a baby is
not hearing or hears in certain ranges but not in all, I'd suggest
a complete evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss may become more obvious in the second year, as a
child who is beginning to speak garbles words in a regular fashion.
I would always be aware of hearing impairment as a possibility in a
child who is not developing properly, particularly in areas of
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Otitis media (infection of the middle ear) can threaten a
child's hearing. Many infants develop a tendency to chronic otitis
media. After an acute earache, the pressure and the discharge seem
to linger despite antibiotics. Otitis media is sometimes called
glue ear _ as if the ear contained glue that was hard to mobilize.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic infection of the middle ear can cause hearing
impairment. Infants in group care or infants with older siblings in
school who are exposed to many different infections are
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ear infections may follow colds as often as every two weeks.
Each ear infection becomes more difficult to treat. Parents and
physicians get discouraged. The baby's general condition is often
affected; she seems to become rundown and vulnerable to everything.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, an ear and throat specialist should be consulted.
It may be necessary to use tubes in the child's eardrums. They
allow drainage, reduce pressure in the inner ear and prevent
hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Following the development of speech and other forms of
communication is the most important way of determining whether
there is hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   With an older child, if you are concerned about hearing, try
whispering in one ear or the other. Be sure to whisper something to
which you know she will want to respond, since there are many
periods in a child's development when ``selective attention'' can
be operating. Whisper a welcome question, such as, ``Do you want to
go to town with me?'' or ``Do you want a cookie?''
</P>
<P>
   In my office, I put my finger in one of the child's ears and
whisper in the other, ``Do you want a lollipop?'' This is almost
sure to get a response. If there are no responses and/or speech is
developing inappropriately, I refer the child for evaluation by an
otolaryngologist or testing by an audiologist.

   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very friendly and enjoys
playing with other kids, but she has no friends. She calls kids on
the phone, but they don't call back. She has had classmates come
over to our house, but no one invites her to theirs. She is in
extracurricular activities such as Girl Scouts and dancing class,
but she does not see anyone after these activities are over.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't complain, but I know she longs for a playmate and
friend. Any suggestions? _ L.K., Leesburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Maybe this is revealing something about your
daughter that you don't see yourself. If you could understand why
other children aren't attracted to her, you would be better able to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   When other children can't or won't relate to a child, that child
may have a deeper problem. For example, your daughter may bully
other children or try to control them because she feels insecure
herself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I would take this situation seriously. Consult her
teachers or a psychologist who can evaluate her. Meanwhile, try to
find your daughter a child who is like her in temperament. Woo the
other child by taking them to a museum or a movie. Try to get them
together regularly for something they can enjoy. If your daughter
can make one friend, it will be easier for the two of them to enter
a peer group _ together.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a single mom of a 2-year-old son. He was 4 months
old when I left my husband and moved from Arizona to Tennessee so
that my parents could help me raise him. My ex-husband never
contacts us anymore, and I have no idea where he is living now.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I will soon be moving back to Arizona. I have always
been open with him about his daddy, telling him, ``Every child has
a mommy and a daddy; yours just lives in another state.'' But when
he gets older and starts to understand more, how do I explain to
him that his dad just couldn't handle the responsibility of raising
a child? I don't want him to think he is the reason he has no daddy
_ or blame me! _ No Name, Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: You may never be able to explain it
satisfactorily to him. A child will always long for the other
parent. He is likely to blame himself (and you) for losing his
father: ``If I were a better boy, he would have never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   You need to be ready to repeatedly reassure him that his
father's abandonment had nothing to do with him. Tell him that you
and his dad couldn't make it together. You need to assume the blame
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   You should also assure him that you will never leave him. A
child without one parent always fears the loss of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Is it necessary for you to leave your supportive family now?
Being a single parent can certainly be difficult, and it may be
hard for your son to be without an extended family or close friends
as cushions when stressful times hit.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very loud when she eats or
drinks. The sound she makes is like a moaning/heavy breathing. It's
nearly impossible to get through a meal without telling her to
quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   Should I ignore this and hope she grows out of it, or keep
reminding her about it so she doesn't embarrass herself at social
functions? Could this be a health problem? _ R.T., Clinton
Township, Mich.

   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very friendly and enjoys
playing with other kids, but she has no friends. She calls kids on
the phone, but they don't call back. She has had classmates come
over to our house, but no one invites her to theirs. She is in
extracurricular activities such as Girl Scouts and dancing class,
but she does not see anyone after these activities are over.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't complain, but I know she longs for a playmate and
friend. Any suggestions? _ L.K., Leesburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: Maybe this is revealing something about your
daughter that you don't see yourself. If you could understand why
other children aren't attracted to her, you would be better able to
help her.
</P>
<P>
   When other children can't or won't relate to a child, that child
may have a deeper problem. For example, your daughter may bully
other children or try to control them because she feels insecure
herself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, I would take this situation seriously. Consult her
teachers or a psychologist who can evaluate her. Meanwhile, try to
find your daughter a child who is like her in temperament. Woo the
other child by taking them to a museum or a movie. Try to get them
together regularly for something they can enjoy. If your daughter
can make one friend, it will be easier for the two of them to enter
a peer group _ together.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a single mom of a 2-year-old son. He was 4 months
old when I left my husband and moved from Arizona to Tennessee so
that my parents could help me raise him. My ex-husband never
contacts us anymore, and I have no idea where he is living now.
</P>
<P>
   My son and I will soon be moving back to Arizona. I have always
been open with him about his daddy, telling him, ``Every child has
a mommy and a daddy; yours just lives in another state.'' But when
he gets older and starts to understand more, how do I explain to
him that his dad just couldn't handle the responsibility of raising
a child? I don't want him to think he is the reason he has no daddy
_ or blame me! _ No Name, Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: You may never be able to explain it
satisfactorily to him. A child will always long for the other
parent. He is likely to blame himself (and you) for losing his
father: ``If I were a better boy, he would have never left me.''
</P>
<P>
   You need to be ready to repeatedly reassure him that his
father's abandonment had nothing to do with him. Tell him that you
and his dad couldn't make it together. You need to assume the blame
to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   You should also assure him that you will never leave him. A
child without one parent always fears the loss of the other.
</P>
<P>
   Is it necessary for you to leave your supportive family now?
Being a single parent can certainly be difficult, and it may be
hard for your son to be without an extended family or close friends
as cushions when stressful times hit.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old daughter is very loud when she eats or
drinks. The sound she makes is like a moaning/heavy breathing. It's
nearly impossible to get through a meal without telling her to
quiet down.
</P>
<P>
   Should I ignore this and hope she grows out of it, or keep
reminding her about it so she doesn't embarrass herself at social
functions? Could this be a health problem? _ R.T., Clinton
Township, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. BRAZELTON: I am not familiar with a physical reason for her
heavy breathing at mealtimes, but I suggest that you consult her
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no physical reason for the breathing, she may be
trying to get a response out of you. If this is the case, ignoring
it is the best way to diminish it.
</P>

breathing socially unacceptable, say that once _ and then shut up.

RUBIN'S LEGACY: A PROSPERITY NOT SEEN SINCE THE '60S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- On his way out of town, Robert Rubin is
performing one final public service. That would be a blunt reminder
of the fundamental place of the economy in our political life.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the outgoing treasury secretary and leader of
President Clinton's economic policy team wouldn't know how to
approach an issue as a partisan. But his huge accomplishments are
the main reason the president was reelected and maintained a
powerful position through last year's impeachment madness.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with as carefully planned and nurtured a succession as
has ever been seen around here, that lesson is being transmitted
forward.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but notice that some of Vice President Gore's
closest associates began sending signals almost immediately that
designated replacement Larry Summers would most definitely be a
strong candidate for treasury secretary should there be a Gore
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The relevant fact is not Summer's frequent, if private, role of
late as the person advising Gore on economic matters. Rather, it
was a rare example of what Gore's campaign insists is its top
priority _ maintaining and broadening the decade's astonishing
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's handling of Rubin's departure and Summer's
ascension, and even Summer's replacement as No. 2 by the competent
and experienced Stuart Eizenstat, reeked of continuity politics.
</P>
<P>
   The moves had been in the works for more than two years. And it
was no mere Clinton operation; the only person as firmly convinced
as the president and Rubin that the 45-year-old Summers is ready
for the responsibility is Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was also instructive. When Rubin told Clinton more
than two weeks ago that the moment had come, the remaining flash
point on the fragile international finance scene (Brazil) had
calmed. At last, from Rubin's perspective, there was nothing left
that could be called pressing, much less crisis material.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of complete continuity in policy is everything to
Clinton and Gore. The hand Gore is fated to play with is a strong
one, certainly better than what George Bush was playing with at
this point in 1987, and a far cry from the mess Richard Nixon
wrestled with in 1959. At the margins, it is probably made a bit
stronger by the fact that there's no denying Gore's role at the
apex of decision making in the Clinton government.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, history doesn't enshrine the economy as the sole
force in presidential politics. And you can just as obviously find
numerous wishful but serious thinkers close to Bill Bradley and the
Republican candidates who have theories why economics won't matter
next year.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is a fact that since World War I, the question of
whether the ``in'' party holds the White House has been answered in
the affirmative whenever people's incomes after inflation are
rising at least moderately and they have confidence in the future.
Other variables come and go, but those have been constant.
</P>
<P>
   The point is especially important as the 2000 election looms
because what the government did that mattered greatly in the 1990s
will also matter greatly in the next decade. When Clinton took his
oath in 1993, he had already veered sharply from what most people
heard during his campaign _ talk of using federal spending and a
tax cut for the middle class to jump-start a stagnant economy.
</P>
<P>
   When he took office, the tax cut was missing and the so-called
stimulus was a puny $16 billion, and Bob Dole beat him fair and
square on that with a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   In their place was an assault on the budget deficit, then
totally out of control and set to hit close to $300 billion that
year. The program was pushed not only by Rubin on his way to
setting up the new National Economic Council, but by incoming
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The argument was that a gradual return to fiscal sanity would
not be conservative, but stimulative. By not borrowing hundreds of
billions of dollars from private savings, those immense sums would
be available for productive investment in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   And there would be a double stimulus because a return to sanity
would cut more than enough off long-term interest rates to give an
extra boost to corporate and home-buying borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, and its dividend can be seen in 1996s electoral
college numbers. But the basic idea is also central to the future _
zealously guarding budget surpluses, paying down the huge national
debt, and leading the world toward greater growth, depoliticized
currencies, and sensible financial practices.
</P>
<P>
   Continuity may sound boring. But when it means sound economic
policies that have contributed to prosperity not seen since the
'60s, it is the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't hurt Al Gore to repeat some version of that mantra
every day for the rest of his quest.

WEDDINGS ARE MORE COMPLICATED THE SECOND TIME AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You're madly in love. You're going to marry.
Anew. Time to get the rings, the dress, a tux, the hall, a cake. Or
not.
</P>
<P>
   If this is your second time around the dance floor, ladies and
gentlemen, relish your freedom. This time, you're the boss. Stuffed
your size 8 frame into your mother's teensy lace dress last time?
Don shorts and hit the beach. Ran to a Justice of the Peace at 18
and missed the party? This could be your big blowout.
</P>
<P>
   But being older, wiser and possibly better funded won't wipe out
complications. Yes, Cupid has struck. Yes, you feel young again.
But you're not a kid anymore. You have kids.
</P>
<P>
   And kids top the list of concerns for folks who remarry. When
Beth Reed Ramirez of Anaheim, Calif., remarried, she said, ``We had
to pick a day when we knew my ex-husband couldn't mess it up by not
delivering my daughter on time. It's amazing the games people do
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents who remarry should get their children involved, said the
Rev. Roger Coleman of Kansas City, Mo. He designed a Family
Medallion and special ceremony integrating children in the
remarriage. He first used the full ceremony and medallion for
athlete Bo Jackson's wedding in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 10,000 couples a year use Coleman's charm,
which has three connected circles at the end of a silver chain, a
symbol of two families merging to create a third.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman got the idea while performing courthouse ceremonies in
the early 1980s. ``I was stunned. I had more children than adults
at my weddings. I'd see the kids having all of this acting-out
behavior. They couldn't behave themselves for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It began to dawn on me: They came thinking something important
was going to happen, but nothing I did acknowledged them at all. I
was seeing confusion, anger and a feeling of not being part of
something. So I developed a little medallion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to hand them out to the kids and I got a whole
different type of behavior,'' he added. ``And the guests acted
differently. They would come up and start hugging the kids
afterwards. It became a tremendous bonding experience. It
incorporated the realities that many people find themselves living
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Some church leaders accused Coleman, a member of the Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ), of promoting divorce. (Not all
religions take kindly to remarriage. The Catholic Church stopped
excommunicating divorced and remarried members in 1977, although a
divorced Catholic must receive an annulment to remarry in the
church or to receive Holy Communion.)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the medallion is most popular among Catholics,
Coleman said. ``Once you start focusing on children, you don't have
room to really condemn the past as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarriage also prompted Beth Reed Ramirez to forge a new path.
Engaged a second time, Ramirez, now 40, scooped up an armful of
bridal magazines at the grocery store. They didn't help. She was
not 24. She was not a size 6. The magazines ``were 500 pages long.
I would tear out about 10 pages that I could use.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's special needs _ stepparenting, prenuptial agreements,
merging two households _ weren't addressed. Frustrated, she created
her own site on the World Wide Web. Last month, she launched Bride
Again: The Only Magazine Designed for Encore Brides, a quarterly
magazine that sells for $4.99 in grocery and bookstores. The only
national magazine dedicated to encore brides, Bride Again is
designed for female readers ages 30 to 45, with a median household
income of $47,474 and a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sizable market. Of the 2.4 million people who marry each
year in the United States, more than 1.1 million are remarrying.
``People are saying, `I can't believe someone hasn't done something
like this before,' Ramirez said. Or: ```I'm 45 and I'm not going to
wear puff sleeves. My parents aren't going to put out the
announcement or pay for the wedding.'''
</P>
<P>
   Encore brides and grooms are no longer second-class citizens,
Ramirez said. These days, divorcees do don white. A quiet City Hall
ceremony is no longer de rigueur.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like `This is a celebration! I've been through so
much with my first marriage or as a single mom. And now, by golly,
I'm gonna have it right!''' said Ramirez, who remarried three years
ago. ``You come with 15, 20 years more experience. You're happy
that you've got another chance and life is good again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bride Again offers tips on etiquette, dress, prenuptial
agreements, stepfamilies and ``his, hers or our house?''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez may have some male readers. Grooms get more involved the
second time around, she said. Her husband, Kelly Ramirez, chose the
location (the 18th hole at Mission Hills Country Club in Palm
Springs), the menu and the band. She picked the honeymoon spot (the
Fiji Islands).
</P>
<P>
   Theme weddings and theme showers are more popular for repeaters,
Finally, a word on rings: When it comes to jewelry, most couples
pick the opposite of what they had the first time, said Kelly
Lindbom, manager of Glennpeter Jewelers in Latham, N.Y. ``They want
something different. If they had a marquise cut, now they want a
round. If they had a solitaire, now they want something with side
stones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been through it all and you're not going to say, `Oh,
whatever you want, honey,''' Lindbom said. ``(Second-timers) get
equal to or better than what first-timers get.''
</P>
<P>
   But never smaller.

DOCTORS SEE LEWIS CASE WITH MIXED VIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As malpractice lawyers publicly batter Dr. Gilbert H.
Mudge, one of Boston's most prominent cardiologists, many
physicians appear to empathize with his plight and say it reflects
the peril of treating a celebrity patient.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether they think Mudge made a mistake in his
treatment of Celtics star Reggie Lewis before his death in 1993 _
and some specialists say privately they believe he did _ doctors
who talked about the case last week said they felt for Mudge and
underscored the vulnerability of even the most competent physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine that many people are saying, `There but for the
grace of God go I,' because these are paths that many of us could
have gone down,'' said Dr. Gregory Curfman, a cardiologist and
deputy editor at the New England Journal of Medicine. As is typical
in Boston's dense and interwined medical community, Curfman said he
is friends with two of the three defendants in the medical
malpractice suit brought by Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, and
had studied under Dr. Roman DeSanctis, a leading cardiologist who
testified about his efforts to caution Mudge about his diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Curfman said ``it's unbelievably'' painful to watch the trial,
which is being covered on television and radio as well as in the
print media. ``I'm certainly glad I'm not on this jury because I
don't know how I'd go about making a decision on this case.
Everyone's waiting to see which way this thing is going to go,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriateness of Mudge's care of Lewis is at the center of
the suit against Mudge and two other physicians, Drs. Peter L.
Friedman and Mark A. Creager, whom Harris-Lewis accuses of failing
to diagnose her husband with a life-threatening heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   When a medical malpractice suit plays out in the public, most
physicians take notice and sympathize, said attorney Dr. Barry
Lang, who specializes in medical malpractice law and was an
orthopedic surgeon in New Bedford for 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any medical malpractice suit chills physicians. No physician
purposely harms people, and Boston is such a visible medical
community. Absolutely no physician wants to see another one sued,''
Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   The empathy stems from the awareness of the potential
humiliation and loss of professional standing that a malpractice
judgment could bring, said Dr. Robert Leach, who was an orthopedic
consultant for the Boston Celtics between 1970 and 1989 and former
head of the US Olympic medical team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's personal worry for the man. There's personal worry for
the profession. I want us to be loved,'' said Leach, editor of the
American Journal of Sports Medicine and professor of orthopedic
surgery at Boston University School of Medicine. Leach said he did
not know Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   As an orthopedic surgeon, Leach said that most of the cases
involving high-profile athletes are not issues of life or death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a professional death, but not an actual death,''
Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   Few doctors were willing to predict an outcome in the Lewis
case: For one thing, few have had access to the complex and
sometimes conflicting documentation of Lewis's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   However, because studies of the electrical function of Lewis's
heart played such a large part in his case, the trial drew a lot of
attention at a meeting in Toronto last week of experts in that
field, said one participant, who has general knowledge of the Lewis
case and who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   He said that attendees at the meeting of the North American
Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology were largely convinced that
Lewis's life-threatening heart condition was so clearly documented
by his initial testing that he should have had a defibrillator
implanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't Reggie Lewis, he would have been treated
appropriately,'' said the electrophysiology specialist. ``If he had
been an accountant, the doctors would have said'' that he needed
the defibrillator, like it or not. But instead, said the
specialist, there was great pressure on physicians caring for Lewis
to find a way of treating him without implanting the device, which
would almost certainly have ended his basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   After Lewis collapsed during a 1993 playoff game, the Celtics
assembled a so-called dream team of about a dozen physicians from
area hospitals at New England Baptist Hospital, where they held a
two-hour meeting to evaluate Lewis. During the malpractice trial,
Celtics physician Arnold Scheller testified that the team of
cardiologists was assembled ``across academic lines, across
hospital lines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to have any politics interfering with medical
decisions, I wanted to get to the bottom of the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Mudge's diagnosis ultimately conflicted with that of the
dream team, Curfman at the New England Journal of Medicine said he
doubted institutional rivalries were the cause. ``I think with
(doctors) of this caliber, the ego thing may come in but they are
also quite capable of moving away from that. These are people who
can put ego in the background and do the right thing,'' Curfman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Without access to the medical records and documents involved in
the case, Dr. David A. Meyerson, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins
Medical Institutions and a spokesman for the American Heart
Association, said that the findings of the dream team and Mudge
could both have been ``partly correct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it would have been difficult for most university
cardiologists to issue an opinion contrary to the 12-member medical
panel that originally evaluated Mr. Lewis,'' said Meyerson.
``Clearly Mr. Lewis and his family had a vested interest in having
him cleared for activity at the highest level of human performance.
Not being privy to Dr. Mudge's data, I cannot honestly say what
kind of decision I would have made,'' Meyerson said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the case sends a message ``that we should remain
conservative until proven otherwise. We must be cautious to use the
same prudent guidelines and practices in evaluating any patient no
matter how famous they may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits like Harris-Lewis's create tremendous pressure on
physicians to make a diagnosis that will allow the athlete to
continue playing, even if the evidence may say otherwise, said a
Boston physician who asked not to be identified. The physician said
that other local doctors said they would rather not become involved
in taking care of a high-profile patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a worst-case scenario. If we were in the present
dilemma, most of us would have tried to avoid it,'' the physician
added.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concern about their reputations, money also
becomes an issue in considering whether to take a high-profile
patient. ``If you are taking care of someone whose future earnings
are such a huge amount, like a professional athlete, a malpractice
suit can ruin your career because you are being sued for so much
money.''

CLASS OF '99 EXPECTS NOTHING BUT THE BEST _ FOREVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The economy is booming, entering its eighth year of expansion.
Jobs are plentiful, unemployment is near its 30 year low and
college graduates _ from philosophy majors to computer scientists _
should have no trouble finding a job.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty rosy picture for the young men and women who are
getting ready for graduation day _ and it is what they have come to
expect. For their lives have not been punctuated with double digit
interest rates, stagflation _ or even rampant inflation. The energy
crisis was something they learned about in history class.
</P>
<P>
   During the two decades this class has been creeping towards
commencement, the nation has experienced some of the best economic
times in its history. There have been only two years (1982 and
1991) in which the economy was in recession.
</P>
<P>
   And that gives the average 22-year-old who a rather skewed _ but
decidedly optimistic _ vision of the world as she or he dons cap
and gown, and marches forward to the strains of Pomp and
Circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Take Christopher Bowler, a 22-year-old senior at Boston College
from St. Louis, who in December was offered and accepted a job with
Lucent Technologies. He starts next month in the financial
leadership development program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the expectation is the jobs are out there and not
finding one would be a big disappointment . . . I see myself
working extremely hard for five years and then I will have a name
in the company so opporunities will be there for me and I will have
a good life the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Richard Leger, head of Boston University's career
counseling office, who has been counseling students since the early
1970s:
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a narrow vision and scope about what they should
expect. Many of them, for example, don't understand the concept of
paying your dues. Because so much has been handed to so many, they
expect to start working as managers without working their way up.
Not everyone fits into that, but there is a certain haughtiness.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that these students don't want to make a contribution
to society, he says. They do. Just on their terms. ``Because they
have grown up in times where there have been virtually no national
crises, so to speak, they have been very entitled and their parents
have taken very good care of them . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Many seniors are so confident about their prospects that they
are simply not looking very hard for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of career services offices are having trouble getting
students in there to do interviews,'' says Camille Luckenbaugh,
employment information manager for the National Association of
Colleges and Employers in Bethlehem, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor market gives them a false sense of security. It is
true that if you are holding a degree that is in demand you will
not have to work as hard as everyone else to find a job. But for
the most part, jobs don't come to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is little _ so far _ to indicate that graduates'
overall sense of optimism is unfounded. While the Class of 1999 may
not face as many job offers as the Class of 1998 did, it will still
be a very good year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salaries are up and the labor market is still great,'' says
Luckenbaugh. ``I am not hearing that history majors are having
trouble finding jobs, but it will not be as phenomenal as last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Those students who are putting off looking for a job, thinking
that the boom market will make it easy, are exibiting a pretty
understandable behavior, says Philip Levendusky, a psychologist and
vice president of network development at McLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' he says, ``if you spent all of your so-called
formative years and early adulthood in a positive economy, your
life expectancy is that it will always be that way. The insulation
and preparation for economic downtimes will be much more difficult
for these folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Levendusky said it is not unusual for mutual funds to adverstise
the age of the fund manager. The message is that if the manager was
working in the field in 1987, he or she would remember stock market
downturns and the recession of 1991. But if they started in 1992 or
later, they do not know what it is like to be in a down economy.
Investors can then make an informed choice about which view they
want to guide their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Because the economy has shifted so much in 20 years _ remember
when people invested in CDs and got double digit returns? _ the
current prestige of high finance and the Internet has visions of
quick killing dancing in the heads of many people, college seniors
included.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel, somewhat, that the guy who works hard and does a
good job, is a sucker,'' says Shiller. Too many, he says, feel
there is a fortune to be made with easy investing. ``In some sense,
(seniors) are ill-equipped because they have very high
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   How high?
</P>
<P>
   Jason Cheney, a 22-year-old Boston College senior from Mobile,
Ala. just started looking for employment. ``I am not worried, he
said. ``The market is doing phenomenally well and there are plenty
of opportunities here in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the 1980s with Reaganomics which was very
prosperous for most people. I see no reason why it should stop. I'm
hoping the jobs will be available when I need one, which is now. I
am not pessimistic at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Because all they know is good economic times, graduates may make
career decisions based on that ``and may not be sensitive to the
vulnerability of career choices made in a down economy,'' says
Levendusky. ``Real estate, for example, is a good thing to be in
now, but go back eight years and it was a terrible time. Graduates
have not seen the other side of the cyclical nature of the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are 40 or older remember the energy crisis and down
cycles in the real estate market. On the other hand, they may not
have the life experience of their parents or grandparents who lived
through the depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Smith, the head of career service counseling at the
University of North Carolina at Charlotte, says that students not
only have optimism, some seniors in sought-after fields such as
computer science negotiate salaries and benefits such as time off
``in a way I have not seen with college graduates in the past, and
I have been here for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A main concern for Smith is the reaction that the students will
have once they enter the job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these students have been made to feel very special
throughout this whole process. They were sought after. And once
they are on board, that is often no longer the case and how will
companies continue to motivate and engage them when they have been
disillusioned.''

WHY ARE FLAMES HOTTEST AT THE TOP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why is it hotter right above a flame than when you pass your
hand through the middle of it?
</P>
<P>
   E.B., Concord, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A bit of flame-speak first, then the answer. There are two
different kinds of flames, according to MIT Chemical Engineering
Professor Jack Howard. The first is a diffusion flame. A candle
creates a diffusion flame. So does burning wood. This one starts
with an ignition source that heats the fuel, like the wax, or wood
or coal or paper, until some of it turns into a gas. The gaseous
fuel molecules diffuse out to meet the oxygen in the surrounding
air. When the fuel vapor and oxygen mix to the right proportions
you have combustion.
</P>
<P>
   The other flame is a premixed flame. The flame in your natural
gas stove is an example. Mix the fuel and the oxygen first, then
introduce the ignition source, and you have a premixed flame.
Howard says this is important because your question really only
applies to diffusion flames.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature at the tip of a candle flame can reach an
incredible 2500 degrees Fahrenheit. But inside the flame, and just
below it, things are only a little above room temperature, just hot
enough to melt the wax. Ever put molten wax on your finger and
watch it harden? The heat you feel from that wax is the temperature
at the bottom of, and inside, a candle flame.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why. Light a match and touch it to a candle wick and some
of the heat transfers down to the solid paraffin. It melts to a
liquid which is absorbed up the burning wick. The heat in the wick
converts the liquid paraffin to a gas and we're off to the
combustion races.
</P>
<P>
   The gaseous paraffin diffuses outward away from the wick. But so
far, it hasn't mixed properly with oxygen, so it really isn't a
flame yet. Finally, a few millimeters away from the wick when the
gas diffusing outward mixes with the oxygen in the surrounding air
and reaches the right concentration: WHOOSH. Where the flame goes
WHOOSH, it's hot. But inside, its not. What you see when you see a
flame is like an upside down ice-cream cone. It's mostly hollow
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it hotter the higher in the flame you go? The fuel gasses
flow upward, and the higher you go the more fuel has been burned,
Howardexplains.
</P>
<P>
   Now what explains the upside-down ice cream cone shape of a
flame? At its base, lots of fuel vapor is diffusing out. There's
more vapor than surrounding oxygen. The mixture is too fuel
rich/oxygen poor to burn.
</P>
<P>
   The little pocket of fuel vapor can grow wide before it mixes
with enough oxygen to ignite. But the higher you go in the flame,
the more fuel vapor has been used up. The mixture goes from
fuel-rich/oxygen poor at the bottom, tomore fuel-poor/oxygen rich
at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the top of the flame, where all the fuel has been burned
and it's at its hottest, that's what actually determines the height
of the flame,'' Howard says. ``Just as the flame is doing its job
most efficiently, it dies.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ Robin Cook, the British foreign

COUPLE BACK IN COURT AFTER FIRM'S $1.5 BILLION SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Before the Internet, before high-tech startups made
billionaires of entrepreneurs overnight, there was Mr. and Mrs.
Kenan Sahin.
</P>
<P>
   After toasting their marriage in the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology student union in May 1967, Selcuk and Kenan Sahin spent
the next 15 years juggling their careers as university professors
and caring for their three sons.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1982, Kenan Systems Corp., a Cambridge software company
and the brainchild of Kenan Sahin, was born.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Sahin scoured the country for the best technological
minds, while his wife, she says, scrubbed office walls and shopped
for discount supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The investment paid off in January, when Lucent Technologies
Inc. paid $1.48 billion for KSC.
</P>
<P>
   But the sensational payoff came too late for Selcuk Sahin, who
walked away with just $1.5 million in 1996 when her 29-year
marriage ended in divorce. At the time, a judge valued the company
at $4.9 million _ 300 times less than what it sold for 32 months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what financial experts, technology specialists, and
divorce lawyers see as a crucial test of fairness and equity in
these high-tech times, the former Mrs. Sahin wants a new day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just common sense,'' said corporate trial attorney Ned
Leibensberger, who represents Selcuk Sahin. ``At the end of the
day, he's got more than a billion dollars and she's got a million.
I think that in cases involving high-tech software companies,
judges have a very tough job trying to determine value. Now we see
this purchase. . . . Now we know for sure how much the company was
worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal specialists say the KSC case, and the drastic difference
between the court estimate and the market price, represents a
growing problem in divorce cases, where his-and-her expert
witnesses race to keep track of an exploding technology market.
</P>
<P>
   Boston business and tax attorney Kenneth Vacovec, who represents
many high-tech entrepreneurs, said he believes mistakes are common
in company value estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is just so unpredictable these days,'' Vacovec
said. ``The economy is very logical; that's headed in the same
direction. But some of the prices we are seeing are amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacovec thinks the Sahin divorce settlement should be voided,
solely because of the huge discrepancies in the estimated worth of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 divorce trial, Kenan Sahin's expert estimated
for the court that his company was worth $4.2 million; Selcuk
Sahin's specialist believed it was worth about $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Without a public stock exchange to consult, and two wildly
different estimates offered by expert witnesses, Norfolk Probate
and Family Judge Eileen Shaevel pegged the value of the company at
$4.9 million, saying that Kenan Sahin's expert used a formula that
seemed more logical.
</P>
<P>
   While neither spouse came close to estimating the true value of
the company, Sahin's former wife now says she has evidence that her
ex-husband knew his company's true worth, or close to it, long
before it was purchased by Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Several legal specialists who have seen Selcuk Sahin's motion to
void her initial divorce action say the testimony of Dr. R. Glenn
Hubbard of Columbia University, an adviser to the president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, may prove invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard concluded that financial data on 70 software firms
between 1996 and 1999 show that the $4.9 estimate was far low,
based on the sale price. In order for a company valued at $4.9
million in 1996 to sell for $1.48 billion in 1999 it would have had
to grow three times faster than the fastest-growing company in the
country, which he said was highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the company's value cannot be attributed to a new
product or a signifigant change in demand for it, Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Sahin's attorney, Norman Jacobs, said the notion of going
back to court because his client's company has done so well is
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that the views she articulates are
outrageous,'' said Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   He called the notion that Selcuk helped build KSC ``ludicrous,''
along with her attorney's allegations that a closer estimate of
worth could have been provided at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs did acknowledge that the messy divorce is a sign of the
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States today, there must be hundreds of
companies that didn't even exist four years ago,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rapidly changing area of economy,'' he said. ``Forty
years ago, we didn't have problems like this in divorce court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs added that Selcuk Sahin was not a credible witness at
trial.
</P>
<P>
   By her own account, Selcuk Sahin made mistakes throughout her
messy divorce. She parted ways with six attorneys before hiring
Leibensperger _ in some cases because she could not pay their
bills, in others because they differed on courtroom tactics.
</P>
<P>
   She admits that her courtroom conduct was harshly criticized at
the close of the trial by the same judge she will face in a hearing
scheduled for May 24, when her former husband will move to have the
prior decision upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sahin said, she realizes she needs to approach her divorce
as the trained researcher she is, without emotion and anger.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard University's School of Public Health,
Selcuk Sahin began a breast cancer foundation in 1990 with money
from KSC, but funding halted when she initiated the divorce, she
says, after years of private battles and her husband's threats to
divorce her.
</P>
<P>
   Now her biggest financial concern is her oldest son, Ayral, who,
despite having graduated from Boston College and displaying talent
and passion for music, is mentally challenged and cannot support
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I am mortal,'' Selcuk Sahin said. ``I don't want to
wait to make this right. I want to make this right now, for women
everyhwere, for me, but mostly for Ayral.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's two other sons are KSC employees, she said, who
have sided with their father throughout the painful process.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Sahin, citing his attorney's advice and the pending court
matter, refused to comment on the case or on any allegations made
by his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known divorce attorneys in the region, Monroe
Inker, who consulted with Selcuk Sahin early in her divorce
proceedings, said the problem of fair estimates for high-tech
companies will become even greater as they multiply.
</P>
<P>
   He's represented clients whose ex-husbands vowed that they would
not take their companies public, then did just that, he said.
Spouses often do not have the money to properly investigate the
potential of companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find today, with all these new issues, and new technology,
that you should always ask for shares of the stock if you can,''
Inker said. ``It's very tough to value this market.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is crazy,'' Inker said. ``You show me how you get the
difference between $4 million and $1 billion.''

GETTING TO THE CORE HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 28 and a single engineer. I bought a condominium about a
year ago. I have no other liabilities and I am putting 2 percentof
my $48,000 salary into my company's 401(k) plan. I also have saved
about $10,000 and I would like to put some of it into Fidelity
mutual funds. I would like to know the difference between growth
and growth and income funds, and which is more suitable for
long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   R.S., Newton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The terms ``growth'' and ``growth and income'' have gone out
of fashion to a certain degree in the last few years, but they
still can be useful tags.
</P>
<P>
   Growth funds are those that build a portfolio of stocks
representing companies deemed to have above-average capacity for
growth, both in terms of growth in revenues and profits, and
particularly growth in stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Growth and income funds are those whose portfolios represent a
compromise of sorts _ seeking a certain degree of income while
still retaining some capacity for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Morningstar Mutual Funds, a couple of years ago people
began to characterize fund portfolios by putting them into a grid,
with portfolio characteristics ranging from value through blend to
growth, and with the market sectors that dominate the portfolio
designated as small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap funds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the old growth and income funds are now classified as
large-cap blend funds; perhaps the archetypal Fidelity fund would
be its Spartan Market Index, which seeks to track the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index. A similar offering, but one that is actively
managed, is Fidelity Growth and Income.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the large-cap spectrum you would find Fidelity's
Equity-Income funds in the large-cap value part of the grid (with
portfolios dedicated to stocks with substantial dividend yields but
less prospect for growth), and Fidelity Growth Company at the other
end, holding a portfolio whose yield is a near-negligible 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who adopt a long-term investment plan begin with
what they consider their core holdings. These will typically be
large-cap blend funds for people whose investment time frame is
less than 15 years or whose appetite for risk isn't all that great.
It's large-cap growth funds for people who figure they can ride out
the invariable bumps in the markets, and for those such as yourself
who have many years to accumulate a retirement nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   If I were advising a 28-year-old on a long-term portfolio, I'd
suggest you put $2,000 in an IRA in Spartan Market Index, $2,500 in
Fidelity Select Health Care, and $2,500 in Fidelity Equity-Income
II.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Health Care fund holds a portfolio that falls in
the large-cap growth corner of the grid, it is a sector fund,
investing all of its portfolio in one industry; for that reason, it
is generally considered even more risky than a large-cap growth
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Equity-Income II falls in the large-cap value grid. (It's worth
noting that, in the current market, values are so high that even an
income-oriented portfolio such as this fund's yields only 1 percent
_ five times that of Growth Company, but still mighty low compared
with markets of old that typically delivered dividend yields in the
area of 2 to 3 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   I suggested the amounts above because both Health Care and
Equity-Income II have minimum initial investments of $2,500; for
regular accounts, Spartan Market Index requires a $10,000 initial
investment, but the amount is reduced to as little as $500 for IRA
accounts. Start by fully funding your IRA, and if you're unwilling
to commit a further $5,000, select one additional fund.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I wish you could contribute more of your salary to your
company's 401(k). For example, if you put 5 percent of your income
into the plan, your $200 monthly contributions would, by the time
you are 65, build a nest egg of $828,314, presuming average annual
returns of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear you thinking _ well, there will be time enough for
that later on, and there are lots of ways for a 28-year-old to
spend his or her money.
</P>
<P>
   But you should also consider the fact that the most important
dollar in your retirement portfolio is the first one in.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you decided to continue with your current $80 monthly
contributions until you are 40, and then bump up your contributions
to the point that's necessary to get to the same final result. At
age 40 you would have to take a giant step upward in the savings
rate _ from $80 to $482 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you can't take the jump from 2 percent to 5 percent,
anything you can add at this point should loom very large in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I invested $10,000 each for my five grandchildren, who range
in age from 3 to 10, putting the money in Pioneer Capital Growth
fund. Recent performance has been poor, with the account balances
down to $8,747 at the end of last year. Should I take the losses
and run, or do nothing?
</P>
<P>
   B.C., La Jolla, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This may be a success spoils the fund story, or perhaps an
illustration of the need to watch a fund very carefully after a
portfolio manager change. Either way, it's a bad news story for
owners of Pioneer Capital Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, this was a small-cap value-oriented fund, with a
long record of superior performance, ending in 1995. Since then, it
has generally operated at the bottom of its peer group. In its last
top-quartile year, 1994, fund manager Warren Isabelle managed a
$437.8 million portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of 1997, shortly before Isabelle left the fund
and turned the reins over to J. Rodman Wright, assets were $1.39
billion and growing. Although the fund gained 11.26 percent that
year, it trailed its peer group average of 25.27 percent growth
markedly; last year it lost 4.17 percent, which compared with a
1.40 percent gain for its average peer. Its portfolio also has
migrated from the small-cap value category to mid-cap value.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has recovered a bit this year, with Lipper Analytical
Services Inc. reporting a 10.67 percent year-to-date gain through
May 5, which compares with a 6.70 percent average gain for its peer
funds. That's a pretty significant turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, I would hang on, but tentatively, analyzing the
fund's performance on a monthly basis. If you see two consecutive
months in which the fund returns to its former subpar performance,
I'd then streak for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am interested in obtaining a listing of the companies from
which I could purchase common stock without the use of a broker,
and also whether they participate in a dividend reinvestment and
stock purchase plan.
</P>
<P>
   G.R., Lansford, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of companies issuing directories listing
both companies with dividend reinvestment plans and companies that
will sell stock directly to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The one I have been using is the annual ``Directory of Companies
Offering Dividend Reinvestment Plans,'' published by Evergreen
Enterprises of Laurel, Md., which you can reach by calling (301)
549-3939.
</P>
<P>
   The company will be issuing the 16th edition of the 160-page
directory shortly, and it will not only list all companies with
DRIPS, but also 99 companies that offer sales of securities
directly to owners.
</P>
<P>
   I think you'll find that virtually every company that offers
direct sales also offers a DRIP, but without seeking the new
edition, I can't promise that.
</P>
<P>
   I have always suggested that paring down the whole universe of
potential stock investments to fewer than 100 simply to avoid a
token brokerage fee _ and even more token now that discount brokers
have taken rates ever lower _ is a poor strategy for making an
investment decision.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I have said this, about a half-dozen people have
written telling of their success using this approach _ and have
suggested that I might go soak my head.

MAKING MUSICAL COMPETITIONS INTO A WIN-WIN GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nature is red in tooth and claw, and competition is one of the
facts of nature, where only the fittest survive. Every blade of
grass knows this, even if some critics of musical competitions do
not.
</P>
<P>
   Competition also seems to be an essential component of human
nature. Like most other aspects of human nature, it has been
responsible for much that is good, and much that is not. That's one
reason many people hold such ambivalent attitudes toward
competition, applauding it in sports arenas, rewarding it in
commerce with money and pink Cadillacs, while deploring it in other
fields of endeavor, and questioning the competitive instinct as
proper motivation for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Competition has nevertheless been a part of organized musical
life since organized musical life has existed. Wagner wrote two
long operas about singing contests in the Middle Ages.
Institutionalized music competitions are an invention of the 19th
century, like many other artistic institutions that are struggling
to continue existing at the close of the 20th. Their history is
interesting, remarkable, and, from the partial point of view
provided by hindsight, not particularly distinguished. Aesthetic
judgments lie in an area where the vagaries of taste intersect with
the solidity of fact. Greatness in musicianship is certainly
irrefutable _ people feel it, recognize it when they hear it _ but
it is also nearly always controversial _ it can't be judged by
objective criteria like the biggest zucchini or the heaviest
pumpkin at a state fair.
</P>
<P>
   The history of French music was written by composers who failed
to win the Prix de Rome, sometimes repeatedly. Some of the greatest
performing careers of the 20th century have been spurred on by
competitions, but one can hardly imagine that the extraordinary
talents of Emil Gilels or Martha Argerich or even Van Cliburn would
have languished in obscurity if these pianists had not won
competitions or even if they had not participated in them. Indeed
it can be argued that Cliburn's paradigmatic but unrepeatable
victory in the Tchaikovsky Competition in 1958 did him no personal
favors.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows the arguments against competitions. The members
of the International Federation of Music Competitions have heard
them more often than people in my equally disreputable line of work
have written them _ the corrupt juries, unfair voting systems, jury
walkouts and audience outrage, retrograde repertory, cookie-cutter
consensus winners that were everone's second choice, the ``losers''
who went on to great careers, the winners who self-destructed.
Every aspect of competitions has been roundly criticized. I have
been disturbed myself by the way competitions have competed with
each other to create bigger prizes, including too many concerts. A
winner who is equipped to take on a 100-concert schedule
immediately may not be the same person as the most compelling,
individual, and exploratory artist in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that some of the great pianists of the past
wouldn't have gotten past the first round of a high-powered
contemporary competition. Alfred Cortot is by common acclaim one of
the greatest pianists ever to have recorded Chopin, but would he
have survived the opening round of a Chopin competition today?
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up, the leading pianists in America were
Rubinstein, Vladimir Horowitz, Rudolf Serkin, and Claudio Arrau.
Four more individual and incomparable musicians would be impossible
to imagine, and you can just imagine what a jury would say about
each of them. Rubinstein was casually sloppy and simplified the
notes; Horowitz was vulgar and distorted the music; Arrau lacked
lightness and spontaneity; and Serkin struggled against the piano
instead of playing it.
</P>
<P>
   Together at the top
</P>
<P>
   Yet the obvious limitations of each of these artists in no way
obscures his greatness, and when you consider the group
collectively, a critical point emerges: At the top level, musicians
are not better than each other. Instead they are different from
each other, and that is why we value them; each of them brings
something unique to our experience of performance.
</P>
<P>
   Every component of our interactive musical ecology is being
blamed for the current crisis _ the disappearance of musical
training and experience as a part of general public education;
rapacious managers and superstars; arrogant orchestras and opera
companies; vulgar competitions whimpering through the last gasp of
the played-out, big-bow-wow repertory; the Vivaldization of radio;
the naivete and commercialism of the record companies; the
mean-spiritedness of crapulent critics. The media denounce the
decline of standards while making their own substantial
contribution to that decline. Yet at the same time, the musical
impulse still wells up in children and young people round the
world, the need and hunger for artistic expression, the need to
express themselves through music or to confirm and enlarge their
feelings by listening to it. Our current musical scene is woefully
deficient in many things, but not in talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education'' is the buzzword of the day, the hope for salvation
_ if we could only get music back into the schools, we would be on
the right track again. It's true, nothing will ever replace the
``hands-on'' experience of singing, playing an instrument, creating
new music; children who learn to make music become the adult
audiences for music. But access is at least as important as most of
what passes for education today _ and indeed, access is a
prerequisite to education. Because many of the avenues of access
today's concertgoers grew up with are now closed _ regularly
touring attractions, significant presence of concert music in the
media, affordable tickets _ the first priority of classical
musicians should be to open new ones, and competitions are well
placed to do so. They are exciting, dramatic, and human, and the
public loves them. Audiences can respond to competitions because
some aspects of the experience are already familiar to them, even
if music isn't. Competitions can lead audiences into the musical
world.
</P>
<P>
   To say this means adjusting the traditional focus of
comeptitions, which has always centered on what they can do for the
artist-contestant. What a competition cannot do anymore is create a
superstar, except maybe in singing, where the repertory coincides
with the attention span of the competing media, and where how a
performer looks is a conscious and important part of the equation.
It is careless of the media to use the subsequent celebrity of a
competition winner to validate, or invalidate, a competition. Yet
it is reckless for a competition to seek to validate itself through
this alone. To an outsider, competitions seem pathetically eager to
buy into an establishment that is at the point of well-deserved
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The repertory question
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the International Federation of Music
Competitions and the individual members of the Federation have
repeatedly considered and reconsidered every process and aspect of
the competition process _ selection of contestants; selection of
the jury; repertory; the adjudication process; the prizes; the
follow-up. All of these areas remain open to discussion because all
of them are open to refinement and improvement.
</P>
<P>
   There is not space to address all these aspects, but I would
like to make three quick points regarding repertory reqirements.
</P>
<P>
   --Not even the greatest pianists with the widest repertories
played everything equally well, so there is no reason to expect
that a young musician should.
</P>
<P>
   --High seriousness has won the battle but lost the war. One
result of this is that young pianists must prove their mettle by
scaling the highest peaks of the repertory every time out; the
``Goldberg'' and ``Diabelli'' Variations, the late Beethoven
Sonatas, and the other canonized masterpieces dominate recital
programs. One reason the solo recital has fallen out of popular
favor is that recitals have become solemn rites in the holy temple
of music, and musicians and audiences are afraid to have fun
anymore, at least until encore time. But you can identify a great
pianist at work in a few bars of a Chopin waltz just as easily as
you can in Beethoven's Op. 111.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this year I have heard audiences literally sigh with
pleasure during concerts, both times during ``unimportant'' works _
when Garrick Ohlsson played Chopin's C-sharp Minor Waltz and when
Dubravka Tomsic played Saint-Saens's Second Concerto with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. I believe that there should be a special
``encore'' category in competitions that would probably be far more
revealing than the standard ``etude'' category, where nearly
everyone sounds alike.
</P>
<P>
   --Since the first Anton Rubinstein competition, there has been a
century's worth of important new repertory, a fact insufficiently
recognized in piano competitions by the inevitable presence of the
same handful of early 20th-century classics, or by the regular
commissioned ``competition pieces,'' few of which have actually
enriched the literature _ or even entered it.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that contestants should play something written in
their own lifetimes in their own country of origin, preferably by
someone they know. Resistance to this, I'm afraid, does not come
from artist-contestants or even from audiences, who always respond
to music played from inner conviction, as commissioned pieces
rarely are. Resistance is more likely to arise from the marketing
people, the managers, the competitions themselves. One effective
way to attract a young audience is to present a young artist
playing music by a young composer who is expressing his or her own
feelings and concerns and, indirectly, those of a generation. This
is one of the engines beyond simple commercial savvy that drives
popular music, and it works in the world of art music too. Our
colleages and friends in the guitar world know this better than the
rest of us, because guitarists have had to create their concert
literature within this century.
</P>
<P>
   Validation comes not from identifying a future superstar or from
the futile attempt to create one. Instead it comes from identifying
and helping some of the people who will lead rich musical lives,
and not always within the traditional boundaries. It should also be
measured in accomplishments that are not secondary, like service to
the community where the competition takes place and to the musical
community as a whole.

WHEN IT COMES TO POP CONCERTS, HE'S THE PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't know why you want to talk to me,'' says
Robert F. X. Sillerman, smiling slightly, welcoming a reporter and
a photographer into his sleek, spacious, silver-black-and-white
corner office, 16 stories above Madison Avenue. ``I don't know
anything about this concert business.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. But people are saying that Sillerman is a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes,'' he concedes, ``I am a player.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the player. He is the 51-year-old executive who sits atop
SFX Entertainment, the New York-based company that over the past
two years has steadily bought up regional concert promoters,
including the Boston area's Don Law Co., and has positioned itself
as the industry's one-stop source for concert tours. Your band
wants to play America's outdoor amphitheaters this summer? You'll
be dealing with one of SFX's companies. You want to attend a
concert at one of those amphitheaters? Same deal.
</P>
<P>
   SFX controls more than 75 stages, puts on 13,200 events a year,
attracts 37 million fans. It will produce 20 national tours this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sillerman wasn't being totally disingenuous. He started SFX
Entertainment without knowing the deep details of the business. He
proceeded on the basis of this notion: The concert business had
always been a patchwork of regional fiefdoms. Maybe he could buy
them and unite them, enabling national tours to be booked through
his company and placed in his venues. And maybe there would be
advertisers who would like to sign up for sponsoring these complete
tours or advertising in these venues. On that hunch, Sillerman sold
his company SFX Broadcasting, for $2.1 billion, and started up SFX
Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for what I think Sillerman knows about
Wall Street,'' says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the
concert-industry trade magazine Pollstar. ``I don't know how savvy
he is about the music business.''
</P>
<P>
   When he purchased the Don Law Co., adding another piece to the
pie, Sillerman also purchased Great Woods Center for the Performing
Arts (and shortly sold the renaming rights to the audio/video
company Tweeter), sight and site unseen. He also acquired Boston's
other premier summer-concert venue, Harborlights (now being
reconstituted as the BankBoston Pavilion).
</P>
<P>
   SFX Entertaiment, which formed in January 1997, is the major
promoter in all of the country's Top 10 markets. It is now building
amphitheaters in Seattle and Sacramento. In talking about SFX,
Sillerman refers to Sam Walton and his nationwide chain of
Wal-Marts: Just as Wal-Mart makes money by giving consumers many
choices and low prices, so can SFX.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Wal-Mart is also blamed for driving out local
businesses and blanketing the land with its ubiquitous, homogeneous
stores. ``Pop is now eating itself,'' says Dave Werlin, owner of
Great Northeast Productions, an independent, Boston-based promoter.
``What it regurgitates at the end remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   SFX is not just a pop-music behemoth; the concert industry
accounts for only 60 percent or so of its business. It bought Falk
Associates Management Enterprises, which manages Michael Jordan and
Patrick Ewing, among others. (In all, SFX represents about 650
athletes and broadcasters.) It bought the New York sports-marketing
company Marquee Group. Across the country, it stages ``Truck
Fest,'' a monster truck show, as well as ``The Magic of David
Copperfield'' and ``Lord of the Dance.'' It develops and manages
touring Broadway shows, such as ``Rent'' and ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Godzilla
</P>
<P>
   In a February keynote speech that Sillerman delivered at the
fifth annual Concert Industry Consortium, a concert business trade
convention, he said, ``In the words of Godzilla . . . size is good.
Size matters.'' Others in the media have also invoked the name of
the giant lizard, likening the monster to Sillerman's company.
Despite Sillerman's reference during his speech, he says
``Godzilla'' is not really a term for which he cares _ especially,
he jokes, after last summer's movie of that name bombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' Sillerman says, ``there has to be a market leader in
every business segment. And how you handle being the market leader
_ you either make things better for all your constituencies or you
are abusive, or some combination _ there's no question in my mind
and in the minds of 99 percent of the people that we're making
things better. I respect the fact that other people will be
concerned about it. We have plenty of competition that we are
mindful of.''
</P>
<P>
   Some stars _ such as Celine Dion, Eric Clapton, Shania Twain,
and Janet Jackson _ have opted not to play for SFX, encouraged by
their longtime booking agents, who fear being cut out of the
picture. Tom Ross, former co-owner of and partner at Creative
Artists Agency, was one agent willing to take on SFX. ``I was the
poster boy for the cause,'' he says. Ross left CAA last November,
in part because of the controversy he stirred up over SFX, and is
starting a new entertainment company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked a big gorilla,'' he says. ``On Wall Street, he's
considered a king. CAA did not like my visible position _ they
thought it was smarter to be closer to your enemy. Although
Sillerman is quoted as saying he wants to be `evolutionary and not
revolutionary,' he clearly has turned the whole business upside
down. Every tour he's bought he's overpaid for. The consumer feels
that. And the brokers'' _ legal ticket broker agencies and scalpers
alike _ ``continue to get their nice share. Ultimately, the public
pays higher prices. Nobody's saying no to the money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the major effect they're having is that ticket prices
have risen dramatically,'' says Jules Belkin, co-CEO of Belkin
Productions Inc., a major promoter in Cleveland and Detroit, about
SFX's impact on the business. ``The consumer is paying a lot more
today than three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't this inflation driven by the artists, who are
determined to get their full share of ticket revenues that have
gone to scalpers and others reselling tickets?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always been a problem in the industry, and more so in
the big cities,'' says Belkin. ``But the price to the artist is
somewhat artificially driven because of SFX's need to acquire a
tour. . . . SFX has an ulterior motive in driving the price up. Mr.
Sillerman has a mission. He wants to drive the price of his stock
up; hopefully, the profits he's able to accumulate will persuade
the financial marketplace to drive his stock up. Like every other
large company today, they look to sell. There is a history of what
Mr. Sillerman does and it's not entirely to grow an industry, but
to grow it to where he can sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Belkin, who has been in the business for 33 years, says he and
Sillerman have had talks about SFX's purchasing his company. ``We
couldn't agree on a price,'' says Belkin, and the negotiations
ended amiably. ``I have no fences to mend.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing monopoly?
</P>
<P>
   SFX also tried to buy Metropolitan Entertainment Group, a New
York/New Jersey-based outfit whose CEO is John Scher. ``Clearly,
SFX has consolidated an industry that was ripe for consolidation,''
says Scher, ``and they bought some great companies, the Don Law Co.
among them. The question really remains: How monopolistic of an
approach are they going to have in the future? Of late, my
observation is they've had a very strong monopolistic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   (Sillerman himself says the Department of Justice has looked at
SFX with the antitrust laws in mind, and continues to keep an eye
on it.)
</P>
<P>
   Scher's company is a big player. It has produced national
Grateful Dead tours and Backstreet Boys tours. It put on the Family
Values tour with Korn, and the Dead-related Further Festival. It
will stage Woodstock 1999. It has booked a national theater tour
for Sarah Brightman and just inked a deal to present Whitney
Houston nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Of SFX, Scher says, ``In addition to acquiring companies, what
they've done on a programming level is buy entire tours in an
unprecedented manner. In the last two years, SFX's strategy has
been to escalate the national touring business on every level of
the industry _ amphitheaters, arenas, even theaters. In the past
it's been the occasional superstar; they've gone across the board
to every kind of artists. That is an approach that for me is
troublesome on an individual and a consumer level. SFX is trying to
control the product so that nobody else can survive or enter into
the business. We must in our industry get back into artist
development: put the right artists in the right location for the
right price.''

BENING GIVES A GREAT PERFORMANCE IN ``IN DREAMS''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``In Dreams'' _ Neil Jordan's haunting film didn't
do well at the box office, but intelligent filmgoers should snap it
up immediately on video. Annette Bening gives a great performance
as an institutionalized career woman in this unconventional horror
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rowing with the Wind'' _ Hugh Grant and Elizabeth Hurley, as
Lord Byron and Claire Clarmont, give this English import a tabloid
buzz. But director Gonzalo Suarez's take on the Percy Bysshe
Shelley-Lord Byron-Mary Shelley literary triangle is tragically
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bent'' _ Martin Sherman's play about the persecution of gays
in Nazi Germany doesn't make a smooth transition to film. Director
Sean Mathias handles the visuals in a bulky, inconsistent style.
Except for Mike Jagger's outrageous performance as a transvestite,
this one can stay on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cruise'' _ The Gray Line tours usually give tourists a
quick rundown on New York's best-known locations _ the Statue of
Liberty, the Empire State Building, and the Fulton Fish Market. Not
this guy. The star of this wacky documentary heads straight for
Greenwich Village with tales of Henry James and Walt Whitman. It's
a wilder ride than Mr. Toad's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadow of Doubt'' _ Randal Kleiser of ``Grease'' and ``Blue

inspiration. Melanie Griffith stars with Tom Berenger and the late
Wade Dominguez.

   COURTS-GERRYMANDERING (Washington) _ In a ruling that could have
a major impact on politics around the country, the Supreme Court
limits judges' ability to strike down election districts drawn by
state legislatures on the grounds that the lawmakers used race as
the major factor in setting the boundaries. Judges now will have to
be more certain of the role race played in the legislators'
reapportionment plans. By MARK HELM.

   COURT-WELFARE (Washington) _ Calling California's welfare law
``a discriminatory scheme,'' the Supreme Court strikes down the
1997 measure, which would have granted the state's newcomers lower
welfare benefits than those received by residents who have lived

says the limit on benefits for new residents violates their

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Under shelter of the longleaf pines
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Carrie Hestand
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   My father's family had a small farm in Louisiana, but when he
and my mother married, he went to work for a lumber company for a
dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
   We lived in a two-room cabin that could be put on a railroad
flatcar and easily moved through the Louisiana forests as my
father's job moved. I guess that would be called an employee
benefit today.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, my father's job was to cut down those beautiful longleaf
pine trees. There is no way I can fully describe those pine woods
of my childhood, how beautiful they were.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that the lumber companies did replant the forests.
The loblolly pines we know today are beautiful, and they help save
the soil.
</P>
<P>
   They keep growing to provide a crop for the paper mills and
that's important, too, but I feel sorry for all the people who
never got to see those majestic longleaf pines that used to grow
there.
</P>
<P>
   My brothers and I and the children of the other lumber workers
had a wonderful playground there in the pineywoods, and I'll always
be grateful for that experience.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I remember us being loaded on the railroad car to
move, I was barely 2 years old _ but I already knew how to pray.
</P>
<P>
   My two oldest brothers were old enough to go to school at that
time. They rode to school in a wagon pulled by two mules and driven
by a boy they had had fights with.
</P>
<P>
   You might say there was strong mutual dislike. The boy refused
to stop at our house, so my brothers would get a running start and
leap onto the back of the moving wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The mules were named Rock and Kate, but I always thought they
were called ``Rotten Cake.'' I couldn't understand why those people
would give their mules such a weird name.
</P>
<P>
   The times weren't easy, but I guess we were just too young to
know it. We thought we had a great life.

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !! 1/2 ``Bird by Bird with Annie'' At a mere 40 minutes, Freida
Lee Mock's documentary on quirky author Anne Lamott is simply too
short to do justice to Lamott's expansive, complicated life as a
recovering-alcoholic born-again-Christian liberal feminist. But
scenes of her readings, a showcase for her considerable humor and
talents, make this brief glimpse worthwhile. (Unrated) (Renee
Graham) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``The Castle'' A winningly good-natured Aussie ``Brady Bunch''
that celebrates family togetherness and ignores bad home decor.
Such story as there is revolves around the family's way of rallying
to fight big money's attempts to bulldoze their homesite to expand
Melbourne's airport. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !!! ``Tea with Mussolini'' There really is a tea with the
Italian fascist dictator in this film, which celebrates the style
and backbone of a colony of reality-denying Englishwomen. They're
determined not to notice, even as World War II approaches, that
Florence no longer is going to be their playground. It's overlong,
but Maggie Smith, Joan Plowright, and Judi Dench as the unsinkable
Brits will keep you from being bored. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``This Is My Father'' Almost radically unfashionable, this is a
beautifully crafted if decidedly leisurely film about a burned-out
Chicago history teacher who goes back to Ireland to learn about the
father he never knew. Moya Farrelly is a find as the teacher's
vivacious mother as a young woman, and Aidan Quinn touchingly plays
his passionate but bottled-up mystery figure of a father. This
family project was written and directed by Paul Quinn and
photographed by Declan Quinn. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Three Seasons'' A delicate take on four contemporary
Vietnamese working-class types _ street peddler, cyclo driver,
prostitute, and lotus harvester. But while Tony Bui's film, the
first American independent feature to be filmed in Vietnam, is long
on atmosphere, it seems rudderless and disjointed, a screenful of
ingredients waiting to be forged into a compelling whole. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! ``Trippin' What with the current deluge of teen films clogging
cineplexes, it was only a matter of time before a hip-hop version
of the trend found its way onto the big screen. Hence, there's
``Trippin' ,'' which manages to prove only that Hollywood finds
black teens as inane, uninspired, and sex-mad as their white
counterparts. (R) (Renee Graham) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream'' A
disappointingly pedestrian treatment of the Bard's moonlit comedy.
Instead of gossamer eroticism, it gives us mud wrestling
(literally), plus a lot of verbal grappling by insufficiently
equipped players. The best thing in it is Kevin Kline's Bottom the
Weaver, who captures not only the role's horseplay, but a wistful
romanticism that eludes the others. (PG-13)

<P>
   There is a galaxy not too far, far away where people say a movie
changed their lives, where husbands do Jedi impressions for
oh-so-patient wives, and 30-year-olds sleep on 20-year-old
bedsheets that contain the faded image of Boba Fett.
</P>
<P>
   This week, after a 16-year hiatus, the age of the ``Star Wars''
fanatic is again at hand.
</P>
<P>
   They sit next to you on the T. They like NASCAR. They write TV
sitcoms. They design Web pages. And in three days, the latest phase
of their ``Star Wars'' lives officially begins with the release of
``Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas's latest, all-new,
much-anticipated celluloid baby.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing you can do to stop the estimated 2.2 million
people nationwide who experts predict will take an unofficial
holiday so they can see the movie when it opens Wednesday at 12:01
a.m. After all, these are the people who waited in line or online
or on the phone last week in order to scoop up the prized tickets
when they went on sale. Better to sit back, ask a few questions,
and try to figure out what makes these people's passion for this
movie burn hotter than a double-ended light saber.
</P>
<P>
   We begin at 9:30 on a quiet Sunday night in the Back Bay when
Mark Ennis, 22, and Phil Damour, 21, rounded the corner at the
teddy bear in front of F.A.O. Schwarz and witnessed what, to them,
was the impossible. They were No. 1 and 2 in line with 2 1/2 hours
to go before the store opened to sell the newest ``Star Wars''
stuff. By midnight, they would be joined by hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, said the two Boston University students when they realized
they would be the first ones in the door. ``We expected the line
would be around the block already.''
</P>
<P>
   When they were asked what makes ``Star Wars'' so special, there
was no easy answer. There never is.
</P>
<P>
   They said it's the best pulp sci-fi movie ever made and waxed on
about the lasers and the special effects and even Princess Leia's
gold bikini. Only one word was heard time and time again _
``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   A clawing mosh pit
</P>
<P>
   When F.A.O. Schwarz's doors finally opened to the strains of the
movie's familiar theme, Ennis, Damour, and their fellow ``Star
Wars'' aficionados galloped up the escalators and formed a clawing
mosh pit around the action figures. Display pegs were picked clean
in about 10 minutes. Workers began restocking the display pegs
after the crowds dwindled, indicating there was plenty more to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hassenfeld, the chairman and CEO of Hasbro, the company
that stands to make a pretty penny off all this plastic booty, even
showed up for the midnight sale. ``It's cool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the store was Tige Quintina, a 30-year-old Web page
designer from Revere, to whom ``Star Wars'' is as much a part of
life as, say, eating. He had seen the movie 15 times by the time he
was 8.
</P>
<P>
   And when girlfriend Rebecca Clements came into his life and he
invited her to his apartment, he didn't think twice about the
``Star Wars'' spaceships hanging from the ceiling, the crates
filled with action figures, or the faded ``Star Wars'' bedsheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very open about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew,'' said Rebecca, recalling that visit, ``that I was
getting to know another dimension of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the Internet, we found the craze is not limited to the
States. In London, Paul Rose is planning to fly to Boston to see
the premiere. Airline tickets were cheap, and the 26-year-old
investment banker said he couldn't wait until July 16, when ``The
Phantom Menace'' will be released in England. By that time, he
said, he'll know everything about the film via the scourge of
rumor-mill Internet sites that he checks daily.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Gabrielle, is coming, too. After all, she's been
putting up with Rose's habit of pulling his blue robe over his head
and repeating Jedi lines word for word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I get on her nerves quite a lot,'' Rose said. ``But
how I do wish that robe were brown and hooded.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, television writer Brett Dewey, 33, who has
written for ``Saved by the Bell'' and is currently writing for
``Malibu, CA,'' was thinking back to his Cape Cod youth in South
Dennis when he credited 1980's ``The Empire Strikes Back'' with
leading him into a career as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tape-recorded the entire movie,'' he said. ``And the first
script I ever wrote was a transcription of that tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewey is also the creator of an Internet site that has coined a
phrase bound to become all too common in three days _ wookie hooky.
</P>
<P>
   The site at http://wookieehooky.starwarsfan.com is a compendium
of pledges and excuses to be used on Wednesday: At the site,
nurses, congressional aides, and even parents and their willing
kids have pledged to shut down on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a holiday''
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who care about these movies, it's a holiday,'' said
Dewey. ``This has more meaning than Arbor Day or Flag Day to a
`Star Wars' fan. It's going to be mania.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people out here in Los Angeles who are my
age, and we're all motivated to get involved in movies and
television thanks to `Star Wars,' '' he said. ``At the time the
film was released, we had never really seen behind-the-scenes
specials about how films were made. `Star Wars' changed all that
and opened up this whole new world for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Suzanne Welke, 33, an associate producer for
television's ``Wings'' and ``Jenny'' in Los Angeles. Yoda came to
her wedding _ or at least a cutout-cardboard Yoda. Han was there
too, and Leia and Luke and, well, everybody, all in one-dimensional
form.
</P>
<P>
   The newlyweds accepted Jeffrey Dollars from Toys ``R'' Us as
wedding presents (all spent on ``Star Wars'' collectibles, all of
which are cataloged in a database). She had originally planned to
wear ``Star Wars'' outfits at the wedding, but Steve, her
husband-to-be, said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be: `Two freaks married in `Star Wars' wedding _ tape
at 11,' '' recalled Suzanne. ``Plus he was worried that his best
man would have to wear a Chewbacca suit.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, Julie Mackler, 10; Josh Mackler, 8; and
friend Korinna George, 10, were traipsing out of Skinner's Back Bay
auction house in Boston and into the bright sunshine when they were
asked about their impressions of ``Star Wars'' passion.
</P>
<P>
   A hint of adulthood shone on their faces. For after witnessing
an auction in which $41,342 had been spent on ``Star Wars''
posters, lobby cards, banners, and other adult toys, these kids
were dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they pay so much for these things from, like, 20
years ago?'' asked Josh. ``They must love it. Or maybe they're just
going to sell it for more money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love `Star Wars,' '' added Korinna, ``but I wouldn't go so
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mackler, otherwise known as Dad, was still upstairs,
looking and examining and bidding. When the kids thought about him,
they nodded and realized what they were dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy who loves this stuff, science fiction and
all,'' said Josh. ``And when he's around it, he's more like a kid.
I guess he just thinks it's cool.''

MAY THE HYPE BE WITH YOU

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gentlemen, start your warp drives. If they haven't been warped,
that is. Or burned out. It's hard to believe that ``The Phantom
Menace,'' George Lucas's ``Star Wars'' prequel, will actually open
Wednesday. It seems as if it's been around for ages. Mea culpa
here, I guess. We of the media don't exactly occupy the moral high
ground on the overexposure issue. No writer or editor wants to be
caught behind the curve, especially in a time when people _ read
the ``Phantom Menace'' target audience _ are getting information in
new ways, mostly on the Internet. So it's going to be hard for
people to look at ``The Phantom Menace'' with fresh eyes, much less
a sense of discovery. Did somebody say information overload?
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago (last Sunday) in a galaxy not far away (a hotel on
Park Avenue in Manhattan), George Lucas sat, trying to play down
the whole ``Star Wars'' and ``Phantom Menace'' brouhaha, going the
spin-doctor route to head off backlash. Suggesting, in his coiffed
salt-and-pepper hair and matching beard, a Marin County ewok, Lucas
said it was only a movie and that obsessional fans should get a
life. No, ``Star Wars'' isn't a religion, he said, and was never
intended to be. But even Lucas seemed intimidated by the huge wave
of anticipation cresting over ``The Phantom Menace.'' ``I certainly
expect not to do well critically,'' he said _ an expectation borne
out by a few critics who jumped the gun with lukewarm reviews. ``I
expect to be trashed. When you have such high expectations, you
can't possibly live up to them,'' he said, adding that the whole
thing had gotten out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   No argument there. The culture has undergone a sea change
between the arrival of ``Star Wars'' in 1977 and ``The Phantom
Menace'' in 1999. ``Star Wars'' helped get it there. It hastened
the cyber revolution by amping it up to warp speed in the public
mind, ushered in the era of movies created in large part at
computer keyboards, as ``The Phantom Menace'' was. During the
shoot, whether in Tunisia or outside London, the actors mostly
acted against nothing. The backgrounds and creatures were added
later. Lucas sees ``The Phantom Menace'' as a way station to the
time when films will be made and projected digitally. Knowing he's
calling the shots here, he has been dictating terms to theaters. He
calls it quality control. To load his film down with trailers and
present it with what he regards as inadequate equipment is, in his
analogy, akin to ``playing symphonies on crappy stereos.''
</P>
<P>
   All eyes on the opening
</P>
<P>
   There's another warp-drive factor at work here. It has to do
with the importance attached to the opening weekend. Late on Friday
nights, interested movie-biz participants gather to learn the
grosses. Then, like pollsters who predict the outcome of elections
with only a few percent of the vote tallied, they predict the box
office fate of the film. It's a practice in synch with the
instant-gratification reflex of a society that can't infantilize
itself fast enough. Almost altogether gone is the practice of
platforming a film, allowing it to find its audience. The big-bang
theory has taken over. For years stars drove films, for a brief
while directors did, and now it's the marketers who occupy the
driver's seat in Hollywood. Picking the right weekend to open a
film _ especially in the summer, when the stakes are at their
highest _ has become the sexiest high-stakes game in Hollywood.
Marketing execs call the shots, even to the extent of assigning an
opening date before production execs assign a start date.
</P>
<P>
   You can't help enjoying one reversal attached to ``Star Wars.''
Lucas likes to refer to himself as this little independent
filmmaker outside off-the-beaten-path San Francisco. At the time of
the original ``Star Wars'' he was. He had to go hat in hand to the
studio, in this case 20th Century-Fox. Now studios go hat in hand
to him. This time around, Fox will earn only a distribution fee,
placed by unconfirmed reports at between 8 and 10 percent of the
worldwide grosses. By today's standards, Lucas is modest about the
whole box office thing. ``The Phantom Menace'' _ brought in at $115
million, chump change at current prices, and in any case $5 million
under budget _ won't unseat ``Titanic,'' he predicts, or ``E.T.,''
or ``Star Wars.'' He does expect it to wind up in the Top 10. If it
doesn't do well, it may mean no second and third prequels, says
Lucas, who reminds journalists that ``Star Wars'' paid for ``The
Empire Strikes Back,'' which in turn paid for ``Return of the
Jedi.'' They all paid for Industrial Light &AMP; Magic, the company he
invented to make the technology he needed for the first trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas says that the launching and running of ILM absorbed him to
the point where he had to hand the direction of the second and
third ``Star Wars'' sequels to others. One reason he waited so long
to get back to the saga, he says, is that he needed time to evolve
the technology he felt deprived of the first time around. When he
had it, he went back and touched up the first three films before
re-releasing them in 1997. ILM gave him the autonomy he wanted. So
did his foresight. At the time of the original ``Star Wars''
release, he cut his fee from Fox by $500,000 in exchange for the
sequel and merchandising rights. He didn't envision much more than
posters and T-shirts, and those only to promote the movie. Two
decades later, the toys and action figures have grossed something
like $5 billion. Lucas owns a piece of Hasbro, the toy
manufacturers. They paid him a $100 million advance on the
``Phantom Menace'' gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A violent world''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because ``The Phantom Menace'' is aimed at younger
audiences, as Lucas admits, it's less gory than most of the films
``Star Wars'' hatched, for all the new film's laser sword fights
and explosions. Still, the toys send a message. As Pernilla August,
the Swedish actress who plays young Anakin's mother, says,
``There's no mommy action figure.'' Lucas answers the violence
question with the context answer, namely that you can't generalize
about scenes of violence but must evaluate each specifically and
ascertain its dramatic validity. ``Obviously, you can't be hurting
people for fun and enjoyment. That's the central issue. You have to
fight for freedom or self-defense. But we live in a violent world.
To deny it is almost as dangerous as glorifying violence,'' he
says. Yet there's a subtler and more profound form of violence
attached to the ``Star Wars'' movies, ``The Phantom Menace''
included.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has many times cited the mythic-religious core of the
``Star Wars'' films. He proudly cites his mentor-disciple
relationship with the late Joseph Campbell, whose classic study of
quest legends in ``The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' has spelled out
their workings for this generation. The films externalize internal
struggles, characters trying to do right, falling from grace, being
redeemed, spanning spiritual darkness with spiritual connections,
including love and family. As the Jedi code puts it, fear is the
path to the dark side _ fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate,
hate leads to suffering. Lucas is the first to point out that there
isn't enough in ``Star Wars'' to be a religion. Yet he says the
movies have been designed to make young audiences think about
larger entities.
</P>
<P>
   The wars in ``Star Wars'' stem from material greed. The ultimate
loss in ``The Phantom Menace'' is the loss of a trade franchise.
Yet these films that argue against becoming possessed by
possessions have themselves become a huge trade franchise. Is there
not a fundamental contradiction between the message of the films
and the message of the merchandising? Even in a culture where the
measure of a film has become its opening weekend gross and not its
content? ``It doesn't seem to bother the church very much,'' Lucas
replies, rationalizing that his practice of using the proceeds of
one film to finance the next is not unlike an Indian killing a
buffalo, not idly, or for so-called sport, but to use all of it _
the meat for food, the skin for clothing and shelter, even the
bones for tools. ``Besides,'' Lucas says, ``I like toys. I think
play is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   This is evident not only in Lucas's films, but in his
micromanaged, self-perpetuating empire. The minions at his
keyboards have become toymakers to the world, dominating American
pop culture just as American pop culture dominates the world by
giving it its images and models. Hollywood has always lived by the
blockbuster. But blockbuster means something new in a
more-wired-than-ever millennial world. Movies have merged with
commercials and television and music videos to become one
mega-delivery system for images. Millennial blockbusters, of which
``The Phantom Menace'' is the latest, now arrive at a cultural
nexus of unprecedented electronic proliferation and warp-speed
debasement of what's being proliferated. Lucas now can leap
light-years with a single keystroke. But he can't run faster than a
rampaging consumer society devouring films and anything else it can
get its teeth on. Dark side, schmark side. As long as the Trade
Federation gets its piece of the action.

FANS PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR EARLY SCREENING OF `STAR WARS'

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They came in droves, like battle droids on the
warpath.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,300 eager moviegoers, along with filmmaker George Lucas,
marched into the Galaxy Theatre Sunday for a charity premiere of
the long-awaited space-myth flick ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Troyer, a die-hard ``Star Wars'' fan from Redwood City,
Calif., who paid $500 for his ticket and waited four hours in line,
emerged from the theater Sunday evening with a hearty thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was sweet,'' he said. ``It had a lot of plot
twists. And the light saber duels, I loved them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Fisher of San Francisco took her son Ryan, 6, and his
friend Madeleine Charters, 6. The kids arrived dressed as Luke
Skywalker and Princess Leia, complete with toy blasters and light
sabers. Madeleine even had the Princess Leia hair thing going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just loved it,'' Fisher said. ``I was afraid Madeleine
was going to be frightened by the film. But it was delightful.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who has a reputation as a
cinephile, called the film ``fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just pure, unadulterated entertainment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The red-carpet event netted $500,000 for the San Francisco Boys
and Girls Club. San Francisco was one of 11 North American cities
where the benefit screenings were held.
</P>
<P>
   About 130 young people from the Boys and Girls Club attended the
screening. Before the film rolled, the kids tried out two computer
games that aren't yet on store shelves: ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace'' and ``Racer,'' which recreates the film's
fast-paced ``pod'' race. The children also received a tote bag of
movie treats, including action figures and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   After the screening, attendees were treated to a gala at the
Regency Building across the street. A life-size Darth Vader statue
in the lobby greeted arriving guests. They quickly filled the
Regency ballroom, enjoying live music and munching on assorted
gourmet fare _ roast beef, sliced pork sandwiches, sushi, steamed
buns, jumbo shrimp and beer.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the steep price he paid to attend the screening,
Troyer said at the gala, ``Might as well get my money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Money raised at the event will be used to expand programs for
the club's 4,000 youths. The organization has five branches in San
Francisco and a summer camp in Mendocino County.
</P>
<P>
   The ``prequel'' is set before the events in the original 1977-83
trilogy _ ``Star Wars,'' ``The Empire Strikes Back'' and ``Return
of the Jedi.''
</P>
<P>
   It tells the story of the boy Anakin Skywalker (who eventually
transforms into the evil Darth Vader) against the backdrop of an
interstellar war involving Queen Amidala's planet Naboo and the
aggressive Trade Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar characters from the previous films _ Yoda, Jabba the
Hutt, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 _ appear in ``The Phantom
Menace.'' The film opens in general release on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews of ``The Phantom Menace'' are mixed. But many
people who saw the film Sunday raved about its fast-paced spaceship
battles, the strange new aliens, the terrifying villains and the
light saber duels.
</P>
<P>
   John Vrolyk, 11, of San Mateo said he enjoyed the film so much,
``I'm gonna see it five times.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yaki, a San Francisco city supervisor, said the event
reminded him of a packed ``Return of the Jedi'' benefit screening
he attended in college in 1983. He said he's been waiting for ``The
Phantom Menace'' for a long time and shrugged off the early buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the critics say _ they don't get it!'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas explained the public's fascination with Luke Skywalker,
Yoda, TIE Fighters, and all things encompassing the Force by simply
saying, ``It's based on old stories that resonate with people.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizations selected for the benefit premiere cover a
range of charities. The Los Angeles screening was to benefit the
Santa Monica-based Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation,
while proceeds from the New York event were to go to the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.

BOOKLET OFFERS ADVICE ON CALCIUM FOR TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a ``calcium crisis'' among teen-agers, according to
health and nutrition experts.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nine out of 10 girls and seven of 10 boys get too little
calcium. The National Academy of Sciences recommends 1,300 mg of
calcium daily for teens _ the equivalent of four eight-ounce
glasses of milk.
</P>
<P>
   It's needed because 15 percent of adult height and half of all
bone mass are added during the teen years. Blame soda for
adolescents' calcium deficit: As teens have double or tripled their
soda intake in the past two decades, their milk consumption has
fallen by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest pegs boys' soda
intake at two and half cans daily. For girls, it's two cans.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Clueless About Calcium,'' a free booklet with information,
comparisons, recipes and tips for including more calcium in a
teen-age diet, call 800-WHY-MILK (949-6455).

</P>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK MEMORABILIA: For the Woodstock fan of your
acquaintance, at least one of a certain age, consider a framed
original poster and unused ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be perfect paired with, for example, those surprise tickets
to this summer's July 23-25, 30th anniversary extravaganza in Rome,
N.Y. The collectible wall-hanging, which we found in an airline
catalog, wonders why the original tickets are unused, something
that wouldn't have occurred to us. After all, wasn't the whole
point of the first fest that almost nobody had tickets anyway?
</P>
<P>
   A comparison: Tickets to Woodstock '69 originally cost $8; the
framed ticket and poster sells for $125; an original ticket was
auctioned in 1995 for $150, suggesting investment potential; and a
ticket to Woodstock/Rome '99 (on a former military base _ how
antithetical!) goes for $150.

PUNISH ACTS, NOT MOTIVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's put aside the dead/more dead debate (Would my brother be
any less dead if his skull were crushed during a robbery than your
brother, whose skull was crushed because he's
black/gay/Jewish/disabled?) and focus on the constitutionality of
hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of the various hate-crime bills being mulled by
state and federal lawmakers may differ, but they share a basic
premise: Enhance penalties for crimes if the victims fit a
protected class _ race, color, religion, national origin, gender,
disability, sexual orientation _ and the perpetrator was motivated
by hate for people of that class.
</P>
<P>
   But establishing laws that are inherently unequal to equalize
protection is unstable, perhaps even unconstitutional, ground to
tread.
</P>
<P>
   Hate in itself is not a crime. There is no constitutional
guarantee that everyone like everyone else. There is, however, a
clear constitutional mandate in the 14th Amendment that says, ``...
nor shall any State deny any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Hate-crimes advocates support this legislation as a way to make
up for historically unequal enforcement of the laws. But failings
on that front don't justify enacting blatantly partial legislation.
In Texas, judges and district attorneys are elected; if a history
of inequitable prosecution is detected, the electorate can take
care of that at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   A word on thought crimes: In a just society, punishment is
exacted for aberrant behavior, not for the idea that motivated it.
</P>
<P>
   Although motive might explain the behavior, it should in no way
make the punishment worse any more than it should excuse the act.
</P>
<P>
   Society must respond to acts of hate with the harshest
condemnation, but to craft legislation to punish thoughts is not
the road to travel.

`STAR WARS' BATTLES TO A DRAW: BREATHTAKING ANIMATION SERVES
FLAT  HUMAN STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB GRAHAM  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does any adventure series have a greater _ and more supremely
deserved _ reservoir of good will going for it than ``Star Wars''?
</P>
<P>
   At a preview screening last week in San Francisco, the keyed-up
audience for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' cheered
the dimming of the lights before the film even began.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered the Lucasfilm logo. They even cheered Rupert (talk
about an evil empire!) Murdoch's 20th Century Fox logo. They
cheered the slogan ``A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, there were more cheers at the beginning than
there were, almost 2 1/4 hours later, at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Right off the bat, Ewan McGregor, as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi,
echoes Han Solo's ``I have a bad feeling about this.'' It would be
merely clever and terribly unfair to say ``Star Wars'' fans might
share that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Is ``The Phantom Menace'' worth seeing? What a question! Of
course it is. It is a stunning spectacle, maybe even Industrial
Light &AMP; Magic's greatest special-effects achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But creator George Lucas has left a lot of room for improvement,
particularly for character development and emotional juice, in this
beginning of the second trilogy. We have every right to assume _ to
demand _ that the next two episodes will accomplish exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, there are high hopes for a promise not yet fully
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The most distinctive thing about ``The Phantom Menace,'' which
opens Wednesday, is the extraordinary degree to which it is
animation _ far, far and away more so than any previous ``Star
Wars.'' An accurate categorization of it would be sci-fi,
live-action animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   From richly imagined new computer-generated characters who
interact uncannily with the human actors to a strategically paced
bonanza of extended, huge-scale, self-contained sequences, the
computer-generated animation is a marvel of solidity, density,
color subtlety and 3-D depth. It is truly out there.
</P>
<P>
   The action introduces us to Anakin Skywalker, the 9-year-old we
already know will become not only Darth Vader but also the father
of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. Two Jedi knights, dispatched
as ambassadors to broker peace between the intergalactic Trade
Federation and the idealistic planet Naboo, believe that they have
discovered along the way the Chosen One who will bring the galaxy
into equilibrium with the Force.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the Force?
</P>
<P>
   It's not the seat-rattling sound that rumbles through the
theater when spaceships accelerate, but it could've fooled me.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer-generated creature Jar Jar Binks also brings
off the illusion. A buddy of Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam
Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), Jar Jar kind of fills the
Chewbacca vacuum. He has droopy ears, bulging eyes on stems and a
humanoid torso. He's got an anteater's wandering tongue and a
hipster's walk, put to delightful use in a dance of celebration
with New Orleans-style prancing droids.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically in ``The Phantom Menace,'' the animated characters
have more human juice to them than the live ones. The humans,
low-key and one-dimensional, are the stick figures. This new
trilogy needs a lovable rascal like Han Solo and a bitchy, bossy
princess like Leia _ somebody to set off some sparks.
</P>
<P>
   The stolid Neeson is warmer than anyone has a right to expect,
and even his Buddhist platitudes (``Be mindful of the moment'') are
never burdensome. My favorite: ``The ability to speak does not make
them intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing message is: We must learn to help one another.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor is more of a problem. As the living prequel to the
saint of the series, in a brush cut with a topknot that seems to
have slipped down the back of his head, McGregor seldom shows his
natural vivacity as an actor and, especially, his unpredictability.
An Alec Guinness imitation is interesting only up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Portman has grown up from the 11-year-old urchin in Luc
Besson's ``The Professional'' and now is a regal, perhaps too
regal, queen of Naboo and something of a clothes horse. One of her
costumes recalls the Elizabethan age, and another is very Japanese.
She has one stripe of lip gloss on her lower lip, and it's likely
that teenage girls already are imitating it. There are some shocks
and surprises along the way, and Portman is involved in one of the
best.
</P>
<P>
   The big question about Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), to my
mind, is what planted the seeds that led to his embracing the dark
side of the Force as Darth Vader. As yet, we don't know. A slightly
younger but still wispy-haired Yoda says that ``fear is the path to
the dark side,'' but the Anakin we see is resourceful and brave.
</P>
<P>
   He's already involved in the creation of a see-through C-3P0
droid, and the nearby prototype of R2-D2 is greeted by the audience
like an old friend. Fighter-pilot son Luke will be a chip off the
old block, as we see in Anakin's entry in the pod race. The cab of
his aircraft, by the way, sometimes hangs behind the free-floating
jets and, in the twists and turns through canyons, sometimes
precedes them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The battles and other set pieces, such as the pod race, go off
like a carefully timed string of firecrackers. The
computer-generated landscapes, cityscapes and seascapes are
awesome. An underwater city is surrounded by an increasingly
ripping series of marine monsters that sequentially gobble each
other up. ``There's always a bigger fish,'' Neeson observes drily.
</P>
<P>
   The cityscapes range from pre-Mayan and Babylonian to Venetian
canals and the precipitous, illuminated towers of skyscrapers. One
battle takes place on an enormous plain, and a climactic lightsaber
fight is waged among ramps, platforms and infinitely deep
crevasses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the creatures are ants-on-their-hind-feet cannon fodder
called battle droids. Another new one is the greedy, winged slave
master of Anakin. His bet with Qui-Gon Jinn leads up to the pod
race. The ever-resourceful Jedi knight has a jujitsu-like knowledge
of how to let an opponent defeat himself.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory scene, a hallmark of Lucas' films and, I think,
of his philosophy, features some of John Williams' new music, which
otherwise tends to fade from consciousness with overfamiliarity.
</P>
<P>
   Jar Jar, by the way, sometimes seems to sound like the Central
American houseboy in Robin Williams' ``The Birdcage.'' There are
other intriguing dialect choices, such as the Federation reps who
seem to speak English with a Mandarin accent.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's show started, a representative of the publicity
agency presenting the screening asked audience members to report
any camcorders they spotted among them. Piracy is a serious
international problem, of course, but anybody who sees a shaky copy
of ``The Phantom Menace'' on a small screen with tinny sound is
missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the ``special edition'' remake of Episodes IV, V
and VI, adding landscapes and cityscapes to put the action in a
more believable context, must have arisen during creation of the
extraordinary environment for ``The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   People may have forgotten how low-rent and underpopulated the
original ``Star Wars'' was in 1977, with its tacky sets and ragtag
little kids disguised in hoods.
</P>
<P>
   In special effects, Lucas has moved a galaxy beyond. In energy,
not yet.
</P>

Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, May 18:

<P>
   SCI-VENTER-GENOME (Undated) _ A Scientist at Work: Dr. J. Craig
Venter, a pioneer in the sequencing, or decoding, of DNA, is
beginning a new venture of boundless ambition. And sequencing the
entire three billion letters of human DNA by the end of 2001, a
goal first announced last May, is just the start of his grand
design. Eventually, he hopes to build a giant database of genome
sequences for thousands of that will be as essential for biologists
and physicians as the Bloomberg data terminals are for the
financial world. Now, his private venture is competing with a
similar federal government project. By Nicholas Wade. (1800 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OFFICE-SURGERY (Undated) _ After shifting from kitchen
tables to hospitals over the course centuries, surgery now is
moving again, this time to the less expensive settings of doctors'
private offices. This has set off an escalating nationwide debate
on how to insure patients' safety as the complicated modern
technology of anesthesia and surgery floats free of hospital
regulations back into less-restricted settings. By Abigail Zuger.
(2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WARMING-WEATHER (Undated) _ Scientists have long been
convinced that global warming would affect large-scale atmospheric
circulation _ the big, swirling global air currents that dictate
where it is warm and cold, wet and dry, and where storms go. Now a
number of researchers say the frequency of these circulation
regimes, as they are called, is changing, with potential for
enormous long-term implications for weather around the world,
including more frequent El Ninos. By William K. Stevens. (1670
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOTH-SEX (Undated) _ When it comes to sex there are many
males in the animal kingdom that can be counted on to contribute
little more to their mates than a moment of time and a bit of
sperm. But consider the male of the lowly rattlebox moth. This wisp
of a creature not only delivers a truly stunning sperm packet (the
proportional equivalent for a 170 pound man of a 17 pound
ejaculate) but, researchers report today, he includes within that
packet the unexpected bonus of a powerful toxin that can protect
his mate from predators for the rest of her life. By Carol Kaesuk
Yoon. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RELIGION-PRIZE (Undated) _ An essay: Despite a recent spate
of peace negotiations and displays of good fellowship by some of
the partisans on both sides, it doesn't look as if the
centuries-old row between religion and science is any closer to
resolution. The fact is that people cling to personal beliefs
regardless of debating points won or lost, and no amount of
persuasion makes much difference. But one thing that does make a
difference is cash. For most people the ultimate measure of success
is money, and by that standard religion is gaining on science. The
Nobel prizes in the sciences (which last year came to $978,000
each) have been shouldered into second place by the Templeton Prize
for Progress in Religion, which is now the world's richest award.
By Malcolm W. Browne. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Shorts on science: items on a new role for
genetically engineered tobacco in cleaning up the environment and
ways to track satellites. (470 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BALLET-PREGNANCY (Undated) _ The experience of ballerinas,
including Margaret Tracey, who have just returned from maternity
leaves makes it clear that it is generally far easier to get back
in shape after pregnancy or other disruptive events if one had been
in good shape to begin with. But it took special training and
programs to get them back on the floor. By Holcolm B. Noble. (1200
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Each
year, the Centers for Disease Control estimates, 4.7 million people
are bitten by dogs, 800,000 of them badly enough to require medical
treatment. At least 60 percent of dog bites and 72 percent of fatal
bites involve children. In fact, half of all children in this
country are bitten by a dog before their 12th birthday. And since
children are most often bitten on the face, many need plastic
surgery to minimize unsightly scars. By Jane E. Brody. (1200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FUTURE-HEALTH (Undated) _ Every week, a group of doctors,
engineers, scientists and computer specialists get together at the
University of Rochester to talk over outlandish ideas, including
the notion that the future of medicine lies in devices that are
high-tech, cheap and controlled by patients. Like a bandage that
would screen for common infectious agents, memory glasses with a
databank of familiar faces that would whisper names into the ear,
body scanners that would check daily and report on the growth of
any melanoma. The sessions that gave rise to them has also given
birth to the Center for the Future of Health, a partnership that
signifies the growing intwinement of computer sciences and the
healing arts. By John O'Neil. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   With
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FUTURE-TOILET (Undated) _ In Tokyo, Matsushita, the
electronics firm, is working on a prototype house of the future
chock-full of gadgets to keep track of the owner's health, right
down to the toilet. The model home, described earlier this month in
the Lancet, includes a bathroom equipped with sensors and
microchips that can provide a ``morning checkup'' by measuring the
user's weight, fat content and urine sugar levels. The bedroom has
an electrocardiometer, a blood-sugar meter and a thermometer, among
other gadgets, and links that can transfer their data not only to
the home computer or physician's office. By John O'Neil. (310
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pro and con: When exercising in warm weather, are sports
drinks necessary to stay hydrated? (400 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Teen-agers who are gay, lesbian or bisexual are more than
three times as likely to attempt suicide than other youth,
according to a Massachusetts-based study reported this month in the
Archives of Pediatric &AMP; Adolescent Medicine. Young men are at
particular risk, the report found. (400 words)

PANEL URGES NEW YORK TO BOOST PAY FOR DEFENSE LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A panel appointed by New York's chief judge to
study public trust in the justice system says increased funding for
legal services and higher pay for court-appointed lawyers is
crucial in fostering confidence in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared by the committee urges the state to establish
a steady, reliable funding stream for legal service programs.
</P>
<P>
   It also says that the fees paid court-appointed defense
attorneys _ $25 per hour for out-of-court time and $40 per hour for
in-court time _ are ``wholly inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The rates haven't risen since 1985. ``As a result, capable,
experienced attorneys are declining to serve as appointed or
assigned counsel because they cannot afford to work at these rates
and meet overhead expenses,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye appointed the Committee to Promote
Public Trust and Confidence in the Legal System in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that while public trust and confidence in all
governmental institutions has eroded over the last 30 years, an
overwhelming number of Americans _ about 80 percent _ remain
convinced that, despite its problems, the U.S. justice system is
the best in the world. However, only 14 percent of those surveyed
in an American Bar Association poll earlier this year had a
favorable impression of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, the committee concludes, stems from the low
fees, and seemingly low priority, afforded legal service lawyers
and public defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This creates the impression that the poor are not receiving
the attention their cases merit or that counsel takes the most
expedient route, by plea bargaining or settling cases, because they
are not sufficiently compensated or do not have the time to
vigorously pursue them,'' according to the committee co-chaired by
Appellate Division Justice William C. Thompson and state Supreme
Court Justice Evelyn Frazee.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, legal service funding is negotiated annually in
budget dealings, which means the long-term viability of such
programs is always subject to political whim. Kaye has proposed
transferring $40 million annually from the state's Abandoned
Property Fund to cover legal aid programs, but her plan has not
been acted upon by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Fees paid to court-assigned lawyers is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers are pushing for their first raise in 13 years,
noting that there is a push in Washington to increase the federal
rate to $75 per hour _ well above what New York pays. In addition,
defense lawyers are suing Kaye and the Court of Appeals, seeking an
increase in rates for lawyers who handle death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, attorneys who represent indigent defendants facing
the death penalty are paid between $100 and $125 per hour. That
rate was set in December after the previous pay range _ $150 to
$175 per hour _ resulted in a torrent of criticism from
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye's committee, in addition to recommending increased pay for
lawyers, also presented several other proposals to increase trust
and confidence in the legal system. Among the recommendations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide statewide sensitivity training for judges,
prosecutors, clerks and others on issues of bias and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Promote greater representation of minorities in the justice
system, particularly as judges.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forgive law school debts owed by graduates who agree to work
in an office that serves low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Streamline the court system so it is easier to understand and
navigate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encourage judges to become more involved in community
activities so they do not appear so isolated.

   SCI-VENTER-GENOME (Undated) _ A Scientist at Work: Dr. J. Craig
Venter, a pioneer in the sequencing, or decoding, of DNA, is
beginning a new venture of boundless ambition. And sequencing the
entire three billion letters of human DNA by the end of 2001, a
goal first announced last May, is just the start of his grand
design. Eventually, he hopes to build a giant database of genome
sequences for thousands of that will be as essential for biologists
and physicians as the Bloomberg data terminals are for the

similar federal government project. By Nicholas Wade. (1800 words)

regulations back into less-restricted settings. By Abigail Zuger.

   SCI-WARMING-WEATHER (Undated) _ Scientists have long been
convinced that global warming would affect large-scale atmospheric
circulation _ the big, swirling global air currents that dictate
where it is warm and cold, wet and dry, and where storms go. Now a
number of researchers say the frequency of these circulation
regimes, as they are called, is changing, with potential for
enormous long-term implications for weather around the world,

   SCI-MOTH-SEX (Undated) _ When it comes to sex there are many
males in the animal kingdom that can be counted on to contribute
little more to their mates than a moment of time and a bit of
sperm. But consider the male of the lowly rattlebox moth. This wisp
of a creature not only delivers a truly stunning sperm packet (the
proportional equivalent for a 170 pound man of a 17 pound
ejaculate) but, researchers report today, he includes within that
packet the unexpected bonus of a powerful toxin that can protect
his mate from predators for the rest of her life. By Carol Kaesuk
Yoon. (800 words)

<P>
   SCI-RELIGION-PRIZE (Undated) _ An essay: Despite a recent spate
of peace negotiations and displays of good fellowship by some of
the partisans on both sides, it doesn't look as if the
centuries-old row between religion and science is any closer to
resolution. The fact is that people cling to personal beliefs
regardless of debating points won or lost, and no amount of
persuasion makes much difference. But one thing that does make a
difference is cash. For most people the ultimate measure of success
is money, and by that standard religion is gaining on science. The
Nobel prizes in the sciences (which last year came to $978,000
each) have been shouldered into second place by the Templeton Prize
for Progress in Religion, which is now the world's richest award.

are bitten by dogs, 800,000 of them badly enough to require medical
treatment. At least 60 percent of dog bites and 72 percent of fatal
bites involve children. In fact, half of all children in this
country are bitten by a dog before their 12th birthday. And since
children are most often bitten on the face, many need plastic

   SCI-FUTURE-HEALTH (Undated) _ Every week, a group of doctors,
engineers, scientists and computer specialists get together at the
University of Rochester to talk over outlandish ideas, including
the notion that the future of medicine lies in devices that are
high-tech, cheap and controlled by patients. Like a bandage that
would screen for common infectious agents, memory glasses with a
databank of familiar faces that would whisper names into the ear,
body scanners that would check daily and report on the growth of
any melanoma. The sessions that gave rise to them has also given
birth to the Center for the Future of Health, a partnership that

healing arts. By John O'Neil. (1300 words)

chock-full of gadgets to keep track of the owner's health, right
down to the toilet. The model home, described earlier this month in
the Lancet, includes a bathroom equipped with sensors and
microchips that can provide a ``morning checkup'' by measuring the
user's weight, fat content and urine sugar levels. The bedroom has
an electrocardiometer, a blood-sugar meter and a thermometer, among
other gadgets, and links that can transfer their data not only to
the home computer or physician's office. By John O'Neil. (310

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Powered by ego, brilliance and bravery, Ehud Barak's
own exploits have helped create Israel's image of daring and unity.
</P>
<P>
   As an Israeli commando, he has disguised himself as a flight
technician when raiding a hijacked airliner. On another mission, he
dressed as a woman to infiltrate Beirut and assassinate Palestine
Libertation Organization (PLO) terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to the point in his career that Israeli officers
customarily adopt Hebrew names, he dropped his family name,
``Brog,'' for ``Barak.'' It means ``Lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he's a quiet, calculating man known for long-term planning.
His hobby since childhood has been fixing old watches and clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 57-years-old, it looks like his time has come.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Ehud Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier,
appeared to leading in the voting to become Israel's next prime
minister. He promises to bring unity to a country with such deep
and bitter divisions that they seem to defy the mythic Israel
Barak's heroics helped create.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections are maybe, in certain aspects, the most
crucial in a generation,'' he said recently, citing Israel's rifts
between rich and poor, and between religious and secular.
``Somehow, something happened in the last few years. The country is
at an impasse on every major issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's target, the man he repeatedly blames for everything
being ``stuck,'' is right-wing incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu, who
once raided a hijacked airline with Barak while they served in the
commandos together.
</P>
<P>
   Barak says Netanyahu was a good officer. He was especially close
to his brother, Yoni Netanyahu, the only Israeli commando killed in
the raid on the hijacked airliner in Entebbe, Uganda. Barak helped
plan, but did not go on the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends say they first began thinking of Barak as prime
minister material when he gave an eloquent eulogy at Yoni
Netanyahu's funeral in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But, Benjamin Netanyahu got the prime minister's job first.
Right-wing and combative, he became an emblem for the
hard-to-manage Israel, a country of divisions that is stalematedon
the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak to set that straight, the former commando will need to
adapt to the give-and-take of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good fighter. I hope he will be a good civilian,''
says an old army commander, Shaul Givoli.
</P>
<P>
   Barak hardly appears either a commando or a politician. Short
and paunchy, he has soft features and still appears stiff in
public. He dodged campaign debates with the quick-tongued
Netanyahu. Friends say he is often shy or even coldly arrogant. He
and his wife, Nava, have three daughters, but they have been slow
to wade into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Barak seems too analytical and blunt for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would have become of him had he been born a
Palestinian, the career soldier said, ``If I were a young
Palestinian, it is possible that I would join a terrorist
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   It caused a stir in the media and was used against him in
political commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Barak was born on a kibbutz, one of the old socialist
communal farms formed by European Jews. His performance in school
and the army vaulted him into Israel's elites. He was pegged as a
leader, even when he made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Givoli remembers when Barak got in trouble for losing maps
during an officer school exercise. Givoli considered expelling him,
but others persuaded him that Barak would one day lead the army.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Gil, one of Barak's early commanders, said he had
``discipline of steel and was always very obedient.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his army service, Barak got a physics degree at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Classmate Danny Michaelson said
Barak soon realized that physics did not offer enough ``action.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he ran reconnaissance teams behind enemy lines in the
war of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He rose to head army intelligence and eventually become army
chief of staff. There, he became a close adviser to then-Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   He's considered a peacemaker in the Rabin style -- tough and
pragmatic -- and eschews idealistic talk about harmony in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he talks of a ``separation'' between the Jews and
Palestinians, with high fences and tight security.
</P>
<P>
   He was slow to accept the Oslo peace process in 1993. But, he
oversaw some troop withdrawals when land was initially handed over
to the Palestinians and now he promises to speed up the
negotiations that Netanyahu has halted.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of strategic thinking comes easily to Barak. It's the
politics, with its hand-shaking and conspicuous shows of emotion,
that will be harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the real test,'' according to Avshalom Horan, among
the hundreds of old commando buddies working on Barak's campaign.
``It doesn't rely on the cerebral. It's a matter of personality and
leadership. He sees that as the major task in the agenda.''

 &HT;    AMERICANS JOINING WITH KOSOVAR REBELS FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY --
KOSOVO

<P>
   BURREL, Albania _ Frank Mehmeti -- his friends call him
``Nitty'' back in the neighborhood -- fears boredom may get him
before a Serb bullet can.
</P>
<P>
   At a countryside cafe -- the distinct smell of goats in the air
-- it is disconcerting to hear American English, much less this
Bronx accent, flowing from a soldier in a Kosovo Liberation Army
uniform. ``I was at a boxing match in April when I get a call on my
cellular (cellulah),'' the solidly built 24-year-old says as he
recounts his odyssey to Albania. ``They told me to go to this
restaurant to sign up.''
</P>
<P>
   He applied to renew his passport, and a few days later Mehmeti
was on a chartered airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmeti had twice put his name on lists -- once in Washington,
once in New York -- offering to join the fight in Kosovo. His
parents emigrated from the small Kosovar town of Llap in the the
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mehmeti was born and raised in the United States,
and is about as American as they come, he has a deep affection for
his family's homeland, which he visited 10 years ago. Five years
ago, he had a friend tattoo the black two-headed eagle of the
Albanian flag across his sizable forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, when he saw television footage of a massacre at a
Kosovar village, he vowed he would join the fight to liberate
Kosovo from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   He's now one of the approximately 80 Americans -- three of whom
are women -- training at a camp about seven miles from this poor
mountain village in the rugged mountains above Tirana, the Albanian
capital. They are called the Atlantic Brigade, an outfit composed
largely of Albanian-Americans from enclaves in New York, Detroit
and Chicago. Many wear U.S. flag patches on their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   They have been here about a month. They train six days a week
and have been taught how to use the weapons the rebel army has
acquired -- mostly an assortment of aging Russian and Chinese
rifles and machine guns. ``The training is very good, I think we're
ready,'' says Mehmeti, whose previous experience with weapons is
limited to hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mehmeti is a big man by Albanian standards, he was
assigned a heavy and powerful weapon, the name of which escapes
him. ``It's really awesome,'' he says with genuine enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Language is a major problem. He speaks the Albanian he learned
from his mother, but struggles to understand the accents here.
``Sometimes it's a problem with orders,'' he says. ``I don't know
if they're saying catch them or kill them. I guess I'll kill them
and ask questions later.''
</P>
<P>
   He borrowed the money in America to buy his uniform, helmet,
bullet-proof vest and other basics. He gets no pay beyond the
subsistence living the rebels provide recruits.
</P>
<P>
   At the cafe during a Sunday afternoon break from camp, he digs
in to a plate of goat meat, tomatoes, olives and cheese and bread.
``I have to tell you,'' he confesses with reluctance, ``The food at
the camp sucks. Fegeddaboudit.''
</P>
<P>
   At first the recruits were given bread and onions, standard
Albanian fare. But the Americans clamored for more substance --
particularly meat -- and soon their diet improved. Hot showers
remain a luxury. ``You have to wait in line behind all these guys
and then you just get a minute or two,'' he says. ``I haven't had a
shower in two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he misses America. ``I miss just being able to hang
around, the computer, my girlfriend,'' he says, a brief sadness
coming over him. For a moment, he looks more boy than man.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't think about all that too much; you gotta think
about today,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the present is a problem too. The Atlantic Brigade has
completed its training, and its members have watched as other
outfits have headed to the front. As NATO heads into its third
month of bombing Serb targets in neighboring Yugoslavia, it is
beginning to look as if the KLA leaders may be reluctant to send
the Americans into combat.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In Burrel, a KLA commander, who asked that his name not be used,
said that the rebel army makes no distinctions with regard to the
origins of its soldiers, many of whom have come from outside
Albania or Kosovo. ``They are all fighting to liberate Kosovo from
the Serb oppressor,'' he said. ``They are the same in our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehmeti has become so impatient that he asked to be transferred
to an Albanian unit headed to the front. ``They said 'no,' that I
have to stay with the unit I'm assigned to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The front, which shifts between the border between Albania and
Kosovo province, has been described by journalists as reminiscent
of World War I, with both sides dug in and firing at relatively
close range.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the guys who was with us, a French guy, got
transferred,'' Mehmeti says. ``We heard he was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he too is willing to die and is convinced he could kill
a Serb soldier. ``Hey, he'd kill me if I didn't,'' he said,
</P>
<P>
   ``Where I come from is a tough place,'' he says. ``We're used to
danger and guns. One of my friends was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get killed here, then it will at least it will be for a
purpose that's bigger than any one person,'' he says. ``If I get
killed at home, they'd say, 'Oh, it's just another street kid.'''

IN MATING, A FEMALE MOTH GAINS AN ARMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Calif., Ill.)   (af)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   When it comes to reproduction, there are many males in the
animal kingdom that contribute little more than a moment of time
and a bit of sperm. But not the rattlebox moth, whose generosity
while mating suggests many males have more to offer their mates
than researchers had ever suspected.
</P>
<P>
   This wisp of a male not only delivers a truly stunning sperm
packet _ fully one-tenth of his body weight _ but he also includes
within that packet the unexpected bonus of a powerful toxin that
can protect his mate from predators for the rest of her life,
according to two husband-wife teams of chemical ecologists, Andres
Gonzalez and Carmen Rossini, both graduate students, and Dr. Thomas
and Marie Eisner, all of Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   The reported the findings last week in The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly novel,'' Dr. Carol Boggs, an evolutionary
ecologist at Stanford University, said of the work. ``It's a very
elegant study.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the finding is a previously unknown example of a
widespread practice among animals and, in particular, among
insects: the giving of so-called nuptial gifts to females by males
before and during mating. Usually these gifts are food items, like
a tasty bit of caterpillar or other prey for snacking on during
copulation.
</P>
<P>
   But the new study suggests that, if this moth is any indication,
gift giving may have a wider scope.
</P>
<P>
   They say it is possible that many males may be discretely
handing out an arsenal of protective chemicals packed in with their
sperm to help their mates with the difficult work of surviving and
ultimately producing young.
</P>
<P>
   In their study of this moth, also known as Utetheisa ornatrix,
the researchers raised females whose bodies were free of the
toxins, known as alkaloids. These females were then mated either to
males that did contain alkaloids or to males that did not.
Researchers then took these females and tossed them into the webs
and jaws of spiders.
</P>
<P>
   They discovered that when spiders found females that had mated
with alkaloid-containing males in their webs, the spiders, rather
than eating the moths, immediately cut them out, setting them free.
When these females were dropped into the spiders' jaws, they were
quickly spit out.
</P>
<P>
   However, if females had been mated with males whose bodies and
hefty sperm packets were devoid of the toxin, the unprotected
females were consistently devoured.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers analyzed the chemical content of female moths
that had mated with alkaloid-containing males, they found that the
females' bodies were permeated with the chemical almost immediately
after uncoupling from the male. The alkaloid could even be found
right away in the moth's wings and its defensive froth _ a bubbling
mass of toxin that spews out from behind the insect's head.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had shown previously in this species that alkaloids
from fathers ended up in eggs, transmitted through the female,
something that has been seen in other species as well. The finding
fit well with the idea that fathers were protecting their offspring
_ their shot at an evolutionary future.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers say that until now, the possibility that the
mother might herself be receiving protection from the male had been
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed it hadn't been predicted before,'' Dr. Eisner said.
``It's not that he's an altruist. She carries the eggs and they're
his offspring, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said it could well be a widespread phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be some sort of isolated, gee-whiz insect
story,'' said Dr. Scott Sakaluk, a behavioral ecologist at Illinois
State University in Normal, Ill. ``There simply haven't been enough
studies of this sort done.''
</P>
<P>
   Utetheisa derives its alkaloids from the leaves and seeds of the
Crotalaria plant, also known as the rattlebox, a plant of the pea
family with small seeds that rattle in the inflated pods when they
ripen. The alkaloids in Crotalaria are so toxic that they can kill
cows that browse on the weed.
</P>
<P>
   Utetheisa moths eat Crotalaria plants when they are
caterpillars. They can also get alkaloids from their mothers as
eggs and, in the case of females, from their mates.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that for males, having enough toxin is critical.
Not only do females prefer to mate with males that contain more of
the chemical, but males require significant amounts of the alkaloid
to provide a potent donation during mating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a single mating,'' Gonzalez said, ``he could be passing 30
percent of what he has stored.'' And since females lose part of
their own stores with every egg they lay, he added, the amount they
receive during mating can be a big boost.
</P>
<P>
   For Utetheisa females then, it can be critical that the male she
mates with is using protection _ in the form of alkaloids. As Dr.
Eisner put it, ``At least there's one species where there's safe
sex.''

   ``A previously unreleased song, believed to be the last record
featuring all four Beatles, will be out in late summer. The

DECONGESTANT IS FOUND USELESS FOR YOUNG FLIERS' EARACHES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new study finds that giving children a decongestant does
nothing to ease the earaches they often suffer during takeoffs and
landings _ or, indirectly, the headaches that some neighboring
passengers sustain from the crying that follows.
</P>
<P>
   The news, unwelcome at any time of year, comes as many families
prepare to take airplane flights long and short over the summer
vacation season. The study appears this month in The Archives of
Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, published by the American
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The most useful advice the article held out to parents was an
editor's note from Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis, editor of the
journal. ``Give the child something to stimulate swallowing on
ascent and descent,'' she wrote, ``let nature take care of the
problem, and throw the medication out the door _ preferably before
you take off.''
</P>
<P>
   The study took a look at the effectiveness of pseudoephedrine, a
popular decongestant. Many adults who suffer from earaches when
they fly say the medication alleviates the problems. But although
parents are often advised by doctors or friends to try the drug if
their children have trouble flying, its effectiveness in children
has not been established, the authors of the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author, Dr. Brian J. Buchanan, a medical resident at
the University of California at Davis, said he began the study
because patients kept asking him about the drug and he was not sure
how to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers reviewed the experiences of 50 children who had
taken 91 flights. Parents of the children _ age 6 months to 6 years
_ were given either placebos or doses of pseudoephedrine to give
their children, along with questionnaires on which they reported
their observations.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors reviewed the results, they found that the children
who had been given the drug did not seem to suffer any less pain
over all than those who had been given the placebo. The children
who took pseudoephedrine did, however, appear drowsy 60 percent of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   But while drowsiness in the airborne young would delight many a
parent, the report cautioned against using pseudoephedrine to
achieve this effect.
</P>
<P>
   Earaches caused by air travel, known as aerotitis media, are
common, especially among young children. They develop as the plane
changes altitude and disparities occur between the air pressure in
the cabin and the pressure of the small amount of air within the
inner ear.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane rises and the cabin pressure decreases, the air
inside the ear expands, causing discomfort. Most children appear to
have more problems during the descent, as increasing cabin pressure
reverses the process.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors have suggested that children may be more prone to
the problem because of anatomical differences between their
eustachian tubes, the slender passageway responsible for equalizing
ear pressure, and those of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said that although he was not surprised the
decongestant had not proven helpful, he was surprised by the amount
of drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``While drowsiness is a known side effect of pseudoephedrine,''
he said, ``one would also expect to see a lot of excitability. And
we did not see as much of that as we expected.''

`SMART TOILET' IS OUT OF MEDICAL SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the electronics giant Matsushita is working on a
prototype house of the future chock-full of gadgets to keep track
of the owner's health _ right down to the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Health is not the only selling point in the ``Warp Square Home
Information Infrastructure,'' which the company hopes to have on
the market by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   There's video-on-demand and a link from the living room to an
``electronic town hall'' of municipal services. But the model home,
described this month in The Lancet, gives an idea of what a
doctor-turned-architect with a bushel of microchips might achieve
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The bedroom, for instance, has an electrocardiometer, a
blood-sugar meter and a thermometer, among other gadgets, and links
that can transfer their data not only to the home computer or
doctor's office, but also to the refrigerator and microwave, which
can then recommend recipes geared to your dietary needs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the bathroom where, at least in this vision of the
future, nothing will be secret. Sensors and microchips embedded in
the toilet can provide a ``morning checkup'' by measuring the
user's weight, fat content and urine sugar levels, plot the data
recorded and can immediately notify the user's insurance company or
doctor of the results _ if the user wants. There is also an
in-bathroom health and diet advice center linked to Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita engineers say the technology to deliver on this
prototype already exists. But it costs: the ``smart toilet'' alone
would be more than $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Akira Kadota, a Matsushita spokesman, said the company hoped the
health features would appeal to the elderly, whose numbers are
growing in all industrial countries, most rapidly in Japan, and
eventually to others with a keen interest in their well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 21st century, information services will be part of the
so-called lifelines, like electricity and gas,'' he said.

PERSONAL HEALTH: HEEDING WARNINGS FROM DANGEROUS DOGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that people and pets are spending more time outdoors, the
incidence of dog bites is about to soar, which is why the Humane
Society of the United States in conjunction with other concerned
agencies is once again urging the public to learn how to act around
dogs and what to do to prevent dog bites.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are cause for concern. Each year, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention estimates, 4.7 million people are
bitten by dogs, 800,000 of them badly enough to require medical
treatment. At least 60 percent of dog bites and 72 percent of fatal
bites involve children. Half of all children in this country are
bitten by a dog before their 12th birthday. And since children are
most often bitten on the face, many need plastic surgery to
minimize unsightly scars.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are schooled in how to behave around dogs, either
their own or someone else's, and many dog owners handle their pets
in ways that ask for trouble. Potentially disastrous encounters
between dogs and children _ or dogs and adults _ are extremely
common. A child tries to pet a dog on the street without first
asking if it is safe to do so. Or a child frightened by a dog runs
away, unwittingly inviting the animal to a chase. Adults, too, may
shout or flail at an aggressive dog or raise their arms to protect
themselves, which the dog may interpret as a threat that warrants
an attack. Or an adult may try to calm a frightened child by
saying, ``See, the dog is friendly, he's wagging his tail,'' when
tail-wagging can be a sign of anger or aggression as well as
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the concern is the fact that most bites are inflicted
not by strange dogs but by dogs belonging to the family, a friend
or a neighbor. In other words, the person bitten is known to the
dog but doesn't know how to behave around the dog to avoid being
bitten.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne Hunthausen, a veterinarian at Westwood Animal Hospital
in Westwood, Kan., who specializes in pet behavior, says children _
and, of course, adults too _ can learn how to act safely around
dogs and cats in just 30 minutes. That is how long it takes to view
the award-winning video he stars in, ``Dogs, Cats &AMP; Kids: Learning
to Be Safe with Animals,'' produced by Donald Manelli and
Associates and available for $19.95 plus $3.95 for shipping and
handling by telephoning (800) 337-3615.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone should know, for example, how to read a dog's body
language and know when to keep away. A fearful animal holds its
ears down, tucks its tail under its body and may shake, growl or
back away. But trying to befriend it, which many would do
instinctively, is inviting an attack, Hunthausen says. Likewise,
stay clear of a dog that is angry or aggressively protecting its
territory: ears are up and forward, eyes look directly at you, tail
is up and may be wagging slowly, hair may be standing up on the
neck, back and tail, and the dog is likely to be barking or
growling with teeth exposed. Cut a wide swath around such an
animal.
</P>
<P>
   If you are approached by an aggressive dog, whether you are a
child or an adult, the best defense is to freeze. Act like a tree:
perfectly still with hands in fists held close to the body, don't
yell or say anything and don't look at the animal. Dogs interpret
direct eye contact as a threat or challenge. If a dog knocks you
down, act like a rock: roll into a fetal position with knees up,
elbows tucked in and hands in fists held against your ears.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of children are bitten by dogs they know. When
petting any dog, pet along the side or back of the animal's body,
not the head, face or ears, which are more sensitive. Don't tease
the dog or play rough with it. Play safe games like fetch or
Frisbee, not tug-of-war. Learn to respect the dog's private times.
Never bother a dog when it is eating, resting, sleeping or chewing
on something.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Hunthausen said, ``kids assume they can treat a
neighbor's dog the way they treat their own.'' Don't pet a dog that
is not your own without permission. A dog belonging to someone else
should not be petted unless an adult is present. Ask whether the
dog is friendly and if it is OK to pet it.
</P>
<P>
   If you are given the go-ahead, move slowly toward the dog so as
not to frighten it, and don't immediately reach out your hand to
pet it. Instead, first make a loose fist and hold it out toward the
dog with the back of your hand up and a little ways from the side
of your body. Let the dog decide whether it wants to come up and
sniff your hand. ``If it doesn't, that's where the greeting should
stop,'' said Hunthausen, who is a co-editor or co-author of two
professional texts on pet behavior and training. Never chase after
a dog that is not interested in playing with you.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
offers more some additional advice: Do not tease dogs behind
fences, do not go near dogs chained up in yards or tied to trees or
poles with leashes or ropes and don't touch dogs that are outside
and off leashes. Never go near a stray dog.
</P>
<P>
   If you are charged by a dog, don't yell or scream, but
immediately offer an article of clothing, gym bag, purse or other
item for the animal to tug on, recommends Jacque Schultz, director
of special projects in the A.S.P.C.A.'s animal sciences division.
And if a dog should grab your arm or leg, instead of pulling away,
push into the animal's mouth as hard as you can, Ms. Schultz
advises.
</P>
<P>
   It will cause the dog to feel like it is losing control of the
situation and it will let go and run away, she said. This tactic
will also keep your flesh from tearing against the dog's teeth as
you pull away. This technique was part of the protective training
she gave last year to field workers for Con Edison in New York, and
one worker already reported using it and escaping with just a torn
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society notes that by spaying or neutering a dog,
owners can reduce by three-fold the risk that the animal will bite
someone. Owners should also be especially cautious when dogs are in
new situations or are around people they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Every dog and its owner should go through behavior training,
preferably when the animal is young. Dogs should be properly
socialized to being with people and other dogs and in a wide
variety of situations so that they are less easily frightened.
Training is best done, Hunthausen said, when the dog is a 8 to 10
weeks old. At this age, they learn with lightning speed, much
faster than at 6 or 8 months, he said. Ask your local vet to
recommend a trainer or puppy classes.
</P>
<P>
   Hunthausen also said dogs learned best when rewarded for doing
the right thing, rather than when punished for doing something
wrong. He insists that owners should never use harsh physical
punishment, prong collars, shock collars and other painful training
techniques. In his experience, dog bites often follow harsh
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Owners must also supervise their pets, obey leash laws and deal
swiftly aggressive behavior. Hunthausen says owners often make the
mistake of trying to calm a dog by petting it when it acts
aggressively, but this only serves to reward the animal and
reinforce the unwanted behavior. As with any unwanted behavior, the
owner must let the dog know who is boss and that the boss is
displeased. In this case, the owner should take control and
immediately remove the dog from the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, an owner should never defend a dangerous dog. Any dog
that commits an unprovoked, uninhibited severe or fatal attack must
be destroyed. It is not safe to send it to another location or
owner.

A NEW ROLE FOR TOBACCO  
 TRACKING SPACE

   Tobacco has a deservedly terrible reputation. But a team of
British scientists has developed a potential use for the crop that
may prove beneficial. Genetically engineered tobacco, these
scientists report, may be used to clean up soil that has been
contaminated with explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of using biology to clean up TNT and other
contaminants around weapons factories is not new. But most research
has focused on using bacteria or fungi, methods that often require
excavation of the soil, an expensive proposition.
</P>
<P>
   It would be much more efficient to simply grow a detoxifying
crop at the site. But plants have not been very effective at
breaking down TNT.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, reported in this month's issue of the journal
Nature Biotechnology, essentially combines the two approaches. The
scientists identified a bacterial gene that produces an enzyme that
breaks down TNT into harmless components. Then they transferred the
gene to tobacco plants.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting plants were able to grow in soil with levels of
contaminants that would kill regular tobacco. And the engineered
tobacco broke down the TNT much more rapidly than normal plants.
The researchers are now planning field tests. &QL;

   Satellites do their share of peeking at people, but serious
skygazers know that people can peek back. Many orbiting spacecraft
are visible just after dusk or before dawn, when they are high
enough to reflect sunlight even as observers below are in darkness.
They appear like slow-moving stars traveling across the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has always been knowing when and where to look. But
the task has just been made easier by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, which has developed software to enable
observers to follow their favorite satellites, as well as space
shuttle flights, Mir and the new International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The program calculates visible satellite passes based on the
user's latitude and longitude and can display a sky chart showing
the satellite's track.
</P>
<P>
   Called J-Pass, it is available via a NASA web site
(liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/RealTime/JPass/20/). Computer users can also
sign up for an e-mail program that will alert them to passes of up
to 20 satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of software, a program called SETI(AT)home lets
computer users participate in the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence, is now available.
</P>
<P>
   Developed at the University of California at Berkeley, the free
screen saver program uses spare processing time on PCs to analyze
signals received by radio telescopes for signs of an alien origin.
It can be downloaded at setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/.

<P>
   Scientists have long been convinced that global warming, whether
natural or caused by human action, would amount to much more than a
simple, uniform rise in temperature. One response of the climate
system to warming, for instance, might be the creation of new
patterns of large-scale atmospheric circulation _ the big, swirling
global air currents that dictate where it is warm and cold, wet and
dry, and where storms go.
</P>
<P>
   It has been thought that these new circulation patterns would be
distinctly different from the kind that now exist. But lately, in
an effort to understand better how broad changes in climate might
affect day-to-day weather, experts have begun to scrutinize the
patterns more closely. Now a number of researchers say that instead
of producing new patterns, global warming may instead be changing
the frequency with which existing circulation regimes, as they are
called, come and go. And that would have enormous long-term
implications for weather around the world.
</P>
<P>
   One recent study, for example, suggests that warming may provoke
more frequent appearances of El Nino, the vast pool of warm water
in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean that from time to time
touches off widespread meteorological havoc.
</P>
<P>
   Another suggests that warming may have some connection to more
frequent appearances of a circulation regime whose prevailing winds
deliver more warmth and precipitation to northern Eurasia and
northwestern North America _ while generally cooling the United
States east of the Rockies and drying out southern Europe and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   These regimes, including the circulation pattern associated with
El Nino, have indeed become prevalent in recent decades, when a
centurylong rise in average global surface temperature has been the
steepest. The temperature has risen in the last 100 years by about
1 degree Fahrenheit or a little more, to nearly 60 degrees, with
the 1990s ranking as the warmest decade of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant view among experts is that rising emissions of
heat-trapping waste industrial gases like carbon dioxide are
responsible for at least some of the warming. If emissions are not
reduced, according to this view, the average global surface
temperature will rise by another 3.5 degrees, more or less, in the
21st century. By comparison, the world is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now
than in the depths of the last ice age some 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have long said that one effect of global warming will be
to alter precipitation patterns _ increasing rainfall in some
places while decreasing it in others. A warmer atmosphere,
according to this view, causes more water to evaporate from the
surface. Also, a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, so that
when a storm system comes through a given locality to make it rain,
the rain is heavier. Data collected and analyzed by federal
scientists suggest that there is indeed a trend in that direction
in the United States. Conversely, where it does not rain, a warmer
atmosphere might make droughts worse.
</P>
<P>
   But however much rain may fall in a given spot, it is the
atmospheric circulation patterns that determine where those spots
are, and also where it is colder or warmer on a given day. Now
scientists are increasingly concentrating on those patterns, and
they are finding that in many parts of the world they flip back and
forth between two alternating, semistable regimes, on time scales
of years and decades. The most familiar of these oscillations is
that of El Nino and its cold-water counterpart, La Nina. In it,
sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific perpetually
alternate between warmer and colder states. The two regimes bring
about different patterns of storm tracks and air mass movements.
</P>
<P>
   Similar oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific
produce alternating regimes whose wind patterns determine how
storms, heat and cold affect the Northern Hemisphere land masses,
particularly in winter and spring. Some scientists believe these
two oscillations may be tied together by a third, this one bridging
the Arctic.

COPING WITH A POST-TRAGEDY MEDIA PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grover Cooper found himself ``reliving a nightmare'' as he
watched the tragedy unfold last month at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   He watched as police tried to reach the dead and wounded in the
high school, then turned off the TV set and walked away. He
couldn't take it any more.
</P>
<P>
   He had had no choice but to ``take it'' a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was the superintendent of the Westside school district in
Jonesboro, Ark., when four students and a teacher were fatally shot
March 24, 1998, at Westside Middle School. Ten others were wounded
by two students at the middle school when they fled the building
after a fire alarm went off. (The alarm had been triggered by one
of the assailants).
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who is 67, retired last summer _ he had announced his
retirement prior to that tragic day in March.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped giving interviews to the outside news media shortly
after the shooting. He agreed to talk to me about his experience
with the media because of the intercession of his son, Roger, who
is an associate professor at TCU's department of radio, TV and
film.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Cooper said it was the outside news media that created a
major problem for him and others involved in the Jonesboro tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they came to give us a problem, but when they
jammed in, they did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said it didn't take long for the national media to arrive
after the school-ground shootings. ``It looked like the Super Bowl
parking lot,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was the insensitivity of many of the outside
reporters that most upset him and other residents of Jonesboro. The
insensitivity was often displayed in the questions they asked, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the question that upset them most was: ``How do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you think we would feel after something like this
happened to us?'' Cooper said. ``... You usually are too numb to
know. One man answered, `How would you feel?' I wish I had said
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the journalists who went to Jonesboro acted as
if they ``had left their feelings someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper recalled one reporter who called ``at 10 or 11 at night
and wanted to ask some questions. I had just come in from three
funerals, and I told him I had two to go to tomorrow and I didn't
want to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reporter just kept pressing, Cooper said. ``I couldn't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the behavior of local journalists was in sharp contrast
to that of their colleagues from outside the area. ``Many were
crying as they worked,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He said he remembered one local TV reporter who approached him
shortly after the shooting. Cooper said he was hoping the reporters
would not ask him any questions at that particular moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in the world he did was slap me on the shoulder and say,
`Grover, I'm sorry,''' Cooper said. ``I won't forget that. It was
more than a story for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said that after microphones and cameras had been shoved
in the faces of witnesses and other residents of Jonesboro, school
officials moved all of the news media to a parking area across a
road from the school grounds and said they could venture onto the
campus only with permission.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a few of the journalists protested but that he
replied, ``There is no negotiation on this.'' Only three or four of
the journalists violated the restriction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The retired school superintendent said he also was bothered by
the attitude of some of the outside journalists: ``They had the
attitude that `there is a story here, and you owe it to us to give
it to us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper characterized most of the reporting on the Jonesboro
tragedy as fair and accurate.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has given several speeches, mostly to school
administrators, about the shooting, and ``I always tell them that
probably 95 percent of the media people were all right, and that
probably is as good as you would get of superintendents.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him what advice he would like to give to the press
concerning future coverage of such horrors. He said he would advise
them:
</P>
<P>
   _Be more sensitive, especially concerning the questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't stick cameras and microphones into the faces of those who
do not want to be interviewed or photographed. Ask their
permission.
</P>
<P>
   _Reduce the number of people sent to the scene so as not to make
a bad situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   _Respect the ground rules set up by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   He also had some advice for officials who will be confronted by
similar situations in the future:
</P>
<P>
   _Confine the news media to a convenient site off the school
grounds in order to provide protection to those who do not want to
be photographed or interviewed. (He stressed such a site should not
be ``on the north 40.'')
</P>
<P>
   _Hold regular press briefings so the journalists will be
provided with timely and accurate information.
</P>
<P>
   _Do not restrain those who are willing to be interviewed and
photographed.
</P>

 UNDATED: the Arctic.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this stage of research, scientists cannot firmly link global
warming to changes in circulation patterns. But one study by
British and Italian scientists, reported recently in the journal
Nature, examined data on atmospheric circulation over the last 50
years in the Northern Hemisphere. The researchers looked to see
whether there had been any change in frequency of large-scale
circulation regimes. The data revealed that there had: in recent
decades, patterns had shifted to favor a warmer climate for most
land areas in the Northern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   In a general warming of the globe, the air above those land
areas would be expected to warm more than that above the oceans,
because of differing abilities to absorb heat. But the authors of
the new study postulate that the change in circulation patterns is
the main reason the land has lately warmed so much.
</P>
<P>
   That is, they say, the climate of the hemisphere shifts
naturally back and forth between two dominant regimes. Both the
North Atlantic and North Pacific oscillations are believed to be
affected by this shift. But if some external influence imparts a
warming or cooling impulse, the scientists say, the oscillation
could be tipped in favor of one regime or the other. The external
influence could be either natural, like a change in solar
radiation, or artificial, like carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is that you can understand much of the
observed climate change in terms of that picture,'' said Dr. Tim
Palmer, a climatologist at the European Center for Medium-Range
Weather Forecasts in Reading, England, and one of the study's
authors. While the study does not prove that human-induced global
warming is what caused the change in frequency of circulation
patterns, he said, the change is consistent with it.
</P>
<P>
   Such global warming would not produce new types of weather
patterns, he said, but it would change the probability of
occurrence of existing ones, Palmer said. And differing regional
patterns of warming are a direct consequence of that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another oscillation, in the Arctic, involves the strength of
high-altitude winds that circle the North Pole near the Arctic
Circle. The winds oscillate between stronger and weaker states,
with consequences for weather and climate farther south. Some
experts believe that the Arctic oscillation is being altered by
global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that at certain critical altitudes, roughly from 6
to 12 miles, increasing carbon dioxide has the effect of warming
the tropics but cooling the polar regions. This would increase the
temperature contrast between the two regions and thereby strengthen
the pole-girdling vortex of winds. This, according to the new
thinking, would in turn strengthen westerly winds off the Atlantic,
making northern Eurasia warmer and wetter.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, like Dr. John Michael Wallace, an atmospheric
scientist at the University of Washington, think that the Arctic
and North Atlantic oscillations are so closely tied together as to
be the same thing. The effects of the Arctic oscillation over the
North Pacific, he said, are more subtle. ``It's hard to see them
clearly,'' he said, ``because another big thing is going on there;
that's the variability related to El Nino.''
</P>
<P>
   The El Nino-La Nina cycle is the strongest year-to-year natural
climatic oscillation. The two alternating states have markedly
different effects on weather. In a strong El Nino, for instance,
prevailing jet-stream winds slam into the southern tier of the
United States, producing floods, mudslides and tornadoes. In La
Nina, the central United States typically gets very cold weather as
well as tornadoes, while much of the East is warm and tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, El Nino has appeared every two to seven years,
with La Nina showing up less often. But over the last two decades,
El Nino has appeared more frequently than before, and in much of
the 1990s it seemed to go on more or less continuously. Could this
be related to global warming?
</P>
<P>
   A number of scientists have raised the possibility. Dr. Kevin
Trenberth, a climate researcher at the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., has postulated that the
time interval between El Nino visitations depends on how long it
takes to recharge the tropical system by re-accumulating heat at
the sea surface. Global warming, he suggests, may enable the system
to recharge more rapidly, thereby making El Nino appear more often.
</P>
<P>
   Another study reported recently in Nature appeared to lend some
credence to this view. The researchers, at the Max Planck Institute
for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, used a computerized model of
the climate system's general circulation to investigate the effects
of global warming on El Nino's frequency. In the past, these
climate models have been unable to simulate the behavior of the
tropical Pacific finely enough to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Max Planck researchers said they had overcome that problem,
and their computer simulation produced more frequent El Nino
conditions as well as more powerful La Nina events.
</P>
<P>
   None of this constitutes anything remotely approaching a last
word on the response of the climate system's natural churnings to
global warming. But as Wallace says, experts have begun focusing on
responses ``that look like distortions of natural patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   All those patterns are part of a single, integrated climate
system, and scientists are just beginning to zero in on how they
relate to one another in the context of a warming atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   That task only makes the problem of climate change more
complicated than ever. &QL;

SHOULD YOU READ THE BOOK BEFORE OR AFTER YOU SEE THE MOVIE?
</HEADLINE>
 (Accompanies STARWARS-CHARACTERS, STARWARS-HYPE, STARWARS-TV) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is basically just one question about ``Star Wars: Episode
I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you read the book before or after you see the movie?
</P>
<P>
   Read ``The Phantom Menace'' before and you know what's going to
happen onscreen. Computer geeks call such information ``spoilers.''
You won't be surprised when trunk-nosed Jar Jar Binks emerges from
some planetary ooze, and you won't be shocked when young Anakin
Skywalker does what he does in the big podrace.
</P>
<P>
   Read ``The Phantom Menace'' after you see the movie and you can
reminisce about favorite onscreen moments, but you won't be way
ahead of all your ``Star Wars''-obsessed pals who've been counting
down the days until the opening of George Lucas' long-anticipated,
second-force-be-with-you film trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   Read ``The Phantom Menace'' any time and you'll be settling for
paste-and-cut pap. Sorry to have to say this, but it happens to be
true. It isn't in any sense, except print on paper, a ``real''
book. It's a Lucas moneymaker, just like those plastic action
figures that'll sell in the millions come Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   We forget, what with all the hoopla about the films, that ``Star
Wars'' as a story pretty much relies on the most ancient theme in
storytelling: Good guys, aided by some magic, vs. bad guys, using
corrupt magic. Essentially, ``Star Wars'' is King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table, but with better special effects.
Calling ``Star Wars'' derivative is not meant to be an insult; John
Steinbeck's superb ``East of Eden'' was revamped Cain vs. Abel. But
we can't give points for literary innovation where none occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ballantine hired a very good sci-fi writer, Terry
Brooks, to flesh out Lucas' screenplay. Brooks has a long,
honorable track record as a writer, starting with his ``Sword of
Shannara'' series that even charmed readers who ordinarily disdain
sci-fi. In his hands, ``The Phantom Menace'' is delivered in solid
style. There are colorful descriptions of new ``creatures'' and
lightsaber duels. Readers trundle along the dusty sands of desert
planets and consider the unique makeup techniques of a pubescent
queen. New bad-guy Darth Maul is much nastier-looking than Darth
Vader ever was. We learn more about the origins of the Jedi and
meet C-3PO and R2-D2 in their younger droid days.
</P>
<P>
   But the real excitement in ``Star Wars'' tales must always be
visual, which is why the movies are justly considered epics. And
although it's true that ``Star Wars'' knockoff novels have sold
pretty well, how many of their readers do you suppose don't also
own the first three ``Star Wars'' films in one of their many
videocassette formats?
</P>
<P>
   So ``The Phantom Menace'' bogs down in print. Instead of
creating their own mental images of characters and actions, readers
try to imagine what George Lucas is about to show them on a movie
screen. It's pretty much an impossible task.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I strongly recommend ``Star Wars'' junkies put off
reading ``The Phantom Menace'' until after they've seen the movie.
Accept it _ ``Star Wars'' will always be movie fare first and
foremost, with books lagging far behind. Wait to read the book
until after you've seen the film. The loss of cinematic surprise
isn't worth the limited charms of the story in print.
</P>
<P>
   And, should you doubt the book's purpose is more to make money
than to entertain, consider this: ``The Phantom Menace'' is being
published with four different dust jackets, each depicting a
different ``Episode I'' character. Do all four jackets come with
each single $25 book? Heck, no. You have to buy four different
books to get a complete collection of the covers, and a lot of
``Star Wars'' collectors will do exactly that.

IN PRIZES FOR SCIENCE AND RELIGION, THE PERSON OF FAITH IS RICHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Tenn., Pa.)   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite recent peace negotiations and displays of good
fellowship by partisans on both sides, it doesn't look as if the
centuries-old row between religion and science is any closer to
resolution than it was when Galileo nearly went to the stake for
defending the Copernican view of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that people cling to personal beliefs regardless of
debating points won or lost, and no amount of persuasion makes much
difference. But one thing that does make a difference is cash.
</P>
<P>
   For most people the ultimate measure of success is money, and by
that standard religion is gaining on science. The Nobel Prizes in
the sciences (which last year came to $978,000 each) have been
shouldered into second place by the Templeton Prize for Progress in
Religion, which is now the world's richest award.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Templeton Prize, this year worth $1.24 million, was
bestowed last Tuesday by Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace on Dr.
Ian G. Barbour, a physicist-turned-theologian from Carleton College
in Northfield, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   A ceremony honoring the new Templeton laureate was also
scheduled this week at a church in Moscow's Kremlin. The John
Templeton Foundation declared that Barbour had ``shown
extraordinary originality in advancing humankind's understanding of
God and/or spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation was created in 1972 by Sir John M. Templeton, the
Tennessee-born founder of several investment funds, who was
knighted in 1987. Abundant money from the Templeton Foundation in
Radnor, Pa., seems to turn up these days wherever science and
religion come into contact.
</P>
<P>
   Some typical Templeton initiatives: a $10 million theological,
social and scientific study of forgiveness; a ``scientific study of
humility theology''; a string of new periodicals, including the
magazine Science and Spirit (devoted to articles deemed helpful in
reconciling religion and science); and the financing of many
experimental tests of religious tenets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Templeton-sponsored experiments is a two-year study
to demonstrate the effect of prayer on 600 patients about to
undergo heart surgery. Two groups were told they might be prayed
for. One of these groups actually was the object of prayers while
the other was not, but neither group was told which was which. A
third group, also intended for prayers, was informed that it was
the beneficiary of prayer. Results of this experiment are not in
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, conducted a similar
experiment in 1872 and found no effect. Undaunted, religious
believers have continued power-of-prayer experiments, generally
failing to convince their scientist critics of any effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Templeton Foundation is not alone in supporting prayer
experiments. In his book, ``Healing Words'' (Harper San Francisco,
1993), Dr. Larry Dossey described four experiments in which yeast
fungus was exposed to cyanide poison. Dossey, a medical doctor,
wrote that when people prayed for the survival of a sample of
cyanide-tainted yeast, its survival rate was better than that of a
control sample bereft of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Templeton Foundation pays handsomely to organize and
publicize discussions between intellectual leaders in science and
religion. Such a meeting, held under the prestigious aegis of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, took place in
Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   It featured a debate between Dr. Steven Weinberg, a staunch
supporter of the scientific paradigm, and Sir John Polkinghorne, a
former physicist who is now an Anglican priest.
</P>
<P>
   The Weinberg-Polkinghorne debate, while entertaining, did not
resolve any differences.
</P>
<P>
   However, theological debate in the right hands can yield good
fun, and once again, it has served as grist for the mill of Dr.
David Jones, alias ``Daedalus,'' whose weekly column in the journal
Nature has delighted readers for many years.
</P>
<P>
   The formal aim of the Templeton Foundation is to ``create and
fund projects to apply scientific methodology to the study of
religious subjects,'' and technically, the tongue-in-cheek
experiments proposed by Jones, a professor at the University of
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, should meet the Templeton criterion.
</P>
<P>
   In two columns in Nature in April, Daedalus proposed experiments
exploring the thermodynamics of the spirit world and the molecular
basis of religious experience. He suggested that the spirit world,
like empty outer space, probably has a temperature of only three
degrees above the absolute zero: the temperature of the microwave
echo of the Big Bang. This would explain why a ghost invading the
warm material world from the frigid spirit world has a chilling
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive instruments, Daedalus wrote, should be able to discern
the leakage of heat from the material world into the spirit world,
and detect a different rate of heat leakage from a holy object than
from an object with no religious significance.
</P>
<P>
   Daedalus proposes another experiment carrying out brain scans on
monks and nuns at prayer, identifying the brain regions associated
with a sense of contact with God, and other regions suffering ``the
dark night of the soul,'' where prayer ``feels like talking into a
dead telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   A nuclear magnetic resonance scan of the divine-connection
region of the brain might reveal the composition of the molecules
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent laboratory synthesis of these molecules could lead to
production of ``Theological Prozac,'' Daedalus suggested, and
``With luck, the resulting illumination will bestow spiritual
comfort on the users, unaccompanied by the stern orthodox
convictions attached to it by the more doctrinal aspects of
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier columns Daedalus proposed attaching sensitive
piezoelectric transducers, accelerometers and other instruments to
dying people to detect the departure of their souls and to measure
the soul's mass, velocity and quantum-mechanical spin.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has not disclosed whether he intends to submit any of his
schemes to the Templeton Foundation for a possible grant or prize.

<P>
   It is hard to put a smile on the rash, foolish and pointlessly
vindictive decision of Russian President Boris Yeltsin to dismiss
his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, this week.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Primakov was neither a miracle worker nor a bold
reformer. He was adept at making mischief for the West, even as
Russia's own powers, economic and military, continued to wane.
</P>
<P>
   But he commanded some respect at home, and at least offered a
respite of stability that was good for his country and so, on the
whole, good for the world.
</P>
<P>
   In diplomatic affairs, he was experienced, sober and sometimes
sensible. In economic matters, he was less confident, yet during
his eight-month tenure Russia's economy did not sink altogether out
of sight, as some had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Now confusion _ and the possibility even of bloodshed and the
demise of Russia's frail democracy _ are back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear who will end up on top. Constitutional procedure
is blurry. Consensus is nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin will probably fend off an impending attempt by the Duma,
Russia's lower house of parliament, to impeach him, but his efforts
to do so (with the expected help of friendly judges on the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts) will make it even harder for him
to persuade a furious Duma to accept a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional turmoil, likely to last weeks if not months,
could well end with the Duma's dissolution, an early general
election, and a new parliament even nastier and less inclined to
cooperate with the president than is the present one.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin should himself have long ago resigned: fitful and
distempered, he is manifestly not up to the task of running Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Barring his early exit, the least bad hope was that he would
totter along, letting his government and prime minister stave off a
total collapse of the state, while political attention shifted
first to the general election due by December and then to the
presidential poll next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Primakov seemed as well suited as anyone to keeping
the show more or less on the road. Certainly, Yeltsin's choice for
an interim prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, inspires no more
confidence: he is imbued with the morals and methods of the
interior ministry (and helped run the war in Chechnya), whereas
Primakov was nurtured by the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Why, in any event, did Yeltsin do it? Magnificent as he was in
the days when he did so much to destroy the Soviet Union from
within, he seems motivated nowadays less by a wish to do good to
Russia than to keep power for himself.
</P>
<P>
   The only half-rational explanation for his dismissal of Primakov
is irritation at the prime minister's relative popularity, at his
modest success in bringing down some of Yeltsin's more venal
cronies, and at the prospect that Primakov might himself be elected
president in a year's time.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is probably now unhelpable, best left to stew in its own
juice. The sacking of its prime ministers is becoming a routine
event: Stepashin is the fourth nominee for the job in barely a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial collapse last August set off a train of
events that caused damage as far away as Latin America, but most of
the delicate economies of Central Europe and the former Soviet
empire have managed to stay upright against the baleful Russian
wind. It is hard to imagine Russia now doing much more economic
harm.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that were to prove false, there may be little that
outsiders can do to make matters better. Certainly, the West should
resist the argument that it, through the IMF, should bail out
Russia in return for cooperation over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of a hostile Duma, Primakov made little progress
towards meeting the Fund's minimal requirements for new loans,
notably the revamping of the tax and banking systems. Stepashin is
unlikely to do any better.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Russia should neither be ignored nor rejected. It
should be a welcome partner for the West and, in particular, it
could play a part in a Kosovo settlement that would be useful both
to itself and to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   With its rusting but still frightening stack of nuclear
warheads, its geographical reach across ten time zones, its
capacity for bullying small neighbors, and its ability to stir the
emotions of Slavdom against the seeming arrogance of NATO and the
West, even a decrepit Russia has to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   And so it will be _ if it has a government to represent it
effectively. But as long as Yeltsin remains president that seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The chances are still that he will give way, at least by the
middle of 2000, either to Moscow's canny, crony-capitalist mayor,
Yuri Luzhkov, or, possibly, to Primakov or, less likely, to a
cantankerous but probably more honest ex-general, Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
   It is just conceivable that a more frighteningly nationalist
figure will emerge. The confusion that Yeltsin has stirred this
week is much more likely to breed that sort of extremist. &QL;

<P>
   Deadlines missed, settlements expanded, the peace process
stalled: a glance at the past three years suggests it would be
reckless to entrust Benjamin Netanyahu with parish-pump
negotiations, let alone the future of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the view of the Palestinians and his Israeli
opponents. But listen also to Netanyahu's erstwhile colleagues, who
worked with him closely until, in despair, they gave up.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister lacks probity, integrity, decency, they
grumble; he makes a promise in the morning and breaks it in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Is such a fellow, as depicted by one-time friends, the right
person to have at the helm as Israel approaches historic decisions
that could define its long-term relations with its neighbors in the
Arab world?
</P>
<P>
   The decisions themselves cannot be avoided. Although the Oslo
peace process is often pronounced dead, Israeli voters are probably
right in assuming that it will return to some sort of life
whichever prime minister they elect.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu dislikes the Oslo arrangements, but he is bound into
them. Moreover, except for a few diehards, right-wing Israelis now
base their objections to handing back land to the Palestinians on
security (a debatable subject), rather than on Israel's sacred
rights (non-debatable).
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, although Netanyahu never got around to talking to the
Syrians, the sharp rise in Israeli casualties in Syrian-controlled
Lebanon makes it imperative that a deal of some sort is worked out
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The doubt is whether a Netanyahu-led government could or would
be able to bring talks with the Palestinians to a conclusion that
they were at all able to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was elected Israel's prime minister in 1996, Netanyahu
insisted that the Palestinians, facing a new ``strong'' leader,
would have to lower their expectations. He has been repeating that
mantra in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet expectations, of Palestinians or anyone else, cannot go on
being lowered forever without some consequence. The very real
danger is that Netanyahu might try to push the Palestinians so far
below their minimum demands that their own government could no
longer keep its citizens under control.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu correctly says that fewer Israelis have been killed by
Palestinian terrorism on his watch than in the previous period. It
does not follow that the next three years will be equally secure.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his men, deeply unpopular
among their own people for being unable to deliver either a
political agreement or prosperity or good government, continue to
call for patience and restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians see Jewish settlements burgeoning on the land
they want to make their state, while their own security forces
cooperate with Israel's to keep violence in check. There are
multiple signs of a conflict-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that time is on the side of a second Netanyahu
experiment is wholly improbable. The alternative is that the
Israelis elect Ehud Barak, the Labor leader, to be their next prime
minister on May 17 (or June 1 if there is no outright winner next
Monday).
</P>
<P>
   Barak is at present comfortably ahead of Netanyahu in the
opinion polls _ but Labor traditionally does better in pre-election
polls than in the elections themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was an intelligent choice to succeed Shimon Peres after
Labor lost the 1996 vote. An intellectual former chief of staff,
festooned with military decorations, nobody can accuse him of
Peres's alleged indulgence towards the Palestinians (Peres was once
a hawkish defense minister, but that is forgotten).
</P>
<P>
   His main known failing is a wooden manner. His political skills
are neither proven nor disproven.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's freedom for initiative, like Netanyahu's, would be
circumscribed by the coalition he would lead. Many Israelis look
towards a national-unity government, encompassing the Likud as well
as Labor.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this should be the perfect answer for polarized,
indecisive Israel; in practice, the record of Israel's previous
national-unity governments has been poor, with little achieved on
the Arab front.
</P>
<P>
   But if Barak were able to pull together a reasonably like-minded
coalition, the advance towards a Palestinian settlement could be
swift.
</P>
<P>
   Although May 4 _ the deadline that Oslo had decreed for a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian agreement _ has slipped by, much of
the donkey-work has been done, either before the change of
government in 1996 or, unofficially, since.
</P>
<P>
   The various outlines at present stuffed into drawers are based
on degrees of compromise by both sides and suggest that few of the
``insuperable'' questions are really insuperable.
</P>
<P>
   The essential first step, however, is up to Israel's voters next
Monday. It is the step of choosing Barak. &QL;

<P>
   That, of course, is the view of the Palestinians and his Israeli
opponents. But listen also to Netanyahu's erstwhile colleagues, who
worked with him closely until, in despair, they gave up.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister lacks probity, integrity, decency, they
grumble; he makes a promise in the morning and breaks it in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Is such a fellow, as depicted by one-time friends, the right
person to have at the helm as Israel approaches historic decisions
that could define its long-term relations with its neighbors in the
Arab world?
</P>
<P>
   The decisions themselves cannot be avoided. Although the Oslo
peace process is often pronounced dead, Israeli voters are probably
right in assuming that it will return to some sort of life
whichever prime minister they elect.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu dislikes the Oslo arrangements, but he is bound into
them. Moreover, except for a few diehards, right-wing Israelis now
base their objections to handing back land to the Palestinians on
security (a debatable subject), rather than on Israel's sacred
rights (non-debatable).
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, although Netanyahu never got around to talking to the
Syrians, the sharp rise in Israeli casualties in Syrian-controlled
Lebanon makes it imperative that a deal of some sort is worked out
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The doubt is whether a Netanyahu-led government could or would
be able to bring talks with the Palestinians to a conclusion that
they were at all able to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was elected Israel's prime minister in 1996, Netanyahu
insisted that the Palestinians, facing a new ``strong'' leader,
would have to lower their expectations. He has been repeating that
mantra in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet expectations, of Palestinians or anyone else, cannot go on
being lowered forever without some consequence. The very real
danger is that Netanyahu might try to push the Palestinians so far
below their minimum demands that their own government could no
longer keep its citizens under control.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu correctly says that fewer Israelis have been killed by
Palestinian terrorism on his watch than in the previous period. It
does not follow that the next three years will be equally secure.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his men, deeply unpopular
among their own people for being unable to deliver either a
political agreement or prosperity or good government, continue to
call for patience and restraint.
</P>
<P>
   But Palestinians see Jewish settlements burgeoning on the land
they want to make their state, while their own security forces
cooperate with Israel's to keep violence in check. There are
multiple signs of a conflict-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that time is on the side of a second Netanyahu
experiment is wholly improbable. The alternative is that the
Israelis elect Ehud Barak, the Labor leader, to be their next prime
minister on May 17 (or June 1 if there is no outright winner next
Monday).
</P>
<P>
   Barak is at present comfortably ahead of Netanyahu in the
opinion polls _ but Labor traditionally does better in pre-election
polls than in the elections themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was an intelligent choice to succeed Shimon Peres after
Labor lost the 1996 vote. An intellectual former chief of staff,
festooned with military decorations, nobody can accuse him of
Peres's alleged indulgence towards the Palestinians (Peres was once
a hawkish defense minister, but that is forgotten).
</P>
<P>
   His main known failing is a wooden manner. His political skills
are neither proven nor disproven.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's freedom for initiative, like Netanyahu's, would be
circumscribed by the coalition he would lead. Many Israelis look
towards a national-unity government, encompassing the Likud as well
as Labor.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, this should be the perfect answer for polarized,
indecisive Israel; in practice, the record of Israel's previous
national-unity governments has been poor, with little achieved on
the Arab front.
</P>
<P>
   But if Barak were able to pull together a reasonably like-minded
coalition, the advance towards a Palestinian settlement could be
swift.
</P>
<P>
   Although May 4 _ the deadline that Oslo had decreed for a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian agreement _ has slipped by, much of
the donkey-work has been done, either before the change of
government in 1996 or, unofficially, since.
</P>
<P>
   The various outlines at present stuffed into drawers are based
on degrees of compromise by both sides and suggest that few of the
``insuperable'' questions are really insuperable.
</P>
<P>
   The essential first step, however, is up to Israel's voters next
Monday. It is the step of choosing Barak. &QL;

<P>
   Leave your job, log on, click and _ hey, presto! _ you too can
turn into the newest pariah of America's stock markets, an
electronic day trader.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, it was Wall Street's takeover barbarians. Today it
is the amateurs in jeans and sneakers who sit in front of a
computer and trade 40-50 times in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they did with the Gordon Gekko types in the 1980s, Wall
Street's great and good are demonizing day traders, accusing them
of distorting the stock market and causing volatility in share
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), does not even dignify day traders as speculators,
let alone investors: he says they are gamblers. And that, as Keynes
once said, is not what the stock market should be about, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the great and good are wrong. Electronic day traders are
merely the most fanatical of a new breed of investors, born of
regulatory changes and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In general, America's 5 million-odd people who buy and sell
shares on the Internet are a good thing. The stock market has been
democratized; Granny can do what was once reserved for boys in red
braces.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has freedom bred recklessness. Most online investors trade
only a little more than they did offline, and extra trades have
meant a more liquid market.
</P>
<P>
   They have also driven down trading commissions, to the benefit
of all investors.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core day traders, of whom there are fewer than 100,000,
also help the market.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite strategy is to scrutinize quotes offered by
market-makers (professionals who publish prices at which they will
buy or sell shares). If this uncovers a market-maker who is slow to
react when rivals change prices, the day traders attack. But this
encourages market-makers to be alert, resulting in more efficient
pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as day traders must complete their trades quickly,
they often offer keener prices than market-makers. This narrows the
difference between best buy and sell prices, giving all investors a
better deal at the expense of intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   Against these benefits stands one big accusation: that day
traders who rush in and out of a company's shares make prices more
volatile. Actually, academic studies have found little evidence
that this is true, even for Internet shares, in which online
investors account for an unusually large slice of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than causing high volatility, day traders, who live or
die by exploiting short-term price movements, may be attracted to
shares that are volatile for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   On Internet shares, such volatility mainly reflects massive
disagreement among investors about what, if anything, the shares
are really worth.
</P>
<P>
   As for gambling, some day traders are doubtless in over their
heads. That is regrettable, but it is not a good reason to attack
day trading.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, for people with a gambling addiction, if it were not
shares, it would be something else. And at least in the stock
market, unlike a lottery or a casino, the average punter is not
mathematically certain to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Most day traders would probably be better off putting their
money in a fund that tracked the stock market index. But that
applies equally to most professional equity-fund managers, who also
fail on average to beat the market index.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders may be mauled if today's high share prices prove to
be a stock market bubble. But they would not be the only investors
left looking foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with their expertise at trading fast and often, when the
conflagration comes, they may prove fleeter of foot than the big,
staid institutional investors who have been bad-mouthing them.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's great and good would do better to remind all
investors that being in the stock market at all is, at today's
prices, something of a gamble. &QL;

   The warrior and the executioner do similar jobs. Both kill the
enemies of the state. But there the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   From time immemorial the warrior has been feted and honored. The
public executioner, by contrast, has always had to lurk in the
shadows, working anonymously or for a pittance. There is no glory
in what he does.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of discomfort and shame is why a growing number of
countries have washed their hands of judicial execution. Today
nearly all western democracies, as well as dozens of other
countries, have abandoned capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the countries which still use it with much frequency,
such as China or Iran, are authoritarian states without independent
legal systems.
</P>
<P>
   The single most defiant _ and most notable _ exception to this
trend is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To the irritation of many of its allies, the American government
regularly defends the death penalty in international forums,
reflecting widespread support for capital punishment at home.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, death-penalty opponents have reacted to America's
stubborn exceptionalism on this issue with knee-jerk condemnation,
or despair. Instead they should relish the chance to convert the
world's most vigorous democracy to a saner policy. For they have
the better case.
</P>
<P>
   Three basic arguments are made for the death penalty: that it
deters others, saves innocent lives by ensuring that murderers can
never kill again, and inflicts on them the punishment they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   The first two, utilitarian arguments, do not stand up to
scrutiny, while the moral claim for retribution, although naturally
more difficult to refute, can be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite voluminous academic studies of American executions and
crime rates, there is no solid evidence that the death penalty is
any more effective at deterring murder than long terms of
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   This seems counter-intuitive. Surely death must deter someone.
But the kinds of people who kill are rarely equipped, or in a
proper emotional state, to make fine calculations about the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even for those who are, decades of imprisonment may be
as great a deterrent as the remote prospect of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Although European countries have abolished the death penalty,
their rates of violent crime have risen more slowly than crime
overall. Indeed, their murder rates remain far below America's.
</P>
<P>
   It is indisputable that executing a murderer guarantees that he
cannot kill again, and this argument once carried considerable
weight in societies that could not afford to imprison offenders for
long periods. But today most countries, and especially America, can
afford this.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that support for the death penalty among
Americans drops sharply when life imprisonment without parole is
the alternative. Executions are not needed to protect the public.
</P>
<P>
   Against the dubious benefits of capital punishment must be
weighed its undoubted drawbacks. It is a dangerous power to give
any government, and has been grossly abused by many to kill
political opponents and other inconvenient people under the color
of law.
</P>
<P>
   Even America, with all its legal guarantees and complex system
of appeals, has not been able to apply it fairly or consistently.
Worst of all, it is irrevocable. Mistakes can never be rectified.
</P>
<P>
   America, like all countries which use the death penalty, has
executed innocents. This is too high a price to pay for an
unnecessary punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave retribution? Some crimes are so heinous
that a societal cost-benefit analysis hardly appears relevant.
Death alone seems sufficient. And yet, as many relatives of murder
victims have discovered, real retribution can never be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the only way to repay fully those who have
committed multiple murder, or killed in a ghastly way, would be to
torture them physically in turn, or to strive to make them endure
repeatedly the torments of death.
</P>
<P>
   Modern societies have rightly turned away from such practices as
barbaric, tempering their demands for retribution in recognition
that tit-for-tat vengeance is beyond the reach of human justice.
That is where the death penalty, too, belongs. &QL;

   The warrior and the executioner do similar jobs. Both kill the
enemies of the state. But there the similarity ends.
</P>
<P>
   From time immemorial the warrior has been feted and honored. The
public executioner, by contrast, has always had to lurk in the
shadows, working anonymously or for a pittance. There is no glory
in what he does.

countries have washed their hands of judicial execution. Today

   AUSTIN _ Texans have always possessed an uncommon (to other
Americans, downright excessive) pride in their state. They print
T-shirts announcing that Texas is not to be ``messed with'' and
drive around with bumper-stickers reading ``I wasn't born in Texas,
but I got here as soon as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing enough speeches by Texas politicians, the casual
observer might begin to believe that the state's official name is
``The Great State of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if state officials get their way, this vast reservoir of
Lone Star devotion will put money into the pockets of Texan
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) will
launch its ``Go Texan'' campaign, an effort to promote goods grown
or processed in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Products will be ``branded'' with the campaign logo (based on a
cattle brand) and promoted first in Texas, and then across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The TDA will also run TV commercials featuring Texas-bred
celebrities such as Tommy Lee Jones, an actor, and Nolan Ryan, a
baseball star.
</P>
<P>
   When Governor George W. Bush announced the campaign last month
he stood on a stage overflowing with Texas-grown grapefruit, rice,
beef jerky and wine.
</P>
<P>
   If poll data are any indication, the ``Go Texan'' campaign has a
good chance of success. According to a recent survey, if Texas-made
products were identified as such, 89 percent of the state's people
would choose them over goods produced elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The TDA believes the campaign will appeal to a natural instinct
among Texans to help out their own. And, if that doesn't work,
there is always peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Susan Combs, the Texas agriculture commissioner,
the idea is to make it ``un-cool'' and ``un-Texan'' to buy anything
but Texan products.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have run campaigns to promote individual
industries, but ``Go Texan'' is the first to label and promote all
a state's agricultural wares.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials believe that the product branding and the
television spots will allow state farmers to break into a national
market for farm products that is still dominated by Florida and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the campaign may find its greatest success outside the
United States. Organizers hope to market Texas agriculture
worldwide by negotiating trade relationships with foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mrs. Combs, the Lone Star State has an
international mystique (and an easily recognizable shape) that she
believes can be cashed into revenues for Texan farmers.
</P>
<P>
   She may have a point. After all, international viewership of
``Dallas'' kept the TV series on the air long after J.R. recovered
from his gunshot wounds. &QL;

<P>
   On May 11, just four days after American bombs had slammed into
China's embassy in Belgrade, the hoarsest cries in Beijing's
diplomatic district came no longer from angry mobs outside the
American and British embassies, but from a lively game of
volleyball in the Vietnamese compound.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden end to the most violent expressions of
anti-Americanism in China since the cultural revolution _ and the
biggest street demonstrations since the Tiananmen protests a decade
ago _ was perhaps not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Though anger was deep and genuine across China, it was nurtured,
channelled and ultimately reined in by a Communist Party that
displayed its still awesome power for social mobilization.
</P>
<P>
   Anger was first whipped up by state media that refused to
countenance any interpretation of NATO's attack other than that of
a deliberate act of aggression _ a violent assault upon China's
sovereignty designed to taunt and humiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, students at Beijing University were given government
permission to demonstrate; buses swiftly appeared, and extra
transport was laid on when student numbers proved too large.
</P>
<P>
   In the embassy district the principal attractions were the
coconut shy of the British embassy and the American pillory around
the corner, where the trapped ambassador, James Sasser, was reduced
to eating military rations.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police were clearly under orders not to stop paving stones
being ripped up and hurled at the windows. In the southwestern city
of Chengdu, the American consul's house was burned.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not want emotions to run too high for too
long. On May 11, Bill Clinton's apologies were broadcast on state
television, two days after they were first made, suggesting a tacit
acceptance of them.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing University put up notices reproving students for some
rowdy behavior and ordering calm. By May 12, when the ashes of the
three journalist ``martyrs'' killed in the Belgrade bombing arrived
home, the embassy area was entirely sealed off to ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   On television, workers have been parroting that the best way
they can show their indignation is to increase production.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, especially American ones, got calm
reassurances that China is still open for business.
</P>
<P>
   Is that the end of the matter, at least as far as demonstrations
of high emotion go? Students are hacking away at American and NATO
computers, and earlier this week caused the White House website to
be closed.
</P>
<P>
   Boycotts of American products are urged, ``apart'' says one
placard, ``from high-technology ones.''
</P>
<P>
   It may prove to be fairly harmless stuff. It is, after all,
still the dream of many an undergraduate to study further in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate members of the government think that calm is certainly
needed to reassure foreign investors that China's economic
development will continue apace. The crisis comes as foreign
investment looks like slowing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So the indignation had better be at least orderly if the
government is to press for its several pounds of diplomatic flesh
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   China is now likely to demand various concessions of America. It
had already withdrawn a set of market-opening measures that Zhu
Rongji, the prime minister, laid confidentially before American
trade negotiators during his trip to Washington last month (and
which the Americans rashly publicized, to China's anger).
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese may now try to insist that they should join the
World Trade Organization this year with few significant
concessions. They will also seek to get American promises that
Taiwan will not be part of a proposed defense umbrella for East
Asia, consisting of early-warning systems against incoming
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   And, most vociferously of all, China's leaders have been
insisting that if they are to help with a political solution to
Kosovo _ and Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy, and Gerhard
Schroder, the German chancellor, both said in Beijing this week
that Chinese help was necessary _ then the bombing would have to
stop straight away.
</P>
<P>
   Since the United States seems unlikely to meet these demands,
how will China react? If the Belgrade bombing is a severe
embarrassment for NATO, particularly America, it is also the
biggest crisis for China's leaders since Tiananmen. Some onlookers
detected cracks in the leadership before the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But on the question of NATO's war in Yugoslavia the government
has been speaking with one voice: if America intervenes over Kosovo
today, why not Taiwan or Tibet tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   The media have fed the Chinese a diet of oppressed Serbs, with
barely a mention of the Kosovars' plight. Yet some policymakers had
been looking more carefully for lessons from the war.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, new, more flexible, political structures might be
needed to head off ethnic unrest in China's own corners of empire,
notably Tibet and Xinjiang. Proponents of such a line, presumably,
are now ripe targets for hard-liners in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombing, though, the cracks were widest over economic
policy. Details are hard to come by. But the reported resignations
tendered by two, possibly three, ministers last week looked like
more than carelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, those pushing for more economic ties abroad and
faster, painful reforms at home, have made plenty of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, in particular, appears to have staked his political
reputation on forging closer ties to America. His less cosmopolitan
rivals will consider the bombing a chance to get their own back on
a man who himself admits he is brusque, short-tempered and lacking
a factional base. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Perhaps not too much should be made of the nagging feeling that
the rabid state media may be getting beyond the control of their
political masters. Nor, perhaps, that the schoolboy of the
Politburo's standing committee, Hu Jintao, has been the front man
during this affair, leaving senior leaders notably less visible.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, Hu who had been chosen a week earlier to
deliver the anniversary speech commemorating the students of the
May 4th movement in 1919, a protest against imperial powers trying
to carve up China among themselves, and a turning point in national
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The students marching past the American embassy last weekend
were, they said, fired by May 4th patriotism. They are, anyway, of
a different generation from the Tiananmen protesters. So how they
will react to the tenth anniversary of the June 4th killings is
hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   For now, their indignation at America's bombing is also their
government's. But the students are visibly elated that popular
protests have become a practiced form of political theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether this generation, now blooded, will get a
taste for expressing wider demands should it feel let down by the
government's eventual response to the bombing, or should factional
fights among the leadership become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   In calmer times, China's senior men know they sink or swim
together. Not so now. The Belgrade bombing may yet claim some
individual victims. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA _ A year ago, Australians were being told to batten
down the hatches. The economic turmoil sweeping Asia was expected
to turn south and engulf a country whose economy has been
notoriously prone to boom-bust cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Australia sells about 60 percent of its exports to Asia, many of
them commodities that are always vulnerable to recession in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia's day of reckoning has never arrived. Instead,
with a growth rate of more than 4 percent over the past year, its
economy has outperformed not only its East Asian neighbors, but
most other rich countries, as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Costello, the treasurer (finance minister), presented
his fourth budget to Parliament on May 11, he announced an almost
unheard-of surplus of A$5.4 billion ($3.6 billion) and talked of
Australia entering the next century ``a world leader in living
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking of an Australian miracle yet, as they used to
talk of an Asian miracle. But Australia's turnaround has taken many
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, one of the
country's four biggest banks, forecast recently that Australia
would ``remain a bastion of stability in an extremely volatile
world economic environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Singapore, once fond of slapping down Australia's claims to
regional leadership, has changed its tune; during a recent visit,
Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, praised Australia's
policies and contrasted them with many Asian countries': ``We were
concentrating on fast growth, quick infrastructure, but forgetting
the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's HSBC bank reckons Australia has entered a prolonged
period of growth that will continue well into the next decade, and
could even surpass the golden age of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Australia still ``rode on the sheep's back,''
with agriculture, especially wool, accounting for much of its
prosperity. Last year farm products made up only one-fifth of its
exports, and wool just 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in the 1990s has been a surge in manufactured
goods and services which together now contribute twice as much to
exports as farming does.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is seeing the benefits of structural changes over the
past 15 years that have made its economy more resilient. The
changes started with the former Labor government, which took the
crucial decision in 1983 to float the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It dismantled many of the tariffs that had for decades protected
inefficient Australian industries from foreign competition,
deregulated the financial system and started to privatize
transport, communications and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative government that came to power in 1996, headed
by John Howard, has taken these reforms further, especially by
reducing union power. It has sold one-third of Telstra, the
state-owned telecoms giant, and now wants to sell the rest and use
the proceeds to pay off debt.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's coalition was reelected last October with a mandate to
overhaul the tax system. But it faces a hostile Senate, where it
relies on two independents to pass its reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that changes seem to be working should help Howard. Now
that they can no longer rely on Australia's small domestic market
of 18 million people, as they could in the bad old days of
protection, companies have learned to switch to new products and
new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing factories, once heavily protected, have gone out of
business, whereas industries with higher added value, such as
medical equipment and car parts, have prospered.
</P>
<P>
   When the Asian turmoil began in 1997, many Australian producers
looked elsewhere to sell. Last year, Australia's exports to Europe
and America rose considerably as those to Asia fell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of Australia's new prosperity is being led by a
consumer boom, which has been supported by a rising stock market,
in which a record number of Australians are now investors. Buoyed
further by rising property prices, people have felt richer, spent
more and saved less.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for imports, together with weak prices for Australia's
commodity exports, has also contributed to one of the economy's
black spots: its current-account deficit, running at 5.5 percent of
GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, the other black spot, is stuck at 7.5 percent and
shows no signs of improving.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Australia is entering its second century as a
nation in strikingly better shape than it entered its first, when
depression and drought in the 1890s almost strangled the new
country at birth. &QL;

<P>
   CANBERRA _ A year ago, Australians were being told to batten
down the hatches. The economic turmoil sweeping Asia was expected
to turn south and engulf a country whose economy has been
notoriously prone to boom-bust cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Australia sells about 60 percent of its exports to Asia, many of
them commodities that are always vulnerable to recession in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia's day of reckoning has never arrived. Instead,
with a growth rate of more than 4 percent over the past year, its
economy has outperformed not only its East Asian neighbors, but
most other rich countries, as well.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Costello, the treasurer (finance minister), presented
his fourth budget to Parliament on May 11, he announced an almost
unheard-of surplus of A$5.4 billion ($3.6 billion) and talked of
Australia entering the next century ``a world leader in living
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is talking of an Australian miracle yet, as they used to
talk of an Asian miracle. But Australia's turnaround has taken many
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, one of the
country's four biggest banks, forecast recently that Australia
would ``remain a bastion of stability in an extremely volatile
world economic environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Singapore, once fond of slapping down Australia's claims to
regional leadership, has changed its tune; during a recent visit,
Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, praised Australia's
policies and contrasted them with many Asian countries': ``We were
concentrating on fast growth, quick infrastructure, but forgetting
the fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's HSBC bank reckons Australia has entered a prolonged
period of growth that will continue well into the next decade, and
could even surpass the golden age of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Australia still ``rode on the sheep's back,''
with agriculture, especially wool, accounting for much of its
prosperity. Last year farm products made up only one-fifth of its
exports, and wool just 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in the 1990s has been a surge in manufactured
goods and services which together now contribute twice as much to
exports as farming does.
</P>
<P>
   Australia is seeing the benefits of structural changes over the
past 15 years that have made its economy more resilient. The
changes started with the former Labor government, which took the
crucial decision in 1983 to float the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It dismantled many of the tariffs that had for decades protected
inefficient Australian industries from foreign competition,
deregulated the financial system and started to privatize
transport, communications and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative government that came to power in 1996, headed
by John Howard, has taken these reforms further, especially by
reducing union power. It has sold one-third of Telstra, the
state-owned telecoms giant, and now wants to sell the rest and use
the proceeds to pay off debt.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's coalition was reelected last October with a mandate to
overhaul the tax system. But it faces a hostile Senate, where it
relies on two independents to pass its reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence that changes seem to be working should help Howard. Now
that they can no longer rely on Australia's small domestic market
of 18 million people, as they could in the bad old days of
protection, companies have learned to switch to new products and
new markets.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing factories, once heavily protected, have gone out of
business, whereas industries with higher added value, such as
medical equipment and car parts, have prospered.
</P>
<P>
   When the Asian turmoil began in 1997, many Australian producers
looked elsewhere to sell. Last year, Australia's exports to Europe
and America rose considerably as those to Asia fell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet much of Australia's new prosperity is being led by a
consumer boom, which has been supported by a rising stock market,
in which a record number of Australians are now investors. Buoyed
further by rising property prices, people have felt richer, spent
more and saved less.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for imports, together with weak prices for Australia's
commodity exports, has also contributed to one of the economy's
black spots: its current-account deficit, running at 5.5 percent of
GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, the other black spot, is stuck at 7.5 percent and
shows no signs of improving.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Australia is entering its second century as a
nation in strikingly better shape than it entered its first, when
depression and drought in the 1890s almost strangled the new
country at birth. &QL;

   TOKYO _ So it's agreed: the future of entertainment is a box.
</P>
<P>
   The megadeals that are sweeping the technology and
communications industries all confirm the notion that some slab of
digital wizardry attached to a television will be at the heart of
tomorrow's wired home.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of box? The PC industry is betting on a simple and
cheap PC-based device. The broadcast industry swears by digital TV
set-top boxes. And the rest of the technology industry is busily
dreaming up other gadgets, from Internet appliances to ``AOL TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile another industry, far from the white-hot glare of the
convergence hype, has been making a plausible precursor to such a
machine and selling it by the tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Video-game consoles, once the bleeping domain of cartoonish
kiddie-fare, have grown up into powerful computers capable of
near-cinematic realism. In the process they have become an
increasingly adult consumer phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   With the coming release of a new generation of superconsoles,
they are poised to break into the wider entertainment and online
world, expanding beyond games to Internet surfing, films, and even
home finance and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   They could thus challenge not only PCs but every other claimant
to the TV-top throne.
</P>
<P>
   The successor to Sony's best-selling Playstation, due out early
next year, will be a 128-bit computer more powerful than a Pentium
III. Analysts predict that it will be able to play DVD movies,
decode digital TV and surf the Web; yet it will sell for less than
$400.
</P>
<P>
   With this machine, claims Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, the
firm will do more than leapfrog its gaming competitors: it may even
challenge ``Wintel,'' the Microsoft and Intel PC standard.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Nintendo and Matsushita jointly announced the
outlines of their own next superconsole, which will have a DVD
drive and 400MHz processor and could arrive late next year.
</P>
<P>
   And in September Sega will unleash a $100 million marketing
campaign for the official release of its new 128-bit Dreamcast in
America.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, more than 100 million Sony
Playstations, Nintendo 64s, Sega Saturns and Dreamcasts will have
found their way into homes in America, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of American households and one-fifth of British
households already have one of these ``next-generation'' game
machines. In Japan almost half do _ far more than have PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This year video-game industry sales (both the consoles and the
games they run) will for the first time overtake Hollywood's
box-office revenues. They should be close to $20 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer just kids' stuff: Sony says its average user
is 22 years old; nearly a third are over 30. Scratch an investment
banker and you may easily find a ``Duke Nukem'' death-match king. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The video-game industry has had high points in the past but they
were never like this.
</P>
<P>
   The Atari craze of the 1980s put it on the map. But after
turning Pac-Man into the symbol of the decade (America's Postal
Service has chosen to commemorate the 1980s with a video-game
stamp), the industry burned out in 1984 in a wave of bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese, led by Nintendo and Sega, revived it with more
advanced 16-bit machines until they, too, faded in the early 1990s,
overshadowed by the PC. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took Sony and its first games machine, the Playstation, to
break out of the toy niche and reach adults. Launched in Japan in
1994, the Playstation was smart from the start: its spectacular 3-D
games, backed by techno soundtracks, were unlike anything that had
been seen before, even on PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the launch of the Playstation, the games industry has
become the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Playstation sales and games royalties accounted for half of
Sony's operating profits last year. Nintendo's N64, released in
1997, has sold 25 million units so far.
</P>
<P>
   One of its games, ``Legend of Zelda,'' earned $150 million last
Christmas in America, more than any film released in the same
period. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 400 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The games industry is now preparing to take on the PC and the
television. But to say ``games industry'' is to underplay one of
its chief advantages: it now represents the greatest powers of the
consumer-electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Matsushita (which makes the Panasonic, Technics and
Quasar brands) are global leaders in televisions and in video and
music equipment. Who better to stake a claim on the
home-entertainment center of tomorrow _ and who knows better how to
sell such gear?
</P>
<P>
   Spurring them on is the worry that they may also have the most
to lose in the coming battles for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Their core business is the stuff of TVs, VCRs and CD players,
all of which are about to go through wrenching changes.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of digital TV, which requires heavyweight
electronics to decode the signal, means that a computer of some
sort will sit alongside most televisions in the years to come: the
TV itself will often be just a screen.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of DVD as a video standard brings another digital
device; make it recordable and it starts to become almost another
computer. Add the expected rise in online music distribution, which
requires a network connection, and the home-entertainment console
begins to tilt seriously towards Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the spread of the Internet has created a demand
for Web surfing and e-mail, but with TV-like simplicity,
reliability and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Who can best put all the parts together? Dedicated Internet
appliances, such as Web TV, do not play games. Personal computers
are expensive, crash-prone and unnecessarily complicated. Digital
TV set-top boxes offer nothing but television.
</P>
<P>
   Only consumer-electronics companies have proved that they can do
it all. With games machines as their base, they have the
opportunity to put all the parts together in a way that their
competitors cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games console is the stealth platform,'' says Jon Peddie
of JPA, a digital-media market research firm in San Francisco. ``It
is the first serious challenge for (interactive) consumer eyeballs
that the PC has seen. And it doesn't hurt that Sony is the Intel of
the consumer-electronics industry.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It may come as no surprise that Sony and its sort will be
powerful forces in home entertainment. But are families really
willing to put a games machine in the center of their living rooms?
</P>
<P>
   They might be, if they could see what sort of games are on the
way. Visit Square, a game-software developer in Tokyo, and you
might be at George Lucas's digital soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between making a video game for the
superconsoles and making a special-effects film are vanishing by
the day. They share the same digital modelling, the same
sophistication of soundtracks, similar scripts and dialogue, and
even camera angles and techniques (for the games, the ``cameras''
are simply the computer's designated viewpoints, but to achieve
film-like realism, the software creates camera effects such as lens
flare).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after wowing gamers with its ``Final Fantasy'' series of
games, Square, along with Columbia Pictures, is now using the same
techniques to make a fully fledged film, for release in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Other games, including ``Tomb Raider,'' ``Resident Evil'' and
``Duke Nukem'' are all heading for the big screen as well; most big
sci-fi and action films also convert perfectly into games.
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Pac-Man'' and ``Mortal Kombat,'' and think ``Bug's
Life'' and ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' Increasingly, it is
all digital entertainment in one way or another. The main
difference is that some is interactive and some is not. &QL;

set-top boxes. And the rest of the technology industry is busily
dreaming up other gadgets, from Internet appliances to ``AOL TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile another industry, far from the white-hot glare of the
convergence hype, has been making a plausible precursor to such a
machine and selling it by the tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Video-game consoles, once the bleeping domain of cartoonish
kiddie-fare, have grown up into powerful computers capable of
near-cinematic realism. In the process they have become an
increasingly adult consumer phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   With the coming release of a new generation of superconsoles,
they are poised to break into the wider entertainment and online
world, expanding beyond games to Internet surfing, films, and even
home finance and shopping.
</P>
<P>
   They could thus challenge not only PCs but every other claimant
to the TV-top throne.
</P>
<P>
   The successor to Sony's best-selling Playstation, due out early
next year, will be a 128-bit computer more powerful than a Pentium
III. Analysts predict that it will be able to play DVD movies,
decode digital TV and surf the Web; yet it will sell for less than
$400.
</P>
<P>
   With this machine, claims Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, the
firm will do more than leapfrog its gaming competitors: it may even
challenge ``Wintel,'' the Microsoft and Intel PC standard.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, Nintendo and Matsushita jointly announced the
outlines of their own next superconsole, which will have a DVD
drive and 400MHz processor and could arrive late next year.
</P>
<P>
   And in September Sega will unleash a $100 million marketing
campaign for the official release of its new 128-bit Dreamcast in
America.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, more than 100 million Sony
Playstations, Nintendo 64s, Sega Saturns and Dreamcasts will have
found their way into homes in America, Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of American households and one-fifth of British
households already have one of these ``next-generation'' game
machines. In Japan almost half do _ far more than have PCs.
</P>
<P>
   This year video-game industry sales (both the consoles and the
games they run) will for the first time overtake Hollywood's
box-office revenues. They should be close to $20 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer just kids' stuff: Sony says its average user
is 22 years old; nearly a third are over 30. Scratch an investment
banker and you may easily find a ``Duke Nukem'' death-match king. &QL;

   It took Sony and its first games machine, the Playstation, to
break out of the toy niche and reach adults. Launched in Japan in
1994, the Playstation was smart from the start: its spectacular 3-D
games, backed by techno soundtracks, were unlike anything that had
been seen before, even on PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the launch of the Playstation, the games industry has
become the fastest-growing segment of the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Playstation sales and games royalties accounted for half of
Sony's operating profits last year. Nintendo's N64, released in
1997, has sold 25 million units so far.

   The games industry is now preparing to take on the PC and the
television. But to say ``games industry'' is to underplay one of
its chief advantages: it now represents the greatest powers of the
consumer-electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Matsushita (which makes the Panasonic, Technics and
Quasar brands) are global leaders in televisions and in video and
music equipment. Who better to stake a claim on the
home-entertainment center of tomorrow _ and who knows better how to
sell such gear?
</P>
<P>
   Spurring them on is the worry that they may also have the most
to lose in the coming battles for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Their core business is the stuff of TVs, VCRs and CD players,
all of which are about to go through wrenching changes.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of digital TV, which requires heavyweight
electronics to decode the signal, means that a computer of some
sort will sit alongside most televisions in the years to come: the
TV itself will often be just a screen.
</P>
<P>
   The coming of DVD as a video standard brings another digital
device; make it recordable and it starts to become almost another
computer. Add the expected rise in online music distribution, which
requires a network connection, and the home-entertainment console
begins to tilt seriously towards Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the spread of the Internet has created a demand
for Web surfing and e-mail, but with TV-like simplicity,
reliability and cost.
</P>
<P>
   Who can best put all the parts together? Dedicated Internet
appliances, such as Web TV, do not play games. Personal computers
are expensive, crash-prone and unnecessarily complicated. Digital
TV set-top boxes offer nothing but television.
</P>
<P>
   Only consumer-electronics companies have proved that they can do
it all. With games machines as their base, they have the
opportunity to put all the parts together in a way that their
competitors cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games console is the stealth platform,'' says Jon Peddie
of JPA, a digital-media market research firm in San Francisco. ``It
is the first serious challenge for (interactive) consumer eyeballs
that the PC has seen. And it doesn't hurt that Sony is the Intel of
the consumer-electronics industry.'' &QL;

<P>
   It may come as no surprise that Sony and its sort will be
powerful forces in home entertainment. But are families really
willing to put a games machine in the center of their living rooms?
</P>
<P>
   They might be, if they could see what sort of games are on the
way. Visit Square, a game-software developer in Tokyo, and you
might be at George Lucas's digital soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between making a video game for the
superconsoles and making a special-effects film are vanishing by
the day. They share the same digital modelling, the same
sophistication of soundtracks, similar scripts and dialogue, and
even camera angles and techniques (for the games, the ``cameras''
are simply the computer's designated viewpoints, but to achieve
film-like realism, the software creates camera effects such as lens
flare).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after wowing gamers with its ``Final Fantasy'' series of
games, Square, along with Columbia Pictures, is now using the same
techniques to make a fully fledged film, for release in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Other games, including ``Tomb Raider,'' ``Resident Evil'' and
``Duke Nukem'' are all heading for the big screen as well; most big
sci-fi and action films also convert perfectly into games.
</P>
<P>
   Forget ``Pac-Man'' and ``Mortal Kombat,'' and think ``Bug's
Life'' and ``Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.'' Increasingly, it is
all digital entertainment in one way or another. The main
difference is that some is interactive and some is not. &QL;

   TOKYO _ So it's agreed: the future of entertainment is a box.

<P>
   The megadeals that are sweeping the technology and

tomorrow's wired home.

COMPANY FILES LAWSUIT OVER DEROGATORY E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By RHONDA PARKS MANVILLE   
 Santa Barbara News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ A phantom menace of an e-mail kind has
infiltrated STAR Telecommunications, and the seventh-largest long
distance carrier in the nation is trying to stop it by filing a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants in the suit _ who are unknown at this time _ have
disrupted company business and harmed morale by sending a barrage
of e-mailings that denigrate the company, its management and staff,
according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Suits of this type are becoming more common as businesses using
the Internet find themselves maligned by anonymous critics, who
hide under pseudonyms and impersonate company managers. Filing suit
enables companies to subpoena Internet search engines for the
originators of harassing e-mail messages, and to sue in civil court
for trespass and other violations.
</P>
<P>
   A similarlawsuit was filed recently by Massachusetts-based
Raytheon. Raytheon's executives sued to get Yahoo Inc. to turn over
the names of employees who allegedly discussed company secrets in
an online chatroom. The employees used aliases that they thought
would protect their identities. Twenty-one employees ultimately
were named in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The detractors in the STAR case have engaged in ``parasitic
use'' of the firm's e-mail system to ``espouse their personal
agendas and to make derogatory and potentially defamatory
comments'' about management and staff, according to the STAR
lawsuit, which was filed last week in Superior Court in Santa
Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and employees at STAR, which is based in Santa
Barbara, as well as the company's lawyers, declined to comment on
the pending litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsolicited e-mail, whether it's harassing or not, is a
problem on the Internet,'' said Dave Clark, general manager of
Silicon Beach, an Internet provider in Santa Barbara. ``If it's
continual, and it contains negative messages, it can constitute
harassment of sorts. Sometimes people abuse the Internet, just as
they do the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit charges the yet-unnamed defendants with
misappropriation of computer resources, trespass, nuisance and
violations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. It seeks an unspecified amount of
damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to burdening STAR's computer system, these
derogatory mass messages have disrupted STAR's work environment by
detrimentally affecting employee morale and productivity, and by
diverting management attention away from the business of STAR,''
the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   Since the phantom e-mails started turning up at the computer
terminals of employees last September, STAR has spent considerable
time and money trying to identify the offenders, the suit says. In
the meantime, management has had to sort through the barrage of
messages to separate legitimate e-mails from bad ones.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing numbers of businesses are being hurt by people on the
Internet who transmit defamatory information about companies in the
form of e-mail or postings on bulletin boards, said Santa Barbara
attorney Andrew Kent, who specializes in intellectual property and
other Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``People out there using the Internet are apoplectic at getting
found out and sued over this stuff,'' said Kent. ``They have no
idea when they do this that they can be tracked down.''
</P>
<P>
   The two cultures sometimes clash because people using the
Internet are accustomed to saying whatever they want anonymously,
without regard to defaming anyone, and businesses are intent on
protecting their good names against harmful comments, Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on civil liberties and privacy say lawsuits growing out
of such conflicts highlight the Internet's ongoing tension between
a right to anonymity and a need for accountability.
</P>
<P>
   A young company that has enjoyed phenomenal growth, STAR is one
of the largest telecommunications firms in the world. But the
company's earnings have been less than stellar lately, with a $7.6
million, first-quarter loss reported last week.

supposedly lost _ at a Florida recording studio during the sessions
for 1982's ``All in a Night's Work.''It features bassist Richard
Finch frantically telling the 911 operator that his cat has been
killed in a grisly blender accident; bandleader Harry Wayne Casey
is then heard shouting over the laughter of the other band members
that it's ``just a joke, Richard _ that's homemade salsa.''

   ``No new work has been done on it,'' an unidentified source
said, ``but Harry has said this will be the last Sunshine Band
recording. There's nothing else left.''

<P>
   _A previously unreleased recording of John ``Bonzo'' Bonham
accidentally setting fire to his own hair, believed to be the last
recording made by Led Zeppelin, will be out in late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-minute, still-untitled prank was recorded _ then
supposedly lost _ after a tape machine was left running during
recording of 1979's ``In Through the Out Door.'' It features
Bonham, after several dares by bandmates, dousing his head with
gasoline, then waving a lighter nearby. ``Holy (expletive),'' a
voice _ perhaps that of singer Robert Plant _ is heard saying. ``He
really did it!
</P>
<P>
   ``No new work has been done on it,'' an unidentified source
said, ``but Robert and Jimmy (Page) have said this will be the last
Led Zeppelin release. There's nothing else left.''

FLORIDIANS GET PEEK AT FILM ABOUT J. EDGAR HOOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL DEAN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Audiences here will get an advance look at
``Hoover,'' a movie starring Ernest Borgnine as FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a traditional or Hollywood-style preview _ where
filmmakers poll the audience and use their reactions to shape the
final print _ the producers of ``Hoover'' will be on hand to survey
audience members' opinions with cards and videotape crews.
</P>
<P>
   They will also introduce the film and answer questions from the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoover,'' which was shot at Universal Studios Florida in
nearby Orlando by filmmakers Rick Pamplin and Bob Fisher, will be
screened for the first time Wednesday and Thursday at the historic
Polk Theatre here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hollywood, when people open a movie, the filmmakers drive
about an hour in any direction and do a sneak preview to get the
paying public to come in,'' said Pamplin, who directed the film and
shares writing and producing duties with partner Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   At such previews the filmmakers sit in the back of the theater
to note audience reactions and then pass out note cards for viewers
to rate the film.
</P>
<P>
   The final print of ``Hoover,'' which will address many of the
controversies of Hoover's career and personal life, hasn't been
struck. Audience reactions could affect the actual film when it's
released later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Polk Theatre officials are thrilled with the chance to show off
the 70-year-old movie palace, which is nearing completion of a $1.4
million renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful to have an honest-to-gosh Hollywood sneak
preview like this, when you've got the filmmakers, producers and
investors coming,'' said Frances McCranie, executive director of
the Polk Theatre. ``This is something you hear about happening in
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage its success, the Polk is lowering its usual
admission of $5 to $1.
</P>
<P>
   Pamplin and Fisher had worked in Hollywood as screenwriters,
story analysts and development executives for years before
relocating to Central Florida in 1994 to produce and direct their
own films. They each settled with their families in nearby Haines
City and opened offices for the Pamplin-Fisher Co. at Universal
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they produced ``Michael Winslow Live,'' a concert film
featuring the comedian and ``Police Academy'' star. ``Hoover,''
filmed on a Universal soundstage in late 1997 with Borgnine, was
planned first, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came to Florida, we were looking for an original
story, and we were also looking for something that could showcase
our talents without raising $70 or $80 million,'' Pamplin said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the two had met Borgnine, who won an Academy
Award in 1955 for ``Marty.'' He agreed to work with them, given the
right starring role.
</P>
<P>
   After finding that no definitive film had been made about
Hoover, Pamplin and Fisher researched their subject for several
years and wrote the script _ answering what they say are unproven
allegations about Hoover's personal life and professional dealings.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, made for less than $10 million, Borgnine's Hoover
confronts allegations of cross dressing and also discusses his
dealings with the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr.

HUMBLE GARDEN SHEDS TURN LUXURIOUS
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color graphic of a garden shed (begin copy in door)
 By BILL DEAN AND MARY LOFTUS 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1896, Henry Ford built his first gasoline-powered vehicle,
the Quadricycle, in a backyard shed behind the home he and his
wife, Clara, rented on Bagley Avenue in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Cars have changed a bit since then, but backyard sheds have
retained their popularity as places to tinker, garden, invent or
repair.
</P>
<P>
   These all-purpose sheds, used to store everything from lawn
mowers and peat moss to old armchairs and half-finished bookcases,
can vary greatly in size and amenities. The most luxurious resemble
miniature houses, complete with windows, carpet and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Sheds fall into two general categories: ''portable'' sheds that
are fully manufactured in a factory and transported to a
homeowner's property, and less expensive ''kit buildings,''which
are sold by home and garden retailers and are put together by
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Portable sheds with floors begin at about 4 feet by 6 feet and
can be built as large as necessary _ up to a double-wide modular
building. Prices start around $600 and can go up to $10,000 or more
depending on size and features. What once were extras, such as
windows, electrical outlets, lights and locking doors, have become
standard features on many models.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our most popular model is 100 square feet, with a gable-style
roof, as opposed to a barn style,'' says Paul Johnston, owner of
The Shed Shop in Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   His shop builds wooden sheds on site for customers, at an
average cost of $2,000. Customers typically use them to store lawn,
garden and outdoor items such as tools, wheelbarrows, bicycles,
sporting gear and even small boats.
</P>
<P>
   But, Johnston says, a well-built shed has many other uses,
including serving as an art studio, workshop, playhouse or backyard
office.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he has used his own shed as a home office, hobby room
and even a guest room.
</P>
<P>
   ''One Thanksgiving, my daughters brought their boyfriends home
from college to visit and we had them sleep in the shed on portable
cots with a space heater...it was nice in there,'' Johnston says.
</P>
<P>
   His 10-by-14 foot shed, which has electricity and indoor-outdoor
carpet, now houses Johnston's expansive model railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do a nice Christmas scene every year, with snow, little
villages and pine trees, all lit up, and we have an open house,''
he says. Or an open shed, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's company offers only wooden sheds, which he says are
superior to metal both in function and form. Metal sheds tend to
rust within a year or two, dent easily, and gather condensation
inside as well as out, he says, which causes stored items also to
rust or mildew.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people have had their fill of metal sheds,'' Johnston
says. ''They're visual eyesores that don't blend in well with the
typical homeowner's back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being hidden away behind a carport or against a
fence, today's customized sheds are becoming backyard showcases,
some complete with French doors, painted shutters, flower boxes,
door lamps and customized paint jobs to match the primary
residence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pride ourselves on custom design,'' says Lynette Paulhus,
owner of Mini Barns in Sacramento, Calif. ''Some of our customers
want just a little storage shed for their patio furniture in the
winter, but more often than not, people are using sheds as
workshops, painting rooms, work spaces. We sold several recently as
teen-age rooms, for them to have a little space of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheds are especially popular in areas where ranch-style homes
without basements or attic space are common. For homeowners with
carports instead of garages, storage can be a pressing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I had gotten a bigger one,'' says Ken Snyder, a retired
trucking company manager whose barn-style shed is home to his lawn
mower, a small freezer, a power washer and tools. Snyder, who
divides his time between Lakeland, Fla., and Gary, Ind., has sheds
at both his homes and couldn't imagine living either place without
them.
</P>
<P>
   And Jay Wright, of Montgomery, Ala., says he believes a lot of
sheds are sold to men who want a place to escape the hustle and
bustle of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have friends who spend more time inside their sheds than
inside their homes,'' says Wright, who works at Thrifty Portable
Buildings in Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Thrifty's most popular shed is a ready-made 8-by-12 foot
building with a wooden frame, an aluminum roof and aluminum siding.
''I've got one in my back yard that's lasted 25 years, and the only
thing that happened to it is some damage I had to fix after a tree
fell on it,'' Wright says. He keeps a shop table at one end of his
shed and listens to the radio while working on his rods and reels
at the other.
</P>
<P>
   While sheds in the past may have been the domain of men, more
women are setting up sheds as craft rooms, gardening centers, art
studios and offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purchase of a shed isn't male-dominated anymore,''
Johnston says. ''A lot of women are using the space themselves. And
some are making their husbands get the shed to get organized and
clear the clutter out of the garage.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring is the busiest time for shed dealers, who say home owners
decide to spruce up the yard, buy a new mower or clean out the
garage when the weather warms.
</P>
<P>
   For the do-it-yourselfer, there are shed kits available at home
improvement centers that offer four walls and a roof. Home Depot
has metal and vinyl shed kits starting at $200 for a 8-by-10 foot
shed with no floor. Foundation kits are available for an additional
$50, wood not included.
</P>
<P>
   Sheds may need a placement or building permit from either the
municipal or county government, depending on the jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Some locales require permits to build any shed, while others
require permits only if the shed is considered a permanent fixture,
such as those attached to a poured concrete slab. Additionally,
plumbing or wiring are taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Most permits begin in the $50 range and cost more if the shed
uses electricity. In most cases, the permitting process is
simplified because many jurisdictions already have blueprints on
file of standard shed models from national manufacturers.

COWBOY HALL OF FAME HOLDS HIDDEN TREASURES
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color photos of Bobby Weaver and a bronc rider 
 Includes a 250-word sidebar
 By JAY ATKINSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the vault beneath the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and
Western Heritage Center in Oklahoma City, there are 400 military,
Native American, and western stock saddles dating from 1847, and
enough cavalry uniforms, feather headresses and firearms to
re-enact an epic frontier battle.
</P>
<P>
   In proximity to this rare collection, lies Academy Award-winning
actor Walter Brennan's leather couch, sagging in the middle and
speckled with bourbon-and-water stains.
</P>
<P>
   ''The West is kind of a mystical place,'' says Bobby Weaver, 61,
the Hall's assistant director, adding that Brennan's couch belongs
in the museum because the Hollywood myth of the cowboy and actual
frontier life have become intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's path to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame was an
irregular one. As soon as he was ''big enough to tote iron,'' he
began working for his father on a tank building crew in the West
Texas oil fields. Over the years, Weaver indulged his passion for
history by attending college part-time, finally earning his Ph.D.
from Texas Tech at the age of 46. ''I was never gonna get rich in a
pair of greasy overalls,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Odessa, Tex., the bantamweight Weaver laughs when
comparing his folksy approach with that of more typical historians.
''Somebody told them they were smart once, and they never got over
it,'' he says, in his West Texas drawl.
</P>
<P>
   The 220,000 square foot Oklahoma City museum is home to
traditional exhibits like the Rodeo Hall of Fame, Hall of Great
Western Performers, western art from the likes of Frederic
Remington and Charles Russell and several collections of Native
American and frontier artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   But $100 million worth of the Hall's collection remains inside
the vault's foot-thick steel reinforced walls, in charcoal-filtered
cabinets which are kept at a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody ever gets in here but the curators and me,'' Weaver
says, with a wink.
</P>
<P>
   As the Hall's coordinator of events, exhibits, educational
activities and research (two new galleries and an authentic replica
of an Old West town called ''Prosperity Junction'' will open in the
summer of 1999), Weaver spends most of his time in meetings and on
the telephone. But when the other curators have gone home, he likes
to wander through the 15,000 square-foot vault.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver points out a buckskin Ghost Dance shirt, worn during
southern Arapaho ceremonies which were meant to rejuvenate the
landscape and call forth the tribe's dead warriors. By 1890, when
the shirt was in use, most Native Americans were ''longing for a
time that was and that'll never come back, '' Weaver says.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the Hall of Fame vault with Bobby Weaver also offers
insight into the practical side of American history. A cabinet full
of Confederate uniforms all look different because, unlike the
Yankee tunics made in northern factories, the Rebels used homemade
butternut dye and it faded to various shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver indicates the oldest piece of military headgear in the
museum, a tar bucket hat from 1833 that has a horsehair tassel and
smells faintly of mothballs. ''When it got all battered, you just
tarred it back up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A Sioux cradle board, ingeniously designed for carrying infants
on foot or on horseback, looks like two ski tips connected by
straps and a beaded leather bag. Weaver demonstrates how the device
would protect the Sioux infant, leaving only his eyes exposed. ''If
you drop this, there's hardly any way he can get hurt,'' says
Weaver, noting that today's child safety seats are modeled on the
cradle boards.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Hall's saddlery collection are two owned by the movie
star Gene Autry, the singing cowboy. One of the saddles is trimmed
in hand-tooled silver and engraved with Autry's initials, while the
other, decorated in the same pattern, is covered with tin. The
silver saddle was used in close-ups, Weaver explains, the replica
for stunt riding.
</P>
<P>
   It's poetic justice that Weaver has become a gatekeeper of the
Old West, according to Jim Pfluger, director of the Ranching
Heritage Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, and Weaver's
close friend for the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bobby's never met a stranger, and that helps when you're
dealing with someone who's going to donate money, a painting, or an
artifact,'' Pfluger says. ''He grew up on the oil patch, and a lot
of his donors and board members are ranchers. Bobby understands an
honest day's work.''
</P>
<P>
   When the two friends were employed at the Panhandle Plains
Museum in Canyon, Tex., during the 1980s, Weaver catalogued on
microfilm the archive of every newspaper in the state, a five-year
odyssey that took him through hundreds of dusty little towns. At
the same time, Weaver helped create the museum's 75,000 square-foot
wing dedicated to the history of oil exploration and development in
the Texas panhandle. In 1984, he lost an eye while operating a
power saw at the museum, but finished both projects.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure at Panhandle Plains, Weaver had a habit of
ignoring the carefully regulated state bidding process. After
making a purchase, he would simply drop the receipts on Jim
Pfluger's desk. ''Bobby would always say it was easier to ask for
forgiveness than permission,'' recalls Pfluger.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver has written eight academic books and published more than
100 historical articles. But he becomes more animated over the
Hall's 8,229 different specimens of barbed wire _ ''bobbed whar''
as he calls it _ than any theoretical aspect of his job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most curators are romantics at heart,'' Weaver says. ''They
weren't there, but they really would've liked to have been.'' -30-
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Assistant Director Bobby Weaver and his curators have been
rummaging in the vault beneath National Cowboy Hall of Fame vault
for the past 10 years, picking out artifacts for an ambitious new
exhibit. On July 4, the museum will open a recreation of an
authentic western town.
</P>
<P>
   Developed by Design Craftsmen of Midland, MI, the 13,500
square-foot ''Prosperity Junction'' will provide visitors with an
experience far beyond the usual movie set facades. Ranged along a
whistle stop on the Great Plains are a livery stable, saddle shop,
train depot, cattle company, photography studio, bank, school house
and church.
</P>
<P>
   As visitors enter this life-size cattle town, they will hear the
tinkling of a vintage piano in the saloon and the quiet thrum of a
nineteenth century organ from the church hall. The time of day is
dusk, and gleaming lanterns are visible through the windows.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 18 buildings will be accessible to visitors. Parts of
old cameras and sepia prints litter the benches in the photo shop,
and authentic 19th century desks form neat rows in the school
house.
</P>
<P>
   As the holidays come and go, Prosperity Junction will come alive
with banners and decorations. On such occasions, historic
interpreters dressed in period costume will entertain passersby
with tales and demonstrations from the era.
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing daily visitors with a trip back in time,
Prosperity Junction will become an integral part of the museum's
educational programming, according to Weaver.

WIND SLOWS START OF SALMON CATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As thousands of California king salmon amass
deep in the ocean off the San Francisco coast, commercial fishermen
have been docked at Fisherman's Wharf waiting for the robust winds
to die down.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the San Francisco fleet of 500 boats heads south of Half
Moon Bay on an annual May 1 pilgrimage to catch the prized king _
or chinook _ salmon for diners. But this year, high winds
attributed to the La Nina weather phenomenon have made it too
difficult for most boats to go trolling.
</P>
<P>
   In calmer weather, the fishermen can be found on weekends docked
at Fisherman's Wharf, selling whole salmon, some weighing up to 25
pounds, right out of their boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for the ocean conditions to change,'' said Larry
Collins, owner of the Pavo Grande, (the Big Turkey), berthed at the
wharf. ``We're wiring up some whopper stoppers _ boat stabilizers _
and making sure the leaks aren't getting any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   While John Mellor did venture out last week to collect crab pots
in his 40-foot High Hope, ``the weather is too rough for salmon
fishing,'' he said. Every salmon is caught by hook and line. Six
steel cables trail behind a boat, each carrying up to 12 hooks
baited with anchovies or artificial lures.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, the fish are farther offshore, Mellor
said. ``You've got to travel two or three hours, which could turn
into five hours in this weather,'' he said. ``The salmon are
feeding on mostly krill, and hang out on the temperature edges
where the warm currents hit the colder water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surface temperatures are about 45 degrees, and that makes
the fish more dormant, more scattered and harder to locate.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Mellor and other fishermen bide their time, repairing,
sanding and varnishing their boats while they shake their heads
over 11-foot-high waves breaking every 9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather's really gnarly,'' Collins said. ``There are a few
guys out there catching salmon, maybe 10 boats out in bad weather,
getting from 25 to 70 fish a day. They're out in conditions that
aren't safe for most of the fleet. They've got the newer, larger
boats, and they're the tougher captains.
</P>
<P>
   We went the first week. We caught 20 fish, which is terrible.
But we knew the weather would get better, and the fish would show
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically at this time of year, most of the Sacramento River's
fall run of salmon is off Monterey, moving north up the coast
toward the San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   In August or September, the 3-year-old adults will make their
way through the Golden Gate, the Delta and up the Sacramento River
and its tributaries to the exact place they were born. The largest
tributary rivers are the American, Feather and Yuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento fall run is the largest of four salmon runs in
the San Francisco Bay, and perhaps the largest on the West Coast,
excluding Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 279,100 wild salmon, the highest number since 1985,
returned to spawn. The warm currents of El Nino, reduced that
number to 180,900 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature
patterns. La Nina refers to the rapid cooling of equatorial waters
in the central Pacific that can also disrupt weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Fisheries biologists say in El Nino's warmer waters, there are
fewer krill and anchovies, the salmon's main food supply. Other
species of fish fleeing Southern California's very warm waters head
north and compete for the dwindling food supply off the coast here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, last year's fall run was somewhat down, simply
because we had El Nino conditions in the ocean. But it's not in
major decline,'' said Rich Dixon, senior biologist for the
California Department of Fish and Game's Central Valley salmon and
steelhead restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1992, the fall run of wild salmon dipped
between 60,000 and 87,000, worrying fish managers that the lack of
freshwater flowing from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers
through the Bay and Golden Gate were hurting the run.
</P>
<P>
   In response, state and federal agencies shortened the commercial
salmon fishing season. They also put more pressure on water
agencies to provide freshwater for fish and wildlife, control
fish-killing farm chemicals and remove unnecessary dams and pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, the National Marine Fisheries Service will
announce more controls under the federal Endangered Species Act to
protect the Klamath River salmon run and perhaps the Sacramento
fall and spring runs as well, which could further limit commercial
fishing.

</P>
<P>
   The 500-boat fleet, down from 5,700 when Barbara and Larry
Collins started fishing in 1985, was hurt by a drop in salmon
prices last year. Fish processors such as Caito, H &AMP; N and Morgan
at one point in the season were paying less than $1 a pound to
commercial fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Some fishermen, including Mellor who has been fishing for salmon
in the fleet for 20 years, decided not to go out at all.
</P>
<P>
   The price drop triggered the historic direct marketing of salmon
last year when whole fish were sold for $3.50 per pound in the
first off-the-boat sales for king salmon at Fishermen's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   It was wildly popular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were caught a little off guard,'' said Hedley Prince,
harbor master of Fishermen's Wharf. ``We were left stranded with
little policy in place. We think it's a good thing, but we want to
make sure it's safe for the public and that we limit our
liability.''

   Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there were so many
characters to keep track of.
</P>
<P>
   The first three episodes of ``Star Wars'' made household names
out of Luke, Han, Princess Leia, Yoda and more, and all three films
had what director George Lucas calls ``arcs,'' intermingled plots
with intermingled characters.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth installment, ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' has several more. Some of the characters from the first
three films return, some don't. Several others (most notably
serious bad guy Darth Maul) are new to the ``Star Wars'' universe,

A BRAND NEW OLD GUARD PRESIDES AT CANNES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANNES, France _ Just before heading into his news conference to
discuss his film ``Felicia's Journey,'' Atom Egoyan sat in all
black sipping morning Champagne as he fielded a ringing cell phone.
(He guessed this must be a call from the nanny.) He acknowledged
the link between his new film, adapted from a novel by William
Trevor, and his own previous ``Family Viewing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said there was ``a whole generation of people who started
watching with `Exotica' and don't know my earlier films at all,''
even though ``Family Viewing'' came out only 12 years ago, and
``Exotica'' merely dates from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bye-bye to the avant-garde: it's the brand-new old guard that
dominates the Cannes International Film Festival this year.
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan, whose film was one of this year's most avidly awaited,
is part of a lineup here of erstwhile Young Turks, including Jim
Jarmusch, David Lynch, Spike Lee, John Sayles, Tim Robbins, Steven
Soderbergh, Peter Greenaway and Kevin Smith, not to mention David
Cronenberg as head of the jury. And that's just the
English-speaking contingent. Pedro Almodovar is here with the
festival's first unqualified hit, ``All About My Mother,'' which
joins last year's ``Live Flesh'' in underscoring how soulful yet
riotous his latter-day style has come to be.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the new firmament here are Takeshi Kitano, whose
``Kikujaro'' apparently casts him as another good-hearted tough
guy, and Chen Kaige, whose epic ``Emperor and the Assassin'' is
about the ruler who unified China in the third century B.C. Chen's
film is detailed in its account of Chinese history, but you needn't
even be able to spell dynasty to recognize Gong Li as latter-day
Cannes royalty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving another dazzling performance, she can be
seen here in makeup endorsements. The festival has a newly garish
logo for the millennium and an official cosmetics brand.
</P>
<P>
   Also back in fine form is Werner Herzog, with a rollicking
documentary about his battles with the actor Klaus Kinski as they
collaborated unforgettably on films including ``Aguirre, the Wrath
of God'' and ``Fitzcarraldo.'' It is one of his most stirring. The
documentary's title is wanly translated here as ``My Best Friend,''
but the original German (``Mein Liebster Feind'') is a lot more
like it.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day festival began slowly on Wednesday with a large tree
falling in the forest, Nikita Mikhalkov's three-hour ``Barber of
Siberia.'' Dutiful festivalgoers have been looking sleepy ever
since. Other epics dominated the event's early days, notably
Alexander Sokurov's ``Moloch,'' a lulling interlude with Hitler and
Eva Braun, and ``Time Regained,'' Raul Ruiz's star-studded take on
Proust. (Catherine Deneuve plays Odette.) Now the pace has picked
up with Egoyan's closest approximation of a commercial genre film,
even though that was the last thing he had in mind. The leading
character in ``Felicia's Journey'' is a serial killer. ``But I
didn't want to make a big thing about that,'' Egoyan said. ``I
think you can watch the film without even knowing.'' Egoyan (``The
Sweet Hereafter'') presents the convoluted relationship between a
pregnant young Irishwoman and this lonely, mother-obsessed
Englishman, with Bob Hoskins as a man more comfortable with a lamb
roast than he is with people.
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan says he intended the character as a genteel monster of
the media age, to the point where the man (like earlier Egoyan
characters) patiently videotapes and catalogs his life. The young
woman, by comparison, is so quaintly direct that she actually sends
letters. Seen this way, and as a muted variation on ``Beauty and
the Beast,'' ``Felicia's Journey'' touches on this filmmaker's
familiar themes about obsession and dehumanization and has the
precise, elegant hallmarks of his more esoteric work. But it also
flouts expectations as a near-thriller that skips the conventional
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan is not alone in going against the commercial grain. It
looks like the strategy of choice this year. Robbins' big,
ambitious ``Cradle Will Rock'' takes on the political currents of
1930s America, the world in which Nelson Rockefeller (played here
by John Cusack) famously commissioned and destroyed a mural by
Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) about the workingman. Robbins centers
the film on Orson Welles and the Federal Theater and even has a
broad caricature of Welles carousing through the film.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robbins maneuvers a large cast on a sweeping canvas in ways that
owe much to ``Nashville'' and ``Ragtime.'' Like Sayles, whose
``Limbo'' concentrates on Alaska, he may find himself busily
explaining Americana to the international press brigade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why France has never had a rock band worth
exporting, and you're listening to it,'' Soderbergh said on Sunday,
hollering over the strains of a musical headache coming from the
city's waterfront boulevard, the Croisette. He was with Terence
Stamp, who claimed to have moved his mattress into the bathroom of
his hotel room to get away from the noise, and Peter Fonda, who
stars with Stamp in Soderbergh's idiosyncratic film ``The Limey.''
</P>
<P>
   The three of them were all talked out about the '60s, beyond
Fonda's remarking nostalgically that he and Stamp had once ``been
bad boys in Taormina,'' in 1965. They had been brought together by
Soderbergh for a film that deliberately echoes the sleek anomie of
those days, a la ``Point Blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamp has spent the intervening time being, among other things,
smart about health food. He said that he had not eaten sugar in
30-odd years but was now pictured on a tie-in soda can for the new
``Star Wars.'' (He rules the galaxy, but he has a part so small and
perfunctory that he described it as ``No smoking in the
auditorium.'')
</P>
<P>
   Stamp charges through ``The Limey'' as a taciturn tough guy
intent on hurting a slick record mogul. ``He's the limey, and I'm
the slimy,'' said Fonda about his own role.
</P>
<P>
   And Soderbergh _ who once shook up Cannes with the impenetrable
``Schizopolis,'' which he now says ``was a Jackson Pollock painting
for me'' _ talked about how necessary he finds such experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have made `Out of Sight' the way I did without
doing that,'' he said. ``You have to be rigorous with yourself,
because there's nobody in the business who'll encourage you to do
anything but more of what you've done before.'' ``The Limey,''
which Soderbergh joking called ``Get Carter'' as done by Alain
Resnais, manipulates time and synchronicity in ways that are much
more elaborate than its no-frills revenge story.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of frills, cries of ``Yeah, baby!'' were in the air as
the ``Austin Powers'' advance team worked on new ways to make
``shag'' part of the local lexicon. Saturday night's high-profile
event was a huge party celebrating ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me.'' Tickets were to be picked up at a so-called Shag Pad,
actually a hotel room full of grumpy journalists grousing about red
tape.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, the event itself was pure Cannes, complete with caste
system; only a special pass led to the VIP room, where Henry Jaglom
was shooting a party scene for a movie of his own. Parties here are
not for the faint of heart. Tight security means more adventure at
the door than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, at a grand casino on a hotel roof, Mike Meyers,
who plays Austin Powers, was in a most un-Austin-like sweatshirt
and wearing a NASA baseball cap because he couldn't shower at his
hotel. (``I guess they call that old world charm.'')
</P>
<P>
   On his first visit here, he had thus far been asked ``How's it
going, old man?'' by Sean Connery, spent three straight days
answering questions and done a photo op with a psychedelically
painted Austin Powers car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Cannes,'' he said slowly. ``I grew up in Can-ada. That
`ada' makes a bi-i-i-i-ig difference.''

A POST-DEATH DOUBLE STANDARD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LANCE MURRAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several weeks ago the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported the
results of the toxicology tests run on the body of a volunteer
firefighter who died heroically battling a church fire. Two
professional firefighters lost their lives as well in one of the
greatest local tragedies in years.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's report _ a public document available for
all to see _ revealed that the volunteer firefighter had cocaine
and marijuana in his system when he died. We reported that finding
in a front-page article and were criticized by many readers for
doing so. It was invasive, even cruel, they said.
</P>
<P>
   It was news, however, and it raised a legitimate issue of public
safety concerning volunteer fire departments. But to many readers
it was unnecessary, and they told us so.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have the drug-related death of Mark Tuinei, a retired
Dallas Cowboys player. He died of what authorities said was an
accidental overdose of heroin and a stimulant, a so-called
``designer drug.'' As in the firefighter's case, some people said
Tuinei's toxicology report was nobody's business.
</P>
<P>
   Star-Telegram sports columnist Randy Galloway expressed that
sentiment about Tuinei in his May 9 column. Some readers perceived
a double standard in reporting about the two deaths. Was the sports
hero getting special treatment, but not the heroic firefighter?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Here's part of what Galloway wrote: ``Of course, open-record
laws in this state will give the slimy sector of the local media
the opportunity to kick around a dead man. If, that is, the autopsy
shows Tuinei was involved in something he shouldn't have been,
resulting in his own death.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the Cowboys' recent image problems, Galloway wrote that if
the investigation found something illegal or if other Cowboys were
involved, then it was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it did,'' Galloway said this week by phone from St. Louis,
where he was covering the Dallas Stars. ``It changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway believes that the story should be fully reported in the
news sections. Cowboys running back Nicky Sualua was with Tuinei
and was the person who called 911, police said. Sualua's statement
to police has been the basis for much of the reporting about
Tuinei's death.
</P>
<P>
   But Galloway's original column caused several readers to assert
that the Star-Telegram was hypocritical and had a double standard.
We'd report about the firefighter, they said, but wasn't Galloway
saying we shouldn't do the same about a sports celebrity like
Tuinei?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. Galloway's column was pointed squarely at those who
might promote sensationalism or controversy, not legitimate news
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was giving my opinion,'' Galloway said. ``That column was
aimed at sports talk shows ... and to point out that I'm a member
of that group.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway also is the host of a popular sports call-in show on
WBAP/820 AM. There is a big difference between talk radio and a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a big difference between what a columnist writes
and what appears in the news stories we publish. A columnist writes
opinion _ his or her opinion. Reporters write and editors select
the news stories we publish each day. Sometimes it is difficult for
readers to separate the two.
</P>
<P>
   Just as readers can agree or disagree with Galloway, he can
express a strong opinion and take issue with the media.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the newsroom didn't agree with Galloway. I didn't.
Neither did his boss, Ellen Alfano, managing editor for sports and
features, who despite her own feelings allowed Galloway to express
his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I may not always agree with Randy Galloway and our
other columnists, I support their right to express their opinions.
The role of columnists is to give readers their insights and points
of view in an entertaining and thought-provoking manner,'' Alfano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway writes about things that he feels passionately about.
He can be emotional, abrasive, sarcastic or funny. He can even be
contrite.
</P>
<P>
   Columnists can write almost anything, unless it is libelous or
false.
</P>
<P>
   If Galloway says that ``old Joe is a lousy coach'' or that a
player is not playing to his potential, it's his opinion. But if he
writes that ``old Joe is a crook,'' it must be true and he must
have the facts to support it. Columnists are bound by the same
rules of accuracy and truth that govern news reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Our columnists write their opinions about everything from
raising a family to local politics. We employ many reporters to
gather facts and write about a wide variety of topics, but they are
not allowed to interject opinion into their writings. They cannot
take a stance. In fact, all sides of a story must be reported,
allowing readers to decide for themselves which side they will
believe.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway wrote of remembering the good things about Tuinei and
his contributions to the Cowboys and the community. We should. We
will remember the heroic way in which those three firefighters lost
their lives. We should.
</P>
<P>
   But we cannot ignore the bad if there is a public need to know
and a lesson to be learned. In such tragedies as these, the
contents of medical examiners' toxicology reports are news, and we
must report them even if they are bad.
</P>
<P>
   But remember: Columns must be relevant, timely and true. They
are opinion. News stories must be relevant, timely and true. They
are not opinion.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ It is like visiting a boxer in his training
camp a few days before the big fight. The display of muscle. The
brassy predictions of victory. The forecast that the world will be
changed after the dazed opponent has been carried from the ring
feet first before a jeering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case the muscle consists of a HAL-sized computer,
said to be the second most powerful in the world, and a
ballroom-like chamber being equipped to receive $30 million worth
of high-tech machines. The opponents are the federal government and
the world's largest medical philanthropy. And yes, the world might
really be changed just a little if the vaunted victory is achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Craig Venter, a pioneer in the sequencing, or decoding,
of DNA, is beginning a new venture of boundless ambition.
Sequencing the entire three billion letters of human DNA by the end
of 2001, a goal first announced last May, is just the start of his
grand design.
</P>
<P>
   His immediate goal is to sequence the genomes of five
scientifically important species _ fruitfly, mouse, human, the
Aridopsis mustard and rice. These will be the core of a biomedical
and an agricultural database.
</P>
<P>
   His wider plan is to sequence the genomes of a thousand major
species in the next 10 years and to make this fountain of genetic
information the centerpiece of an electronic information empire. An
annotated genome _ explanations of what each gene does, keyed to
its DNA sequence _ is the logical organizing principle around which
to develop a full description of any organism and its biology.
</P>
<P>
   Venter will store all this information on his computers, along
with related data contributed by other biologists and special
programs for searching and analyzing the vast trove. His ambition
is to create a database as essential for biologists and physicians
as the Bloomberg data terminals are for the financial world.
</P>
<P>
   Trouncing the publicly financed effort to sequence the human
genome seems to be just a small part, however pleasurable, of this
grand design. ``My major mental goal right now is not to beat
publicly funded scientists at doing something. What we are doing
gives us far more than that,'' Venter said while showing a visitor
around his new plant here, in a suburb a few miles north of
Washington's Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Venter asserts that the public effort to sequence the human
genome, by a group of academic centers financed by the National
Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust of London, has chosen a
flawed strategy that will produce a seriously incomplete DNA
sequence. The public consortium breaks DNA in large fragments, maps
the positions of the fragments on the chromosomes and then
sequences the fragments. Venter's approach is to fit the fragments
together without a map.
</P>
<P>
   He implies that his rivals should pack up and find some other
line of work, a course whose wisdom will be clear before the end of
the year: by that time he hopes to have validated his own strategy
by sequencing the fruitfly's genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Morgan and Collins are putting good money after bad,''
Venter says, referring to Dr. Michael Morgan, the Wellcome Trust's
executive for genome sequencing and Dr. Francis Collins, director
of the NIH's part of the human genome project. ``Their plan is not
to finish the genome,'' he says, but rather to prevent him from
obtaining the only sequence and locking it up with patent claims.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Collins, Dr. Kathy Hudson, said that he remained
``totally confident of the current human genome project strategy
and that, ``While Venter is certainly a fascinating personality,
his every utterance does not seem to warrant a story in The New
York Times.'' Morgan said the public consortium's strategy was
safer than Venter's.
</P>
<P>
   Venter has always reveled in portraying himself as an outsider
to the biomedical establishment, a maverick implementer of bold
ideas that other scientists say cannot work. Coming from almost
anyone else, the rhetoric might be sharply discounted. But at least
as far as his own plans are concerned, Venter has acquired both the
track record and the resources _ half a billion dollars _ to be
taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   As an unknown researcher at the NIH, Venter became interested in
sequencing human DNA, particularly after the first commercial
sequencing machines became available. In 1992, a medical financier,
the late Wallace Steinberg, spotted the significance of Venter's
ideas and set him up to work independently, founding the Institute
for Genomic Research.
</P>
<P>
   He and a colleague, Dr. Hamilton O. Smith, changed microbiology
when for the first time they decoded the genome of a bacterium. An
article by them, published in 1995, sealed Venter's standing as a
serious scientist. (Smith already had a Nobel Prize in Physiology
or Medicine.)
</P>
<P>
   The genomes of almost every significant pathogenic organism are
now being sequenced, and young scientists are flocking to what had
been seen as a mature field.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Venter, who is now 52, amazed the biomedical world by
saying he would sequence the human genome ahead of the public
consortium. Together with a colleague, Dr. Michael W. Hunkapiller,
he has in effect hijacked a major company, the former Perkin-Elmer
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Now the PE Corp., it has sold off its well-known instrument
making operations and transformed itself into a pure genome
company. Hunkapiller is head of one division, PE Biosystems, which
makes the leading brand of DNA sequencing machines, and Venter is
head of the other, known as Celera. Trading in PE Biosystems and
Celera began earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkapiller, who first proposed the idea of a separate human
project, has in effect set off an arms race between Celera and the
public consortium to buy his new sequencing machines. So far Celera
has ordered 300 machines and the public consortium 200. The
machines cost $300,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Celera is capitalized at $330 million and will receive $75
million from PE Biosystems. Two pharmaceutical companies, Pharmacia
and Amgen, have taken out $50 million, five-year subscriptions each
to Celera's human genome database. As a result Venter, who owns 5.5
percent of Celera, has more than $500 million to invest in
implementing his design.
</P>
<P>
   Venter calculates his 300 sequencing machines will be able to
decode 140 million units of DNA every 24 hours, making Celera the
most powerful DNA sequencing center in the world. To reconstruct
genomes from millions of small pieces of DNA, and store vast
archives of assembled sequence, he has invested heavily in data
processing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Celera's computer will have 20 trillion
bytes of disk storage. Its computational capacity, when completed,
will make it the second most powerful in the world after the
Department of Energy's computer that simulates nuclear explosions,
said Keith Pillow, a spokesman for Compaq, which supplied the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   At Celera's Rockville building, 50 of Hunkapiller's new
sequencing machines are already running. Their first major tasks
will be to sequence the genome of the Drosophila fruitfly and then,
if this pilot project succeeds, to tackle the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Venter plans to sequence the genomes of five individuals, to be
selected from the major ethnic groups and including three men and
two women. The people will be chosen from a large number of
volunteers and will not know they have been selected.
</P>
<P>
   From these 10 sets of chromosomes (each individual has a
paternal and maternal set) Celera will generate a ``consensus''
human sequence as well as an expected 20 million or so of the DNA
variations, known as polymorphisms, that make each person unique.
The polymorphisms are of great interest to drug companies because
they are the genetic reason why people respond differently to
different drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The polymorphism data will be open only for a fee but the
consensus human DNA sequence, Venter said, will be made freely
available for academic scientists to search, though not to download
until the full sequence is completed. This restriction seems
designed to prevent the public consortium from using Celera's human
genome sequence to help complete its own.
</P>
<P>
   The restriction creates a lack of reciprocity because Venter
fully intends to use the interim sequence information being
released by the public consortium. Venter said progress on the
human genome would be faster if Celera and the public consortium
were to cooperate, as they are doing on Drosophila.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation is less simple than it may appear, however, as the
two groups have different rules for releasing information and
different agendas. Both Morgan and Collins said they would be happy
to cooperate if Celera would agree to full and immediate
publication of its sequencing data.
</P>
<P>
   After the human and mouse genomes are sequenced, Celera's
phalanx of sequencing machines will turn to other interesting
species. ``I am dying to add chimp to this,'' Venter says. The
chimpanzee genome, which differs hardly at all from human DNA,
would help identify the handful of genetic changes specific to
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to make a list of a hundred insects whose genomes
would be interesting. Look at how much money we spend on killing
insects,'' he says. The cow genome also seems high on his list of
candidates, in the belief the beef industry would pay well for it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confidence that Venter projects, Celera's approach
to deciphering the human genome is not without considerable risk.
Each human chromosome is a single DNA molecule roughly 100 million
bases in length. The sequencing machines that determine the order
of DNA bases cannot handle pieces longer than 600 bases or so.
Reconstructing a full length chromosome from such short snippets is
a formidable task by whatever method it is done.
</P>
<P>
   In the public consortium's approach, a chromosome is broken down
into large overlapping fragments, and biologists then try to figure
out which region on the chromosome each fragment comes from, a
process known as mapping. In Venter's process, called a whole
genome shotgun, the entire genome is broken into sets of large and
small fragments, and the pieces are assembled from their overlaps
without prior mapping of their chromosomal positions.
</P>
<P>
   Venter and his colleague Smith have developed some clever tricks
to help bypass the tedious mapping stage but nonetheless will have
to piece together a jigsaw puzzle of 70 million pieces without any
crib sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Venter's criticism of the public program is based on his view
that the mapping process has not been made to work efficiently.
There are risks in his own too. Because the human genome contains
many regions where the same DNA sequence is repeated over and over
with few or no variations, some biologists believe it may be hard
to reconstitute the genome from a shotgun experiment as the
repetitive regions will yield a nightmare of almost identical
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Venter and Smith used their shotgun strategy to sequence the
first bacterial genome in 1995 but that possessed a mere 1.8
million units of DNA. The Drosophila fruitfly, which is thought to
have a genome of 160 million units, will prove a harsher test of
the strategy, and even Drosophila is a fraction the size of the
three billion unit human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Venter expresses no doubt that his enormous gamble will be
successful. Sitting in Celera's cafeteria, clad casually in jeans
and more relaxed than usual, he banters light heartedly with
colleagues while dishing out zingers to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from us being the evil empire, we as a corporation are
providing them with the tools and reagents to try to compete with
us,'' he says with Vader-like finality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming we could do the Drosophila genome, we think the world
will change,'' he says. ``It will be like before and after
Haemophilus. And once the paradigm is proven again, I guarantee
that everybody will adopt it.''

FINDING LODGINGS ON THE CHEAP
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday May 23)  
(dal) 
 By BETSY WADE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gone are the days when the family piled into the car and drove
off willy-nilly, selecting roadside motels or cabins as they
appeared. The tourist cabins on the blue highways are big resorts
now, and in summer almost everything requires a reservation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are still economical ways to find housing on the road,
although these, too, require planning ahead: in college dormitories
vacated by their school-year inhabitants; hostels, either linked to
an association or free-standing; and Y's or other youth-oriented
organizations with downtown buildings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At all these places what you get is more likely to be a single
bed or bunk than a private room, and a private bathroom is a
rarity. But sometimes early calls can produce the one or two family
rooms in a hostel. Some universities that run subsidiary businesses
in conferences will have nicer quarters.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guides to places to stay on campuses and other no-frill lodgings
are in accord with the places they depict: economically printed,
devoid of glorious color pictures of tea on the veranda. The
commercially sold guides may simply re-sort and print public-domain
material that is otherwise available free. But the convenience of a
single guide may make the cost worth it.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Low-Rent Route  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a glance at guides to alternative housing on the road in
the United States and for travelers taking the low-rent route
overseas.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the least known here is the British Universities
Accommodation Consortium, which annually prepares free brochures on
facilities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This
year's guide lists 62 universities, with grids showing what is
available at what times of year, and the fees. As an example,
bed-and-breakfast accommodations at Kings College in London,
available from July 9 to Sept. 16, start at (PS)25 a night, or $41
at a recent rate of exchange.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the phrases on the chart may be a bit obscure, for
example, ``self-catering holiday flat,'' which means a vacation
apartment where you may prepare your own meals. Prices are given in
pounds. The guide is available free on request to B.U.A.C., Box
1756, University Park, Nottingham, England NG7 2RD; telephone
(44-115) 950-4571. The guide is also on the Internet at
www.buac.co.uk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian University and College Conference Officers
Association publishes similar free information about its
dormitories, although the main thrust is toward conference
planners. The leaflet ``Vacationing on a Budget'' covers nine
universities in Atlantic Canada. ``The Planners' Guide to Canadian
Universities and Colleges'' covers 60 places. They are both
available from Christi Higginson, Dalhousie University Conference
Services, 6136 University Avenue, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4J2,
Canada; (902) 494-3831, fax (902) 494-1219.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The organization also maintains a Web site at cuccoa.org with
basic information and a number of links to the individual college
pages. It includes color pictures; the photographs of Shirreff Hall
at Dalhousie, built in 1923, show a lounge with a fireplace and a
dining hall set for a meal. A single room there, with breakfast, is
$25 a night, a double $37, about $17 and $25 in U.S. currency.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another free publication is ``Y's Way Accommodation and
Reservation Guide,'' published by the YMCA. This slim pamphlet,
with an introduction in five languages, focuses on places to stay
in New York, such as the Vanderbilt YMCA and the West Side YMCA,
where singles with shared bath, with access to health facilities,
cost $54 to $59 a night, depending on the season. Affiliated places
in other cities and overseas are included. In the back is a form to
request a reservation, which must be prepaid. Y's Way: 224 E. 47th
St., New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 308-2899, fax (212) 308-3161. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Guides to Hostels  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels publishes
``Passport to North America,'' which also has an introduction in
four languages in addition to English. This 432-page annual guide
to 220 hostels is free to members, or can be ordered by nonmembers
for $3 a copy. Part of the publishing expense is met by the ads for
guidebooks and car-rental and bus companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hostels are organized by state, one listing to a page, with
small black-and-white pictures and schematic maps. The book
includes a list picking out 25 U.S. ``sustainable living center''
hostels that have been adapted to reduce waste and conserve water
and that seek out nontoxic products.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the hosteling group is free for anyone under 18
and costs $25 a year for people 18 to 54, $15 for those over 54.
For people going overseas, the organization sells two guides, one
to Europe and the Mediterranean and the other to Africa, America,
Asia and Australia. These are $13.95 each.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The organization is also distributing a free map of its 142
hostels in the United States, with addresses and telephone numbers.
Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels, 733 15th St.,
N.W., Suite 840, Washington, D.C. 20005; (202) 783-6171, fax (202)
783-6171.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hostels U.S.A.'' by Evan Halper and Paul Karr, a directory to
all American hostels, whether affiliated or not, has just been
published in its second edition by Globe Pequot Press. This
440-page book, in a tall narrow format slightly larger than the
HI-AYH book, uses stars and icons to grade 300 places in the United
States and parts of Canada.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although AYH affiliates do not usually permit alcohol, this is
not the case with independent hostels. So one of the useful icons
in this book is the ``party index,'' one to five New Year's hats
for places that range from ``downright quiet'' to ``rage all
night.'' The Fort Lauderdale International Hostel, as an example,
rates only two stars, or ``barely adequate,'' and gets five hats on
the party line. This book costs $14.95 in bookstores. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Globe Pequot has also published two overseas guides in the same
format, ``Hostels UK,'' which includes Northern Ireland ($14.95),
and ``Hostels France and Italy'' ($14.95). A separate guide to
Canada is due in the fall. &QL; 
Campus Quarters  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Campus Lodging Guide,'' published by Robert C. Luckcuck and
Jan Luckcuck in California, who operate as B.&AMP; J. Publications,
contains a lot of supplemental material in its 334 pages: addresses
of tourist offices, a collection of travel bargains and a dense
list, three columns to the page, of hotels, motels and inns. The
campus material is copious, starting with Australia and ending with
Wyoming. The book also has a long list of Y's worldwide. The
editors, who have been publishing this book for 18 years under
various titles, earmark lodging places that have not responded to
requests for up-to-date information.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   B.&AMP; J. Publications has a Web site, campus-lodging.com, that
contains an order blank. The price of the book is $14.95, and
shipping is $2. B.&AMP; J. Publications, P.O. Box 5486, Fullerton,
Calif. 92838; (800) 525-6633, fax (714) 525-6625.  &QL;

 &HT;    COLD, SMART AND AMBITIOUS, BARAK HAS LIVED ISRAEL'S HIGH POINTS
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-ELECTIONS-0518.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Powered by ego, brilliance and bravery, Ehud Barak's
own exploits have helped create Israel's image of daring and unity.
</P>
<P>
   As an Israeli commando, he has disguised himself as a flight
technician when raiding a hijacked airliner. On another mission, he
dressed as a woman to infiltrate Beirut and assassinate Palestine
Libertation Organization (PLO) terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   When he came to the point in his career that Israeli officers
customarily adopt Hebrew names, he dropped his family name,
``Brog,'' for ``Barak.'' It means ``Lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he's a quiet, calculating man known for long-term planning.
His hobby since childhood has been fixing old watches and clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 57-years-old, his time has come.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Ehud Barak, Israel's most decorated soldier, won
by a stunning margin to become Israel's next prime minister. He
promises to bring unity to a country with such deep and bitter
divisions that they seem to defy the mythic Israel Barak's heroics
helped create.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections are maybe, in certain aspects, the most
crucial in a generation,'' he said recently, citing Israel's rifts
between rich and poor, and between religious and secular.
``Somehow, something happened in the last few years. The country is
at an impasse on every major issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's target, the man he repeatedly blames for everything
being ``stuck,'' is now-former right-wing incumbent Benjamin
Netanyahu, who once raided a hijacked airline with Barak while they
served in the commandos together.
</P>
<P>
   Barak says Netanyahu was a good officer. He was especially close
to his brother, Yoni Netanyahu, the only Israeli commando killed in
the raid on the hijacked airliner in Entebbe, Uganda. Barak helped
plan, but did not go on the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends say they first began thinking of Barak as prime
minister material when he gave an eloquent eulogy at Yoni
Netanyahu's funeral in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   But, Benjamin Netanyahu got the prime minister's job first.
Right-wing and combative, he became an emblem for the
hard-to-manage Israel, a country of divisions that is stalemated on
the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak to set that straight, the former commando will need to
adapt to the give-and-take of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good fighter. I hope he will be a good civilian,''
says an old army commander, Shaul Givoli.
</P>
<P>
   Barak hardly appears either a commando or a politician. Short
and paunchy, he has soft features and still appears stiff in
public. He dodged campaign debates with the quick-tongued
Netanyahu. Friends say he is often shy or even coldly arrogant. He
and his wife, Nava, have three daughters, but they have been slow
to wade into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Barak seems too analytical and blunt for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would have become of him had he been born a
Palestinian, the career soldier said, ``If I were a young
Palestinian, it is possible that I would join a terrorist
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   It caused a stir in the media and was used against him in
political commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Barak was born on a kibbutz, one of the old socialist
communal farms formed by European Jews. His performance in school
and the army vaulted him into Israel's elites. He was pegged as a
leader, even when he made mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Givoli remembers when Barak got in trouble for losing maps
during an officer school exercise. Givoli considered expelling him,
but others persuaded him that Barak would one day lead the army.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Gil, one of Barak's early commanders, said he had
``discipline of steel and was always very obedient.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his army service, Barak got a physics degree at
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Classmate Danny Michaelson said
Barak soon realized that physics did not offer enough ``action.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he ran reconnaissance teams behind enemy lines in the
war of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   He rose to head army intelligence and eventually become army
chief of staff. There, he became a close adviser to then-Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   He's considered a peacemaker in the Rabin style -- tough and
pragmatic -- and eschews idealistic talk about harmony in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he talks of a ``separation'' between the Jews and
Palestinians, with high fences and tight security.
</P>
<P>
   He was slow to accept the Oslo peace process in 1993. But, he
oversaw some troop withdrawals when land was initially handed over
to the Palestinians and now he promises to speed up the
negotiations that Netanyahu has halted.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of strategic thinking comes easily to Barak. It's the
politics, with its hand-shaking and conspicuous shows of emotion,
that will be harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the real test,'' according to Avshalom Horan, among
the hundreds of old commando buddies working on Barak's campaign.
``It doesn't rely on the cerebral. It's a matter of personality and
leadership. He sees that as the major task in the agenda.''

FORMER HACKER SAYS TEXAS PROSECUTOR TRYING TO DOWNLOAD HIM INTO
CELL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTI MUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUGAR LAND, Texas _ From the blackness of his bedroom, Dark
Spyre would be awakened by a desk lamp clicking on.
</P>
<P>
   Hooked to his computer, it would signal him _ sometimes in the
middle of the night _ that a fellow hacker was ready to begin.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks in late 1993 and early 1994, Ryan David
Schwartz, alias Dark Spyre, was a high school senior by day, a
computer hacker by night. Breaking the security code of a
long-distance phone company based in Mississippi, he was able to
charge thousands of dollars worth of computer bulletin board calls
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   When Sugar Land police showed up at the Houston-area home he
shared with his grandparents and mother in March 1994, Schwartz
confessed to hacking. They took his computer, all of the
components, even the desk lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Indicted on two counts of felony theft a month after his
graduation, he pleaded guilty in January 1995. He was sentenced to
five years' deferred adjudication _ a punishment that would expunge
the conviction from his record if successfully completed _ plus 450
hours of community service, court costs and nearly $5,000
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just a year shy of completing his probation, Schwartz faces
a motion to revoke the probation. Revocation could send him to
prison and end his pursuit of a degree at Baylor University in
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   From Schwartz's perspective, the Fort Bend County District
Attorney's Office set him up for failure from the start and has
treated him more like a violent criminal than an intelligent young
man who made a mistake and was willing to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's perspective, Schwartz has been thumbing
his nose at the court and deserves to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he ignored probation conditions that included
orders not to use a computer, but he has abused a string of second
chances, Assistant District Attorney Mike Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame in a lot of ways, because he's a bright kid,''
said Elliott, who, coincidentally, is the computer expert in his
office. ``But he just can't leave it alone. He's got an
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz denied violating his probation. He insisted that he has
been walking the straight and narrow _ working nearly full-time at
a Service Merchandise store in Waco, attending classes at Baylor
and frantically rushing back to Fort Bend County every Friday
afternoon to meet with his probation officer.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Land, an affluent community just outside of Houston, is
about 150 miles from Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has not used a computer and that fellow students have
typed papers for him, which, according to his understanding of the
probation, was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott said the ruling was clear: Schwartz is forbidden from
using a computer, period. Allowing someone else to use a computer
on Schwartz's behalf, and using Schwartz's password, is the same as
if Schwartz had used it, Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get school done and get a degree and get a
career going,'' said Schwartz, now 23.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott contended that Schwartz doesn't merit pity. Not only did
Schwartz ignore a warning from LDDS Metromedia Communications, the
long-distance company &UR; ,  &LR; to stop hacking long before the criminal
charges were filed, but he also violated his probation by accessing
the Internet and using a computer, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game to them,'' he said of computer hackers. ``They
don't see the danger, the real harm in what they're doing. Many
people are under the misconception that if you do a crime on the
computer, it's not that bad, like murdering somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is a crime _ a felony crime. How many people's phone
bills went up because of acts he and others did? Everybody pays for
his kind of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's probation problems started early, when he contended
that his severe asthma prevented him from the lawn-cutting and
outdoor maintenance chores that are typical of community service.
</P>
<P>
   He had enrolled at the University of Houston in August 1994 and
attended classes there through May 1995. After his enrollment at
Baylor in July 1995, the community-service hours became more
difficult to complete.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the first motion to revoke Schwartz's
probation was filed, alleging that he had failed to report to the
probation department in February, May and June 1996 and that he had
failed to perform community service. A probation department report
said Schwartz hadn't done service for a year.
</P>
<P>
   It also maintained that, even after being referred to light duty
because of his asthma, Schwartz failed to report for community
service in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that, saying he had reported but wasn't given an
assignment compatible with his health.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he was instructed to clean out a dark, cellarlike
room at a Waco charitable organization, he said. It was, he said,
infested with rats, an environment his asthma was unable to
tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the job for only one day. A promised assignment in a
library never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was willing to do the work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing in December 1997, state District Judge Bradley
Smith did not revoke his probation but made several changes in its
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz was given an additional 600 hours of community service,
to be completed by Jan. 1, 1999. And he was forbidden from
operating a computer without written court permission.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz took off a semester and reported for work daily at the
Precinct 4 justice-of-the-peace office to complete his community
service. His mother, Linda Schwartz, a secretary, paid the
restitution, and his grandparents, Greta and Izu Schwartz, 71 and
73 respectively, helped pay lawyer and bond fees.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the family had stacked up about $50,000 in payments to
bail bondsmen and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The family thought that the ordeal was nearing an end and that
Schwartz could finish college and get his degree in finance and
management information systems. He wants to have a career in
financial consulting or investments.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz applied for early termination of his probation after he
completed his community service, but was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court granted his request to return to Baylor, he
was told to report to the probation office in Richmond at 4 p.m.
every Friday. Schwartz said he did his best to comply, leaving as
soon as classes or work were through and driving hard to make the
deadline. But he was late three times, clocking in at 4:25 p.m. one
time, at 4:31 p.m. another time and at 4:16 p.m. another.
</P>
<P>
   After using several lawyers, the family hired Houston attorney
Dick DeGuerin to try again to get the probation terminated early.
Schwartz obtained a letter from an associate dean at Baylor, saying
he lacked 39 hours to graduate and would have to have access to a
computer to complete his course work.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant professor at Baylor wrote to Judge Smith, asking
that Schwartz be allowed to use a computer ``and move on to a
career in business.''
</P>
<P>
   While supportive letters were filling Schwartz's court file,
Elliott was getting tips that the probationer was actively using
the computer, the Internet and e-mail at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   The second motion to revoke his probation was filed in March. It
is set for a June 10 hearing before Smith, who has a reputation
around the courthouse of being tough on wayward probationers.
</P>
<P>
   The Schwartz family views the latest development as continued
torture, referring to Elliott as a persecutor instead of a
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to put him in jail. That's what they want,'' said
Linda Schwartz, 47. ``He was young and foolish,'' she said, but he
has paid for his mistake. ``Now we don't know what to do. We're
going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, meanwhile, is preparing for the hearing. If Schwartz's
probation is revoked, he could receive two to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times can you thumb your nose at the court and get
away with it?'' Elliott asked. ``He would have had a very bright
future with some company. Why couldn't he do something constructive
with his time instead of trying to beat the system?''

THERE'S NO MUMMY LIKE AN OLD MUMMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, May 19)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't intend to see the new movie, ``The Mummy,'' because I
can tell by reading the reviews that I won't like it.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Mummy'' is said to be heavy on the special effects,
which serve no purpose other than to take your mind off the stupid
dialogue and the sad fact that Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo
will never be another Peter Cushing or Boris Karloff, no matter how
many digitalized locusts you throw at them.
</P>
<P>
   Most depressing of all is that the modern Mummy is not a mummy
at all, but rather your basic, garden-variety rotting corpse. And
it has the ability to transform itself into a variety of distinctly
un-mummylike things. Like a sandstorm, for instance. C'mon, people,
let's get real.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to me: A mummy is not whirling dirt or scarab beetles
burrowing under your skin. It is a (semi) preserved dead person
swathed in bandages. Good mummies, or rather the mummies of good
mummy movies, are thousands of years old and, as you might expect,
a little slow-footed and creaky in the joints. You should be able
to wade through quicksand while carrying a fainted Yvonne Furneaux
and still be able to outrun a mummy.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the bandages and, perhaps, a strict Egyptian
upbringing, mummies don't talk much or show a lot of expression.
Christopher Lee, in the 1959 version, brought the art of grunting
and eye-rolling to a level that has yet to be matched. If Lee's
mummy rolled his eyes upward, it meant he was preparing to strangle
Peter Cushing. If he rolled his eyes in a counterclockwise
direction, it meant he was in the process of strangling Peter
Cushing. If he grunted and rolled his eyes in a clockwise
direction, it meant that he was allowing amorous thoughts of Yvonne
Furneaux to distract him from the business of strangling Peter
Cushing. Etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing as it does in ancient curses and such, a good mummy
movie should have some elements that fly in the face of logic. For
example, there should never be any good explanation as to why the
mummy is so adept at catching his victims given the fact that he
possesses the foot speed of a box turtle. I mean, it's not like the
mummy exactly blends in with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Seven feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Bandaged from head to foot.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling gait.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think a person like this would attract attention. But no.
Mummies have no problem blending in with society, which should tell
you all you need to know about society.
</P>
<P>
   In a good mummy movie, the victim should be sitting in his
living room, reading a book and smoking a pipe. Suddenly, a mummy
shuffles into the room. The victim reacts to this invasion by
turning the page and taking another puff on his pipe. The mummy
stands there for a minute or two, waiting for a reaction. Nothing.
You get the feeling the mummy could fix himself a sandwich or
perform a break dance on the living room floor and the victim
wouldn't notice. Finally, realizing that he's got to get moving if
he's ever going to get to the clinch scene with Yvonne Furneaux,
the mummy rolls his eyes upward and lifts the victim out of his
chair by the neck.
</P>
<P>
   (Because it is a good mummy movie, viewers do not question why
it is that a person who has been dead 3,500 years has such superbly
conditioned wrist and forearm muscles yet cannot outrun a lawn
statue.)
</P>
<P>
   In the end, you should feel sorry for the mummy, but not because
it is the undeserving victim of an ancient curse and is doomed to
inhabit the nether world between the living and the dead for all
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   You should feel sorry for it because someone in the future
(Stephen Sommers) will do a remake of the movie filled with
needless special effects and cheesy dialogue and it won't be around
to roll its eyes upward and extend a helping hand.

A PICASSO IS SEVERELY SLASHED BY A DUTCH MENTAL PATIENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A Dutch psychiatric patient wielding a kitchen knife
severely slashed a Picasso painting called ``Nude in Front of the
Garden'' in Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art on Sunday,
then went to a newspaper office to brag about his act. The police
were called to the office, where the man was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the museum said that just as the museum was
emptying on Sunday afternoon, the man ripped a large circular hole
in the center of the canvas with a blunt knife before fleeing. The
man, identified only as P.G., whose age was given as 41, is a
patient in a psychiatric clinic in the nearby city of Utrecht and
had been given permission to leave, a spokesman at the clinic said.
The police returned him to the clinic, where he is now confined to
a closed area.
</P>
<P>
   He is believed to be the person who in 1990 sprayed acid on
Rembrandt's ``Nightwatch'' in the nearby Rijksmuseum, damaging the
varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Rudi Fuchs, the Stedelijk's director, said restoration experts
are examining the Picasso and the possibility of repairing it.
``This is a very dramatic incident,'' Fuchs said. ``The painting is
an essential piece of our collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mosterd, the museum spokesman, said that restoration would
not be simple because of the bluntness of the peeling knife that
was used. ``These are not neat cuts,'' Mosterd said, adding that
fragments of paint along the cuts had fallen off.
</P>
<P>
   The work, which Picasso painted in Cannes in 1956, shows a naked
woman reclining in a chair against a backdrop of a garden. It has
been in the museum since 1981 and is one of the museum's six
Picassos. Its estimated value is $5 million to $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cut affects part of the woman's body and the garden behind
it. In Amsterdam and elsewhere the incident has again raised the
issue of the security of unprotected art in public places.
</P>
<P>
   The is the third time that a work in the Stedelijk has been
vandalized. In 1987 an Amsterdam resident slashed a painting by
Barnett Newman, ``Who's Afraid of Red Yellow and Blue III.'' The
same man struck again in 1997, this time ruining ``Cathedra,''
another Newman painting.
</P>
<P>
   By some standards, security in Dutch museums is casual, although
the debate about what kind of security is desirable and what is
acceptable will no doubt reopen, Amsterdam officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guards, we have video cameras, but we don't have metal
detectors or special doors,'' Mosterd said. ``We do not want to
turn into a fortress. We want to remain an easy, open place. It is
nearly impossible to protect yourself against madmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuchs said at a news conference that he would meet with
government and other museum officials to discuss security.
``Museums all over the world face a security problem,'' he said.
``It's a real dilemma. You can come in, you can look and
unfortunately you can pull out a knife and cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Paintings have glass only when it is physically necessary, he
went on. ``We would like to keep it that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the suspect struck at 4:30 p.m., half an hour before
closing. He spent more than an hour in the museum and apparently
waited to act until a guard walked into an adjacent room.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the museum unhindered, he went to the offices of
De Telegraaf to boast about his deed. The newspaper called the
police and the man was detained on the premises.

ZEDILLO VISIT A TEST FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ When Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
arrives in California on Tuesday, his first stop will be a state
Capitol jammed with hundreds of immigrants and Hispanic activists.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Zedillo's visit with the annual ``Hungry for
Justice Immigrant Day'' is, officials insist, coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just as well, because immigration and how California
Gov. Gray Davis has treated undocumented Mexicans will be a central
theme surrounding Zedillo's three-day trip to Sacramento, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other issue facing his 5-month-old administration,
Davis walks a delicate path when it comes to immigration, mindful
that former Gov. Pete Wilson hurt the Republican Party by appearing
too mean-spirited on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis angered California Hispanics when he decided to
negotiate a court settlement over the remaining shreds of
Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot initiative to cut public services
to illegal immigrants that has been hobbled by court challenges.
They expected Davis to simply drop California's defense of the
initiative, but he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of angry people,'' said Gary Segura, a
professor at Claremont Graduate University. ``This is a very
complex issue, and I think it might blow over, but it got
simplified into: `Gray Davis tricked us.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Davis, who is a Democrat, quietly shut down a
Wilson border policy of interrogating immigrants about using state
health insurance. Those found to have used public services, such as
Medi-Cal for childbirth, were taken to court and forced to repay
the money, sometimes thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Hispanic activists applauded Davis' decision on the
border interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   But the political ripple over Proposition 187 spread as it
received much more media attention and sparked a public feud
between Davis and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is ``trying to have it both ways, and he can't,'' said
Renee Saucedo, chairwoman of the San Francisco Immigrant Rights
Commission. ``Through some of his strategies, he has basically
betrayed the community that helped put him in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was elected by one of the largest landslides in modern
California history, with Hispanics voting overwhelmingly for him
over Republican Dan Lungren, 78 percent to 17 percent, according to
an exit poll taken by the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis promised during his campaign, in somewhat vague terms, to
end the ``wedge-issue'' politics of the Wilson administration,
which viewed many state-financed services as magnets for illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also is keenly aware that wedges can split a political
career both ways. A majority of voters supported Proposition 187
and another state initiative, Proposition 209, which ended
affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the major challenge Davis faces,'' said Mike Madrid,
former state GOP political director, ``is appeasing an increasing
and growing constituency that was largely responsible for his
overwhelming victory, and at the same time balancing his own
internal polling that shows the vast majority of Californians would
support Proposition 187 if it were on the ballot today. It's a
pretty big dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante, who is not related to the
lieutenant governor, acknowledged that Davis was balancing
constituencies in his decision to send Proposition 187 into
mediation to resolve legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters voted for this,'' Bustamante said, ``and the governor
will not disregard the vote that was cast, even though Proposition
187 was an initiative he believed was wrong and opposed.''

NORMAN FOSTER TO REDESIGN BOSTON'S MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Norman Foster, the 1999 Pritzker Prize-winning architect who
oversaw the recent redesign of the Reichstag in Berlin, has been
commissioned to produce a master plan for the expansion and
renovation of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced Monday by museum director Malcolm Rogers, is
part of a 10-year plan to enhance the institution. The selection of
Sir Norman, whose firm, Foster and Partners, has headquarters in
London, came after a yearlong search that considered about 30
architectural teams. The commission is the architect's first
full-scale project in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for an internationally recognized firm, which
would be able to create a landmark design for the museum,
integrating a modernist esthetic while remaining sympathetic to the
museum's existing historic buildings,'' said Graham Gund, an
honorary trustee of the institution. The museum has seen numerous
major expansions in its 130 years, most recently the
80,000-square-foot West Wing designed by I.M. Pei, another Pritzker
winner. The Pei addition was completed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Norman likened the museum to its surrounding city. ``You
have this building with wonderful historic qualities which has
grown over time,'' he said. ``It has some outstanding parts and
some that don't work so well.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect's work is noted for its adherence to the esthetics
of 20th-century modernism, combining bold structures, a lavish use
of glass and dramatic interior spaces. In the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corp. building in Hong Kong, perhaps his
best-known project, tall, thin slabs of metal, glass and concrete
appear to be held together by three massive steel trusses. His
design for the Reichstag features a glass dome enclosing spiral
ramps. Other museum projects include the Great Court of the British
Museum in London; the Sainsbury Center for Visual Arts in Norfolk,
England; the Carre d'Art in Nimes, France, and a new wing for the
Joslyn Museum in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   The jury for the Pritzker Prize, architecture's most prestigious
award, called Sir Norman's work ``downright beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials expect Foster and Partners to complete a master
site plan and initial schematic drawings by early next year.
Construction is expected to take several years.

<P>
   The ancient art of surgery is on the move again. For hundreds of
years most surgical procedures were done at home on the kitchen
table. Only in the last century did advances in medical technology
move them into hospital operating rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now much of surgery is traveling again, into the less expensive
settings of doctors' private offices, and this has set off an
escalating nationwide debate on how to insure patients' safety as
the complicated modern technology of anesthesia and surgery floats
free of hospital regulations back into less-restricted settings.
</P>
<P>
   Although only a handful of states have enacted legislation
dealing with office surgery, virtually all are examining the issue
because of a few widely publicized deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Favors, a day-care worker in Odessa, Texas, has to her
regret become an unwilling expert on the issue. Two years ago Mrs.
Favors' daughter, Kami, 9, went into a Texas doctor's office for
routine minor ear surgery. Kami's heart stopped from the anesthetic
before the surgery began, Mrs. Favors said. She was taken to a
nearby hospital but could not be resuscitated. A malpractice suit
was settled for $1.8 million early this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my only child,'' Mrs. Favors said. ``I'm never going
to have another one. Tell people to do their surgery in a hospital
that's regulated. Tell them to make certain they have somebody
there and medicine to help if something goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the most recent year for which statistics are
available, 51 percent of the nation's surgical procedures were done
on people who were not admitted to a hospital, according to the
National Center for Health Statistics. The SMG Marketing Group, a
Chicago consulting firm, estimated that 26 percent of all these
outpatient surgeries were performed in doctors' offices, up from 5
percent in 1981. If current trends continue, the group estimates,
20 percent of all surgical procedures will be done in doctors'
offices by the year 2005, a total of almost 10 million operations a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The most common procedures performed in outpatient settings are
cataract surgery, examinations and biopsies of the lining of the
small and large intestines and plastic surgery. Some outpatient
operations can be done under local anesthesia, but a growing number
require more powerful drugs, including sedatives that induce a
short sleep that erases all memory of the operation, and more
powerful anesthetics that paralyze breathing during surgery and
require the placement of a breathing tube and the use of a
respirator.
</P>
<P>
   The farther from a hospital an operation is moved, the less
expensive it becomes. The per-hour cost of an operation in a
freestanding surgical center near a hospital, and with close
hospital affiliations, is about 50 percent to 60 percent of that in
a hospital, and in a doctor's office, about 33 percent, said Edward
J. Stygar Jr., a spokesman for the American Association for
Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, patients generally find office settings more
pleasant, quieter and more private than hospitals, while medical
personnel almost always find working in an office more convenient
and efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But the farther from the hospital a surgical procedure moves,
the farther it also moves from the cadre of trained medical
personnel who can help in emergencies, and from the hospital's
thousands of regulations and protocols, including routine checks on
medical qualifications of surgeons and anesthesiologists,
maintenance of equipment, and procedures to follow if something
goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike hospitals and hospital-associated facilities, private
offices are largely exempt from routine oversight by state and
national agencies and subject to examination only when patients
file complaints. In most states, doctors are under no obligation to
report untoward incidents that happen in the office to the state
health authorities, nor do hospitals regularly track the emergency
and near-emergency cases that arrive in hospital emergency rooms
from doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   The state doctor-licensing boards lack the budget and manpower
for routine inspections of doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everyone else in state systems, medical boards are
suffering from limited resources,'' said Dale L. Austin, deputy
executive vice president of the Federation of State Medical Boards.
``They tend to go where there are complaints, where there are fires
to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there are few statistics on injuries or deaths from office
surgery, preventing the authorities from devising adequate
regulations. Still less is known about what kind of anesthesia
equipment is used in offices and how it is maintained, or how
commonly doctors perform surgery in their offices because they lack
the training or credentials to get operating privileges in a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey is one of the few states to put doctors' offices
under the same tight operating regulations as those for hospitals.
New York and Connecticut are looking at the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even in states without legislation, some safeguards on office
surgery exist, but they are voluntary. Three national independent
agencies can, for a fee, accredit offices where surgery is
performed. This means that office routines and qualifications of
personnel are periodically examined, much the way they are in a
hospital, and gross breaches of safety are picked up and corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Patients on their own are unlikely to sense when there is a
problem with a surgical office, said Dr. Ervin Moss, executive
medical director of the New Jersey State Society of
Anesthesiologists and a champion of the state's new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially plastic surgeons' offices,'' Moss said, ``You walk
in and it looks like Hollywood. People just don't know. They have
not been protected up till now.''
</P>
<P>
   Accidents during surgery do occur even in hospitals, but they
are increasingly rare. Deaths from anesthesia, a major cause of
surgical accidents, have declined by about 95 percent in the last
15 years, said Dr. Ellison C. Pierce Jr., an anesthesiologist at
Harvard University, who is executive director of the Anesthesia
Patient Safety Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement has resulted from better equipment for
monitoring patients, safer drugs and better training for medical
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Professional anesthesia organizations have developed guidelines
for administering anesthesia in offices, and many anesthesiologists
maintain that it can be given in the office just as safely as in a
hospital. But doing so requires an obsessive attention to detail
and safety procedures, said Dr. Marc E. Koch, an anesthesiologist
who works in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For four years, Koch has worked exclusively in doctors' offices,
wheeling portable anesthesia equipment on a luggage carrier into
private surgical offices to anesthetize patients for procedures as
simple as minor foot surgery or as complicated as an eight-hour
facelift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be one step better than a hospital,'' he said
recently, driving through city traffic for 8 a.m. breast surgery in
Great Neck, N.Y. Koch said he had walked out of surgical offices
with electrical hazards or unacceptable sanitation, and he
routinely carries a full array of emergency medication.
</P>
<P>
   A survey in the medical journal Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery in 1997 examined more than 400,000 surgical procedures done
in accredited surgical offices and found complications in fewer
than 1 percent of the cases, comparable to the low rate in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   But even if states make this accreditation mandatory, problems
with office surgery may persist. For example, California, one of
the states that regulate office surgery, required that all
office-surgery facilities be accredited as of 1996. Most surgeons
operating in their offices complied with the law, said Dr. Thomas
A. Joas, president of the Medical Board of California. But Joas
added: ``Were we left with a problem after that? Yes, we certainly
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the regulations were passed, three California women died
in medical offices from liposuction, the surgical removal of fat,
and another suffered gangrene of both legs from implant surgery to
increase the size of her calves. Legislation being considered in
California would further regulate office surgery, including
specifying how offices should be staffed and requiring full
disclosure of doctors' credentials to patients.
</P>
<P>
   But for states to dictate the parameters of private practice is
an enormously controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic surgery is ``the last bastion of the free enterprise
system in medicine, and it attracts physicians and surgeons of all
ilk,'' Joas said, referring to the fact that cosmetic procedures
are seldom covered by medical insurance and doctors are generally
paid in cash.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, and also because cosmetic procedures are
elective and the first to be bumped off hospital surgical schedules
for emergencies, cosmetic surgery is routinely performed in
doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cosmetic operation performed in the United
States is liposuction, which may cause a variety of
life-threatening complications. According to a report last week in
The New England Journal of Medicine, five people died in New York
City from 1993 to 1998 after liposuction, from dangerous shifts in
body fluid, blood clots that traveled to the lungs or complications
from anesthesia.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the dangers of cosmetic surgery have focused the
state's concern with office surgery in general. Last winter, a Fort
Lauderdale newspaper, The Sun-Sentinel, published a series of
articles detailing dozens of deaths that occurred during cosmetic
procedures in the state since 1986. Many of the operations were
performed in doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Florida Medical Board reacted to the series with
a set of stringent regulations governing office surgery, including
limits on the amount of fat that could be removed during an office
liposuction, and a mandate that office operations last no more than
six hours. Cosmetic operations, particularly when they include
several procedures, may take eight hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions on the amount of fat safely removed in an
outpatient setting is consistent with medical guidelines, said Dr.
Joel R. Studin, a Manhattan plastic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   But although some surgery, like an abdominal operation, is safer
when it is shorter, limiting the duration of cosmetic operations is
not known to increase their safety, said Dr. Edward Truppman, a
Florida plastic surgeon who is the immediate past president of the
Florida Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   The stipulation worries many Florida plastic surgeons. They fear
that to practice legally, they might rush procedures, Truppman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can regulate or legislate good surgical
judgment,'' Truppman said.
</P>
<P>
   And when states try to regulate not only surgical procedures in
offices but also who performs them, they may become entangled in
turf battles and stall efforts on regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, for instance, part of the state's 1998
regulations are on hold while certified nurse-anesthetists battle
the state in court over the requirement that an anesthesia-trained
doctor also be on the premises during some office procedures.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York, state Sen. Roy M. Goodman, Republican of
Manhattan, said that shortly after his office issued a report
detailing problems with office surgery in the state and implying
that only doctors with plastic surgery training should perform
liposuction, he was visited by a group of dermatologists who wanted
to emphasize their own qualifications to perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really needs to be done is to determine through some form
of survey what the bungle rate is of services that are being
performed by doctors in offices,'' Goodman said. ``What we have is
anecdotal information which is quite shocking. We have to try to
get some further information so that we can determine what
categories of things are most accident-prone and most likely to
cause an unhappy outcome.''

 &HT;    FCC TO STUDY NEED FOR BROADBAND RULES
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories

<P>
   WASHINGTON-- Government regulators plan to move cautiously in
framing rules to govern high-speed digital services for consumers,
Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As telecommunications companies increasingly offer Internet
service, the FCC must weigh to what extent it should regulate what
Kennard pointed out is an essentially unregulated medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be very, very careful about injecting government
into a market like the Internet, which has thrived quite well
without a lot of government intervention,'' Kennard told a National
Consumers League forum on information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard argued that consumers have benefited because the
Internet market ``has been effectively unregulated.'' But he said
the FCC will soon seek wide public comment ``on access to the
broadband pipe so that we can gain a better understanding of how
this marketplace is developing and whether there is an appropriate
regulatory response to this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have is the cable companies moving into the Internet
and the telcos moving into the Internet,'' Bell Atlantic Chairman
Ivan Seidenberg, another forum speaker, said. When fully
implemented, their rival broadband technologies will be capable of
offering high-quality video and audio links to the World Wide Web,
as well as other interactive consumer services.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg agreed with Kennard that consumers should have easy
entry to a host of communications gateways, including wireless and
satellite services. But he also called on the FCC to deal ``with
issue of parity,'' claiming that the cable companies currently
enjoy an unfair advantage as a result of ``disparate regulatory
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard and Seidenberg were joined on the panel by America
Online Chairman Steve Case, who said: ``My own view is that there
are only two broadband wires into the home: the cable line and the
telephone line....
</P>
<P>
   We need to recognize that two wires taken to an extreme would
lead to a duopoly that would gut innovation and momentum in this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online recently sought to become a partner in a bid by
Comcast to acquire MediaOne Group, a big cable firm with Internet
aspirations. But, America Online, the nation's biggest online
service, backed out of the deal when AT&AMP;T trumped the Comcast offer
in an effort to become the nation's top cable provider.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the forum about America Online's broadband strategy
in the wake of the failed Comcast overture, Case said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to work with any company who is interested in
working with us to try to move this medium forward and try to take
advantage of the audience we have to sell their technology.
Certainly AT&AMP;T is on the list of companies we'd love to work with
as long as we can establish a win-win partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Case noted that about one-third of all U.S. households currently
possess Internet access. Although only a tiny fraction have the
kind of fast connections that are increasingly common in the
workplace, that number is expected to rise rapidly in the next five
years.

conference in Washington sponsored by the century old National
Consumers League.

&HT;        FOUR JAILED REFUGEES RETURNED TO CAMPSITE, INS OFFICIALS
SAID
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, May 17 -- After a brief stint in Pennsylvania jails,
four ethnic Albanian refugees who used fake identities to gain
entry into the United States were returned Sunday to Fort Dix, New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The four were freed when immigration officials reversed their
position, deeming it ``unnecessary'' to jail refugees just because
they lacked the proper documentation, said Amy Otten, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had to follow the standard immigration
procedures which would be to detain someone while these questions
were answered,'' Otten said. ``But we reconsidered and now unless
it's an egregious situation or there are issues with the person's
criminal history, we don't have to go through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials, Otten said, now know the identities of the four
Ethnic Albanian refugees. The two men, one woman and one teenage
girl are unrelated, did not have criminal backgrounds and had been
slated to come to the U.S as refugees, Otten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a case where they may have jumped ahead in line
or traded spots with relatives or friends in order to leave
war-torn Kosovo earlier,'' Otten said. ``We just didn't have the
right documents for them.''
</P>
<P>
   When the four arrived last week at Fort Dix, N.J., immigration
officials realized their names didn't match identification photos
taken in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, aged 21 and 22, had been held in Carbon County
prison, and a 22-year-old Kosovo woman was in a York County prison.
A 17-year-old Kosovo girl was kept at the Berks County youth
center, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting immigration hearings to determine if they could
remain in the country, the four refugees had been sent to
``dormitory portions'' of the jails and separated from the inmates.
But officials said there was no longer a risk the four would be
returned to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never believed they were criminals,'' Otten said. ``This is
a unique situation and we are having to create unique procedures to
reconcile our desire to help the refugees with the requirements of
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   An INS spokesman at Fort Dix said the four were ``relieved to be
back at the campsite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a four or five day detour,'' said Carl Rusnok, a
Philadelphia regional spokesman for INS temporarily based at Fort
Dix. ``It's a wonderful day here in New Jersey for those refugees
who are now back with the others at the picnic area and
playground.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials had announced they would tighten screening of refugees
in an effort to keep out Serb collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, INS officials received special training on
identifying criminals who may be passing themselves off as
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The four were in the second wave of ethnic Albanians who arrived
at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey earlier this month. The
U.S. has agreed to take in 20,000 Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Otten said there are about 29 other cases at Fort Dix where the
identities of refugees is unclear. But those cases will be handled
differently, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those refugees will not be sent to jails while the details of
their identities are sought,'' Otten said. ``We have had to
establish these procedures as we go along in these unique
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for The United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, said the group was pleased INS had reconsidered its
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better if they had never been jailed at
all, but we are very happy INS reversed itself promptly,'' said
Bemma Donkoh, a UNHCR spokeswoman. ``This is the right thing to do.
We hope this will mean good things for future refugees.''

BENDS IN THE RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do meandering rivers meander more over time or do
they straighten out?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There are three basic channel patterns for a river: straight,
meandering or braided. Depending on factors like terrain, soil and
water volume, different stretches of a river may show different
patterns, and channels may shift over time.
</P>
<P>
   There is no fixed rule for the evolution of a river's channel,
but one typical progression is from meandering to even more
convoluted to straight. What happens in such a case, according to
the geology text ``Understanding Earth'' by Frank Press and Raymond
Siever (W.H. Freeman &AMP; Co.) is that the flowing water, which
reaches its maximum velocity at the outside of a bend, causes the
greatest amount of soil erosion there. The eroded material is
deposited as what is called a point bar on the inside of the bend.
</P>
<P>
   The position of the strongest current shifts from side to side,
and the meanders migrate and accentuate over time. The migration
can be very rapid; some Mississippi River meanders move as much as
65 feet a year. As the looping meanders become more pronounced and
migrate, getting closer and closer together, they are vulnerable to
being cut off during a flood.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the river bypasses a loop, and an oxbow lake is
formed as the main course of the river takes the straighter path,
past the cut-off lake. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday, five feet of standing water covered the streets of
Dubuque, Iowa, as a slow-moving thunderstorm produced 3.7 inches of
rain in portions of the city. The storm was part of a larger
cluster of showers and thunderstorms that erupted as an approaching
cold front lifted a wedge of very humid air covering the Middle
West. Tuesday the front will forge eastward, bringing the threat
for potent storms to the eastern Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The day will dawn unusually warm from southern Ohio to western
New York. As the sun heats the ground and overlying moist air, the
atmosphere will turn more unstable, setting the stage for strong
thunderstorms to form by afternoon. An approaching jet stream
disturbance will enhance the volatile conditions, causing a few of
the storms to produce hail and damaging winds.
</P>
<P>
   Intervals of clouds and sun will cover the Northeast and Middle
Atlantic Seaboards Tuesday as an offshore low-pressure system
continues to circulate damp, ocean-chilled air westward. Farther
south, sunshine and humid conditions will persist over Florida with
isolated thunderstorms developing in the sultry air.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated potent thunderstorms will ignite across southern Texas
and the lower Tennessee Valley as a weak cool front crosses the
region. Behind the front, dry but warm conditions will envelop the
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional showers will dampen the Northwest as cool, onshore
breezes persist. Meanwhile, the Southwest will broil beneath
abundant sun. Readings will exceed 100 degrees near the
California-Arizona border.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Pending Monsoon
</P>
<P>
   Not a single raindrop has to fall during a monsoon. Derived from
an Arabic word meaning ``season,'' a monsoon is simply a seasonal
shift in wind direction. Over India, extreme heating in summer
fosters moist ocean winds that fuel showers. During India'Us
winter, however, the expansive Siberian high dominates, promoting
dry northerly winds that shut off precipitation. The onset of humid
winds from the Bay of Bengal initiates over Sri Lanka during the
next week. It takes most of June for the sultry winds to dominate
the subcontinent with tropical moisture not reaching Delhi until
early July.

IN THE FUTURE, SOME DOCTORS MAY BE GADGETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Md., N.C., Utah)  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every week, a group of doctors, engineers, scientists and
computer specialists get together at the University of Rochester in
Rochester, N.Y., to talk over ideas that might sound outlandish to
most people, including the notion that the future of medicine lies
in devices that are high-tech, cheap and controlled by patients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ``smart'' bandage covering a wound that would
instantly screen for common infectious agents and indicate whether
an antibiotic was needed, and if so, which one. Or memory glasses
linked to a databank of familiar faces that would display their
names to Alzheimer patients when one comes into sight. Or a body
scanner that would provide a daily body check in the shower and
report on the growth of any melanoma long before the person would
be likely to find it, or an ``emotion detector'' that would learn
the rhythms of a wife-batterer's rages and warn him as anger began
to build.
</P>
<P>
   None of these gadgets are ready for the drugstore or close to
it. But the cross-pollinating sessions that gave rise to them have
also given birth to the Center for the Future of Health, a new
partnership between the University of Rochester and the Media Lab
of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their collaboration
points to the growing entwinement of computer sciences and the
healing arts and the degree of integration between fields like
pathology, biochemistry and electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Similar efforts are under way at Johns Hopkins, Duke and
Massachusetts General Medical Center, where doctors armed with a
Defense Department grant are trying to apply military technology to
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the devices under development at the center rely on a
new generation of microsensors that use inexpensive computer chips
not only to record but to analyze data. ``That allows you to know
what's happening to you virtually all the time _ to learn your
body's specific rhythm as opposed to the average pattern,'' said
Alexander Pentland, academic director of the MIT Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   The devices could home in on more specific problems as well. For
example, diabetics often lose sensation in their feet, leaving
injuries unnoticed and untreated until they have grown more
serious. Sensors inserted in the fibers of socks could detect such
injuries before the wearer could, according to a center proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Langer, a professor of bioengineering at MIT with no
connection to the Rochester center, believes many of the proposals
at the center are promising, but wonders about their practical
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``These all sound like very good ideas, but the key issue is how
well are these things really going to work,'' he said. ``You can
make something small or cheap or efficient, but it's hard to do all
three. Sensors, for instance, have to be small enough to go where
they are needed, specific enough to focus in on what is being
looked for and sensitive enough to filter out background noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alice Pentland, a dermatologist who is the Rochester
center's medical director, and Pentland's sister, said one of the
program's goals was to get participants ``from each side of the
divide'' to be more aware of how the other side works. ``Engineers
are used to building something, trying it, taking it apart and then
building it again,'' she said. ``Physicians are more used to having
devices handed to them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, clinicians have a clearer idea of the needs
for which gadgets should be dreamed up. The smart-bandage project,
for example, grew out of a radio report Dr. Pentland heard about an
epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis in Russia caused by misuse
of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it takes weeks to get culture results for
identifying new strains,'' she said. ``I was thinking that sooner
or later we're going to get an influx of this, and wouldn't it be
nice to have something that could screen for it fast, and stop the
epidemic before it got into the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   The bandage works with an array of tiny sensors, each able to
recognize one characteristic of bacteria, which have telltale
patterns of sugars and proteins. In the presence of an infectious
agent, the reactions would create a current that would feed a
microcomputer, which would then compare the ``map'' of reactions
with stored data on bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   It took a team, including a microbiologist, biochemist, computer
scientist and electrical engineer, to conclude that the task was
doable. Dr. Philippe Fauchet, the center's director, estimates that
a working product is three to five years away.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the center's projects are trying to take recent
high-tech developments and spin off simpler counterparts. For
instance, its researchers hope to use a sophisticated robotic hand
developed by MIT and the University of Utah to develop
object-recognition software for a device that could help older
patients keep their pills straight.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pentland said she hoped that the approach could spill over
into a number of disciplines, like psychology. ``Imagine how a
behavioral therapist would benefit from something that would not
only monitor a session but give feedback as the therapy was
proceeding,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposed psychological device, the emotion monitor, is
an example of how the center hopes to build on a fairly simple,
existing device _ a sensor worn like a wristwatch that monitors the
pulse and major muscle movements. The next stage would be to add
sensors that track respiration. The leap would come in developing
``intelligent'' software that could learn how those measures
correlate with the wearer's emotional state, potentially sounding
an alarm as a violent rage first starts to build.
</P>
<P>
   Officials concede that such devices raise staggering issues of
privacy, as do even simpler proposed devices like the melanoma
monitor, which would create a three-dimensional map of the body
surface and analyze changes for early signs of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Phelps, a health-care economist who is provost of the
University of Rochester, said it would be important to establish
the principle that the consumers who buy the devices own the data
they create. ``Think of a smart bed that records metabolic rates
and other information,'' he said. ``Insurers would certainly like
to get their hands on that data _ who is obese, who has heart
problems _ but there's no particular reason why consumers should
have to give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pentland said she hoped the data from such home monitors
would provide very specific individual health information for
consumers to use, for example, in the doctor's office. ``Right now
people come in with their piles of information from the Internet
about something that's far from the mark,'' she said. But if
patients are able to pose routine queries through interactive
medical records ``friendly enough for a mom to be able to use in
the middle of the night,'' and arrive armed with detailed data from
home monitors, ``this will free doctors up to do what they should
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into medicine to give emotional support and help people
with problems,'' Dr. Pentland said, ``not just to be a test-taker
and a paper-shover.''

   Are Sports Drinks Better Than Water?
</P>
<P>
   Sports drinks offer many benefits over plain water or other
beverages like fruit juice or soda to maintain hydration status and
enhance performance.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have studies found that people can perform at higher
intensities for longer periods of time for endurance sports
(activities lasting over 90 minutes) like marathon running or
cycling, recent research shows that sports drinks improve athletic
performance in high-intensity, stop-and-go sports including
basketball and soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike water, sports drinks provide sodium, which is lost in
sweat, and carbohydrates. The small amount of sodium helps
stimulate the body's thirst mechanism so that the active person
drinks more than he or she normally would. In addition, these
ingredients speed fluid absorption from the gut into the
bloodstream, making dehydration less likely. Finally, the
carbohydrates in sports drinks provide a steady source of readily
available energy so that people can avoid the feeling of hitting
the wall when muscle carbohydrate stores are depleted.

   For most active people, sports drinks are unnecessary, if water
is consumed before, during and after exercise. The vast majority of
active people do not exercise long enough or hard enough to reap
the benefits of rapid hydration that sports drinks provide.
</P>
<P>
   Those who exercise to lose weight should be reminded that every
quart of a sports drink contains 250 calories, so consumers have to
make sure to burn off well over 250 calories during a workout to
create a caloric deficit. It is possible that some people consume
more calories in sports drinks than they burn off during their
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Unless someone loses several pounds of sweat, equivalent to 2
percent or more of body weight, he runs little risk of becoming
dehydrated by drinking water rather than sports drinks. During most
workouts, people do not come close to approaching dehydration nor
do they lose so much sodium in sweat that they need to replenish
sodium during sports.
</P>
<P>
   If a person's urine lacks color and he urinates every two to
four hours, he is adequately hydrated.

<P>
   For Gay Teens, a Desperate Cry for Help
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers who are gay or bisexual are more than three times as
likely to attempt suicide as other youth, according to a
Massachusetts study reported this month in The Archives of
Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine. Young men are at particular
risk, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   The lead researcher, Dr. Robert Garofalo, a pediatrician at
Children's Hospital at the Harvard Medical School, also noted that
these young people were more likely to engage in other high risk
behaviors: alcohol consumption, drug and tobacco use and sexual
activities with multiple partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any clinician who works with youth has long suspected that
attempting suicide is an issue for a subset of gay youth,''
Garofalo said. ``I see the results of this study as a cry for
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo and his colleagues looked at self-reported data on
sexual orientation and suicide attempts among students in 9th
through 12th grade who participated in the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's 1995 Youth Risk Behavior Survey.
Massachusetts was the first state to add a question about sexual
orientation. Answers were optional and anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4,167 students surveyed, 3.8 percent identified
themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or unsure of their sexual
orientation. Researchers found these students were 3.41 times as
likely to report a suicide attempt within the previous year as were
heterosexual students.
</P>
<P>
   The number rose significantly when only young men were
considered. In the overall population, boys tend to commit suicide
more often than girls, the American Academy of Pediatrics says.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David H. Kaplan, a pediatrics professor at the University of
Colorado School of Medicine who is charged with revising the
academy's teen-age suicide policy, believes that solutions are
fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about engaging kids and making them feel that they
really matter and their thoughts really matter,'' Kaplan said.
``There is lots of homophobia these days, but those kids in a more
accepting environment do a lot better than those kids seen as
freaks.''

   What Fills a Child's Garden of Fears
</P>
<P>
   Things may still go ``bump'' in the night, but school-age
children are actually more afraid of sharks and snakes, according
to an Ohio State University study examining children's fears and
anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 90 boys and girls 8 to 12 years old and
included interviews with the children, human-figure drawing
analysis and questionnaires gauging anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the children reported 177 fears, and neither sex
appeared to be generally more fearful than the other.
</P>
<P>
   They were most often afraid for their safety, of animals or of
natural phenomena like storms, lightning or thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This age group has pretty vivid imaginations, which are part
of their charm,'' said Dr. Nancy A. Ryan-Wenger, chairwoman of the
department of community, parent, child and psychiatric nursing at
Ohio State University and lead author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're learning to differentiate between reality and fantasy,
but at the same time, they're not really sure that things they
fantasize couldn't happen,'' Dr. Ryan-Wenger said.
</P>
<P>
   Boys said they were more afraid for their safety (74 percent)
and of animals (40 percent) than were the girls (58 percent and 23
percent). Safety fears included people wielding guns or knives,
forced entries into their homes and frightening amusement park
rides.
</P>
<P>
   Animal feared included sharks, snakes, wolves and spiders. Girls
tended to be more afraid of natural phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Boys also reported more fears than girls when the topic dealt
with supernatural phenomena like fear of aliens and monsters (14
percent versus 12 percent) and school.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve percent of the boys questioned admitted that they feared
school authority figures and failure, but just 7 percent of the
girls reported having the same fears.

<P>
   As Margaret Tracey floated across the Lincoln Center stage on
Sunday afternoon, every line of a perfectly fit ballerina's body
where every line ought to be, it was impossible to believe that
little more than six months ago she was, as grandmother used to
say, great with child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tracey, 32, a principal with the New York City Ballet, gave
birth to a son, Avery, on Oct. 22. Her friend Stacey Calvert, a
36-year-old soloist with the company, gave birth to a girl, Ayla,
two weeks later. This month, both ballerinas had their post-baby
debuts, and the experience makes it clear that it is far easier to
get in great shape soon after pregnancy or other disruptive events
if one was in great shape to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   As for staying in shape during pregnancy, supervision, group
interaction and organized fitness classes are invaluable aids, say
fitness experts like Elizabeth Noble, author of ``Essential
Exercise for the Childbearing Year'' (Houghton Mifflin, 3rd
edition).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tracey had no problem with the group interaction part. She
continued with the dance company during the first four months of
her pregnancy. At the end of that period, with her waist expanding,
she starred as the Pearly Queen in ``Union Jack.'' ``But this is
one of the easier roles I have,'' she said in an interview. She
appeared, as a costermonger and streetwise entertainer, in a
loose-fitting, camouflaging jacket. She then stopped performing but
continued with ballet classes an hour and a half a day, five days a
week until two months before the baby was due. After that, she
continued rigorous stretching until the day she entered the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Her fitness regimen before the baby's birth was close to
perfection, in the view of her trainer and physical therapist,
Marika Molnar, director of Westside Dance Physical Therapy, which
treats the company dancers. But Ms. Molnar also pointed out that
``Margaret and Stacey were in excellent shape before the
pregnancy,'' and this enabled them to continue more rigorous
activity than would otherwise be prudent.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists recommend exercise of moderate intensity and duration
_ stretching, stationary cycling, swimming and walking. Other types
are either disapproved or require modification, but the college
says: avoid ``jerky, bouncy movements and exercises that involve
straining, jumping or sudden changes in direction'' _ the very
definition of ballet.
</P>
<P>
   For these dancing mothers, ``modification'' and extraordinary
conditioning were the keys. ``Margaret and Stacey have been dancing
all their lives,'' Ms. Molnar said. ``They know what their bodies
can and can't do. And they knew to take the easier roles that are
doable and safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that elevator, or Kegel, exercises, before and
after delivery are essential to restore the muscles that are most
weakened during pregnancy and delivery. ``The first area to be
worked, contracted and relaxed, can actually be started in the
recovery room _ within a half-hour of delivery,'' Ms. Molnar said,
depending on difficulties in delivery or pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molnar described the Kegels as three sets of exercises:
first as contractions of the lower pelvic muscles, holding the
contraction for 10 seconds, relaxing, then repeating the exercise
50 times every hour. The second is a series of ``quick flick''
contractions of those muscles, with no holding, for one minute. The
third is deep diaphragmatic breathing, inhaling and expanding the
rib cage, filling the back part with air, which strengthens the
lower-back muscles; then exhaling, contracting the abdominals
between pubic bone and navel, which pushes the lower abdominal
muscles toward the back. She recommends repeating this set for
about five minutes every hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``These simple exercises are important for everyone, for the
lungs, posture, for keeping the abdominals strong and the stomach
flat,'' Ms. Molnar said. Sports-medicine experts and trainers
stress the value of learning well-timed rhythmic breathing for peak
performance, making difficult tasks _ from weight lifting, to golf
swings to ballet steps _ easier during exhalation when the body is
more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Calvert tried Kegels after delivery and did them
sporadically in the days that followed. Ms. Tracey was quick to
confess that she did not do them and waited eight weeks before
starting any kind of workout regimen. The routine for the
ballerinas intensified as the weeks of recovery passed and they
added spring-resistance-weight training, especially well suited to
dancers for strengthening muscles at the hip joint in particular,
as well as legs, arms, chest and upper back. The spring weights are
attached to a strong bedlike fabric on which the two ballerinas
could safely perform all their routines, each spring being
tightened to increase resistance as they gained strength. Finally,
Ms. Molnar readied her stars by insisting that they walk, walk and
walk more. ``Three times a week, 30 to 45 minutes, no errands,
nonstop,'' Ms. Molnar said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Calvert's post-baby debut came at the Saturday matinee in
early May in a solo role in the new production of Peter Martin's
``Swan Lake.'' It was a good performance to start with: ``It was
not hard,'' said Ms. Calvert, who felt strong and happy to be back.
Ms. Tracey said that when she stepped out to dance her solo as a
muse in Stravinsky's ``Apollo'' on Sunday, ``I knew I was home, in
a place where I belonged.''
</P>
<P>
   The applause was good to hear, they said. Which was better, they
were asked, the applause of a full house at New York State Theater,
or the sound of two hands clapping at home? The smiles of the
ballerinas left no doubt about the answer.

COURT LIMITS JUDGES ABILITY TO INVALIDATE ELECTION DISTRICTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a ruling watched closely by politicians around
the country, the Supreme Court made it harder Monday for judges to
invalidate election districts on the grounds that the state
legislatures setting the boundaries did so largely for racial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   By forcing judges to be more certain of the role that race plays
before deciding to strike down any reapportionment plan, the
court's unanimous ruling could influence redistricting plans
nationwide after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case was North Carolina's snake-shaped 12th
Congressional District, which was challenged in federal court as
having been drawn with racial factors as the predominant
consideration _ something the high court has ruled
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A group of white plaintiffs filed a suit in federal court
alleging that the North Carolina legislature drew the district's
boundaries in 1997 in an effort to get minority candidates elected,
violating the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which
bans racial favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   But North Carolina argued that state lawmakers were trying to
draw a congressional district where Democratic voters, not
necessarily black voters, would be in the majority. The fact that
the district created was also heavily African American was merely a
coincidence, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, a three-judge U.S. District Court ruled 2-1 that the
12th District, containing parts of Winston-Salem, was
unconstitutional primarily because the legislature excluded many
adjoining precincts that were heavily Democratic but also largely
white.
</P>
<P>
   After considering the 12th District's shape and racial makeup,
the court made its decision in what lawyers call a ``summary
judgment'' _ which is used when judges feel that the facts in the
case are clear and that a full trial is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the high court reversed that decision, saying the
three-judge panel acted too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the lower
court erred in not holding a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   But he indicated that he agreed with its verdict. ``Evidence
tends to support an inference that the state drew its district
lines to support an impermissible racial motive _ even though ...
(he plaintiffs) presented no direct evidence of intent,'' Thomas
said. ``Summary judgment, however, is appropriate only where there
is no genuine issue of material fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Still, a voting rights specialist at the Washington-based
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, said the court's decision,
while ``fairly narrow,'' does give civil rights advocates some
breathing room. ``If the state of North Carolina had lost this
case, it would have been disastrous for the civil rights
movement,'' Still said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in six years that the high court has
examined the much-studied North Carolina district.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 ruling, the justices allowed people to challenge
districts that were ``extremely irregular'' and apparently designed
to ``segregate the races for the purposes of voting.''
</P>
<P>
   The boundaries for the 12th District were first struck down in
1996. At that time, it had a 57 percent majority of blacks among
registered voters. It was 160 miles long and for some stretches had
the width only of Interstate 85.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature redrew the district in 1997, making it wider and
cutting its length to 71 miles. This time blacks comprised 47
percent of registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the Supreme Court has issued several redistricting
decisions elsewhere that shot down attempts by state and local
lawmakers to use race as the ``predominant factor'' in drawing
lines to preserve or enhance minority candidates' chances of
winning. Most of those rulings were reached by 5-4 votes that
reflected the court's ideological divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy united in those
cases to control the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting in those cases were Justices John Paul Stevens, David
H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, those four justices joined in the final result but
not in Thomas' opinion. Stevens wrote separately for the four.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record supports the conclusion that most loyal Democrats
living near the borders of District 12 happen to be black
Democrats, and I have no doubt that the legislature was conscious
of that fact when it enacted the apportionment plan,'' Stevens
said. ``But everyone agrees that that fact is not sufficient to
invalidate the district.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina dispute now will return to the three-judge
federal court.

 &HT;    SEVEN YEARS AFTER 'MURPHY BROWN,' QUAYLE'S THEMES ARE ECHOING
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The value-laden presidential campaign themes of
Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have a
familiar ring, one that former Vice President Dan Quayle sounded
exactly seven years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Quayle, himself a candidate for president, returns
to San Francisco to the same podium where he delivered his famous
``Poverty of Values'' _ or ``Murphy Brown'' _ speech, in which he
sounded an alarm over the decline of the two-parent family.
</P>
<P>
   While his 1992 speech to the Commonwealth Club of California was
widely ridiculed, Quayle's message of the importance of family
values in a culture awash in sex, drugs and violence now echoes in
the rhetoric of the presidential front-runners of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Even Quayle critics are now willing to concede that he spoke up
long before other politicians about the loosening of moral moorings
and social bonds in U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what he (Quayle) was saying was constructive,'' House
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt acknowledged, even if the speech
betrayed a nostalgia for the largely fictional ``Father Knows
Best'' America of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of his cut at this was a desire to go back in time,''
said Gephardt. ``But you can't go back. ... So, without discharging
parents of their responsibility, we have to help families succeed
in the modern world.''
</P>
<P>
   What has changed the course of the 2000 presidential campaign is
the recent shooting of high school students in suburban Littleton,
Colo. The deaths of 15 students have had ``a searing effect'' on
the American conscience, said Celinda Lake, a noted pollster and
public opinion analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Pew Research Center in Washington has found that the
tragedy at Columbine High School has evoked an extraordinary level
of public attention. It is the third highest ranked news story of
the decade in the center's survey of public attentiveness, behind
only the Rodney King verdict in 1992 and the crash of TWA Flight
800 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic front-runner, and Bush, the favorite in the
GOP field, have borrowed freely from Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign
and its emphasis on ``opportunity'' and ``responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither candidate took up Clinton's theme of ``community''
until the killings in Colorado sparked a rare period of national
soul-searching over the nature of Americans' obligations to their
children and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gore is talking about reaching beyond government to
integrating the role of community and religious organizations in
addressing social ills, and Bush is touting his record in Texas of
involving private and faith-based organizations in government
social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's commencement address Sunday to Graceland College in
Lamoni, Iowa, sounded as if whole pages came from Quayle. The vice
president noted that parents today lack the ``most precious''
commodity _ ``time with their children ... to teach them right from
wrong, time to pass on their best values.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when there is time, Gore added, ``challenges to the
strength of the family remain,'' mostly from a culture ``of chaotic
value'' _ a culture ``with too much meanness, and not enough
meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has yet to venture outside of Austin as a
presidential candidate, his comments in interviews also echo
Quayle's concerns. In a post-Littleton interview with the Los
Angeles Times, for example, he said parenting ``tools'' such as the
television rating system are less important than cultural changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental question is going to be, can America
rededicate itself to parenting as the No. 1 priority for all of
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron insisted Monday that the former
vice president is ``not the kind of guy who says, 'I told you so.'
`` Still, Quayle couldn't resist reminding voters in New Hampshire
last weekend that he pioneered the values debate, at great
political expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's been through the meat grinder?'' Quayle said in Concord.
``Who's back up on his feet fighting for you and has the courage to
get back up and continue the fight for our values and for our
families?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '90s, people laughed him off the stage when he
talked about family values,'' said Mike Robinson, a Concord
businessman who had come to hear Quayle. ``If they took him
seriously back then, we might not have some of the problems we have
now _ like in Colorado.''

<P>
   Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron insisted Monday that the former
vice president is ``not the kind of guy who says, 'I told you so.'
`` Still, Quayle couldn't resist reminding voters in New Hampshire
last weekend that he pioneered the values debate, at great
political expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's been through the meat grinder?'' Quayle said in Concord.
``Who's back up on his feet fighting for you and has the courage to
get back up and continue the fight for our values and for our
families?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '90s, people laughed him off the stage when he
talked about family values,'' said Mike Robinson, a Concord
businessman who had come to hear Quayle. ``If they took him
seriously back then, we might not have some of the problems we have
now _ like in Colorado.''

NBC EXPANDS DRAMA LINEUP FOR FALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC announced a new fall program schedule on Monday that
signaled a significant shift away from half-hour comedies and
toward drama, some based in comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Only two seasons ago NBC had 18 half-hour comedies in prime
time; this fall there will be 10. The network is dropping such
comedies as ``Mad About You,'' ``News Radio,'' ``Caroline in the
City'' and ``Lateline'' and adding only two, ``The Mike O'Malley
Show'' and ``Stark Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Several NBC executives cited a shortage of strong new comedies
to choose from this spring, partly a result of a boycott by studios
last fall, when NBC tried to force the studios to relinquish some
percentage of ownership of shows or charge NBC a single price for
the lifetime of a show. Normally there is a four-year license
period after which the price can rise.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will also add five dramas, three from producers associated
with NBC's strongest shows. John Wells, executive producer of
``E.R.,'' has two new dramas, ``The West Wing'' and ``Third
Watch.'' Dick Wolf, executive producer of ``Law and Order,'' has a
new drama that NBC wants to associate with that perennial hit: It's
called ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The best spot for a new series on NBC schedules throughout the
1990s has been Thursday at 9:30 p.m. It still is, although the 9
p.m. comedy ``Frasier'' has proved far more vulnerable there than
``Seinfeld'' ever was, and ``E.R.'' at 10 p.m. has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has mostly wasted the 9:30 slot with such poorly received
fare as ``Veronica's Closet.'' The comedy inheriting the 9:30 spot
this fall will be ``Stark Raving Mad,'' which stars Tony Shalhoub
as a horror novelist and Neil Patrick Harris as his new, extremely
taxed editor. It is created by Steve Levitan of ``Just Shoot Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' (Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m.) stars that
comic as a man who decides at age 30 that it is time to become an
adult.
</P>
<P>
   The drama NBC has highest hopes for is ``The West Wing''
(Wednesday at 9 p.m.), a look behind the scenes at a fictitious
White House. It stars Rob Lowe as the communications aide and
Martin Sheen as the president. It was written by Aaron Sorkin, the
creator of ``Sports Night.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Third Watch'' (Sundays at 8 p.m.) traces the lives of
paramedics, firefighters and police officers on the night shift in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special Victims Unit'' (Mondays at 9 p.m.), once called ``Sex
Crimes'' before more cautious thinking prevailed, is about
especially vicious crimes against women and children. One
connection to ``Law and Order'' will have Dann Florek returning to
his role as Capt. Donald Cragen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Feet'' (Fridays at 10 p.m.) is a comic drama about the
relationship among three couples: One are new parents, one just
dating and one just married.
</P>
<P>
   The final drama, ``Freaks and Geeks'' (Saturdays at 8 p.m.), is
one of the new season's near endless parade of shows set in
schools, this one being a comic look at the out crowd in high
school in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   NBC had a couple of surprise survivors, including ``Veronica's
Closet,'' which will move to Mondays at 8:30 p.m., and especially
``Jesse,'' which won a second chance on Thursday at 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the NBC fall lineup:
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY: 8 p.m., ``Suddenly Susan''; 8:30, ``Veronica's Closet'';
9, ``Law and Order: Special Victims Unit''; 10, ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Third Rock From the Sun''; 8:30, ``The Mike
O'Malley Show''; 9, ``Just Shoot Me''; 9:30, ``Will and Grace'';
10, ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY: 8 p.m., ``Dateline''; 9, ``The West Wing''; 10, ``Law
and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY: 8 p.m., ``Friends''; 8:30, ``Jesse''; 9, ``Frasier'';
9:30, ``Stark Raving Mad''; 10, ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY: 8 p.m., ``Providence''; 9 p.m., ``Dateline''; 10, ``Cold
Feet.''
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY: 8 p.m., ``Freaks and Geeks''; 9, ``Pretender''; 10,
``Profiler.''
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY: 7 p.m., ``Dateline''; 8, ``Third Watch''; 9, Movies.

<P>
   MIAMI _ The explorers battled fat leeches and cliffsides so
steep and slippery, one false step could mean a plunge of thousands
of feet.
</P>
<P>
   They navigated a raging, treacherous river. They even heard
rumors of the Dugmas, a cult of females who attack outsiders with
snake venom concealed beneath their fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an Indiana Jones-style adventure, but it was
real.
</P>
<P>
   The expedition, sponsored by the National Geographic Society
last November, took four Americans into the inner gorge of the
Tsangpo River, the world's deepest canyon, in a remote part of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-day undertaking was a lesson in endurance, but the reward
was extraordinary: the sight of a thundering, 100-foot-high
cascade, dubbed ``Hidden Falls.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's equally extraordinary is that a giant waterfall on a
major river had yet to be recorded. Indeed, on the eve of the 21st
century, there are lots of unexplored spots on the planet _ even in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we mapped every single inch of the globe? Certainly, we
have not,'' said Rebecca Martin, director of the National
Geographic Society's Expeditions Board. ``There are nooks and
crannies in the Grand Canyon no one has gotten to.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1888, the National Geographic Society's name is
synonymous with the exploration of exotic places. It publishes the
magazines National Geographic and National Geographic Traveler, and
recently launched National Geographic Adventure, designed to tell
readers ``where to get once-in-a-lifetime experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the world seems to have grown a lot smaller over the
last two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in 1806 that two American explorers, Meriwether
Lewis and William Clark, became the first people to traipse across
North America and reach the Pacific. In the early part of this
century, many large patches of jungle in Asia and Africa had not
been visited by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Now, explorers have reached the highest mountain (Everest,
29,029 feet), the deepest ocean (Mariana Trench in the Pacific,
35,839 feet), and the coldest ice field (Polyus Nedostupnosti,
Antarctica, minus 72 F annual mean).
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades it has seemed as though every far-off locale
has been charted, visited, or analyzed ad nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they've even been decimated. As more and more people
explore the Amazon, scientists estimate that up to 16 percent of
the original million-square-mile rain forest has been ravaged.
</P>
<P>
   These days, adventure travel is the rage. Growing numbers of
tourists trek through the Himalayas, while 10,000 tourists visited
Antarctica, the most isolated place on the planet, between November
and March. This year alone, National Geographic Expeditions will
escort travelers to sites as far-flung as the peaks of Nepal and
the Yangtze River in China.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all this, hundreds, if not thousands, of peaks and
mountain passes are still waiting to be mapped.
</P>
<P>
   From Tibet to New Guinea, to central Greenland and remote
reaches of Nahanni National Park in Canada's Northwest Territories,
to the Arctic and Antarctica, there are a host of sites that have
been accessible only to the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, explorers haven't completely roamed the Ndoki forest,
on the border of Congo and Cameroon. They haven't fully surveyed
New Guinea, the world's second-largest island after Greenland. And
they haven't scaled all the mountains in the Antarctic, half as big
as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Holy Grail of exploration is perhaps the ocean. The sea
covers 70 percent of the Earth's surface, and 80 percent of it _
packed with little-known plant and animal life _ remains
undiscovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can draw a parallel between the ocean and outer space,
because there's so much we still don't know about them,'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Back on land _ or beneath it _ underwater caves hold a wealth of
opportunities for discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The world's longest underwater cave is Nohoch Nah Chich, located
in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. So far, only 32 miles have been
charted. Divers believe there's much more to be documented, but the
pitch-black labyrinth can be deadly for a diver who becomes lost
and confused.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a National Geographic team is creating a
three-dimensional computer map of tens of thousands of feet of
submerged caves at Wakulla Springs, about 15 miles south of
Tallahassee, Fla. The vast network of caverns and grottoes is
believed to be the third largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This digital mapping is wonderful, and it's going to help
people figure out how groundwater travels throughout Florida,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Mountaintops symbolize the spirit of exploration. All 14 of the
world's mountains higher than 8,000 meters, or 26,250 feet, have
been scaled.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Everest was conquered in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and
his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay. The famous mountain has been
climbed so many times that today's challenge comes in trying to
break the endurance record. The current record was set this month
by a Nepali Sherpa, Babu Chiri Sherpa, 33, who spent 21 hours on
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   But mountaineers shouldn't be disheartened, because there are
still plenty of peaks waiting to be mastered.
</P>
<P>
   An abundance of unclimbed summits rise above 25,000 feet
throughout the Karakoram mountain range in Pakistan, near the
borders with Afghanistan and China. Another unclimbed peak is
Lhotse Middle, at 27,605 feet, in the Lhotse massif near Mount
Everest.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The higher the mountain, the more discoveries explorers seem to
reap.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, National Geographic announced the discovery of
three children found sacrificed atop Argentina's Mount
Llullaillaco, the world's highest archaeological site at 22,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Located under about five feet of rock and earth, the perfectly
preserved bodies apparently had been frozen for more than 500
years, leaving them to appear as though they had just been buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear the best preserved of any mummy I've seen,'' said
archaeologist Johan Reinhard, co-leader of the team that discovered
them. ``Their arms looked perfect, even down to visible hairs.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most uncharted places is the island of New
Guinea, north of Australia. The eastern part of the island is
occupied by the nation of Papua New Guinea, while the western part
is Irian Jaya, a province of Indonesia where up to 800 languages
are spoken by primitive tribes living on jungle-choked terrain.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher who has roamed Papua New Guinea is Bill Thomas,
an anthropologist who grew up in Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   When he's there, he lives among the Hewa, eating mostly bananas
and sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am over there, sometimes I forget what a privilege it
is to be in a place like that,'' said Thomas, 44, who's been
studying the effect of human activities on conservation. ``But when
I'm dead and gone, I'll have done something you only dream about
when you're a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While enthusiasm for exploration certainly hasn't diminished
through the years, what has changed is the nature of exploration.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the main goal was to find remote places that had
never before been walked on by a human foot. The emphasis now is on
being the first to examine and document sites, even those that have
been visited before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of explorers who've been in the most incredibly dense
rain forests in South America and hostile desert in Asia where they
couldn't imagine any human had ever walked before, but how can we
be sure?'' Martin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important now is that people go out and record what
they see, and to share that with others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After National Geographic announced November's discovery of
Hidden Falls, explorers from Arizona claimed that they had already
visited the lush, subtropical oasis reminiscent of the paradise
depicted in the 1937 Frank Capra movie classic, ``Lost Horizon,''
which made Shangri-la a household word.
</P>
<P>
   China didn't open the area to Westerners until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic officials have never denied that other
explorers had been in the gorge, but insist their expedition was
meant to conclusively document the legendary waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Barbara Moffet said dueling discoveries are nothing
new, pointing out that Christopher Columbus didn't really discover
America, although he's often credited for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one spot no one will ever fight over is Mount Kailas in
southwestern Tibet, a 4-mile-high pyramid of ice and rock.
</P>
<P>
   The peak is regarded as the home of Shiva, god of destruction
and rebirth, and is the most sacred summit on Earth for both Hindus
and Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   For now, climbing the mountain is forbidden.

Lhotse Middle, at 27,605 feet, in the Lhotse massif near Mount
Everest.

   The higher the mountain, the more discoveries explorers seem to
reap.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, National Geographic announced the discovery of
three children found sacrificed atop Argentina's Mount
Llullaillaco, the world's highest archaeological site at 22,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Located under about five feet of rock and earth, the perfectly
preserved bodies apparently had been frozen for more than 500
years, leaving them to appear as though they had just been buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear the best preserved of any mummy I've seen,'' said
archaeologist Johan Reinhard, co-leader of the team that discovered
them. ``Their arms looked perfect, even down to visible hairs.''
</P>
<P>

   One of the world's most uncharted places is the island of New
Guinea, north of Australia. The eastern part of the island is
occupied by the nation of Papua New Guinea, while the western part
is Irian Jaya, a province of Indonesia where up to 800 languages
are spoken by primitive tribes living on jungle-choked terrain.
</P>
<P>
   One researcher who has roamed Papua New Guinea is Bill Thomas,
an anthropologist who grew up in Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   When he's there, he lives among the Hewa, eating mostly bananas
and sweet potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am over there, sometimes I forget what a privilege it
is to be in a place like that,'' said Thomas, 44, who's been
studying the effect of human activities on conservation. ``But when
I'm dead and gone, I'll have done something you only dream about
when you're a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While enthusiasm for exploration certainly hasn't diminished
through the years, what has changed is the nature of exploration.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the main goal was to find remote places that had
never before been walked on by a human foot. The emphasis now is on
being the first to examine and document sites, even those that have
been visited before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of explorers who've been in the most incredibly dense
rain forests in South America and hostile desert in Asia where they
couldn't imagine any human had ever walked before, but how can we
be sure?'' Martin asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important now is that people go out and record what
they see, and to share that with others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After National Geographic announced November's discovery of
Hidden Falls, explorers from Arizona claimed that they had already
visited the lush, subtropical oasis reminiscent of the paradise
depicted in the 1937 Frank Capra movie classic, ``Lost Horizon,''
which made Shangri-la a household word.
</P>
<P>
   China didn't open the area to Westerners until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic officials have never denied that other
explorers had been in the gorge, but insist their expedition was
meant to conclusively document the legendary waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Barbara Moffet said dueling discoveries are nothing
new, pointing out that Christopher Columbus didn't really discover
America, although he's often credited for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one spot no one will ever fight over is Mount Kailas in
southwestern Tibet, a 4-mile-high pyramid of ice and rock.
</P>
<P>
   The peak is regarded as the home of Shiva, god of destruction
and rebirth, and is the most sacred summit on Earth for both Hindus
and Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   For now, climbing the mountain is forbidden.

`THE WHOLE WOMAN': THE FEMALE CONDITION, RE-EXPLORED 30 YEARS
LATER
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Germaine Greer's swaggering call for sexual liberation,
``The Female Eunuch,'' appeared in 1970, it created a sensation.
The book urged women to embrace their sexuality, to become
self-reliant and to repudiate the passive roles in which they have
traditionally been cast. It laid out these dictums with a
rollicking sense of humor and a marked sympathy for men, two
qualities in decidedly short supply among feminist theorists of the
time. Indeed, Ms. Greer's book anticipated the thinking of later
feminists like Naomi Wolf who would treat men not as adversaries
but as potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some 30 years later, Ms. Greer has written a sequel of
sorts to ``The Female Eunuch.'' It's a book that is as sour as
``Eunuch'' was exuberant, as dogmatic as ``Eunuch'' was original,
as slipshod in its thinking as ``Eunuch'' was pointed. Instead of
drawing upon her readings in psychoanalysis, literature and
cultural history as she did in that earlier book, Ms. Greer relies
in these pages on highly selective anecdotal evidence (from
newspaper stories, court cases and polls) to support her
assertions. Instead of drawing her disparate observations together
into a coherent thesis, she settles for giving the reader a
scattershot _ and often highly contradictory _ series of reactions
to an assortment of phenomena, including sexual discrimination
legislation, deadbeat dads, anorexia, self-mutilation and the rise
of Madonna and the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this messy volume, Ms. Greer tries to argue that
things are worse than ever for women. Although she acknowledges
that ``feminist consciousness now leavens every relationship, every
single social and professional encounter,'' she insists that our
culture is ``less feminist than it was 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When `The Female Eunuch' was written our daughters were not
cutting or starving themselves,'' she writes. ``On every side
speechless women endure endless hardship, grief and pain, in a
world system that creates billions of losers for every handful of
winners. It's time to get angry again.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one reason Ms. Greer is so pessimistic has to do with
her willful _ and often perverse _ insistence on seeing
developments most feminists would embrace as signs of progress as
symptoms of some vague male conspiracy. Modern contraception, she
suggests, does not give a woman greater control over her body, but
turns her into ``a manmade nonmother'': it is another instance of
``male interference with conception and birth.'' Reproductive
technology, in her view, does not exist to offer unfertile women
the hope of having babies but to make women subsidiary to the
process of reproduction. Screening for cervical and breast cancer,
she declares, ``is many times more likely to destroy a woman's
peace of mind than it is to save her life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are driven through the health system like sheep through
a dip,'' she writes in a typically dogmatic passage. ``The disease
they are being treated for is womanhood.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the legal right to have an abortion, Ms. Greer sees it as
a reflection of the power of ``the masculine medical establishment
and the masculine judiciary'': ``there were fortunes to be made in
pregnancy termination,'' she writes, ``at a time when advances in
the technology were making a risky procedure foolproof.'' In her
opinion, all that women won with Roe vs. Wade was ``the `right' to
undergo invasive procedures in order to terminate unwanted
pregnancies, unwanted not just by them but by their parents, their
sexual partners, the governments who would not support mothers, the
employers who would not employ mothers, the landlords who would not
accept tenants with children, the schools that would not accept
students with children.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Greer noisily assails the Western establishment for
forcing women to conform to stereotyped standards of beauty, she
denounces Western efforts to stamp out female genital mutilation in
Africa as ``an attack on cultural identity.'' Although she admits
that genital mutilation ``represents a significant health risk,''
she argues that ``it must also be a procedure with considerable
cultural value because it has survived 50 years of criminalization
and concerted propaganda campaigns.'' Although the brutal procedure
is frequently performed on girls who have no say in the matter, Ms.
Greer writes that ``we should be considering the possibility that
F.G.M. acts in a similar way'' to tattooing and body piercing ``to
assert the individual woman's control over her genitals and to
customize them to her specification.''
</P>
<P>
   Such patronizing, ill-considered remarks do nothing to inspire
confidence in Ms. Greer. Nor do her hectoring denunciations of men
as lazy beasts who increasingly prefer masturbation to ``the
services of actual women'' or her churlish reluctance to regard
male-to-female transsexuals as women.
</P>
<P>
   As for her recommendations for change, they not only sound
impractical but often loony as well. She suggests that women
``should consider the possibility of deploying grief as a
subversive force'' _ as a means of protesting, even stopping
governments from making ``war on a helpless civilian population.''
She also argues that women _ who, she now believes, will always be
ignored or treated as sex objects by men _ should ``make a
conscious decision not to want men's company more than men want
women's,'' even if that results in a segregation of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   While reporters have already made much of the fact that in the
30 years since ``The Female Eunuch'' Ms. Greer has changed her mind
about everything from motherhood as a career option to sex as a
liberating (or enslaving) force, she would argue that ``women's
changeability'' can be a ``corrective to masculine rigidity.''
</P>
<P>
   What is unfortunate about ``The Whole Woman'' is less that she
has changed her views than that she has done such a weak job of
articulating her evolving vision and that her writing _ and
thinking _ have grown so vituperative and shrill. None of the
thoughtful insights into male and female psychology that animated
``The Female Eunuch'' are to be found in this volume, just as none
of that earlier book's intellectual analysis is to be found in its
pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Woman'' is a castrated book.

offering is one of the sweetest little gadgets I've seen in years.
Kodak sent a sample of its Advantix T550 camera, and the camera is
incredibly simple to use, it takes good pictures under a variety of
conditions, it's smaller than a pack of cigarettes and about as
lightweight and it takes pictures in three formats: classic, group
and panoramic. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 8. MOVED

incredibly simple to use, it takes good pictures under a variety of
conditions, it's smaller than a pack of cigarettes and about as
lightweight and it takes pictures in three formats: classic, group
and panoramic. (Cummings, Dayton Daily News). 8. MOVED

BEAUTIFUL BABY? JUST WAIT TILL SHE'S A SEXY 6-YEAR-OLD

   Who are the main players in the country's proliferating baby
beauty contests? The stars, those painted, besequined tots whose
routines owe a lot to Las Vegas and more than a little to the
strippers of yesteryear? Their mothers, who are also their managers
and taskmistresses? The entrepreneurs who make a living out of
show-biz hopefuls, 3 million of them, age 3 months to 16 years?
</P>
<P>
   The question is not resolved in ``Baby Beauty Contests,''
Tuesday night's edition of ``Inside Story.'' But the hour offers
enough glimpses of events with names like Royalty Miss Pageant to
capture the heavy emotional investment of all parties in what
enthusiasts call tournaments and critics call travesties.
</P>
<P>
   The California families we meet do not seem to have cash to
throw around, yet the expense of fielding a tournament contender is
considerable: singing, modeling and hip-swiveling lessons;
costumes, hairdos, cosmetics, publicity portraits and other
essentials. And it's not just a sometime thing. One pageant hopper
says she spends $20,000 a year in hopes of getting some prize money
for her daughter or at least a trophy for Best Smile.
</P>
<P>
   All the mothers assert that for them winning is not the point.
The point, they say, is to give their little girls a good time. But
not every contestant seems to be having a good time; a few need a
bit of coercing to do their numbers, and one decides that the show
doesn't have to go on and stops in mid-performance.
</P>
<P>
   And not every mother is a good loser. One whose 14-year-old
didn't get first place in a pageant's Elegant Division has to have
her expletives deleted. ``Mom,'' her daughter says, ``you're mad
because I didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the participants, the contests are exhilarating high
points in family life. Less involved viewers may be a little
depressed at the exhibitions of young children, all dolled up and
drained of spontaneity, going through casino-lounge motions.

DON'T LOOK FOR THREEPEAT OF APRIL BUDGET FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If expert prognostications are on target, Friday's Treasury
report won't be a repeat of the pleasant surprises of the past two
Aprils. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there probably was a significant federal budget
surplus for the month because of the tax-filing deadline, but it
isn't expected to be nearly the magnitude of those recorded in 1997
and 1998. Last year's April surprise totaled nearly $125 billion,
which topped the previous record of nearly $94 million set in April
1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if this year's April surplus isn't nearly as large,
however, it still should be more than enough to wipe out the $50
billion in red ink accumulated during the first six months of
fiscal 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   April's huge budget surpluses of the past two years resulted not
only from rising personal incomes and corporate earnings, but also
from investors' taking some profits from their stock market gains
of recent years. April's tax collections also are considered one of
the year's most useful forecasting tools for anticipating full-year
budget results. This year's budget surplus is currently forecast to
come in at about $111 billion. &QL; 
Monday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Home Builders survey for May is due
for release. &QL; 
Tuesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another uneventful meeting is expected when the Federal Open
Market Committee convenes to mull monetary policy. As long as
inflation remains under control and the global economy remains
weak, monetary tightening isn't expected. Nor is loosening likely
as long as the U.S. economy remains strong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Housing starts are forecast to have eased slightly in April,
but the expert consensus also calls for a companion report on
building permits to show the same level of activity as the previous
month. The annual rate for starts is expected to be 1.75 million,
which would be a 1.1 percent decline, while permit issuance is
predicted to have remained at a 1.65-million-a-year rate. &QL; 
Thursday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another huge deluge of red ink is forecast when the
international trade balance for March is reported. Most analysts
expect the shortfall to be less than February's record $19.4
billion, and the consensus calls for a deficit of about $18
billion. If the call is accurate, it will bring the first quarter's
trade imbalance to more than $52 billion. &QL; 
Eye on the economy
</P>
<P>
   --Tuesday: No surprises from the Fed
</P>
<P>
   --Thursday: More trade red ink
</P>
<P>
   --Friday: No April revenue surprise

THE ONE THAT DIDN'T GET AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE HENDRICKS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the substitute column for the one I intended to write
but put off because I didn't want to spoil my perfect day doing
something unimportant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like working. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You don't blow a perfect day if you don't have to. How often do
perfect days occur, anyhow? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About once a year, if you're lucky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet 99 out of 100 of us are too honest to call in sick on those
days, or don't even notice the day's perfection until it's too late
and we're chugging down the interstate, sucking in exhaust fumes
when we dare open the car window for a whiff of the perfect day
that got away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me of that other column. Not bad. I'd done all the
interviews, checked all the facts, experimented with a catchy
opening or two. A couple of lines, I figure, you'll cherish for two
or three seconds _ and the points made might even provoke some to
write their congressman or kick the dog. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it can wait. Because on the morning I arose to write that
column, I realized something extraordinary had arrived with the
dawn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The perfect day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sky was the bluest I'd ever seen. Bluer than the rinse in
grandma's hair. Bluer than a bottle of Windex, bluer than ... gee,
I can't think of it right now, but it'll come to me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in this blue-rinse, Windex sky was not a cloud, not a jet
trail marring its perfection. The high was to be 75 perfect
degrees. The car perfectly sparkled. The grass, already cut.
Perfectly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So there was no choice, it being May and all _ the perfect
month. I had to do the perfect thing. I had to go to the ball
game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sportswriters have to go to ball games, too, but it's different
with them. They have to go to ball games, otherwise what will they
write about? They'll write about their favorite TV highlights
shows, or revenue sharing, or they'll reminisce about seeing ball
games with Dad back in olden days when the players carved their
bats with bowie knives and fashioned mitts from worn-out Army
boots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness sportswriters go to ball games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Me, I had to go to the ball game for another reason. Where else
was I going to find cotton candy for my youngest kid on the perfect
day? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so we headed to the ballpark about noon, got a perfect
parking spot, and on this perfect day as we stood on line at the
box office, something perfect had to happen. And it did, of
course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A woman rushed up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, can you use these tickets?'' she asked. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, we could. And as luck would have it, the
free seats were in the lower part of the upper deck -- section 310
-- just to the right of home plate. The view of the field and the
water spectacular was -- what else? -- perfect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free tickets meant there was more money left for hot dogs and
Polish sausages, which anyone knows are perfection at the ballpark
and the perfect first course before one partakes of the cotton
candy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which came in your choice of two flavors: pink or blue. And
there it was. The perfect image to stick up there in paragraph
nine. The sky was bluer than the cotton candy sold at Kauffman
Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., on a day that would have been perfect
beyond imagination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If only the Royals had won. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, you learn to cherish such days, fold them up in your
memory like love letters. Get them out and reflect upon them when
you awake some morning to find that the day ahead is not perfect at
all, but dark and forbidding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or worse, that it's Monday. &QL;
</P>

IRS COLLECTION EFFORTS DROP IN WAKE OF TAXPAYER PROTECTION LAW

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service tax collectors, under intense pressure
from Congress to be nicer to taxpayers, have drastically scaled
back efforts to collect unpaid taxes, newly available statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
   Seizures of property are down 98 percent over the last two
years, according to the IRS. Levies and garnishments of bank
accounts and paychecks are just one-fourth the level of two years
ago. And the filing of tax liens, which make sure that back taxes
are paid when a property is sold, are down two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the drop-off in enforcement is because the IRS has been
shifting some resources to pay for customer service, new computers
and retraining. But IRS officers in six states said in interviews
that the biggest reason for the retreat was their fear of being
dismissed for running afoul of a new law intended to protect
taxpayers from overzealous collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some tax preparers are telling clients that they can
use the law to thwart collection of overdue taxes altogether, IRS
revenue officers and outside tax experts said. One tax preparer,
for example, threatened to bring a harassment claim if a collection
agent did not accept the preparer's terms for settling a case, said
Phyllis Vidler, president of the National Treasury Employees Union
local in Detroit, which represents IRS workers in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Workers' fears prompted Charles O. Rossotti, the tax
commissioner, to send a memo with the March paychecks for the IRS's
98,000 employees assuring them that their jobs were safe unless
they willfully abused taxpayers' rights. On May 5, Rossotti issued
regulations aimed at carrying out the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The law says that IRS employees must be dismissed if, following
an administrative inquiry, they are found to have committed any of
10 acts, among them violating any constitutional or civil right of
a taxpayer, threatening an audit for personal gain, making a false
statement under oath or falsifying or destroying documents to
conceal mistakes. None of these provisions specify that conduct
must be willful, although others do, such as willfully cheating on
taxes or lying to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Tax experts who have worried that Congress overreacted to
complaints about the IRS said that the drop in collection efforts
would lead to widespread tax evasion if some balance was not
quickly restored to the political climate surrounding the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dumb law,'' said one critic, Donald C. Alexander, the
Nixon administration tax commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, now a Washington tax lawyer, said the fall-off in
collections was causing alarm among IRS executives. ``When someone
can fail to meet his or her tax obligations without a worry about
having enforcement actions taken, then other creditors are going to
come in first and get paid, and the deadbeat taxpayer wins,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican
who as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee was a principal
sponsor of the new law, said he saw no problems with its
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the senator's intention was not to either frighten
good IRS employees or encourage tax evasion,'' said the
spokeswoman, Ginny Flynn. ``His intention was to insure that IRS
employees do not treat either their colleagues or taxpayers
unfairly and to ensure that the tax commissioner can deal with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax collectors who act properly have noting to fear, she added,
``because the law requires proof, not just an accusation'' of a
violation.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp decline in collections comes as the agency is in the
midst of a cultural revolution whose success, Rossotti has warned,
is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the problems of collection, many veteran auditors
have chafed, for example, at being pulled off examining tax returns
to answer telephone calls from taxpayers. Other employees say that
Rossotti is naive and fails to realize how many taxpayers cheat,
requiring costly collection efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, meanwhile, has frozen the IRS budget just when
Rossotti is seeking billions of dollars to build new computer
systems, retrain the agency's staff and recruit managers from
outside the government. Some of the money to finance these moves
has come from scaling back audits and collection efforts, officials
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, who ran a successful computer consulting firm before
joining the government, gently suggested that IRS employees were
overreacting to the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to denigrate the fears and concerns of front-line
employees,'' he said, ``but the reality is that this law deals with
willful and serious misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six months ended March 31, the IRS seized property to
satisfy long overdue taxes 108 times, down from 1,150 seizures in
the comparable period a year earlier and 5,000 seizures two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Garnishments of paychecks and levies of bank accounts in the
latest six months fell to 458,000, down from 1.8 million two years
earlier. Liens, which ensure that taxes are paid when property is
sold, fell to 98,000, compared with 272,000 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is expected to collect about $1.7 trillion this year,
with less than 2 percent, or about $30 billion, from enforcement
actions such as issuing liens, levies and seizing property.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS begins collection efforts after a taxpayer has failed to
pay taxes or to turn over taxes withheld from workers' paychecks.
But instead of stepping up pressure, one tax collector said, ``with
this new law if somebody says `I'm not paying,' then we just say
thank you and leave.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a revenue officer today I would have great hesitance
to take any enforcement action,'' said Alexander, the former IRS
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Richardson, the Clinton administration's first tax
commissioner, said that ``there is a lot of healthy skepticism''
among tax collectors about Rossotti's promise that only willful
acts will result in dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners who are habitually late turning over taxes
withheld from workers' paychecks also have begun using the law to
derail collection of overdue taxes, said Mrs. Vidler, the union
official, and other veteran tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want to pay your taxes today all you have to do
is say two magic words: installment agreement,'' said one IRS
collection officer in Washington state who spoke on condition of
anonymity because he feared retaliation by supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just say you want one, and even if the terms you propose
are ridiculous _ like $10 a week when you owe tens of thousands _
collection stops while your proposal goes up and down the chain of
managers, until 90 days later you are told no,'' the IRS employee
said. ``Then you just need to say another magic word _ harassment _
and because of this new law, the collection process stops while
your complaint gets reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat, noted that the provisions
of the new law relating to agency employees' conduct were not among
those recommended by a congressional commission that he co-chaired
on reforming the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to change at least four or five of the 10 items in
this law, or reform just isn't going to work,'' Kerrey said,
``because it creates a disincentive for IRS people to do their
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   One veteran tax collector in Manhattan said he and others were
troubled that the new law mandated dismissals for several acts even
if willful misconduct was not proven _ including violations of the
Age Discrimination Act of 1975 or ``falsifying or destroying
documents to conceal mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You say `intentional,' I say honest mistake,'' this tax
collector said. ``I'm not going to risk my job on that, and I don't
believe anyone else would either.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   IRS agents and officials of their union point to the case of a
revenue officer in White Plains. The woman, they say, is under
investigation by the Treasury Department's inspector general
because her activity log failed to note whether she had included a
particular form in a delinquency notice she sent to a taxpayer. The
notice was returned by the post office as undeliverable because the
taxpayer had moved, said Frank Heffler, president of the local
union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing happened here but a simple mistake of no consequence,
but now there are two inspectors working on this, and the revenue
officer fears she will lose her job,'' he said. ``Given the trouble
you can get into over a work log, I don't know anyone who would
execute a property seizure and risk their job.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti, the tax commissioner, said the new law ``did create a
lot of concern and anxiety among many employees, understandably,
because it affects every one of them and some of the provisions are
rather complex.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in addition to his March memo, he is trying to
instill in IRS managers ``the difference between accidental versus
intentional mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Richardson, the Clinton administration's first tax
commissioner, said tax collectors are responding to the signals
sent by Rossotti.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big message is in the new IRS mission statement, which
says nothing about collecting taxes,'' she said. ``That was a
powerful message to the organization, to people who don't want to
pay and to unscrupulous tax professionals.''
</P>
<P>
   The new mission statement, written by Rossotti, says that the
IRS should ``provide America's taxpayers top-quality service by
helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by
applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all.''
</P>
<P>
   Montie Day, a former IRS criminal investigator and federal
prosecutor who now regularly sues the IRS on behalf of taxpayers,
said that Rossotti should take forceful action to restore
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically there is no enforcement going on right now, and that
undermines the whole tax system,'' he said. ``And as word about
this gets out two things will happen: People who are inclined to
cheat will say to themselves that since they aren't going to be
made to pay up, they should cheat. And people who are inclined to
pay as the law requires will ask themselves, `Why am I doing
this?'''

CHANGES LEAVE GOLF ON AN UNSURE COURSE
</HEADLINE>

By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ A fresh century beckons, causing havoc in the
computer industry and distress for executives unsure if their
company's software is Y2K compatible heading into a new millennium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But on the golf course, production is recorded with pencil and
paper, not megabytes and microchips. The primary mode of
transportation, at least during the MasterCard Colonial, is
footpower _ a method impervious to meltdown from an impending
computer glitch. Tools of the trade involve manufactured goods, not
software programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the growth industries in the United States, golf would
seem to be among the best-insulated from the impending threat of
global chaos some analysts predict when our clocks strike midnight
and our computers crash in unison on Jan. 1, 2000. Scratch the
surface, however, and there are plenty of issues that concern
professional golfers and tournament executives as the game heads
into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Call them the Y2K worries of the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   They might not be obvious to fans who attend the MasterCard
Colonial, where tournament rounds run Thursday-Sunday at Colonial
Country Club. But they weigh on the minds of competitors and
organizers who will spend this week at ``Hogan's Alley.'' They
figure to be determining factors in how long professional golf
continues to ride the wave that has seen PGA Tour events enjoy
rampant increases in attendance, television ratings and purses over
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the messiest potential minefield in the 21st century
involves a perceived need to curb technological advances in golf
equipment to prevent today's courses from becoming obsolete. The
issue is so hot, a lawyer with three decades of experience in
golf-related issues predicts an impending ``Armageddon'' between
manufacturers and the game's governing bodies over this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a major confrontation. It's the biggest
thing facing golf,'' said Leonard Decof, lead counsel in helping
Ping win the right to keep square-grooved clubs on the PGA Tour
after a court challenge was dropped in 1993 by then-commissioner
Deane Beman.
</P>
<P>
   Others consider the World Golf Championships, which debut this
season, as the biggest storm cloud on the horizon. Because their $5
million purses tend to drain the talent pools at surrounding events
on the PGA Tour calendar, many tournament organizers view the WGC
stops as a threat to the continued health and well-being of events
such as the Colonial and the GTE Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are moving, I'm very concerned,'' said Wally
Schmuck, a past Colonial president and former tournament chairman.
``The \RWGC\S tournaments are going to impact a lot of events.
That's a reality. I just hope they never put one in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf officials also worry about:
</P>
<P>
   Finding enough title sponsors to meet the demand for upwardly
spiraling purses mandated by the PGA Tour's four-year, $650 million
television contract that expires after the 2002 season.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring a way to improve on the next round of TV negotiations
after doubling the take from a $325 million deal that expired in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way to appease a splinter group, the Tour Players
Association, that offers the potential for labor unrest in a sport
that has experienced little labor-related strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of moving parts to this thing, and every day,
they're going faster,'' said Patrick McEvoy, chairman for the 2000
Nelson Classic. ``I talk to people who look at all the uncertainty
and say, `It's going to be pretty wild in the next five years.' But
I think it's already wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel with us as we peer into our dimpled, crystal ball and try
to discern how various turn-of-the-century concerns will affect the
foreseeable future of professional golf: \Nsubheds:Technology
Clearly the game's hot-button topic, players and administrators
remain divided on what safeguards _ if any _ are needed to prevent
the next generation of golfers from overwhelming existing layouts
with equipment that allows them to hit longer, straighter shots
with greater margin for error than their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the topics being studied by members of the U.S. Golf
Association, regulator of equipment-related issues in the United
States, is placing a limit on the ``spring-like effect'' derived
from the club face of metal-headed drivers. The organization also
is studying a measure to eliminate the use of long putters, limit
shaft lengths on drivers and put a loft limit on clubs used in
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA's goal, said executive director David Fay, is ``to
establish a standard and draw a line'' that ensures technological
advances do not outstrip shot-making abilities in determining a
player's score.
</P>
<P>
   A noble goal, say proponents. A move long overdue, says Gary
Player, 63, who joins Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Gene Sarazen on
the short list of players to win all four of professional golf's
major championships during their PGA Tour careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way, any more, to compare the scores of today to
the scores that Ben Hogan shot. Technology is ruining the game, and
we have to do something about it,'' said Player, who likes Jack
Nicklaus' suggestion to make PGA Tour participants play with a
uniform ball that would limit compression, spin and ball flight.
</P>
<P>
   Without crimping today's technology, organizers of some PGA Tour
events fear that many of today's golf courses will become obsolete
before young stars such as David Duval and Tiger Woods are eligible
to hit their first 320-yard drives on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something has got to be done with technology. Enough is
enough,'' said Phil Thomas, Colonial tournament chairman. ``I think
the PGA Tour will be the one that does something, when we finally
get some restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But something's got to give. You can't go and rebuild these
golf courses we already have. And you can't just keep building
newer, longer golf courses to play tournaments on. To find enough
land, you'll get them so far out of town that people will need
choppers to get to the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk rankles Decof, who represents Callaway Golf, one of
the nation's leading manufacturers of metal-headed drivers. He
considers attempts to limit driving distance ``misdirected''
despite the fact that three rounds of 59 have been recorded at PGA
Tour or Nike Tour events in the past 12 months. Until last May,
only two 59s had been shot in the history of professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   For those consumed with scoring records, Decof offers this
rejoinder: The PGA Tour's season scoring record remains 68.33, a
mark set by Byron Nelson in 1945. That was before the advent of
graphite shafts or metal woods, he said, making fears about
technology outstripping the game ``groundless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the USGA wants to try to do something about it, the ball
will be in their court,'' Decof said, pun clearly intended. ``There
will be ... Armageddon between the manufacturers and the USGA
unless there is some type of accommodation.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Daniel, a member of the LPGA Hall of Fame, prefers a limit
on future technology. She called for the USGA to take corrective
action or step aside and ``let the game go to another level,'' with
an inevitable flood of scoring records to follow as players become
bigger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equipment bunches players. It's taken a lot of shot-making out
of the game,'' Daniel said. ``Now, you just aim at the pin and go,
which I don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   With today's rules, said Daniel, she can tailor her equipment to
meet the conditions of the day. It's something she does to remain
competitive but a loophole that Daniel would prefer to see closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a high-ball hitter,'' Daniel said. ``But if I'm playing in
the wind, I can use a lower-flying ball and special shafts to
offset that. It's easier to keep the ball down, and I don't need to
use any special ability to make the ball do something to get it to
do what I want. It helps my score, but I'd rather see people have
to play shots and work the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, author of professional golf's most recent 59 _ a
final-round effort to win the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic on Jan. 24
_ said a fresh wave of improvements to equipment would not bother
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's always taken advantage of what's the most advanced
technological equipment they could find. I have no problem with
that,'' said Duval, 27, a four-event winner on the 1999 PGA Tour.
``Nobody mentions that technology has gone into the equipment that
preps golf courses, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Golfers from yesteryear, said Duval, ``didn't play greens that
were as hard or fast as we do. The rough was never as thick. The
fairways are tighter now. It all balances out.'' \Nsubheds:World
Golf Championships Despite an explosive growth in purses, which has
seen payouts for both the Colonial ($2.8 million) and the Nelson
($3 million) double since 1995, officials at both events wonder if
the extra dollars will continue to attract the type of marquee
players that Fort Worth-Dallas fans have grown to expect on an
annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point is the emergence of the World Golf
Championships, a series of high-dollar competitions between elite
competitors from all tours. The 1999 schedule includes three WGC
tournaments, each with a $5 million purse. A fourth event will be
added next season. More could follow in future years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, the biggest change in how we do our business
will come from the WGC events,'' said Frank Houseman, Nelson
tournament chairman in 1996-97 and current president of the
Salesmanship Club, which oversees the event. ``Who knows if, in
five years, there will be enough money out there that guys will
just play the four majors, The Players Championship, the Tour
Championship and the \RWGC\S events? Right now, that would be 10
tournaments, and they could make plenty of money just playing in
those. I hope that doesn't happen, but the concern is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Created by PGA Tour officials as an inducement to get the game's
best players together more frequently, the concept has an inherent
flaw, said Colonial champ Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' said Watson, ``is this will reduce the
number of tournaments players play on their respective tours.''
</P>
<P>
   In a roundabout way, Colonial officials already have felt a
backlash from a heightened emphasis on global golf. Five
high-profile members of the PGA Tour, including Woods and British
Open champ Mark O'Meara, are skipping Colonial to accept six-figure
appearance fees while competing this week at the Deutsche Bank-SAP
Open, a European Tour event in Heidelburg, Germany. Other absentees
include Ernie Els, Jesper Parnevik and Nick Price, the 1994
Colonial champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you can prevent that,'' said Schmuck, noting
the long-standing ban on appearance fees for players at PGA Tour
events. ``You just hope this is a one-year deal and that the
sponsor can't afford to keep paying those type of appearance fees,
year after year.''
</P>
<P>
   A bigger concern, say Colonial and Nelson officials, would be
having a WGC event moved into a May slot on the PGA Tour calendar.
The WGC's match-play event in February relegated the Tucson Open,
played during the same week, to cable television and decimated the
field at the next tour stop, the Doral-Ryder Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd hate to be the tournament right behind or right before
one of those,'' Thomas said of the WGC tournaments. ``With the way
those events are placed, I don't think they will affect us today.
But I'm not going to say they won't in the future.''
\Nsubheds:Television and title sponsorships Minimizing the impact
of the WGC era on a traditional tour stop, say tournament
officials, will require solid television ratings and a long-term
commitment from a title sponsor. Both local events qualify in both
areas, placing them among the in-crowd on a PGA Tour calendar that
many envision to be divided between the ``haves'' and ``have-nots''
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Houseman predicted the Nelson, which offered a $1.5 million
purse in 1996, will hit $3.5 million next year and $4 million by
2002, the final year of the tournament's existing television
contract with CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial officials vow they will be in the same neighborhood,
leaning on a long-term agreement with MasterCard (through 2002) and
enviable TV ratings to keep them in what Thomas termed ``the top
tier'' of tour events behind the major championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dedicated to being there and they \RMasterCard\S are
dedicated to seeing that we stay there,'' Thomas said. ``We
couldn't be happier with our arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tournaments caught bouncing between sponsors, like the
Compaq Classic of New Orleans, figure to face tough sledding in the
current climate. The New Orleans event changed title sponsors in
February. A Boston-based event was dropped from the 1999 schedule
after losing its title sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the next two years will be critical for the smaller
tournaments,'' said Paul Pulliam, who will be the Nelson chairman
in 2001. ``People have to make a commitment to try and keep up with
the WGC events or decide, `We can't get there' and move to another
level. To say which ones might fall back would be real difficult.
But there's no question the best places to be are in areas with a
big corporate base. With so many businesses in Dallas-Fort Worth,
that gives us and the Colonial an edge over a lot of tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   The local events will maintain that edge, Houseman predicted, as
long as they retain the two T's of survival in the 21st century: TV
ratings and title sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you put on a good show for TV and make your sponsor
happy, you're OK,'' Houseman said. ``If you lose the support of
either or both, your tournament could be in trouble.''
\Nsubheds:Labor relations Because PGA Tour participants are
independent contractors, they are not eligible for certification as
a labor union. That removes any threat of a labor strike.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped a group of golfers, known as the Tour
Players Association (TPA), from banding together and questioning
the direction the PGA Tour is headed as the 21st century
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Edwards is president of the group, which claims membership
of more than 50 but had only 14 players attend its January meeting.
Among its goals, said Edwards, is to bring golf salaries more in
line _ on a percentage basis _ with those of athletes in other
professional sports. TPA members also seek to gain a greater input
into the tour's financial dealings and have succeeded in laying the
groundwork for a new bonus system, proposed for next season, that
would help defray the cost of travel expenses for players who
finish in the top 125 on the 1999 money list.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards conceded TPA membership has been ``difficult to sell''
to peers because golf is riding a wave of increased purses and
increased popularity. But the numbers, he said, are undeniable:
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Jack Nicklaus led the PGA Tour in earnings ($305,463)
at a time when only 22 major-league baseball players earned more
than $100,000 and the average salary of those players was $133,000.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Duval was the tour's top money-winner ($2.6
million) in a season when 22 baseball players _ now unionized _
earned more than $6.6 million, with an average salary of $8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Although the PGA Tour's 1998-99 annual report to members, which
was independently audited by an outside firm, shows 66.1 percent of
a projected $209,368,000 in income will be spent on players'
salaries this season, Edwards considers the percentage high. So
does Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks, the TPA treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, said Brooks, do not account for golf-related income
generated by tournaments like Colonial or the Nelson and kept in
local coffers. As a result, Edwards estimated that professional
golfers play for roughly 40 percent of the dollars that change
hands at tournaments, compared to 67 percent for NFL players, 57
percent for NBA participants and 55 percent for major-league
baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards called it ``one of the huge travesties in professional
sports.'' Nelson and Colonial officials said distributing a larger
chunk of tournament proceeds to players would cut into charitable
contributions that topped the $5 million mark last year ($4.3
million by the Nelson, $1 million by Colonial).
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the charities, but it's got to be reasonable. There's
got to be a formula where the people that generate the money get at
least a fair share,'' Edwards said. ``On the surface, it looks like
we're greedy. But the reality of it is when we go to the Phoenix
Open, \Rtournament officials\S generate $16 million, give $3
million to charity and we play for $2.8 million. That's not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody runs their business and recognizes that cost of goods
sold is not 15 or 25 percent. Companies are not allowed to make a
75 percent margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such numbers fail to inspire passion in most PGA Tour
participants. Asked about the TPA, Fort Worth resident Clark Dennis
said: ``I don't think there's a lot of interest in it. Most guys
are pretty happy with the way things are going on tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Brooks said he is glad to be part of the
organization so that it can serve in a watchdog capacity for the
financial dealings of PGA Tour executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer that it shouldn't go away,'' Brooks said.
``I wouldn't call it a loaded gun, but it's something that's there
in case they want to do something they shouldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, commissioner Tim Finchem, TPA members will be
tracking your every move. Through Y2K and beyond. nn

RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT HINTS NEW PREMIER COULD SAIL THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ After the fireworks of a failed impeachment attempt,
the Russian parliament's vote on Wednesday on a new prime minister
promises to be surprisingly tame _ and it is likely to be a ``yes''
vote.
</P>
<P>
   More politicians indicated Monday that they are ready to call a
time-out in their battle against President Boris Yeltsin and to
proceed swiftly with the approval of Sergei Stepashin, the
47-year-old Interior Minister named last week to succeed Yevgeny
Primakov as the leader of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other way out,'' said Aman Tulayev, a Communist
who is governor of the Kemerovo region. ``The sooner we form a
Cabinet, the sooner we have stability. Any fool can understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on television Sunday night, Gennady Zyuganov, leader of
the Communist Party, said he would not rule out a favorable vote
for Stepashin, although he said it will depend on his meetings on
Tuesday with party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The first confirmation vote in the parliament's lower house must
take place Wednesday. If the president's nominee is rejected three
times, then Yeltsin will be obligated under the Russian
constitution to disband parliament and set early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the collapse on Saturday of a Communist-led drive to
oust Yeltsin from office, many here had predicted that the
parliament would not push the crisis to a confrontation over the
Stepashin nomination. Now, after failing to get the two-thirds
majority required to push impeachment forward, the opposition is in
even less of a position to challenge the president.
</P>
<P>
   With his law-and-order background, Stepashin was already an
acceptable figure for many lawmakers. And with his promise over the
weekend not to appoint any `'odious'' figures to the Cabinet, he
appears to have assured opposition leaders that he will not be a
springboard for the return of such reviled liberal economic
reformers as Anatoli Chubais, the one-time privatization chief.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stepashin has promised to keep on most of the old
Primakov Cabinet, with the exception of Yuri Maslyukov, the old
coalition Cabinet's top Communist, who has already announced his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who has been shown on television meeting with groups
of lawmakers in his shirt-sleeves, has offered them a
back-to-business respite from the political struggle. So far, his
strategy seems to be working.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view Stepashin, better than anyone else, can insure
political stability from the viewpoint of reaching a compromise
between the government, the parliament and the president,'' said
Oleg Morozov, leader of the moderate Russian Regions bloc, whose 45
members split on the impeachment issue on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's press spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, said Monday that
the president thinks that Stepashin's chances are ``not bad.'' He
said that recent statements from parliamentary leaders fill Yeltsin
``with a certain optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to get tough on the theft and corruption rampant in
Russia and to curb the flight of capital, Stepashin echoed familiar
themes that are popular with all sides. He also promised to push
ahead with a legislative package that is considered crucial for a
debt relief package negotiated with the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the obligations assumed by the previous government will be
fulfilled,'' he said. But time is short, Stepashin said. ``The next
three months will be crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   With parliamentary elections just six months away, some members
have said that another round of clashes over a lame-duck government
is neither necessary nor worth the expenditure of further political
and financial capital. After Yeltsin fired his last government in
August, it took the parliament two votes and almost a month before
both sides settled on a compromise candidate, Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the members have already been warned that Stepashin
will withdraw his nomination if it is rejected on the first vote.
That would leave the door open to Yeltsin to propose an obviously
unacceptable nominee and to push ahead with disbanding parliament.
The president would then be free to leave his own government in
place until elections.
</P>
<P>
   Although Communist Party leaders have insisted publicly they are
ready to face early elections, many analysts say that the
Communists are likely to be reluctant to give up the perks and
privileges that come with office, all of which would come in handy
during an electoral campaign.

RACE NOT ENOUGH TO INVALIDATE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS, COURT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ga., Texas) (nk) 
 By   LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Revisiting a much-disputed North Carolina
congressional district Monday, the Supreme Court ruled with
surprising unanimity that even a conscious concentration of black
voters did not automatically make a district unconstitutional as
long as the state's primary motivation in drawing the district
might have been political rather than racial.
</P>
<P>
   The court overturned a judgment won last year by a group of
white voters who challenged the latest version of North Carolina's
12th Congressional District as an unconstitutional racial
gerrymander. The case will now go back to a special three-judge
federal district court in Raleigh with instructions to take account
of the state's evidence that it wanted to create a district of
loyal Democrats, many of whom happened to be black.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs were allied with the white voters whose challenge
to an earlier and more heavily black version of the same district
led in 1993 to the Supreme Court's Shaw vs. Reno decision, which
opened the door to strict and _ until now _ invariably fatal
judicial scrutiny of districts drawn as part of an effort to
enhance black political representation.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas' decision for the court Monday in no way
disavowed Shaw vs. Reno or the four cases that followed it,
striking down majority black districts in Georgia and Texas as well
as in North Carolina. Rather, Thomas said, those cases had limits:
Plaintiffs retain the burden of proving that race was,
impermissibly, ``the predominant factor'' in drawing district
lines, and lower courts are not free to ignore, as this one did,
evidence of other permissible motivations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jurisdiction may engage in constitutional political
gerrymandering, even if it so happens that the most loyal Democrats
happen to be black Democrats and even if the state were  &UR; conscious
 &LR; of that fact,'' Thomas said, adding, ``Evidence that blacks
constitute even a supermajority in one congressional district while
amounting to less than a plurality in a neighboring district will
not, by itself, suffice to prove that a jurisdiction was motivated
by race in drawing its district lines when the evidence also shows
a high correlation between race and party preference.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of motivation is a fact to be proven at trial, he
said, not a conclusion to be assumed by a court at the summary
judgment stage, as happened in this case. Thomas emphasized that
the court was taking no position on the ultimate question of the
12th District's constitutionality. He said there was evidence of
both a political motive and a racial motive for the district, which
is now 47 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 9-0 decision was in that sense inconclusive, its
importance on the eve of the next national round of redistricting
could reach considerably beyond the fate of this particular
district, a thin, 90-mile-long squiggle that links centers of black
population in west-central North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision, Hunt vs. Cromartie, No. 98-85, was
essentially a set of instructions to the lower-court judges who
will be hearing similar challenges following the 2000 census.
Thomas appeared to go out of his way to make clear that simple
consciousness of race among district line-drawers is not, by
itself, enough to invalidate a district. Lower court judges
misunderstand the Supreme Court's recent precedents if they think
the court has instructed them to root out any use of race, Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   While all nine justices agreed with the decision, the four who
have consistently dissented from the recent redistricting cases did
not sign Thomas' opinion, instead filing a separate opinion to
emphasize what they said was the weakness of the evidence for a
racial gerrymander in this case. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote
the separate opinion, which Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer also signed.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time the 12th District had been before the
court. In its present form, the district represents the North
Carolina Legislature's effort to remedy the constitutional
violation the justices found when they struck down the previous
version in a 1996 decision, Shaw vs. Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the plaintiffs argued that once a district has been
declared an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, as this one was,
any remedial version carried a special burden, with the state
having to prove that the modifications were untainted by racial
motive.
</P>
<P>
   The court Monday rejected this argument by not even mentioning
it, making clear that plaintiffs still have the burden of proving
their case.
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of the ruling Monday may be to give states
``very significant breathing room'' as they approach the next round
of redistricting, Walter Dellinger, who argued the case for North
Carolina, said Monday. Dellinger, the former acting Solicitor
General, handled the case as a private citizen and North Carolina
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Since there tends to be a strong correlation between race and
voting patterns in many areas, the court's approach may well permit
the incumbent politicians who draw district lines to achieve two
goals at once: concentrate predictable Democratic and Republican
voters in separate districts while at the same time ensuring
continued black representation from certain areas.

 &HT;    Screaming about Littleton syndrome
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gregg Easterbrook argues that our critical celebration
of such gore-drenched moves as ``Scream'' (featuring torture and
graphic murder) and ``Pulp Fiction'' (in which hit men are snappy
and glamorous) should be held partly responsible for the massacre
in Littleton, Colo. Easterbrook, writing in The New Republic
($3.50) cites studies that correlate violent images with increased
aggression and nicely documents the swelling tide of killings in
television and movies. He fails, however, to demonstrate how the
rising murder rate on the big and little screens can be tied to
youth violence, which, according to some statistics, is actually
dropping.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE REAL BLUES: Singer Jennifer Holliday tells about her
battle with depression, which led to a 1990 suicide attempt and,
finally, to treatment. The star of ``Dreamgirls,'' who gained a
hundred pounds during her six months on Broadway in 1981, tells
Essence ($2.75) that her weight gain was a symptom, not a cause of
her illness. By 1995, she was seeking therapy and losing weight.
She also speaks of an encounter that year with singer Phyllis
Hyman, who eyed the trimmed-down Holliday and clearly wished she
could do the same. Three weeks later, Hyman committed suicide in
her New York apartment. An accompanying story explores an
``unrealistic'' belief in personal strength that can keep black
women from seeking help when they need it most. &QR;  DEAR PAPA: Fifty
years ago, Lillian Ross wrote a New Yorker profile of Ernest
Hemingway that laid his personality bare and was hailed as the
woman who destroyed the macho writer. But Hemingway considered the
article accurate, and the two remained friends. In this week's The
New Yorker ($3) Ross recounts years of correspondence with
Hemingway, quoting his retort to those who wondered why he was
still her friend: ``How can I be destroyed by a woman when she is a
friend of mine and we have never even been to bed and no money has
changed hands?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  THE LOCKDOWN: Questioning the wisdom of privatizing prisons,
Blaze ($2.95) suggests that profit-making companies such as
Corrections Corporation of America, which operates 70 prisons
worldwide, ``have a vested interest in stoking America's fear of
crime.'' Blaze interviews Junior Kargbo, 24, an inmate serving 20
years to life for murder at the Central Arizona Detention Center,
who calls the private prison's goal ``genocide. They hope you
commit another crime, so you can come back and fill bed space.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  HOME IMPROVEMENT: Rating the warehouse-size home centers,
Consumer Reports ($3.50) finds Home Depot is a shade better than
competitor Lowe's. The magazine also gives high marks to
California-based Orchard Supply Hardware and to Sears Hardware,
with most of its stores in the Northeast and Midwest. (Chains of
independently owned hardware stores such as Ace and True Value were
not rated.) Though these stores have almost anything the shopper
wants, only half of people surveyed said the stores were good at
helping them find it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  CHOKING ON PROGRESS: Since the Clean Air Act was passed in
1970, Atlanta has never met EPA standards, reports Georgia Trend
($2.95). In a cover story on Peachtown's air pollution, the
magazine points out that in 1990, metro Atlantans drove 81.5
million miles a day. By 1997, it was 110 million miles a day, or
32.8 miles per capita, the highest in the nation, with single
drivers composing 78 percent of commuters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  SECOND SIGHT: ``Implantable synthetic vision systems,'' or
robotic eyesight for the blind, is an eye-opening cover topic for
Technology Review ($4.95). Scientists are experimenting with
microelectronics to replace the functions of the retina's
photoreceptors and have already stimulated visual response with
electrical signals. This advance, says TR, doesn't mean blind
people will ever be able to read a newspaper or recognize faces,
but for some individuals it could spell the difference between
seeing nothing and seeing outlines, light and shadow.

 &HT;    'I've got a bad feeling about this.'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ OK, I dare you: Just try not to shiver when those
tranquil blue letters flash onscreen: ``A long time ago in a galaxy
far, far away. . .'' But now for some bad news. Very little in
``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' lives up to those
anticipatory tingles you feel when John Williams' familiar score
blasts the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is a
remarkable achieve-
</P>
<P>
   ment. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out the gee-whiz
enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out memorable
characters. He left out the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Should you see it? Sure, you have to. It's a worldwide
phenomenon. So pity the poor critic who has to write about its
success as a movie. (For the record, I'm a series fan. I saw the
first ``Star Wars'' more than a dozen times in the summer of '77.)
</P>
<P>
   This first installment of a projected prequel trilogy,
``Menace'' introduces us to Jedi knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson)
and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor, doing a fine
vocal homage to Alec Guinness). We meet them as they intercede on
behalf of Naboo, a planet targeted for invasion by the powerful
Trade Federation.
</P>
<P>
   This fact is one of your first inklings that there's something
off about the movie. Tariffs, economic sanctions and blockades
aren't subjects that get your blood pounding. The movie is a
strange mix. It's full of skulduggery and political maneuvering
that children won't care about. But the action is delivered at a
frantic pace designed to keep kids with short attention spans in
their seats.
</P>
<P>
   The plot takes our knights to Naboo, where they meet Queen
Amidala (Natalie Portman), whose elaborate costumes make her look
like a sofa in some exotic bordello. Another new character is the
long-eared bumbler Jar Jar Binks (voiced by Ahmed Best). Next stop
on the tour: Tatooine, home of Luke Skywalker's future dad (and
Darth), young Anakin (Jake Lloyd) and his single mom, Schmi
(Pernilla August).
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about spoilers in this review. There's really not a
lot to give away. ``Menace'' doesn't have the grand surprises that
the last two ``Star Wars'' movies packed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the movie is filled with thrilling sequences and images: an
underwater art nouveau city. A breathless ``pod race'' through the
rocky Tatooine landscape. An urban skyline braided with endless
trails of hovercraft in flight.
</P>
<P>
   These are computer-generated effects, and Lucas packs nearly
every frame of film with some digital doodad. So many new creatures
and contraptions appear, ``Menace'' starts to feel less like a
movie, more like a product reel for the tie-in collectibles.
Instead of an embellishment, these effects have become the main
event, crowding the heroes out of their own movie. Sacrificed at
this digital altar, the humans become supporting players, like the
actors opposite the cartoons in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie equates more with better. One panoramic shot of a
massive robot army lined up to attack Jar Jar's tribe is supposed
to inspire awe. It can't. We're obviously looking at CGI effects,
not creatures we care about. (Especially in the case of Jar Jar.)
For all its visual imagination, the movie becomes less engrossing
as it unfolds, not more.
</P>
<P>
   Too much tech and too little heart makes a bad mix. While the
old ``Star Wars'' movies gave us a yearning youth, a sassy heroine
and a rogue adventurer, the characters in ``Menace'' seem curiously
vague, undefined. (When old pals C-3PO and R2-D2 turn up, they make
you miss the old crew even more.) The new heroes fire their
blasters and murmur about the Force. But they're just going through
their paces, pawns of the plot instead of enacters of destiny.
Emotion is at a minimum, real danger is nil. It's hard to get
worried when Amidala teeters on a ledge above a precipice, or young
Anakin hurtles through the desert at Mach speed. It's a video game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of human Storm Troopers, Lucas introduces robot
soldiers, which means the good guys can ``kill'' guiltlessly,
without bloodshed. He stages spectacular, unsurvivable crashes in
the pod race, then makes sure we see the crash victims emerge
unscathed. Compare this to the original ``Star Wars,'' whose
swashbuckling was grounded in real human loss: Luke's aunt and
uncle, and heck, the whole planet Alderaan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menace'' lacks the corny epic grandeur we associate with
``Star Wars.'' Lucas is so focused on FX, he blows what ought to be
big character and magic moments. You wait for Darth Maul (Ray
Park), the movie's scariest-looking thug, to develop into a major
villain. He barely gets any screen time. One character's death is
filmed so obliquely (almost apologetically), you hardly realize
what's happened. It's like a Wagnerian refrain played on the kazoo.
</P>
<P>
   The only indelible creature in ``Menace'' is Jar Jar, in the
worst way. He's a CG creation whose role as clumsy comic relief
grows grating fast. Plus, his Rastafarian-inflected pidgin English
is often incomprehensible. (Speaking of accents, it's questionable
that Lucas has two of the shadier alien species sounding Chinese
and Middle Eastern.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie has another big, little problem: Lloyd. He's a cute
kid, with his moon-round face and haystack hair. He delivers his
lines, hits his marks and says ``yippee'' and ``oops'' a lot. But
he's not what you'd call an actor. (When the Jedi knights start to
marvel about his powerful mystical vibe, you think, ``Who? The
moppet?'')
</P>
<P>
   Even the more experienced actors come off stiff, maybe because
they spent the shoot acting against blue screens, or talking to
creatures that were still incubating on someone's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, it's a ``Star Wars'' movie. It's an end-of-millennium
event. After you see it, you'll look forward to ``Episode II'' _
not to find out what happens next, but in the hopes that it will be
better. By then maybe Lucas will have rediscovered the wit, heart
and danger that made the first three movies more than just a slick
pastiche of old cliffhangers.
</P>
<P>
   His fans will cut him slack this time. If we can forgive him for
the Ewoks, we can forgive him for anything. Except, maybe, Jar Jar.

 &HT;    Intuit, Security First agreements called 'a big deal' by analyst
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Security First Technologies is buying two of its
largest competitors, FICS and Edify, for $1.4 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The move would create an Atlanta-based company, called S1, that
could dominate the market for software that lets people, small
businesses and corporations handle their money via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Edify and FICS deals are subject to approval by Security
First Technologies' and Edify's shareholders. They are expected to
be completed in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Intuit announced Monday it is buying a 2.5 percent stake
in Security First Technologies for about $50 million. The
investment includes an agreement that lets the two companies offer
Intuit's tax filing, payroll and tax payment products to financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The deals line up several companies and aim them, indirectly, at
one target: you.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect that in the near future the Internet will be the
place where people, small businesses and corporations file taxes,
balance books, transfer funds and get and pay bills.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Security First, which sells software that lets
customers of retail banks access their accounts via the Internet,
hopes Monday's deals will create a company that can offer almost
one-stop shopping for a bank wanting to set up online.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``rounds out our product offering and takes our
strongest competitor out of the marketplace,'' said James S. Mahan
III, Security First Technologies' chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were uncertain about the deal. Security First
Technologies's stock dropped $3, to close at $51. Security First
shares are up 234 percent for 1999. Edify closed at $14.93 3/4,
down 31 1/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   But research analysts liked the moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal,'' said Brook Newcomb, a senior analyst at
Forrester Research. ``It has created a giant among a bunch of small
vendors. A company looking for a front-end to its Web presence now
doesn't have to worry about looking for a whole bunch of vendors.''
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the deal, Security First will issue 20 million shares
of its stock to Belgium-based FICS and 6.4 million shares of its
stock for Edify, based in Santa Clara, Calif. The $54 stock price
is based on Security First Technologies' May 14 closing price.
Security First had $24.2 million in revenue in 1998, a 123 percent
increase over 1997.

$100 MILLION SOUGHT FOR FIXES TO F-16 ENGINES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Air Force is asking Congress for $100 million
to repair about 1,800 F-16 fighter plane engines, fixes prompted by
seven F-16 crashes since November that were blamed on engine
failure.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is gaining support among key lawmakers, would
allow repairs at bases worldwide. Air Force propulsion experts
believe that engine problems contributed to the crashes, none of
which was fatal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get the hardware into the field quicker,'' said
Robert May, manager of the Air Force's propulsion product group at
Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. ``The faster you get the
hardware into the field, the quicker you get the risk out of the
fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   May said that the engine problems are not related to any design
flaw in the F-16. Lockheed Martin builds the fighter plane in Fort
Worth, but does not make the engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The F-16 is the safest single-engine fighter in the Air
Force's history,'' May said. ``We think it is extremely safe, and
we are proud of the record of the engines.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Hayden, a spokeswoman at Lockheed Martin Tactical
Aircraft Systems, said, ``Lockheed Martin takes any loss seriously,
and we are pleased that both the problems, as well as the
solutions, have been identified.''
</P>
<P>
   The program would ask Air Force maintenance personnel to install
several parts and make improvements to the F-16 engines, which are
made by General Electric in Cincinnati and Pratt &AMP; Whitney in West
Palm Beach, Fla. The two contractors build all F-16 engines.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both companies said their firms helped in the
investigations of the crashes and would help with the repair
program.
</P>
<P>
   The repairs would include:
</P>
<P>
   _Replacing the power-management control on the GE F110-100
engine.
</P>
<P>
   _Treating fan blades on some GE engines with ``laser shock
peening'' to make the blades more resistant to cracking.
</P>
<P>
   _Replacing some fan blades on the Pratt &AMP; Whitney F110-220
engine with more-durable blades.
</P>
<P>
   _Replacing the augmenter duct on the Pratt &AMP; Whitney engine with
a newly designed, chemically milled unit. The ducts help provide
thrust for engines by forcing air out of the nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   The work would be done on 1,860 F-16 engines, including those on
operational aircraft and others available as spares. The Air Force
has about 1,400 F-16s in its inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Without the $100 million being sought from Congress, the repairs
could take six to eight years to complete, Air Force officials
said. With the money, the repairs could be done in two to three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance personnel have already begun inspecting the suspect
parts. The inspection program includes F-16s in Europe, where the
fighters have been flying thousands of sorties in Operation Allied
Force.
</P>
<P>
   One F-16 crashed May 2 in western Serbia. Its pilot ejected
safely and was rescued. NATO officials initially said engine
problems may have caused the crash, but May said the exact cause is
not yet known.
</P>
<P>
   May said the engine problems are not the result of faulty
production work by either contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engines are so complex that there are a lot of things you
cannot analytically model'' in development, he said. ``Basically,
you find some problems when you put them out in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of the recent F-16 crashes blamed on engine problems
occurred Nov. 19 at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina. The
engine lost thrust during takeoff and the pilot ejected safely.
</P>
<P>
   The last engine-related accident was on March 26 at Luke Air
Force Base in Arizona. The pilot ejected safely before the plane
slammed into the desert about 22 miles southwest of the base.
</P>
<P>
   Luke has been the site of four high-profile F-16 mishaps blamed
on engine failure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is among the lawmakers urging that
the F-16 repairs be made soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that this emergent requirement comes at a time
when our defense dollars are very tight,'' McCain said in a letter
to fellow members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``The
safety of our air crews and the combat readiness of our Air Force
are priority concerns that require our immediate attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said that the requested money is likely to
be in the 2000 budget, but that the Air Force will have to wait
until the budget is finished in several months.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the money would be in addition to the $328 million
the administration has proposed for purchasing 10 new F-16s from
Lockheed Martin.

RULING MEXICAN PARTY OPTS FOR OPEN PRIMARY IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's ruling party broke with 70 years of
tradition Monday by deciding that its presidential candidate for
2000 would be chosen in an open primary election.
</P>
<P>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which, since its
founding in 1929, has controlled Mexico, traditionally has had as
its candidate the personal choice of the incumbent president. But
Mexico's current president, Ernesto Zedillo, has repeatedly pledged
to end the so-called ``dedazo''in favor of a more democratic
process. In addition, growing competition from opposition parties
has put greater pressure on the PRI to adopt reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, no one can say that the president has chosen the
candidate,'' PRI President Jose Antonio Gonzalez said in a speech
to the 300 party officials who attended Monday's marathon session.
``We will choose our own candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, all interested candidates must register by
the end of June. Candidates who currently hold public office must
resign by June 15.
</P>
<P>
   The primary campaign season would run from Aug. 1 to Nov. 3. The
PRI will not provide any funds during the primary but will impose a
spending limit, which remains to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate would be selected by a vote among all registered
voters in early November. The winner would be the candidate who
takes the largest number of the country's 300 congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts predicted a more open process could attract a
larger pool of candidates. Already, there are at least three
declared candidates: former Puebla Governor Manuel Bartlett,
Tabasco Governor Roberto Madrazo and former PRI president Humberto
Roque.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders could include Interior Secretary Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, considered by many to be Zedillo's favorite, and
Veracruz Governor Miguel Aleman, son of a former president.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision by the PRI was a surprise to some observers
who expected the party to agree to hold a secret vote only among
its members.
</P>
<P>
   Now the party appears ready to expand a successful experiment it
tried during last year's governor's race in the border state of
Chihuahua. There, for the first time, the PRI held an open primary
to pick its candidate rather than letting party bosses decide.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI went on to win the seat, taking away an office that for
nearly a decade had belonged to the conservative opposition
National Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing here is an extraordinary development to a
more open democracy in the PRI and for Mexico,'' said Arturo Nunez,
the head of the PRI's congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the opposition parties has selected its candidate yet.
The two leading opposition candidates are Mexico City Mayor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the leftist Party of the Democratic
Revolution, and Guanajuato Governor Vicente Fox, of the PAN. Both
of them have outpolled all potential PRI candidates in recent
surveys.

BOSSES COMMENTS QUALIFY AS HARASSMENT

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I have been employed for seven months on my
present job. My boss has made several comments about my physical
appearance, and he recently told me how I reminded him of a
particular lingerie model. I am most uncomfortable with this
situation, but I feel it probably does not qualify as a sexual
harassment. Do I say anything, and if so, how? N.M.
</P>
<P>
   A. You remind him of a lingerie model? Doesn't he remind you of
a Neanderthal boss who drags his company into a sexual harassment
lawsuit? As to whether his actions qualify as sexual harassment, he
is engaging in unwanted sexually oriented behaviors that are
creating a hostile environment for you. It sounds like he is highly
qualified for the designation of sexual harasser.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is for you to go directly to management. In fact,
many companies encourage their employees to do just that. There is
tremendous liability associated with sexual harassment, and
numerous employers have specific channels to deal with it. You also
have the option of contacting an attorney or various state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer, you can meet with your boss and tell him that his
sexually oriented comments must stop. Give him examples of the
comments in question, let him know they are upsetting you, and
conclude by saying that you will be forced to take more serious
action if his harassment continues.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue is that many companies have policies, training
programs and a broad range of resources specifically designed to
deal with, and ultimately eliminate, sexual harassment. One has to
wonder about a company that still has this kind of predator lurking
about.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The supervisors who report to me write up evaluations on
their employees. I meet individually with the evaluated employees
and go over their reviews. There is one employee whose review is
fairly negative, and I am concerned about how to deal with her.
What can you suggest? K.S. &QL; 
A. What are you going to do when this employee asks you for
specific examples of the behaviors that caused her to receive such
a low rating? What are you going to say when she insists that she
completed everything her supervisor requested?
</P>
<P>
   The point is that you should not be the one who sits down with
these evaluated employees. This responsibility belongs to the
supervisors who wrote the evaluations in the first place. For you
to step in at this point wastes your time, puts you in a situation
in which you cannot provide adequate information or guidance,
undercuts the supervisors, and generates feelings of frustration
for the evaluated employee.
</P>
<P>
   It will make more sense for you to give the supervisors some
training in the performance appraisal process. Let them see the
importance of setting goals with their employees and providing
performance-based feedback and coaching along the way. Not only
does this approach lead to improved performance, it also leads to a
performance evaluation session where there are no surprises. If an
employee has been struggling, he or she knows about the problem and
has already been working with the supervisor to correct it.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no surprises in the evaluation process, and it
would be particularly surprising to have the review session led by
someone other than the employee's direct supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just joined this company and I cannot believe how many
people are quitting. Three people in my department just left, as
did my manager and the person who first interviewed me. I have
never seen anything like this, and I am wondering if I should think
about jumping ship too. What do you think? C.B.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is never a great feeling to get on a ship and see masses
of people scurrying for the lifeboats. And it is particularly
unsettling to find that the people who once believed that this is
the right company for you, including the interviewer and your
manager, do not feel that it is the right company for them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, this turnover could be a random occurrence
and mean very little in terms of the quality of the company. Or it
could mean something quite ominous. The best step is for you to
look around the company and try to figure out what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   You should talk to your fellow employees and members of
management regarding this matter, and contact people who have left,
particularly your former manager and the individual who interviewed
you. In order to make a truly informed decision, let some time
pass, keep the communication lines open, read as much about the
company as you can, and be very observant. It should not take long
to determine if you should head for the lifeboats too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARRIOTTSVILLE, Md. _ Short, slight, boyishly frail-looking at
60, James F. Laughland can pierce the pupil in the eye of a bull,
or its paper equivalent, shot after shot, with his .22-caliber
Winchester rifle or his mightier M-1A. A badge on his shooting
fatigue jacket says ``President's Hundred,'' putting him in the top
rank of thousands of shooters who compete in a national tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aerospace engineer, Laughland spent this past weekend,
like most, working on his ``groups,'' the pattern of shots that
pierces a target's black center and surrounding rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sighting in and looking for the smallest group possible,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   With guns, he has hurt only one living thing, his own right
shoulder. It needed rotator-cuff surgery after more than 40 years
of pounding by recoiling rifle butts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the massacre last month at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., guns have seized the agenda of Congress more than
at any other time in recent years, and their owners have been
demonized, or at least oversimplified, in the pitched battle
between gun-control advocates and the National Rifle Association
and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the men, women and children at weekend shooting
tournaments like the one here at the Associated Gun Clubs of
Baltimore attest, there is another dimension to Americans and their
guns. According to the National Rifle Association, 60 million to 65
million Americans own 200 million guns, or about three per person.
As tools of sport and fun, guns are as entrenched in the culture
and life of many American communities as the Little League and
Sunday school.
</P>
<P>
   That guns can be instruments for evil seems far removed from the
climate of America's thousands of rifle and pistol ranges, where on
this weekend in May, several million target shooters began their
annual cycle of tournaments and matches.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Gun Clubs' site here occupies 60 hilly acres of
brush, fields and maple trees, near stone quarries and horse farms
just beyond the western fringe of suburban Baltimore. Twenty-five
clubs with a total of 3,000 to 3,500 members support the site's
pistol, bench rest, rifle, trap and archery ranges, most with
covered firing lines to permit shooting in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Up at the trap range, 15 men and a woman armed with 12-gauge
shotguns take turns shooting in groups of five and six. Four men
are black, the others white. They run the gamut in age, from late
20s to late 60s, and have jobs, from mechanic and truck driver to
lawyer and engineer. They are skinny and fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a sport for exercise,'' says Bob Baker, 51, an
informations system engineer and one of the beefier shooters. ''I
do this for sport,'' he said. ``I've never been hunting in my life.
I like this because the targets move. It's a little more
challenging than shooting at a stationary piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shanks, 49, a supervisor for a public transit agency, is
black. He spent his early childhood in Georgia and then moved to
Baltimore. He learned shooting in the Boy Scouts and fought in
Vietnam as a staff sergeant in the Green Berets. But he traces his
interest in shooting to the rural black America of an earlier
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of our culture,'' Shanks said. ``As a black person
in this country, you learn to survive by shooting game for food.
You learn to shoot .22's for rabbits and squirrels. You feel
comfortable with a rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting range, he says, is a great equalizer. ``When you
come here, you strip away all your prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanks, Baker and three other men load up. From a bunker-like
trap house _ a 2-foot-high concrete structure about 10 yards in
front of the shooters _ a hidden machine catapults small orange
saucers, or clay pigeons, into the air, simulating ducks bursting
from marsh.
</P>
<P>
   The saucers take off flying 60 mph in any of 52 directions.
Struck with a burst of buckshot, they shatter. Each competitor gets
25 pigeons. John Quinn, a mechanic at a Mack Truck dealership and a
frequent winner, sometimes hits all 25. He wins this round today,
missing just two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is 10 percent knowledge, 90 percent concentration,''
Quinn says. As the clay pigeon takes off, he explained, he keeps
the gun moving with it, and a little ahead and then fires. ``The
whole trick,'' he said, ``is to keep the gun moving. You stop, you
miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do trap, pistol and rifle, and I coach,'' Quinn said. ``I
come here at least every Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   He started bringing his daughter when she was 9. She became a
proficient shooter and met and married a member whose father and
uncle were also members. ``My son-in-law is a hunter, big time,''
he said. ``Their majority meat for the year consists of venison.''

   Bob Baker wonders what has become of Americans and their guns.
``A lot of us grew up with toy guns,'' he said. As a child in
Framingham, Mass., he said, he played cops and robbers with cap
guns. ``I used to get cowboy sets for Hanukkah,'' he said. ``I shot
BB guns in summer camp. I shot rifle in college.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Baker said, ``If a police officer sees a kid with a
gun, he's going to shoot and ask questions later.'' Kids get into
trouble, he said, ``talking about guns or drawing pictures of
guns.'' For the most part, he said he blamed violent movies for the
surge in schoolyard shooting by children.
</P>
<P>
   Safety is a big issue here. No one is allowed on the range
without a member's numbered orange badge, which indicates that the
bearer has mastered a full course of safety instruction. Typically,
the members bring several guns here to shoot on the different
ranges, and many attach trigger locks when they are not shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks has built a cabinet into the wall of his basement, which
he locks, and when he loads up his van to go shooting, he attaches
locks to the triggers of his guns. When Baker resumed shooting six
years ago after a long hiatus, he said he bought a $350 steel safe
for his guns before he bought his first gun.
</P>
<P>
   Down at the benchrest section of the 100-yard range, John
Mathis, 43, a commercial printer, has brought his children, Mark,
12, and Christine, 15, for their first afternoon of formal
instruction. ``I have a room and everything in the room is in two
large cabinets,'' Mathis said. ``The cabinets are locked and the
room is locked.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, Mathis said, since his days as a ``teen-age
plinker.'' Plinking _ picking off tin cans and other random objects
_ is confined today largely to the deserts of the West. ``There was
a time in America,'' he said, ``when if you were a marksman, that
was a good thing. Now if you say you're a good shot, someone thinks
you're crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A gun, Mathis said, builds character. ``It creates discipline
and responsibility. You have a tool in your hand that can be
hazardous. You learn to control that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis brought Christine out to the range when she was 8 and
bought a child's .22-caliber Chipmonk for her to use. Her interest
waned, but now, in the aftermath of Littleton, she wants to learn
to shoot. At school she has been assigned a debating class topic,
gun control, and to argue the case for it.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Mark, by contrast, has been tagging along with his
father to the range. While Mark needs a lot of work on his aim, he
seems smitten by the same thrills that hook most people here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best time,'' Mark said, ``was when I took out a bull's
eye.'' Taking out a bull's eye entails so riddling a target's black
circle with holes that nothing of it remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept shooting,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark added, ``I like to come outside and spend time doing
something I enjoy.''

BLAIR PRESSED TO END CLINTON'S STALLING ON GROUND FORCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-NATO, KOSOVO-MILITARY) 
(mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair is coming under increasing
pressure to stand up to President Clinton on the issue of using
ground troops to achieve a NATO victory over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction is taking hold in Britain that the war against
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia cannot be won on NATO's
terms without troops on the ground. Blair is being urged to use his
close friendship with Clinton to persuade him to confront
congressional and public misgivings over committing American
soldiers to such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting widespread public doubts about the American
president's stance, the lead editorial of The Financial Times said
Monday, ``Clinton's prevarication about offering the U.S. troops
that are vital to a successful outcome has left time on Milosevic's
side.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London said Monday that one of those moments that
makes for what Winston Churchill called the British-American
``special relationship'' is at hand and that it is up to Blair ``to
convince the president that his reputation and NATO's future
credibility rests upon a willingness to use the tools at his
disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   A former defense minister, Michael Portillo, said on TV Sunday
morning, ``If the government wants to achieve what it says it wants
to achieve, you can only do that by ground forces.'' And Paddy
Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats and himself a former Royal
Marine commando officer, said he had never heard of anyone
``surrendering to an aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ashdown and William Hague, leader of the Conservative
Party, warned Blair in the House of Commons last week that time was
running out for a decision on ground forces. ``I am acutely aware
of the issue of time, and the issue of the Balkan winter and the
need for planning for all contingencies,'' Blair responded.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has not explicitly endorsed sending in the infantry, but
his emphasis on pushing for undiluted victory has inevitably cast
him in the position of being in favor of using ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend he responded directly and bluntly to British
critics of the American war effort, saying, ``The vast bulk of this
military operation is being carried out by U.S. forces, although
Kosovo is a very long way from Kansas. Their commitment and
leadership is something for which President Clinton should be
praised, rather than the sneers he receives from the right in this
country.'' He was speaking in a question-and-answer interview with
The Observer in what has become an almost daily habit of Blair's of
rallying public opinion on NATO's bombing over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, who is flying to Washington
on Thursday, said Monday that NATO does not have to wait for a
negotiated settlement with Milosevic before sending in troops. ``We
are certainly not going to stand around at the border whilst we
wait for him to come to a signing ceremony with flags and cameras
and make an official treaty,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset of the bombing campaign seven weeks ago, Blair
has employed the brawniest rhetoric of any allied leader and has
described the conflict as a moral one and the acts of Milosevic as
war crimes for which the West must seek retribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no half-measures to his brutality and there can be
no half-measures about how we deal with it,'' he told an audience
in Germany last week. ``No compromise, no fudge, no half-baked
deals,'' he said in describing the only acceptable resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to showing any signs that his loyalty to Clinton had
been shaken by any disagreement over the military campaign, Blair
flew Monday to Bulgaria and went out of his way to praise the
American role in the struggle. ``America has once again shown that
it has the vision to see that instability, chaos and racial
genocide in the heart of Europe will never affect Europe alone,''
he told an audience at Sofia University in the Bulgarian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Blair goes on to Albania on Tuesday in what is his second trip
to the Balkans this month. Two weeks ago, he saw refugee camps in
Macedonia and addressed the Romanian Parliament in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an unwanted measure of his success in portraying
himself as NATO's most forceful champion that Blair is now obliged
to respond to repeated reports that he and Clinton have serious
differences over the war, and that during his visit to the United
States last month he became frustrated at his inability to sway the
president to his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question we are all pondering is whether Blair knows
something we do not about American intentions, or whether he is
merely clinging to the hope that moral determination can prevail,
even when the military means to achieve a speedy decision in Kosovo
are lacking because the U.S. will not provide them,'' said Max
Hastings, the editor of The Evening Standard, writing a rare
column.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked about the reports, a spokesman for 10 Downing Street said,
``The press is portraying the prime minister as a hawk and Clinton
as not as fully committed, but that is nonsense. We have been
absolutely up front about the fact that the prime minister and the
president are of one mind about the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said he had been in the party accompanying Blair
to the United States and added, ``That was true before the prime
minister went to Washington, and nothing happened there to change
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said his trip to Washington was designed to ``demonstrate
the solidarity of our two countries,'' whose relations, he said,
are characterized by ``strong unity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no ideological dispute about the need for ground
troops,'' Cook said in a video link to Monday's Defense Ministry
briefing from Brussels, Belgium, where he was attending a meeting
of European Union foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in Washington he hoped to explore ``how we take
advantage of the success that we are achieving in Kosovo from the
military campaign from the air so that we are ready to go in as
soon as it is possible to go in safely and when it's appropriate to
do so to get the refugees back. We need to do that as quickly as we
can because we are all well aware that winter is coming.''

 &HT;    Gone, but still _ and always _ here
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARCO ISLAND, Fla. _ They had said their farewell to Eugenio
Saraceni, son of an Italian carpenter and were now laying his body
to rest in Marco Island Cemetery. And so ends the 97-year-old story
of Saraceni turned Gene Sarazen, whose life was a biography of the
American dream. ``Leaving footprints in the sands of time that can
never be filled,'' to quote his great friend, Don Panoz.
</P>
<P>
   After a career of checking the world from one end to another,
this little island on the southwest of Florida is where he chose to
settle. They came here, his wife Mary and Gene, after she had
discovered the treasures of shells on the beaches. First, they came
for the winters, then later made it full-time, and hardly any
corner of this island hasn't been touched by the Sarazens. Now they
lie in adjoining plots.
</P>
<P>
   The service was high Catholic, celebrated by a priest who dealt
wittily in golfing metaphors, Father McConigal. Ken Venturi
delivered a warm and poignant eulogy. It was of note that Tim
Finchem of the PGA Tour had come to pay his respects, although the
Sarazen World Open that Panoz created has been deleted by the new
World Tour. The tournament at Chateau Elan fit in so well with
Sarazen's reputation as ambassador of golf, but so much for that.
It is significant that he has been revered in Japan for three
decades with a tournament in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Before airlines girdled the globe, Sarazen carried the gospel of
golf to every continent where the game is played, then went back to
the birthplace of the game and won the British Open, among his
seven major championships. He hit parts of the world Americans had
never heard of, when overseas travel was by steamship. He golfed
with sultans, kings, tycoons and princes. He missed the first
Masters because he had committed to a series of exhibitions in
South America and Australia. But he was only beginning to see the
world. One day, as he was haying in a field on his farm a car came
rolling up in a cloud of dust, and with it an offer to host the
``Shell Wonderful World of Golf.''
</P>
<P>
   He would say later, ``That brought me more attention and made me
more money than all of the tournaments I won.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finally did plant his feet, it was on a farm, odd as it
might seem. No recreational farmer, he. He owned three farms at one
time or another, but the last was his pride and joy, located near
Germantown, N.Y. He sold his second farm to Gabriel Heatter, the
radio newscaster, and bought 300 acres called Mountain Range. He
produced apples, cherries _ he loved cherry trees _ and hay and
kept a herd of Black Angus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My motive was strictly economic,'' Sarazen said in his book.
``I wanted something solid under my feet,'' speaking of a time when
the big Depression was upon us.
</P>
<P>
   He was Bobby Jones' closest friend among the professional
players, for not many flocked around an amateur who was beating
them at their own game. He and Jones were born within 18 days of
each other, both had wives named Mary and were married within days
of each other. A few years ago, he called from Florida and wanted
to stop off in Atlanta and visit Jones' grave site. He was taken to
Oakland Cemetery, and there had his picture taken by Jones'
headstone, a treasured experience in my life.
</P>
<P>
   He has had a special relationship with the Masters from the time
he delivered the historic double eagle in 1935. Jones himself
witnessed it from 50 yards away. Sarazen would later say, ``Any
club that wants to see how a tournament should be run should send a
few emissaries to study the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sarazen World Open filled a void in his life after Mary
died. She, too, had been smitten by the game, leading to a story he
loved to tell. ``I had just lost the U.S. Open by a stroke to Olin
Dutra at Merion and was coming home on the train. Mary met me at
Penn Station, and came running up and said, 'Gene, Gene, I shot an
84!' And I'd lost the U.S. Open by one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a million Sarazen stories, for here was a man who
captured America's imagination before television was there. He was
small in size, about 5 feet 5, with a big smile that was always
turned on. Now, though, we must adjust to thinking of golf without
the man who gave us the sand wedge and Lord knows how much more. On
a pedestal in front of the altar at San Marco they'd placed one of
his little white golf hats. It was almost as if he was there, and
in a sense he was and shall always be.

US WOMEN'S SOCCER CHOICES GOLDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only suspense was who the third goaltender would be. Almost
anybody who's watched the US women's soccer team play this year
could probably have ticked off virtually the entire 20-player World
Cup roster announced Monday, just over a month before the opener
with Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   That's how stable, and predictable, the squad has been since the
host Americans reloaded after winning the Olympic title in Atlanta
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen gold medalists _ most notably Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers,
Kristine Lilly, Julie Foudy, Joy Fawcett, Carla Overbeck, and
keeper Briana Scurry _ will form the core of a squad that has lost
only nine matches in six years and has won 54 of its last 55 on
home soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about this team,'' said coach Tony DiCicco, whose
squad will be favored to recapture the crown it lost to Norway four
years ago. ``I think it's the best the US has ever put together.''
</P>
<P>
   It's undoubtedly the most experienced. Eleven players were
members of the 1995 Cup squad and seven played in 1991. Eight have
competed in at least 115 international matches. Lilly, the
27-year-old midfielder, owns the world record for most caps (177)
and Hamm, the 27-year-old forward, needs only one goal to set a
global mark with 108.
</P>
<P>
   So DiCicco's decisions were mostly on the margins _ keep a
veteran bench player or go with youth? With the Olympics coming up
next summer, DiCicco stood pat more often than not. He chose Cup
veteran Saskia Webber over 21-year-old Siri Mullinix for third
keeper behind Scurry and Tracy Ducar of North Andover, Mass. And he
decided that 18-year-olds Ally Wagner and Susan Bush needed more
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   But DiCicco opted for Natick-born defender Sara Whalen, the
23-year-old former UConn star, because of her speed and
versatility. ``We think Sara's part of our future,'' said DiCicco.
``We're hoping this experience will vault her into the next
level.''

FAILING TO RECEIVE SUPPORT, SONIA GANDHI QUITS AS PARTY LEADER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow who
inherited the mantle of India's founding political dynasty,
submitted her resignation Monday as leader of the Congress Party
after a trio of party leaders revolted against her candidacy for
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The party's shaken governing body promptly and unanimously
rejected her resignation. But party officials said they were unsure
whether Mrs. Gandhi actually intends to quit or whether she will
relent. Senior Congress leaders rushed to her home Monday evening
to dissuade her from stepping down as president of a party they say
she has single-handedly rescued from a disastrous decline over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharad Pawar, a powerful Congress Party leader from the state of
Maharashtra, and two other senior Congress officials had openly
challenged the appropriateness of Mrs. Gandhi's candidacy for prime
minister because of her foreign birth and her lack of political
experience.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary letter that was delivered to her on
Saturday, the three party leaders also asked her to propose a
constitutional amendment requiring that the offices of president
and prime minister be held only by natural born Indian citizens.
The letter was leaked to newspapers, which carried accounts of it
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible that a country of 980 million, with a
wealth of education, competence and ability, can have anyone other
than an Indian, born of Indian soil, to head its government,'' they
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a party where many serve as sycophantic courtiers to the
Gandhi family, the rebels' letter was a stunningly open airing of
doubts about Mrs. Gandhi's fitness to govern. Mrs. Gandhi, whose
husband, Rajiv Gandhi, and mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi, both
served as prime ministers of India and who were both assassinated,
has never held any elective office. She has been president of the
Congress Party for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that party leaders considered her foreign birth a
political liability, she said in her letter of resignation that she
was ``pained by their lack of confidence in my ability to act in
the best interest of the party and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Though born in a foreign land, I chose India as my country,''
she wrote. ``I am Indian and shall remain so till my last breath.
India is my motherland, dearer to me than my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of frenetic behind-the-scenes meetings, the Congress
Working Committee, the party's governing body, Monday night
strongly endorsed Mrs. Gandhi's continued leadership.
</P>
<P>
   They said it was essential in the political battle against the
rival Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which they describe
as a political force intent on inflaming communal passions among
Hindus, Muslims and Christians. They also said that Mrs. Gandhi,
who became an Indian citizen in 1983, has united the party and can
ably lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The three rebels did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, a regal, austere figure who gives no free-form
interviews and offers few impromptu remarks, did not appear before
reporters Monday. Up to now, she has not declared her own intention
to be a candidate for prime minister, though party spokesmen have
repeatedly said she is the party's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The views of Pawar, who led the opposition in the lower house of
Parliament, and of the two other signatories, P.A. Sangma, a member
of Parliament and a Christian from the small, northeastern state of
Meghalaya, and Tariq Anwar, a Muslim leader from the state of
Bihar, are especially damaging because they echo and legitimize
statements made by the Hindu nationalists, Congress' main rival for
power in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   The nationalist party officials say it is a disgrace that India
should even consider electing an Italian-born woman who is a
political neophyte. And they have held up their leader, the
caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee _ a veteran
parliamentary leader and an Indian _ as the antithesis of Mrs.
Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalist-led coalition lost a vote of confidence
last month by a single vote, with a healthy push from the Congress
Party. But afterward, Congress was unable to come up with a
majority to form a new government _ a failure that tarnished Mrs.
Gandhi's image for mature and cautious leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, almost seven years after her husband was
assassinated as he campaigned to be prime minister, Mrs. Gandhi
agreed to take over as president of the Congress Party and had been
credited with rescuing it from near oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   While the rebels praised Mrs. Gandhi, ``a daughter-in-law to
India for the past 30 years,'' for helping to revive the party and
said they hope she continues as party president, they drew the line
at her heading the government.
</P>
<P>
   They contended that the legacy of the slain independence leader
Mohandas K. Gandhi justified their insistence on the need for a
native-born Indian prime minister _ an interpretation of Gandhi's
views others disputed. Gandhi, known as the Mahatma, or Great Soul,
is no relation to Sonia Gandhi's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``India has always lived in the spirit of the Mahatma's words,
`Let the winds from all over sweep into my room,' '' they wrote.
``But again he said, `I will not be swept off my feet.' We accept
with interest and humility the best which we can gather from the
north, south, east or west and we absorb them into our soil. But
our inspiration, our soul, our honor, our pride, our dignity, is
rooted in our soil. It has to be of this earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion by Pawar is threatening, not only because of the
content of the missive, but also because he is a powerhouse in the
state of Maharashtra, whose capital, Bombay, is India's financial
nerve center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharad Pawar is the Richard Daley of Indian politics in his
creative use of patronage to build networks of support,'' said
Jairam Ramesh, a Congress Party official.
</P>
<P>
   Maharashtra provides the Congress Party with 37 of its 140
members of Parliament _ support the party cannot afford to lose if
it hopes to win power after the elections. Pawar, who is 58 and a
man with prime ministerial ambitions of his own, may see the
continued dynastic reign of the Gandhi family as shutting off all
hope that he can ever rise to the pinnacle of power.

COURT STRIKES DOWN CALIFORNIA WELFARE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: RECASTS lede, adds reaction in 5th and 6th grafs.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling California's welfare law a ``discriminatory
scheme,'' the Supreme Court on Monday struck down the 1997 measure,
which would have granted the state's newcomers lower welfare
benefits than those received by residents who have lived there
longer.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision, which could affect 14 other states, said
California's limit on benefits for new residents violates their
constitutional right to travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the
right to choose to be citizens of the state wherein they reside,''
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court. ``The states,
however, do not have any right to select their citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``California's legitimate interest in saving money
does not justify this discriminatory scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann E. Bushmiller, a lawyer for the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty, a Washington-based advocacy group, called
the ruling a victory for Americans' right to travel freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tell new state residents, `You can't go to our public
schools or use our roads,' so why should we tell them that they
can't use our welfare benefits?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision will force California to restructure
its welfare policy. The state has the nation's largest number of
welfare recipients _ about 2.6 million _ and a $6 billion budget to
aid them.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also could force welfare policy revisions by the
other states that passed statutes similar to California's under the
welfare restructuring law that Congress passed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After that law was enacted, California redesigned its welfare
system to pay new residents _ those in the state less than a year _
who apply for aid only as much as they would have received in their
former states. Newcomers could receive full California benefits
after one year of residency.
</P>
<P>
   Since California ranks sixth highest among the 50 states in
welfare benefits, the vast majority of newcomers would have
received far less money than longer-term residents. For example,
California would have paid $673 a month to a family of four who had
been in the state more than a year, but if that family had recently
arrived from, say, Mississippi, it would have received $144 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the two-tier system to prevent states with
higher benefits from becoming ``welfare magnets'' that would
attract migrating poor people. Many lawmakers said that if such a
migration were to happen, states might engage in a ``race to the
bottom'' to lower their benefits and make themselves less
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Before the California law went into effect, however, a single
woman and a family of welfare recipients challenged the law, saying
the limit on benefits _ along with California's high cost of living
_ could deprive them of the basic necessities of life.
</P>
<P>
   The family, listed under the fictitious name of the Roes, had
moved to Long Beach, Calif., from Oklahoma and would have received
$307 per month compared with the in-state resident benefit of $565.
The anonymous woman, called Anna Doe, had moved to Los Angeles from
Washington, D.C., when she was six months pregnant and would have
received $330 per month compared with an in-state resident benefit
of $456.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District Court ruled on April 1, 1997 _ the first day
that the California law would have become effective _ that it was
unconstitutional. The court said the law penalized migration
between states in violation of the equal protection clause of the
14th Amendment. The next year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   During his arguments before the high court in January,
California Deputy Attorney General Theodore Garelis argued that
while the law might have impeded migration to California, it would
not have prevented freedom of travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``People move for a host of reasons, with welfare benefits being
only one,'' Garelis said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the law would not have ``hurt'' newcomers because
they would have received some benefits and those payments would
have risen to California levels after a year. ``In the end, they're
no worse off than if they had stayed in their original state,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens wrote on Monday that while it may be reasonable to
assume that some people might move to a state to receive higher
welfare benefits, ``the empirical evidence ... indicates that the
number of such persons is quite small _ surely not large enough to
justify a burden on those who had no such motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin
Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the two, Rehnquist called the California law a
``reasonable measure falling under the head of a `good-faith
residency requirement.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other states with lower welfare benefits for newcomers are
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Several of those laws have been
challenged in court and have been barred from taking effect.

 &HT;   Storied friendships, rivalry set aside as Hawks, Knicks look to
advanceBy Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even a year ago, the smile on his face told the world
that Dikembe Mutombo was simply happy to be here _ be it an
early-season game, a crunch game in April or a first-round playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   He's beyond that now.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, when Mutombo walks to the jump circle against his old
friend and mentor Patrick Ewing, his demeanor will be grim, his
visage bordering on a glower.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen years into his basketball career in America, eight years
into his NBA career, three with the Hawks, the bright, angular man
from the Congo says he finally understands the quest for a
championship, as Atlanta plays the New York Knicks in the second
round of the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A month from his 33rd birthday, Mutombo says, ``I'm getting to
the middle of my career when I want to win something. You want to
win a championship, and now Chicago leaves the door open. I don't
see why I would miss the opportunity presented to me. It's a chance
to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The road to opportunity, however, goes through Ewing, 37, a man
whom many believe Mutombo accorded too much respect in the early
years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about Ewing's relationship with Mutombo and Miami's
Alonzo Mourning, coach Lenny Wilkens said Monday: ``Patrick always
had an edge on those two guys. He was friends with them but he was
professional on the court to start with. After the game, they could
be friends, but when we're out there as long as you've got that
uniform on, you're not my friend. And I think Mourning got to that
level. Now we have to get Deek there.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said that Mutombo needs to say to himself, ``I'll
respect you, but you ain't gonna run over me.'' The Mutombo-Ewing
matchup is the centerpiece in a series that is short on both
rivalry and history. The franchises haven't met in the post-season
in 28 years. Mutombo understands that the two centers will share
the spotlight, even if he is not the offensive focus of his team,
even if Ewing's creaky legs have made him a questionable but brave
participant throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick? I don't worry about Patrick. I'm worrying about New
York's offense,'' Mutombo said. ``Patrick and I can have dinner
before the game. We can have an orange juice after the game, but
when we come to the court, our friendship will be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo disagreed with the suggestion that Ewing's personality
has dominated him, but he does honors the older player's influence
on his career since the day he followed Ewing to Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something special to play against someone you know
half your life and grow up with _ in the game and off the court,''
Mutombo said. ``To physically and mentally play at this level and
face him on the court, I love to see it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing ``might be a lucky guy,'' Mutombo said with a sly smile.
``He played Mourning and me in the (playoffs) same year. I gotta be
the one that finishes him. I know that he finished Mourning. Now
I've got to finish him.''
</P>
<P>
   They will battle through the best-of-seven series, he said, then
meet up again in Georgetown where they spend their summers, honing
their game for the season to come, telling lies and boasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be there in the summer time when we go to dinner
and when we (are) playing in the gym. There is a lot of
trash-talking, about what I did to you in the regular season. I
told Patrick I got you already in the regular season and I'm going
to get you in the playoffs. It's just friends talking, two guys
that are enjoying themselves. This is what we all love to do, work
hard and then come to the big dance. And it's time to dance now.''
</P>
<P>
   They split the two regular-season games in which Ewing
participated. The Hawks took the finale when Ewing watched in
street clothes, saving his aching Achilles tendon. Ewing averaged
18.5 points and 7.0 rebounds against the Hawks, Mutombo 10.7 points
and 15.7 rebounds against the Knicks. With the bell ready to sound
for Round 2, Wilkens says, ``Dikembe is pumped up about the
playoffs. Whoever we play, he's ready. Whatever we ask him to do,
he's ready for that, too.''

By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ The champion of the 1999 MasterCard Colonial
will stride up the 18th fairway Sunday and into a casting call for
``Braveheart.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he embraces the trophy, his wife will force a smile to
disguise her horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egad, it's plaid.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just any plaid: It is Colonial Plaid, a one-of-a-kind,
made-to-order, 12-color Royal Tartan, worsted wool. It is milled in
Scotland and included on The Register of All Publicly Known Tartans
_ the official listing of the about 2,500 plaids recognized by the
Scottish Tartans Society.
</P>
<P>
   It is Forever Plaid. It is the plaid jacket, the sometimes
maligned but mainly coveted prize of the MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, they don't let us take it out of the clubhouse,''
said 1994 winner Nick Price, who will not be playing this week
because of a schedule conflict. ``The only time we have to wear it
is on champion's dinner night. There's one other that's equally as
ugly, and it's from Hilton Head \Rthe MCI Classic in South
Carolina\S, but it's a tradition and a good tradition. I'd wear
another five jackets if I could win another five Colonials.''
</P>
<P>
   This one will be the 47th plaid jacket to be awarded since its
debut in 1952 (the Tournament Players Championship was played at
Colonial in 1975) when the tournament committee decided to emulate
the Masters and the Phoenix Open by offering a distinctive coat.
Then-tournament chairman S.M. ``Bing'' Bingham chose plaid because,
``Our officials should shine with the same brilliance as our field
for the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colonial is one of five tournaments that award jackets; the
others are the Masters, the MCI Classic, the Memorial and the
Bayhill Invitational. Although Colonial champions are awarded a
matching Colonial Plaid tie, a nationally recognized fashion maven,
commenting in ``Sports Illustrated,'' awarded the Colonial Plaid
jacket a ``bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Highland warriors, the tournament committee is quick to
defend its two-button, center vent, notch lapel, flap-pocket
tartan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wish they had one,'' said shootout committee
chairman Barry Smith, a men's clothier who has been custom-making
the jackets for 10 years. ``The Colonial is not about fashion. It's
about tradition, and it's about golf.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any clan plaid, only a select few are allowed to wear
it: tournament committee chairmen and vice chairmen, the Colonial
board of governors, former tournament chairmen, past champions and
the ``Pride of the Plaid'' _ those deemed to have given long-term
service to the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   They wear their jackets proudly at the sales kickoff dinner in
early spring, at functions during tournament week and at the trophy
presentation on the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``And most people do not put them on until right before the
awards because immediately, your shirt sticks to your skin,'' said
Mike Thomas, a past club president. ``It gets hot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why they have a jacket ready and waiting for the winner.
The presenters raid the champions locker room when it becomes
apparent who might win the plaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the same thing the Masters does,'' tournament director
Dennis Roberson said. ``We find another champion's jacket that we
think is the right size. We'll go down there with two or three
coats if we have to. If it looks like Corey Pavin or Craig Stadler,
we'll get a big one and a small one _ no offense to Craig Stadler,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he's coming down the fairway, we look out at Tom Watson and
say, `Hmm _ Is he an Ian Baker-Finch?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Baker-Finch took a dip in the water hazard on No. 13,
dropping his trousers and wading in, but failed to save par.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to the tournament committee to save ``pair:'' At the
1994 champions dinner, Baker-Finch was presented a pair of Colonial
Plaid boxer shorts to match the jacket he won in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That would be worsted wool in the worst way.
</P>
<P>
   But it gets worse: At the 1991 champions dinner, Lanny Wadkins
presented 1990 winner Ben Crenshaw a pair of custom-made Colonial
Plaid pants to match the jacket he won in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   And just think of all the yuks you've missed out on because
``you'' don't have one, and you probably won't get one any time
soon, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people with the jackets are very proud of them, and
they're not easily given up,'' said Scott Corpening, chairman of
special events. ``There's been a lot of fun poked at the jacket,
but I can assure you there won't be one guy that tees it up
Thursday that wouldn't love to have one. It's our heritage. It's
what we're proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   They're mad about that plaid. nn

CHINESE LEADERS DIVIDED ON NEGOTIATIONS FOR JOINING WTO
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ While China officially remains committed to joining
the World Trade Organization, Chinese economists say that apparent
divisions in the nation's leadership are likely to further stiffen
Beijing's negotiating position and make agreement difficult to
achieve in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   With China experiencing a wave of nationalist politics after the
American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7,
orthodox politicians, skeptical about the benefits of forcing open
Chinese markets as membership in the global trade group would
require, seem to be gaining influence.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Zhu Rongji is widely considered China's strongest
proponent of entry into the trade group, which sets the rules of
global commerce. But Zhu has become vulnerable to accusations that
he was giving too much away in the broad concessions he offered to
American negotiators during his visit to the United States last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Trade Minister Shi Guangsheng said Monday that China had
not changed its basic negotiating position. But he also
re-emphasized that Beijing would join the trade organization on its
own terms. ``China will never enter the WTO at the expense of its
own basic interests,'' Shi said at a meeting with visiting
Australian officials in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant U.S. trade representative, Robert Cassidy, had
originally been scheduled to return to Beijing this week to resume
talks, but his visit has been indefinitely delayed.
</P>
<P>
   An economist in Beijing with close ties to the government said
that the mood surrounding the trade talks had darkened, and that
many economic reforms were likely to be delayed while the
leadership was occupied with a new campaign to promote nationalism.
``No one dares do or say anything until they see a direction from
the center,'' the economist said. ``It limits everyone's ability to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   After President Clinton turned down a deal on Chinese membership
in the trade group during Zhu's visit, Chinese and American
negotiators looked to early June as a deadline to reach an
agreement, when China's most-favored-nation trading status expires.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching a deal by then would enable the Clinton administration
to advocate a single vote in Congress to give China permanent
favorable trading status, as required under trade organization
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Without a deal, Congress would have to vote once to renew
Beijing's most-favored-nation status, and then vote again on giving
China that status permanently. With so many anti-China voices in
Congress, made louder by recent accusations of nuclear spying, the
administration wants to avoid giving Congress two chances to oppose
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet reaching a deal before June now looks increasingly unlikely.
Former Prime Minister Li Peng, now chairman of the Chinese
legislature, has been leading the ranks of old-line leaders in
attacking the United States for aggression in Yugoslavia, charges
that have no direct connection to the trade talks but that
inevitably affect the flexibility of Chinese negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Li argued that the bombing had enabled Chinese
people to see ``the hypocrisy of the democracy and human rights
advocated by the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He denounced the Western view that student demonstrations in
Beijing and other cities had been orchestrated by the leadership in
order to gain better leverage in the trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said that the final areas of disagreement
with Beijing were over financial services. The Americans have
sought full rights for foreign banks operating in China to do
business in local and foreign currencies and to serve both Chinese
and foreign customers.
</P>
<P>
   Too many operating restrictions on American banks, insurers and
other financial companies are discouraging them from doing business
in China, American negotiators have said. In response, Chinese
officials maintain that making the rules even for Chinese and
foreign banks could disastrous for China.

CHINESE CONDEMNATIONS OF U.S. COULD REFLECT POLICY SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's leaders are continuing to condemn the United
States in harsh terms following the NATO attack on the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, reflecting what may be an
important shift in China's view of global politics.
</P>
<P>
   A front-page commentary in Monday's People's Daily, the official
newspaper of the governing Communist Party, said that NATO's air
assault in Yugoslavia was part of an American ``global strategy for
world hegemony.'' It charged that the United States was engaged in
``a new form of colonialism,'' using pretexts like human rights to
turn other countries into dependents.
</P>
<P>
   The article called the air campaign an ``aggressive war'' that
was ``groundless in morality or law,'' part of a plot by the United
States and its partners to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and
control all of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That portrayal of American intentions comes as China is also
telling the student demonstrators against the United States to get
back to work and urging Western companies to keep investing here.
But it contrasts with the more nuanced views expressed by leaders
here in the last two years, before NATO began its air attacks to
halt the persecution of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, President Jiang Zemin praised President Clinton and
said China was pursuing a ``strategic partnership'' with the United
States despite disagreements over human rights, Taiwan and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Even before China's Embassy was attacked by mistake on the night
of May 7, causing an outpouring of anti-American rage here, China
strongly condemned NATO's military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   NATO had bypassed the United Nations, where China has veto power
_ a sign to China that its views were not respected. China also
sees the bombing in Yugoslavia as a dangerous precedent for
possible foreign involvement in Taiwan or Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, China has said it hopes to continue
building commercial ties with the United States despite the
anti-Americanism in evidence last week as students stoned the
American Embassy here. And life has returned to normal in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's article and continued praise of a speech Jiang made
last Thursday suggest that China may adopt a more assertive stance
on international political issues.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese defense experts are depicting the bombing of the embassy
in Belgrade as the latest in a series of American steps intended to
hem China in and obstruct its rise as a major power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The eastward expansion of NATO in Europe, the strengthening of
the U.S.-Japanese military alliance in the Asian and Pacific region
and the launching of the current aggression against Yugoslavia,''
People's Daily said, ``all constitute an important step in the
United States' strategy for world hegemony.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, after eulogizing the three newspaper and news
service employees killed in the Belgrade embassy as ``revolutionary
martyrs,'' Jiang made a statement that officials have since been
instructed to study.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to keep China on the path of economic reforms. But he
also said, ``The United States continues to pursue hegemonism and
power politics, and wantonly interferes in the internal affairs of
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats here are debating whether Jiang has had a true change
of heart or is seeking to pre-empt military leaders and other
hard-liners who feel that China has been too friendly with the
United States. In either case, the official line on the United
States has changed.

 &HT;    Knicks coach gets job done as team moves on
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The game was over. New York had knocked off Pat Riley
and the Miami Heat on Sunday. And as his team celebrated on the
floor, Jeff Van Gundy was on the sideline, yelling at an official,
as if a poor call had cost his team advancement to the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   It was Van Gundy at his best: always coaching.
</P>
<P>
   He rightfully was upset that, with 0.8 seconds left, Miami's
Terry Porter received an inbounds pass, pump-faked, dribbled and
still got off a shot before the final buzzer sounded. It appeared
to be too little time for anything more than catch and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Because the shot missed, it did not matter _ to anyone but Van
Gundy, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The embattled coach whose job security might have strengthened
with the Knicks' gutty conquest in Miami has endured as difficult a
season as anyone in the NBA, so maybe he was just letting off some
compressed steam before joining the hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Van Gundy stormed off the floor looking like
the loser, flailing expletives over his shoulder about a play that
didn't matter, which was more an indication of the winner in him
than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff and I had our differences when I was there,'' said former
Knicks guard John Starks, now with the Golden State Warriors. ``But
he realized, and I realized about him that we just want to win in
the worst way. He pushed me, he coached me. And I know that's what
he did with that team because that's what he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever was wrong with the team (earlier in the season), it
wasn't because Jeff didn't coach them right. I know that. He
learned under Pat Riley, and you can see that. He'll battle for the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole season has been a battle for Van Gundy, 37. He was not
happy with the trade of Charles Oakley to Toronto for Marcus Camby,
a talented player whose grit and determination have been
questioned. And when he did not play Camby much early, Van Gundy
and Ernie Grunfeld, then the Knicks president, were at odds. When
it became clear that either or both could be fired, all kinds of
speculation spread, including a well-traveled rumor that Van Gundy
planted stories in the media to benefit him and belittle Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy would not dignify such talk, but Grunfeld ended up
getting fired by friend and Madison Square Garden president Dave
Checketts with eight games left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks struggled to make the playoffs but have upset Miami
and now face a team with which they are evenly matched. High
expectations have returned to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Van Gundy's job isn't safe just yet. In an interview
during Sunday's game, Checketts said the coach would be evaluated
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a growing sentiment that the job he's done this
season has been superlative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the very best in the league,'' Riley said. ``He's
one of the youngest and brightest, and I think right now Jeff is
showing you why he is that.''

WATSON EAGER TO RETURN TO COLONIAL AS DEFENDING CHAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Week by week, Tom Watson has tried to maintain
a stoic approach to his farewell journey through the PGA Tour
schedule.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But he admits to occasional cracks in the facade. There are days
when the emotions race, the memories overwhelm and the tear ducts
seep.
</P>
<P>
   It happened at Pebble Beach Golf Links, site of Watson's
signature stroke in a hall of fame career: a chip-in for birdie on
the 71st hole of the 1982 U.S. Open that secured a victory against
Jack Nicklaus. It happened at the Hawaiian Open, an event Watson
never won but a trip he considers an annual highlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the handwriting on the wall,'' said Watson, 49, whose
focus will shift to the Senior PGA Tour when he turns 50 on Sept.
4. ``At tournaments I've really enjoyed, I'll think, `Wow. This is
the last time I'll ever play here.' There is a little nostalgia in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But no place, in Watson's estimation, figures to trigger a
warmer inner glow than the one he will feel on the first tee
Thursday in the opening round of the MasterCard Colonial. It will
be there that Thomas Sturges Watson, winner of 34 events during a
25-year career, will likely be introduced as a defending champion
for the final time at a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Watson considers his Colonial triumph, with which he displaced
Ben Hogan as the oldest winner in tournament history, as one of the
most emotional of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be my last victory on the PGA Tour. You bet, I'm
nostalgic when I think about that,'' said Watson, who has won twice
in the past 12 seasons. ``That was a very emotional, very special
day. It was a surprise because I wasn't sure if I'd ever win
another tournament. You can't help but think that way at my age.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ability to compete out here is winding down. But you never
know when you're at the end. Sometimes, I feel like I'm at the end.
Other times, I feel like, `Bring on Tiger.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, alas, will not have Tiger Woods to kick around at the
1999 Colonial. Enticed by a six-figure appearance fee, Woods will
compete this week at a European Tour event in Heidelberg, Germany.
Watson, on the other hand, hopes to collect a six-figure paycheck
the old-fashioned way: with a victory on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to do my best to fire one more parting shot,'' said
Watson, winner of eight major championships, including five British
Open titles. ``I want to beat these kids one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he knows that the deck appears stacked against him.
Slowed by a shoulder injury that required a cortisone injection in
April, Watson hasn't cracked the top 10 at a PGA Tour event this
season. He hasn't survived the cut at a major championship since
the 1997 British Open. But at Colonial, for one final fling, he
will be The Man.
</P>
<P>
   When September arrives, Watson might become the first
professional golfer to threepeat the Fort Worth-Dallas area as a
two-tour competitor in the same season. Watson, who participated
last week in the GTE Byron Nelson Classic, will be eligible to
participate in the area's new Senior PGA Tour event, the Bank One
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 17-19 event at Bent Tree Country Club in Dallas could
mark Watson's debut on the 50-and-older circuit. The Colonial champ
said he is undecided on his schedule for 1999 Senior PGA Tour
events. But he expressed plans to curtail a typical fall schedule
that leans heavily toward bird hunting in favor of trying to bag
more birdies on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   No one was happier to hear that news than Bruce Edwards,
Watson's caddie for most of 25 seasons as a PGA Tour participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to his age, it's tough trying to beat these
22-year-olds whose nerves are a little better than his,'' Edwards
said. ``There's no question he'll do very well on the Senior Tour.
Once he gets that feeling of winning again consistently, like he
had 20 years ago, he'll be off and running. I'm looking at the end
of this season and next year being similar to 1977, when he started
to dominate the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1977-82, Watson won 26 tournaments, an average of 4.3 per
season. Senior Tour participants do not question that it's possible
Watson could double that number in his first full season on a
circuit in which Hale Irwin won 16 events in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Tom raises the bar out here,'' said David Graham, a
Dallas resident in his fourth season on the Senior PGA Tour. ``When
he tees it up, a lot of other guys will start playing for second. I
expect him to have a big, big impact.''
</P>
<P>
   But September, and anticipated Senior PGA Tour success, must
wait. For four months, Watson must contend with the flatbellies on
the PGA Tour. And he must defend one more title, this week at
Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like I can compete, especially at a course where
I'm comfortable, like Colonial,'' said Watson, who boasts the best
career scoring average (69.96) of any competitor who has played in
at least 20 Colonials. ``Now, for Tom Watson, we let the chips fall
where they may. Certainly, it would be nice to go out strong.'' nn

U.S. ARRESTS AUSTRALIAN IN SPY CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By   DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former Australian military intelligence analyst
was charged Monday with trying to sell more than 700 highly
classified American defense documents to an undercover FBI agent
who posed as an overseas spy, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian was identified by the federal authorities as
Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, 28, who worked in Canberra for the
Australian Defense Intelligence Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In his job, an FBI affidavit unsealed Monday said, he had access
to ``top secret and sensitive compartmented'' military papers from
the United States, which he sought to sell to an unidentified
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit alleges that Wispelaere obtained $120,000 from the
FBI in exchange for the classified documents. The Australian
intelligence organization had obtained them under treaties with the
United States that grant close allies access to American military
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Wispelaere was arrested on Saturday as he arrived at Dulles
International Airport on a flight from London for a meeting with
the undercover agent.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of attempted espionage, Wispelaere could receive a
maximum penalty of life in prison _ or death if certain conditions
are met, for example if the material he is accused of trying to
sell was related to nuclear secrets or military spacecraft. He also
could be fined up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest followed an investigation by the FBI, the Australian
Security Intelligence Organization and the Australian Federal
Police, the justice department said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials said Monday that Wispelaere
had been motivated by financial gain rather than ideology. In one
tape-recorded conversation, the officials said, he told an
undercover FBI agent that in late 1998 he had ``a very dire, dire
financial need.''
</P>
<P>
   He was employed at the Australian intelligence agency for less
than six months, from July 13, 1998, to Jan. 12, 1999. Five days
after leaving, the affidavit said, Wispelaere walked into the
embassy of an unidentified country in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Wispelaere told embassy officials that he was an American. Using
the name Jeff Baker, he identified himself as an employee of the
U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He produced a brown paper envelope. Inside it, the affidavit
charges, was an American military document, classified secret,
which related to another foreign country, and a list of classified
documents that he was prepared to sell. Wispelaere also is said to
have written his e-mail address on the envelope for use as a
contact if the embassy wanted to buy additional documents.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the government of the country
that Wispelaere had approached had tipped off American officials,
who immediately set up a sting operation.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 19 an FBI agent posing as an intelligence official from
that country contacted Wispelaere using the e-mail address. The
agent asked for additional biographical information and sought
information on how best to conduct clandestine communications.
</P>
<P>
   Wispelaere responded that he was self-employed but had unlimited
access to material like the document he provided at the embassy
meeting in January, federal documents say. He went on, ``Although I
have unfettered access to such material, practical exigencies mean
that I would be able to offer my product only twice a year or
thereabouts,'' the affidavit says.
</P>
<P>
   The government charges that after a series of e-mail messages,
Wispelaere met with the undercover agent on April 3 in a hotel in
Bangkok, carrying a backpack filled with classified documents. The
agent gave Wispelaere $70,000 as a down payment for the secret
papers, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Wispelaere mailed more classified documents to the
undercover agent at a post office box in Virginia in exchange for
$50,000, the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI affidavit said some of the documents ``could cause
serious and exceptionally grave damage to the U.S. national
security if disclosed to unauthorized entities.''

SPENDING BILL FULL OF PORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mississippi, Alaska, Utah, Pennsylvania, West Virginia)  (dal) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A little item temporarily attached itself, like a
barnacle riding a whale, to the $15-billion emergency spending deal
lashed together by congressional negotiators last week.
</P>
<P>
   Buried in the bill was $8.1 million to repair a storm-battered
Army National Guard armory. The public draft of the bill never said
the armory was in Gulfport, Miss., home state of Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, who requested the money.
</P>
<P>
   But the item vanished sometime between late Thursday night, when
the negotiators struck a deal, and late Friday night, when printers
struck the proofs of the daily Congressional Record, containing the
first public version of the bill in final form, said Senate and
House aides.
</P>
<P>
   It was a case of ``hot pork, cold feet,'' a Democratic aide
said. The spending for the armory had been erased at Lott's
request. ``Lott thought he'd show some leadership by asking for his
own little project to go,'' said a senior Republican aide.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's little project was not the only provision inserted into
the emergency bill without public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs flow from outbursts of altruism and opportunism
peculiar to Congress. The emergency spending bill, which helps
finance not only the war in Yugoslavia but disaster relief in the
Americas, is a perfect vehicle for them. Since the big bill, which
comes to the House floor for a vote on Tuesday, must pass, little
riders hop onto it. The process has been compared to feeding the
horses to feed the pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said, ``Senator Lott is doing
everything in his power to make sure the bill is as clean and
skinny as possible.'' Democratic aides said Lott withdrew the money
after reporters inquired about it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lott and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois urged
the Senate and House conferees to stick to the basics in the
emergency bill. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee,
Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., worked to keep it free of riders and
amendments offered by House and Senate appropriators.
</P>
<P>
   The money ``is all about helping people,'' Young said. But if
the bill is passed as printed, its beneficiaries will include some
people beyond Pentagon personnel and victims of war and disaster.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, home of Sen. Ted Stevens, the Republican chairman of
the Senate Appropriations Committee, commercial fishermen get $26
million to compensate them for federal fishing restrictions, and
commercial reindeer ranchers get $3 million to protect them from
deaths in their herds.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, home of the Republican Sen. Robert F. Bennett, Salt
Lake City gets $2.2 million for sewers for the 2002 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, House pages get $3.76 million to redo their
dormitory, and the local airports get $30 million for renovations.
</P>
<P>
   In North Union Township in Pennsylvania, in the district of Rep.
John Murtha, a senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, the
local government gets to keep an unstated amount of leftover money
from a federally financed land-development project.
</P>
<P>
   One provision that, like Lott's armory money, appeared and then
disappeared into thin air, would have authorized the secretary of
the Air Force to lease up to six Gulfstream V executive jets for
nine of the nation's most senior generals and admirals.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force and congressional estimates placed the cost of the
lease at $478 million or more over 10 years. The House-Senate
conference did not debate the provision last week, and its public
working papers did not mention the Gulfstream jets by name or spell
out their potential costs.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican appropriations committee aide said the request for
the lease became ``a hot issue,'' given the original intent of the
military spending bill: financing the bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The unpublished Senate draft of the bill specified that a new
prison be built in West Virginia, home state of Sen. Robert C.
Byrd, the Appropriations Committee's ranking Democrat. The printed
version says ``a mid-Atlantic state'' will get the prison.
</P>
<P>
   The $15-billion bill going to the House floor on Tuesday grew
from President Clinton's requests for more than $7 billion for
military and refugee-relief operations in the Balkans and
disaster-assistance for hurricane victims in Central America and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the $15 billion will finance NATO's military
operations in Yugoslavia. Another third will go to the Pentagon for
programs added by congressional negotiators, including a
$1.84-billion package of military pay and pension increases,
covering generals and admirals as well as privates and seamen. The
pay increase still must be authorized by Congress, and its final
form could change.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees from Kosovo and the survivors of last year's hurricanes
in Central America and the Caribbean each will receive aid packages
of about $1 billion. American victims of tornadoes, storms and
floods will receive about $900 million. American farmers crippled
by low prices will get $547 million, $422 million more than Clinton
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Despite threatening a veto if the bill strayed beyond providing
for the needs of war and disaster, Clinton has indicated he will
sign it if Congress approves it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hasan Yildiz has never visited a friend's house because he has
never had a friend. He has never dated, either. And he never goes
to bars, restaurants or ball games because his chest tightens and
he breaks into a sweat when he is around people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a loner by choice,'' said Yildiz, a 19-year-old
freshman at Bronx Community College who rarely goes beyond
``hello'' in interactions with his classmates. ``I like being with
people, but I always get scared and nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Yildiz suffers from an extreme form of shyness called social
phobia. First formally identified in 1980, social phobia ranks
today as the third most prevalent psychiatric disorder in the
United States after substance abuse and depression, affecting an
estimated 19 million Americans, according to the Anxiety Disorders
Association of America. Many are too bashful even to talk to
therapists. Yildiz himself backed out of an appointment to have his
photo taken, saying he did not want his classmates to see him in
the paper.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't require group interaction to pop a pill. And just
as the pharmaceutical industry has introduced medicines in recent
years to alleviate such common afflictions as obesity, baldness and
sexual impotence, it now sees a huge market in social anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, companies do not have to spend huge sums to develop a
new blockbuster drug to do the job. SmithKline Beecham P.L.C. won
approval lasy week from the Food and Drug Administration to market
its antidepressant Paxil for social phobia. And other companies are
close behind. Solvay S.A. of Belgium is conducting pilot trials in
the United States of its drug Luvox, which it already sells under a
different name in the United Kingdom to treat the ailment.
Likewise, the American Home Products Corp. plans to begin clinical
trials for its antidepressant Effexor for the same purpose, and
Pfizer Inc. is experimenting with its Zoloft.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts view social phobia as the latest battleground for
the antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. They believe the three leading drugs of this family _
Paxil, Zoloft and Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s Prozac _ can be used almost
interchangeably, making their manufacturers eager to find new uses
for them to make them stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure how much money is to be made from social phobia
medication _ but 19 million is a lot of people, representing about
7 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire mental health sector is at a stage where
cardiovascular diseases were at 20 years ago,'' said Stephen Scala,
a pharmaceutical analyst with S.G. Cowen Securities. ``There is
still a lot we do not know about these mental disorders. We are at
the very early stages of another big market opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Awareness of the malady's prevalence came slowly to the
industry. Dr. Michael Liebowitz, director of the Anxiety Disorders
Clinic in New York and a consultant to pharmaceutical companies,
said that in the early 1980s, studies indicated that only 2 percent
to 3 percent of the population suffered from social phobia. But a
decade later, he said, researchers were finding that the number was
closer to 8 percent or 9 percent. At that point, he said,
drugmakers started conducting clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 5 percent of the population that suffers from social
phobia is receiving treatment,'' said Bonnie Rossello, a vice
president with SmithKline Beecham's neuroscience division. ``This
disorder is very pervasive, but it is underdiagnosed and
undertreated.''
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers fear that in addition to social phobia, milder
forms of shyness are also going to grow. They say that the
increasing dependency on technology is creating a socially awkward
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are growing up with few opportunities for social
interactions,'' said Philip Zimbardo, a psychology professor at
Stanford University who started the Stanford Shyness Research
Program in the early 1970s. ``The cousins, uncles and aunts with
whom children practiced social skills are no longer around.
Moreover, an increasingly technological society has reduced human
interaction. There is more interface with ATM's, answering machines
and the Internet than with human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   But are drugs the answer? A lot of therapists don't think so.
They fear that many Americans suffering from ordinary shyness might
seek solace in prescription medication. Better, they insist, to
confront the problem the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much easier to pop a pill; it is tough to do therapy,''
said Dr. Jonathan Berent, a psychologist who runs a shyness
institute in Great Neck, N.Y. ``Shy people have to go through scary
social situations week after week when they come for therapy.''
Berent criticizes drugs as too easy an alternative, adding, ``Once
patients discontinue the drugs there will be a relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a cottage industry of psychotherapy has sprouted to ease
the social anxieties of the seriously shy. Whereas help groups were
almost nonexistent a decade ago, at least 15 major institutes and
100 support organizations cater to victims of the disorder today,
according to mental health specialists. In addition, more than
1,000 therapists with expertise in the field are listed with either
the Association for Advancement of Behavior Therapy or the Anxiety
Disorders Association of America.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In Palo Alto, Calif., Lynne Henderson, a social psychologist,
runs a center called the Shyness Clinic for easing the
apprehensions of bashful Silicon Valley professionals. Participants
go through a 26-week therapy program and are given a thorough
rubdown on such social skills as how to make eye contact, how to
edit out embarrassing pauses in conversations and how to pick up
the phone and actually set a date to do something with somebody.
They also get homework assignments that include commenting on the
weather to strangers in the supermarket and saying hello to 10
people at an office party.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henderson, who charges $440 to $880 for diagnostic tests,
$60 for group sessions and $110 an hour for telephone
consultations, is a staunch advocate of therapy as the first line
of defense against shyness. ``We offer a social fitness model where
we emphasize that everybody needs to get in shape,'' she said. ``If
we see it as a disorder, it will be much tougher to get people to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, Dr. Thomas A. Richards is tapping into the shyness
market with entrepreneurial zeal. His Anxiety Clinic offers
sessions of games and exercises aimed at motivating patients to be
more outgoing. In one of them, called the Circle of Death,
participants go around the room introducing themselves to one
another. Patients have a choice between sessions lasting nearly two
hours and those lasting all day; the latter are videotaped and
played back to show participants how they are performing.
</P>
<P>
   Richards' price ranges from a few hundred dollars for
abbreviated programs to $6,860 for an intensive four-week course
for out-of-towners, though he lowers some fees based on income
levels. He is also preparing a set of instructional audio cassettes
that he plans to sell for $350.
</P>
<P>
   For some, therapy is a godsend. Barry Greenblatt, a 39-year-old
supervisor with the New York City Police Department's 911 emergency
line, recently completed a 10-week session at the West Side Social
and Performance Anxiety Workshop and plans to keep taking the $250
course until he overcomes his extreme shyness.
</P>
<P>
   Greenblatt said he had had a limited social life and found it
difficult to get a date because of his habit of staring fixedly at
people while they talk. ``Two years ago I felt that I had to do
something about this,'' he said. ``I felt that there was no need to
go on living if I could not get over this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the MCP Hahnemann University in Philadelphia, a treatment
program for adolescents is being offered without charge, financed
by a $600,000 grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.
``We are networking with schools here so that the kids can be
identified early on,'' said Dr. James Herbert, assistant professor
of psychology. ``The problem, however, is that teachers notice only
the acting-out kids. The shy ones are just not visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Visible or not, more and more companies are seeing the profit
potential of shyness. Studies by Zimbardo of Stanford University
and by Bernardo Carducci, director of the Shyness Research
Institute of Indiana University Southeast, indicate that 40 percent
to 50 percent of all Americans are shy.
</P>
<P>
   That is too large a market for publishers to ignore.
HarperCollins has just published ``Shyness: A Bold New Approach:
The Latest Findings Plus Practical Steps For Finding Your Comfort
Zone,'' by Carducci. And Simon &AMP; Schuster has come out with ``How I
Overcame Shyness: 101 Celebrities Share Their Secrets,'' edited by
Gary Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies argue that the two basic approaches to
treating social phobia _ therapy and drugs _ can coexist and in
some cases complement each other. They insist that antidepressants
should not be used for all forms of shyness, just for the severe
variety.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge lies in diagnosing the condition. Psychologists
and the sufferers themselves are constantly grappling with the
question of where shyness ends and social phobia begins. The rule
of thumb is that social phobia seriously impairs normal
functioning.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry has started a campaign to make
physicians and the general public aware of the distinction _ and of
the availability of drugs for the clinical cases. SB Pharmaceutical
has provided a grant of an unspecified sum to the Coalition on
Social Anxiety Disorders for a public awareness campaign with the
theme ``Imagine being allergic to people.'' The coalition members _
the Anxiety Disorders Association of America, the American
Psychiatric Association and a New York advocacy organization called
Freedom From Fear _ are also circulating a videocassette among
physicians describing the symptoms of social phobia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, research into the condition continues. The National
Institute of Mental Health has been financing research at
universities and private clinics to study the efficacy of therapy,
drugs and a combination of drugs and therapy for treating social
phobia. And the New York State Psychiatric Institute is studying
the relationship between social phobia and stuttering.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from damaging people's self-esteem and robbing them of
friendships and the pleasures of everyday intermingling, social
phobia can be a career-killer. ``You typically have people
performing much below their potential,'' said Herbert of MCP
Hahnemann University. ``I had an Ivy League school graduate who
took to delivering candy to vending machines because he thought
that job did not require interaction with people. That is when you
need intervention.''

 &UR; PHANTOMBIZ _  &LR; George Lucas's new ``Star Wars _ Episode One: The
Phantom Menace'' is sure to be a huge moneymaker, maybe even the
biggest grossing movie of all time. But even if Lucas doesn't sell
a single ticket, he's already more than made up the cost of
production through various toy and book licensing deals. This was
Lucas's genius from the beginning: In 1977, he sold the first movie
to Twentieth Century Fox, but kept the merchandising rights.

<P>
   WEINING, China _ Deep in the ravaged mountains of southwest
China, one of nature's jewels improbably endures, a shallow grassy
lake that is a crucial wintering ground for dozens of species of
migratory waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
   Declared a protected reserve by China, the lake and its
surroundings seemed tranquil on a recent morning as families of
rare black-necked cranes picked their way through the marshes,
surrounded by gabbling flocks of ruddy shelducks and bar-headed
geese. The occasional fisherman poled a skiff through the reeds.
</P>
<P>
   But the solitude was deceptive on this remote lake known as Cao
Hai, situated three hours up slippery mountain roads from the
nearest train stop in Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
   A large and growing population of desperately poor farmers wants
nothing more than to convert the rich marshes into farm plots,
making Cao Hai one of the most acute examples anywhere of a
mounting worldwide problem: the competition between people and
wildlife for scarce natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   In a creative effort to ease the conflict, Guizhou conservation
officials, with aid from American groups, are providing loans to
help some of those land-short farmers develop new sources of income
_ money to buy chickens to resell in town, or for tools to make
stoves out of discarded cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying our best to prolong the life of this lake,'' said
Guan Yuhe, a reserve official. ``I know that in many countries
parks are closed off to people, but that's impossible here.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truce remains uneasy, and the effort to save nature here
reveals the difficulties Beijing faces in remote spots when it
tries to impose its social policies _ whether birth control,
compulsory education or wildlife conservation.
</P>
<P>
   The hills around Cao Hai are anything but serene. Studded with
the hulks of backyard zinc smelters abandoned by government fiat
only last year, much of the watershed would probably qualify in
Western countries as a hazardous-waste site. Denuded slopes send
topsoil into the lake, and the town of Weining pours in half its
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   The main threat, though, comes from some 30,000 people living
around the lake. These are some of China's most wretchedly poor:
families that get by on what corn and potatoes they grow on a small
fraction of an acre, plus the odd menial job.
</P>
<P>
   They are nearly all illiterate, and often cannot even afford a
radio. Couples bear four, even five or six children each and send
fewer than half of them to school. As they see it, their biggest
need is more cropland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here would be happy if they would drain the lake,''
said a man in the hamlet of Bojiwan. As it is, in a cat-and-mouse
game with guards, villagers are constantly trying to dig up the
marshes.
</P>
<P>
   Cao Hai _ the name, pronounced tsow-high, means sea of grass _
already bears the scars of Chinese Communist history. Until the
late 1950s, this lake 7,000 feet high in the mountains was a prime
habitat for migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1958 came Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward, when China was
supposed to produce grain on every available acre. Under Mao's
urgent command to conquer nature, the newly formed communes dug
channels for partly draining the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1972, amid the frenzy of the Cultural Revolution,
officials tried to drain it entirely. The transformed land would
yield so much bounty that ``even the sows will wear gold
earrings,'' an official promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results were not what people had envisaged,'' said Hong
Shouli, director of Guizhou's Nature Protection Department, in the
provincial capital, Guiyang.
</P>
<P>
   Only one-fourth of the drained land proved suitable for
agriculture, Hong said. At the same time, the surrounding water
table began to drop, insect plagues and seasonal flooding worsened
and dust storms blew. Surrounding communities asserted, improbably,
that draining the lake was causing droughts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Chinese scientists concluded that the lake should be
restored, and in 1982 officials built a dam and started refilling
Cao Hai.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery was astounding, and in 1985 the lake and
surrounding watershed were declared a national reserve _ one of
hundreds in China's ambitious if overstretched effort to save
natural diversity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the lake has been host to more than 400 of the
birds that are its claim to fame, the black-necked cranes, a 10th
of the global population. A total of 184 bird species have been
sighted on the lake.
</P>
<P>
   But this victory for nature was not widely applauded by local
villagers, who seem to have sharper memories of land lost than of
ecological disasters.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I think our life here was best when they dried up Cao Hai,''
said 76-year-old Pan Caoyi of Bojiwan, which lost half its cropland
when the lake was refilled. ``Then there was more land for us, and
we could raise more livestock and make more money.''
</P>
<P>
   With little local industry, most families are dependent on
minuscule plots for subsistence, lucky to have a cash income of
$100 or $200 a year from temporary jobs or raising a few pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Their desperation and the quandary facing conservation officers
were both evident on a boat ride through Cao Hai: the waters are
crisscrossed with illegal fine-mesh nets, capturing the same shrimp
and minnows the birds like to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' said Guan, the reserve official, ``we tried
mobilizing the police to confiscate the nets and burn them on the
shore. We found this created too many conflicts with the local
villagers.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1994, with aid from the International Crane Foundation in
Wisconsin and the Trickle-Up Program in New York, officials tried a
strategy involving more carrot than stick. It includes employment
for reserve guards, ecological education and aid for school fees.
But the core is the program of small grants and loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial phase, more than 400 small grants were doled out
to some of the poorest families to enable them to create businesses
like selling produce or raising pigs or chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Zhao Zinglin, a recently widowed mother of five, used her grant
last year to buy a dozen chickens a couple of days each week, then
take them by bus into town to resell. Her daily profit, she said,
ranged from $1.20 to $4.80.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Zhao lives in Lingjiao hamlet, which lost more than half
its farmland when the lake was refilled. ``When business is good we
eat meat maybe twice a month,'' she said, ``and when it's bad we go
two or three months without.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote long-term development, the aid project is now
providing seed money for what are known as perpetual community
funds, in which groups of people join together and provide
three-month loans to a few members at a time, using the moderate
interest charged to build up the fund. So far the loan program has
had a remarkably good repayment record.
</P>
<P>
   For people living on the edge, small loans can go far. Zhu
Tianwei, 53, a blacksmith in Lingjiao, said his recent $12 loan had
enabled him to buy new tools and an anvil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I didn't have the right tools to make items like these
boat nails,'' he said as he hammered on red-hot bits of metal.
``Now I can make as much as $1.50 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The loan funds and other aid programs are popular, but how far
they can transform these villages and reduce the pressure on the
lake remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the loans are used to create self-sustaining businesses.
Li Shoufen, a 43-year-old mother of four, borrowed $30 last fall _
and used it to help pay her children's school fees.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Li and her husband, Zhu Guiyong, 47, share their small
house with his aged parents, the four children and six pigs. The
family lost 90 percent of its cropland when the lake was refilled
in 1983, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was much better back then,'' he said. ``We had a lot more
land and no children.''  &QL;

JUSTICES TO DECIDE WHETHER STATES CAN SELL DRIVER'S LICENSE DATA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide
whether the federal government may order states not to sell
personal information gleaned from driver's licence applications to
companies and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, amid reports that a killer collected data about his
victim from an application, enacted the 1994 Driver's Privacy
Protection Act to bar states from selling the information. But
South Carolina challenged the law as an unconstitutional
infringement on the right of states to administer their records as
they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to hear arguments in the case, Reno
vs. Condon, this fall or early next year and render their decision
by July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial federal law prohibits any state motor-vehicle
agency from ``knowingly'' disclosing or making available to people
or companies ``personal information about any individual obtained
by the department in connection with a motor-vehicle record.''
Exceptions to the law permit states to provide information for a
``state-authorized purpose relating to the operation of a motor
vehicle or public safety'' or to give the data to
automobile-insurance firms and towing companies after a car has
been impounded.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law after it was revealed that Rebecca
Schaeffer's killer, Robert John Bardo, was able in 1989 to track
down the California home address of the television actress through
state motor-vehicle records.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina challenged the law's constitutionality, winning
in both a federal district court and then in the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals. The 4th Circuit called the federal restriction on
the state dissemination of driver's license information
inconsistent ``with the system of dual sovereignty established by
the Constitution'' between the federal and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   In successfully urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, the
Clinton administration said the federal law is necessary to protect
the privacy of citizens who seek only a license to drive.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Solicitor General Seth Waxman, the administration's chief
lawyer before the high court, noted that data, which can be gleaned
from driver's license applications, include the name, address and
telephone numbers of motorists, many of whom might otherwise seek
to keep that information private by refusing to list it in
telephone directories. In some cases, the information can also
contain a photograph of the motorist as well as his or her Social
Security number and medical information bearing on the person's
ability to drive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of driver's license records can also be quite lucrative
for states, as New York in one recent year earned $17 million from
individuals and businesses who sought access to the information,
Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   In other high court news, the justices on Monday upheld by a 7-2
vote the constitutionality of a Florida law that permits police
without a warrant to seize and search automobiles suspected of
having been used in the commission of a crime. Writing for the
majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said the Fourth Amendment's
prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures does not apply to
suspect cars parked in public places because the police must act
fast before the cars are driven away.

3 ONLINE BOOK RETAILERS CUT PRICES ON BEST SELLERS
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (ms) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an escalating battle of the books, Amazon.com Inc., the
online retailer, cut the prices on best-selling books by 50 percent
Monday, a move that was matched hours later by its Internet rivals,
Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com, all of whom will almost
certainly lose money on the bargain rates.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's price-cutting comes during a rather auspicious time for
its No. 2 rival, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc., which has imminent plans for
a public offering of its Internet unit within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But a company spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon.com said the
timing of its discounts on books from The New York Times
best-seller lists was a matter of coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things that drive this business,'' said Bill
Curry, a spokesman for Amazon. ``It's selection, price and
convenience. And we are constantly working on all three of these
things. We've added convenience with distribution centers that will
get merchandise faster to customers. And this is an opportunity to
do something with price.''
</P>
<P>
   With a flurry of announcements on Monday, the three electronic
booksellers announced virtually identical plans to cut the prices
of hardcovers and paperbacks appearing on The Times best-seller
lists. That amounts to deep discounts on about 70 titles in any
given week.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, publishers offer books to retailers for less than
half of the list price, which means that the electronic rivals will
be losing money with these discounts on best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not seem to deter the major booksellers, who
offered similar reasons for plunging ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to remain competitive in the marketplace,'' said
Leonard Riggio, the chairman and chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble,
who added that Amazon has ``changed their prices in the middle of a
public offering for Barnesandnoble.com and that speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   With a certain element of distaste, Borders.com, a unit of
Borders Group Inc., also announced a price-cut. ``I have to tell
you that this is not the battlefield that we think we're going to
win on in the long run,'' said Rich Fahle, a spokesman for
Borders.com. ``But we're not going to let this distinguish us from
the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the booksellers set any particular time limits on the 50
percent discounts. And, in fact, Amazon was issuing refunds on the
difference in price to customers who bought best-selling books
shortly before its announcement of the discounts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kate Delhagen, director of online retail strategies for
Forrester Research Inc., a technology research firm, said the
outbreak of discounting was not particularly surprising given new
competitive pressures.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of new companies that are helping book buyers
to compare prices through Web site services such as Add All that
instantly list shipping and title costs for major booksellers. For
example, Monday that site compared the prices for more than 24
bookstores and prominently listed Amazon for offering the best
price for the best-selling children's novel, ``Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone.'' The list price is $16.95, but with the discount
and a shipping charge, Amazon was selling the title for $12.43.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using these comparison tools,'' Ms. Delhagen said.
``And what Amazon is doing is making sure that they are there. It's
definitely a defensive strategy being deployed, but it's also part
of their increasing energy to add customers to their database.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry, Amazon's spokesman, declined to say whether the company
would lose money on the 50 percent discounts. ``We're just not
talking about whether we're selling at a profit or a loss,'' he
said. However, Curry said Amazon has decreased its reliance on book
distributors and was dealing more directly with publishers. Those
efficiencies have resulted in increased savings that Amazon is now
passing along to its customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that the discounts were not a reaction to the
activities of competitors. ``We don't fancy ourselves with the
competition,'' he said. ``We're focused on our customers as opposed
to what the competition is doing.'' &QL;

What will Colonial's tournament look like in 2099? (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: From equipment to economics, the golf industry
faces several issues that could lead to major changes in the game
and the PGA Tour in the 21st century. How might they affect the
MasterCard Colonial? Join us as we peer into our dimpled, crystal
ball and check out final-round coverage of Fort Worth's annual tour
stop, circa 2099.
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Keeping alive a family tradition, Davis Love VI
collected the latest plaid jacket among a group of golfers who have
four generations of Colonial blazers in their respective closets.
</P>
<P>
   Love achieved his record-breaking triumph in a most
untraditional manner, however. Under the warm glow of floodlights
erected for the first night finish in the tournament's 153-year
history, he overpowered Colonial Country Club with a controversial
driver that is being investigated by U.S. Golf Association
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Love, 37, is the first player to successfully harness the new
Plutonic driver, which propels shots off the club face with the
explosiveness of plutonium but without the radioactive
repercussions. Combining the metal-headed club with an Elastiphite
shaft, a graphite-elastic mixture that permits wraparound
backswings and generates excessive clubhead speeds, Love routinely
blasted 400-yard drives during a closing round of 56 at the
American Airlines-Alcon-MasterCard Colonial presented by Rolaids
and Pace Picante Sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Love's score, the lowest recorded at a professional golf
tournament, allowed him to come from 10 strokes off the pace to nip
third-round leader Leopard Woods by one shot. The victory was
Love's first in five years at a Samsung-Microsoft Global Golf Tour
event and sparked controversy about more than his choice of clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, great-grandson of five-time Masters champ Tiger Woods,
was assessed a pivotal two-stroke penalty on the 14th hole in the
final round. Videotapes taken from the ``caddie cam'' atop the
Robocaddie that carries Woods' clubs clearly show that the player
improperly grounded his wedge in his haste to hit from one of the
quicksand traps installed in 2076 to make scoring conditions more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, however, disputed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get it out of there quick, before the ball gurgled
beneath the surface. But I was sure I didn't touch my club to the
ground before I hit,'' Woods said. ``This is really disappointing.
I should have won this tournament. I just couldn't catch a break
from the rules official. I guess the Woods name doesn't carry the
same clout out here that it once did. `Gramps' told me that when he
missed a fairway, they used to move boulders for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday at Colonial, the primary mover was Love, who bagged 10
birdies and two eagles in mounting the greatest final-round
comeback in tour history. Playing under the lights to allow for a
10 p.m. finish, as mandated by the tour's new $64 billion network
television contract, ``created a few more shadows, but nothing I
couldn't handle,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of a tailwind, Love drove the green at No. 5, a
560-yard par-4 with a new tee box in Forest Park that forces
golfers to hit over vehicles traveling south on Rogers Road. He
rolled home a 70-foot eagle putt at No. 11, a par-5 that features
the Incredi-cup, an electronic device that keeps the diameter of
the hole in constant flux _ varying between normal size and the
width of one golf ball _ while players putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timed it perfect,'' said Love, who set a tournament scoring
record (22-under par) in addition to his single-round mark. ``The
hole widened out right as my ball got there. This was unbelievable.
I caught every break I could. I'm still pinching myself to make
sure it's not a dream. I've never had a day like this. No one
has.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, he said, was ``extremely emotional'' because the
first three golfers named Davis Love to etch their names on
Colonial's Wall of Champions were in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Included was Davis Love III, the player's 135-year-old
great-grandfather who is among the first wave of benefactors from
scientific research in 2020 that discovered that the wonder drug
Viagra, if taken with ginseng root and bee pollen, slows the aging
process in adult males to 1/100th the normal rate. The elder Love
competes on the Super Senior Tour, where the minimum age for
participants is 95.
</P>
<P>
   But this day belonged to the latest Love namesake, who shed
tears as club officials draped the same plaid jacket across his
shoulders that his great-grandfather first wore in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-six years later, it's still the ugliest jacket on tour.
But I've always wanted one,'' Love said. ``I remember when I was
little, Dad would wear his when he took me trick-or-treating. All
the neighbors would laugh their heads off. But I thought it was
neat. It made for some special memories.''
</P>
<P>
   With the $6.8 million winner's check, Love said, he plans to buy
``some matching pants.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he is unconcerned about a USGA probe of the
Plutonic driver, a club that debuted this season but which few
players have been able to control as well as Love. The 12-year
touring pro split 13 of 14 fairways and averaged 402.3 yards per
drive in the final round. Love hit no approach shots with a club
longer than a 9-iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a secret to hitting it,'' Love said. ``I just figured
it out this week. But I'm going to be like Ben Hogan. I'm not
sharing my secret with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   USGA officials have said they will add the Plutonic driver,
which features a head made of a metallic mixture of nonradioactive
plutonium, titanium, chromium, barium and calcium, to the list of
clubs being studied to determine whether the club face produces too
much of a ``springlike effect'' at impact. The probe has been
ongoing since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see them outlawing it,'' Love said. ``They've never
won a major court case against a manufacturer yet. Until someone
yanks it out of my hands, I intend to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday at Colonial, he used it to move into the tour record
books. And to continue a family tradition. nn

OBSESSION WITH LONG DISTANCE DRIVES TODAY'S GAME

   ``Drive for show
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   _ ancient golf wisdom
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit it long
</P>
<P>
   And you can't go wrong''
</P>
<P>
   _ modern golf thinking
FORT WORTH, Texas _ In 1980, Dan Pohl led the PGA Tour in driving
distance with an average poke of 274.3 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the ball that far in 1999 and you will find yourself about
34 yards behind the drives of PGA Tour distance leader, John Daly,
whose average whack pushes up toward 309. The game's top players,
David Duval and Tiger Woods, each drive it about 290 yards on
average.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Hale Irwin averaged 250 yards a drive and
still won a U.S. Open. Hit it 250 these days and you'll need a cart
to catch up to your playing partners.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the game has changed. Everyone's hitting it longer, if
not always straighter, but who cares? Distance is everything, or so
it seems, even to the high-handicap weekend player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to hit it from the back tees these days,''
says David Bridges, who has been playing golf for 50 years and
teaching it for 20, including his stint at Randol Mill Golf Center
in Fort Worth. ``If I had a sign up that said I can teach you how
to hit it farther, and a guy down the street had a sign that said
he'd teach you to hit it straighter, they'd all come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's responsible for this obsession with long drives? Golfers
cite club and ball manufacturers who try to increase sales by
developing and promoting equipment they say will add yards. Others
cite television's influence, noting that Daly's ``grip it and rip
it'' philosophy is seductive even to duffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can just see all the blood running out of their fingers,''
Bridges says.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for yardage off the tee is the subject of countless
instructional videos and books. In the May issue of ``Golf Digest''
alone, several articles including the cover story deal with how to
hit it farther.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: One teaching pro offered thoughts on how to hit it ``10
more yards.'' In ``Tiger Tips,'' long-bomber Woods suggests that
golfers widen their stance ``when you really want to crush it.''
Another piece, ``How to buy more distance,'' offers suggestions on
what clubs will help you hit it farther.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's cover boy Jason Zuback, the three-time reigning
national long drive champion, who is shown in an inside photo
spread, frame by frame, as he grips it and rips it. It's a hack
Mark McGwire would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Distance isn't a bad thing, of course. For one, it allows you to
hit beyond troublesome traps and over water. Also, it can make for
shorter, easier approach shots, the kind that allow you to hit the
ball high and soft, and to drop it close to the pin giving you a
better chance on the greens.
</P>
<P>
   That's assuming you hit it straight, though, and that's assuming
a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Penneman of Arlington, a competitor in long-distance drive
events, typically hits it well beyond 300 yards, and when all
conditions are right can push it up to about 400 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he says, ``I'd give up 25 yards if I could put it in the
fairway 50 percent more often.''
</P>
<P>
   Penneman said he sees the pros and cons of hitting it so far. On
the plus side, he says, his length carries through the bag: he can
hit a 1-iron 270 yards so he'll play that straighter club in lieu
of a driver on many holes, giving him the best of both worlds. His
prodigious blasts also earn him regular invitations to scramble
events where, he says, partners and competitors ``ooh and ahh''
about his smashes over the practice range fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit it 250 and straight all day and nobody will watch you,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Pavlet, a long-drive competitor from Phoenix who once sent
one 462 yards, said: ``It's like in baseball. Tony Gwynn has
probably been the best hitter in the game. But he doesn't have the
mystique of McGwire or Sammy Sosa. Everybody wants to see the
Waveland Avenue \Rstreet beyond the outfield fence in Chicago's
Wrigley Field\S ball.''
</P>
<P>
   On the PGA Tour, too, length has been a sticky issue.
Traditionalists fear that many revered older and shorter courses
will be rendered obsolete as pros find they are able to fly over
obstacles en route to record-smashing scores. Woods' taming of
Augusta National a couple years ago fueled such paranoia. There has
been much debate about restricting club and ball technology so
munchkins don't hit them 300 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so alarmist, however. Greg Norman, in Fort Worth
recently, downplayed the distance issue.
</P>
<P>
   Length, schmength, he seemed to say. High handicappers still
can't break 100, and even pros aren't firing sub-60s week in and
week out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at average scores,'' Norman said. ``They aren't much
different than 30 or 40 years ago. Sam Snead once shot a 59 with
older-style equipment. It doesn't make as big a difference as some
people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Too, for every advocate of the joys and competitive advantages
of distance, there are those who urge taking delight in small ball.
In the same issue of ``Golf Digest'' that depicts long driver
Zuback contorting and cranking, there is mind-game advice from golf
guru Dr. Bob Rotella, who advises, ``To excel, you don't have to
hit it big.'' He points to little guy short drivers who've won
recently on the PGA Tour, including Jeff Sluman, Billy Andrade and
Brandel Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age,'' Rotella wrote, ``when everything seems
to be about power, it's hard to believe that guys who look more
average than you do can win on tour, but it's true. And in their
success lies a lesson.''

COMMENTARY: SEEING CHINA IN 3-D 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So I'm listening to the radio last week reporting on the stoning
of the U.S. embassy in Beijing, in retaliation for NATO's bombing
of China's Belgrade embassy. But I can't help chuckling at the last
line of the news report. It quotes China's minister of tourism as
saying that despite the rock-throwing, China is perfectly safe and
American and other tourists shouldn't think of staying away.
Translation: We burn U.S. flags, not U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-China crowd wants us to believe that the embassy
stoning was organized entirely by the Beijing government and shows
the real, true, unchanging character of China. I beg to differ.
What it shows us is the real, true, constantly evolving,
multidimensional character of China, where government control is
not what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   It is time we mothballed the perception, frozen since the 1989
Tiananmen massacre, that China is just a big prison where everyone
is making replicas of the Statue of Liberty in the basement. Wake
up! What has happened since Tiananmen is that the Communist
leadership in China _ for its own survival _ has struck a New Deal
with the Chinese people. That deal says you can live, work and
travel as you like, make as much money as you want and say whatever
you want at home. Just don't do one thing: Challenge Communist
Party rule.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, since Tiananmen China has witnessed a flowering of
pop culture, alternative life styles, tabloids and call-in radio
shows, neatly detailed by Jianying Zha in the book ``China Pop.''
At the same time, China's impressive economic development has
fostered a lot of authentic national pride. And at the same time
the Chinese regime has stoked this nationalism to deflect attention
from its own corruption, and to reinforce its legitimacy at a time
when Communist ideology is dead and the regime can't afford to
bring down the iron fist on its people as easily as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   This cocktail of Chinese self-confidence and nationalism emerges
at a time when America is no longer China's ally against the Soviet
Union but now the world's dominant power, telling China what it can
and cannot do. As such, America today inspires as much envy and
resentment in Chinese youths as admiration. The NATO bombing played
right into that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I grew up, America stood for democracy and human
rights,'' remarked a Chinese friend who graduated from Beijing
University in 1982. ``But now America is seen as a high-tech
economic power, with certain imperialistic tendencies. And when
America refused to let China hold the Olympics, that made big
headlines. People are now sobering up from their romantic view of
the West.'' So Chinese students throw rocks at the U.S. embassy
while preparing to take the national English exams to get into a
U.S. university.
</P>
<P>
   The same multidimensional view needs to be brought to bear when
analyzing Chinese politics, as Larry Diamond, the democracy
specialist at the Hoover Institution, explains in his important new
book ``Developing Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy doesn't happen at one instant,'' observes Diamond.
``More often, you get a softening of authoritarian rule,
incremental changes in the political and civic landscape, and
liberalization, prior to democratization. If we want China to fully
democratize one day, we have to encourage the incremental process
now under way there _ the opening up of information flows, the
introduction of electoral choices, even at levels that may seem
meaningless now, and the limited judicial due process beginning to
take shape in the administrative arena. These changes will go on at
the same time as brutal repression in Tibet and China's stealing of
nuclear secrets from the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why U.S. policy has to remain focused on curbing one
trend while constantly nurturing the other. It's not either-or, but
always both. ``Because the more China liberalizes and integrates
into the world,'' says Diamond, ``the more you raise the costs for
bad behavior.'' Indeed, you could almost see China's leaders
weighing how far to milk the embassy stoning _ before it threatened
trade, tourism, investment and other relations. Four days was their
limit.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly have a subtle, multidimensional view of their own
situation. If we don't adopt an equally subtle, multidimensional
view we will help turn China into a one-dimensional place. And
nothing _ nothing _ would destabilize the whole world more.

HIGH COURT UPHOLDS DECISION TO DISCHARGE HIV-INFECTED OFFICER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court bolstered the president's power
as military commander in chief Monday by upholding a decision to
discharge an HIV-positive Air Force officer imprisoned for having
unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   The justices unanimously ruled that the military's highest court
overstepped its powers when it blocked a move by the president and
various military officials to force Maj. James Goldsmith from the
Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   A military law enacted in 1996 allows the president, and Defense
Department officials acting on his behalf, to fire commissioned
officers jailed for more than six months under a court-martial
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith, who is infected with the virus that causes AIDS, was
ordered by a superior officer to inform his sex partners of his
health status and to use methods, including condoms, to protect
against spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Goldsmith was convicted of having unprotected sex with
two women _ a civilian in 1989 and a fellow officer in 1993 _ in
violation of the ``safe-sex'' order.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith was sentenced to six years at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.,
but retained his rank and active military status. His appeal of the
conviction was rejected by an Air Force appellate court, but his
sentenced was reduced to three years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Goldsmith was notified that the Air Force was taking
steps to have him forced out _ or dropped from the rolls, as it is
called in the military _ by the president under the law enacted
only months earlier and more than two years after his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces blocked the
dismissal of Goldsmith, who currently is serving in the civil
engineering squadron at Lackland AFB near San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court's 3-2 ruling said ejecting Goldsmith from
the Air Force, which would deprive him of military health care,
under a subsequently enacted law amounts to double-jeopardy and ex
post facto punishment, both of which are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Supreme Court ruling, written by Justice David H.
Souter, said the decision to boot Goldsmith from the military was
an administrative decision and not part of the punishment meted out
by the court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Executive action to drop ... (Goldsmith) from the rolls falls
outside the ... (military court's) statutory jurisdiction,'' Souter
wrote, adding that other avenues of appeal are open to the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith's attorney, John Economidy of San Antonio, said he and
the major plan, as suggested by the justices, to appeal the
discharge move to the Air Force Board of Correction for Military
Records.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Economidy said, he would try to negotiate with
the Air Force to end the litigation and the effort to forcibly
discharge Goldsmith, who on July 1 will have served 20 years, the
threshold for military retirement.

PHILIPPINE AIRLINES OWNER GETS ULTIMATUM FROM GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In yet another twist in one of Asia's
longest-running corporate dramas, Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has given the embattled owner of Philippine Airlines a week
to come up with $200 million for the debt-ridden company.
</P>
<P>
   If the owner, Lucio C. Tan, cannot produce the funds by next
Sunday, Estrada will force him to relinquish control, according to
Jose Pardo, the Philippine minister of trade and industry, who
joined Estrada and Tan at a meeting at midnight on Sunday in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo said Estrada would then auction Philippine Airlines to the
highest bidder. The airline, which is the oldest in Asia and is
known as PAL, has been sinking under $2.2 billion in debt and
eroding revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks partly to support from Estrada, Tan has held off his
creditors by promising to inject $200 million _ half his own money
and half from a partner. But his effort to find an outsider has
come to naught, as would-be investors, including other airlines,
have balked at his involvement in management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucio Tan has been dillydallying,'' Pardo said. ``We told him:
`You can't buy more time. We're denying you that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who is attending a conference of investors here with
Estrada, did not return a call seeking comment. A tobacco-and-beer
tycoon, Tan is one of the richest men in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   If Estrada holds to his ultimatum, it may finally resolve the
future of Philippine Airlines, which was shut down by Tan last
September in a labor dispute and reopened with the intercession of
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   The key word is ``may,'' since every previous climax in the PAL
story _ including the abrupt shutdown _ has proved to be a mere
prologue to further twists and turns. Estrada has taken a hard line
with Tan before, without forcing him to surrender his grip on the
57-year-old airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estrada still owes big favors to Lucio Tan for giving him the
financial resources to run for president,'' said Jim Eckes, an
aviation consultant at Indoswiss Aviation Ltd. in Hong Kong. ``But
I don't think, even with that closeness, it can help Tan to
maintain control this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tan's options were narrowed two weeks ago when one
of PAL's largest creditors, the Export-Import Bank of the United
States, announced plans to seize four of its planes.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had previously endorsed a plan to rehabilitate the
airline _ after Tan had agreed to cede day-to-day management to a
team of executives from Cathay Pacific Airlines. But Tan took back
the chief executive title in late April, relegating the team from
Cathay Pacific to a subordinate role.
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for the Export-Import Bank, which attributes
many of PAL's problems to Tan. The bank withdrew its support and
warned Philippine regulators that it planned to seize four Boeing
747s.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Tan had tried to placate the creditors by
recruiting the German national airline, Lufthansa &UR; ,  &LR; to provide
consulting services. But Eckes said that was unlikely to satisfy
the banks unless it was accompanied by Tan's departure from
management.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo said that Tan now accepted that ``his management style has
not met the test of creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government has taken charge of trying to find a
partner, and Pardo said he had received expressions of interest
from two investor groups, one in the Middle East and one in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged that it would be tough to wrest
Philippine Airlines from its controlling shareholder. Tan has
poured more than $500 million into PAL since he gained control of
the airline. Formerly a state company, it was spun off after the
ouster of the Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes he can see a light at the end of the tunnel,
because of his efforts to streamline the operations,'' Pardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Philippine Airlines has whittled down its costs by
selling planes and cutting its work force to 8,800 from 14,000,
analysts say it is still one of the most bloated Asian carriers. To
be profitable with its current fleet of 22 planes, Eckes said PAL
would have to cut its work force 50 percent further.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Tan has in his favor is Estrada's unflagging desire to
keep the flagship airline of the Philippines aloft. But Pardo said
Tan's intractable attitude was fraying the president's patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Tan, `You're putting to test a relationship,' '' he
said. ``It's bordering on presumptuousness.''

MEXICO'S GOVERNING PARTY OPENS NATIONAL PRIMARY TO ALL VOTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The governing party Monday formally broke with the
tradition under which Mexican presidents have handpicked their
successors, approving extensive new party rules to govern a
nationwide primary election, scheduled for November 7, that will
select its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, approved Monday in nearly unanimous votes at a
party convention here, were immediately scrutinized by skeptical
politicians and analysts searching for ways in which they might
allow President Ernesto Zedillo to maintain presidential control
over the nomination. But several analysts said the rules appeared
to leave few ways to fix the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to conceive of a new system that's as radical a
change as possible from the old one, then this is it,'' said
Federico Estevez, a prominent political scientist here. ``This
system is just not very controllable. The risk will be great for
the president that his man, if he has one, won't be selected. Money
and influence will matter, but all kinds of surprises can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, written by party leaders appointed by
Zedillo, all Mexican citizens with voting credentials will be
allowed to participate in the primary. The governing party, known
as the PRI, experimented for the first time with primary elections
in several gubernatorial races last year, concluding that opening
the nominating process to Mexican voters helped restore party
popularity. PRI fortunes had dropped so dramatically over the
previous decade that in 1997 the party for the first time lost
control of the federal Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, whose Spanish initials
are PRI, has won every presidential election since its founding in
1929, and each of 10 successive presidential candidates since
Manuel Avila Camacho in 1940 has been designated by their
predecessor in a secret process known as the ``dedazo,'' literally
the ``fingering of the candidate.'' The rules outlined Monday
formally abolish that autocratic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to Monday's convention, Jose Antonio Gonzalez
Fernandez, whom Zedillo appointed as party president in March,
acknowledged that the old nominating system ``converted the
presidential succession into a traumatic and conflictive moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the name of the man or woman who will be the PRI's
presidential candidate will no longer come out of the president's
office,'' Gonzalez said. ``I don't expect, as party leader, to
receive a telephone call with the name of somebody who is the
designated candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez made his speech in a meeting at PRI headquarters in
downtown Mexico City of the PRI's National Political Council, made
up of some 350 congressional deputies, labor bosses, former Mexico
City mayors, rural political chiefs, and other senior party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules the council approved Monday, PRI politicians who
wish to appear on the ballot in the primary must resign their
government posts by June 15, register as pre-candidates by July 15,
and begin barnstorming for votes only on August 1, when the formal
primary campaign would begin.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, potential candidates would have to
agree to participate in a public debate among all contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Nov. 7 primary will be the candidate
attracting a majority of votes in the largest number of the
country's 300 electoral districts, rather than winning a simply
majority of votes nationwide. The candidate will be formally sworn
in as the PRI candidate on Nov. 20. The presidential elections are
scheduled for July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules will force at least four PRI politicians who have
expressed interest in the nomination to resign public posts if they
wish to contend: the interior minister, Francisco Labastida Ochoa,
the social development minister, Esteban Moctezuma Barragan, the
governor of Tabasco state, Roberto Madrazo Pintado, and the
governor of Veracruz, Miguel Aleman Velasco.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo and two other PRI leaders, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, the
ex-governor of Puebla state, and Humberto Roque Villanueva, a
former party president, are already campaigning openly for the
nomination and will apparently be forced to suspend their
activities, which have included expensive television campaigns,
until the formal opening of the campaign in August.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, the PRI is to issue campaign spending limits
and establish a new party committee to monitor fundraising and
spending by those seeking the nomination.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zedillo first formally proposed that the PRI revise its
candidate selection procedures in a March speech short on details.
Zedillo's aides later interpreted the speech as outlining a system
in which not one nationwide but several regional primaries would
elect delegates to a subsequent party convention, American-style,
which would pick the PRI candidate. Many analysts said that
proposal would allow Zedillo to maintain control over the
nominating process, by packing the convention if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Under the nominating rules outlined Monday, however, a party
convention simply does not figure; the PRI's presidential nominee
will emerge as the winner of the nationwide primary. One analyst
who criticized the process Zedillo outlined in March was Augustin
Basave, an ex-congressman who has founded a PRI caucus pressing for
increased party democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little surprised,'' Basave said Monday. ``I thought the
president and his men would look for some kind of safety valve that
would give them a way to eliminate candidates they don't like. But
if there's no party convention, then that's one less barrier to
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, political analysts have been insisting that
Labastida, the interior minister, is Zedillo's preferred candidate.
In a nationwide poll published Monday by the Mexico City newspaper
El Universal, however, Labastida trailed Aleman, the Veracruz
governor, among voter preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The likely candidate of the pro-business National Action Party,
Vicente Fox Quesada, led in the poll. A distant second was
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the leftist Mexico City mayor.

3. Utah Jazz vs. 2. Portland Trail Blazers Season series: Jazz won,
2-1
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jazz scouting report: Utah is 24-4 at the Delta Center,
including an 11-point victory over Portland last month. ... Won two
of three against the Blazers, with the only loss coming in double
overtime at the Rose Garden in February. ... Byron Russell has
become a viable crunch-time option, nailing huge 3-pointers in
Games 4 and 5 against the Kings. ... Utah's half-court execution
has been tremendously effective against Portland's physical,
sometimes over-aggressive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Trail Blazers scouting report: Their main edges are depth and
rest, having swept the Phoenix Suns while Utah struggled to put
away feisty Sacramento in five. ... Their confidence is brimming,
having gotten past the first round for the first time in seven
years. ... They pounded Utah on the backboards in the three
meetings, but allowed the Jazz to shoot 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Key matchup: Jazz PF Karl Malone vs. Blazers PF Brian Grant.
Malone didn't have a 30-point game against Sacramento and was at
times badly outplayed by Chris Webber. Grant, who made 23 of his 32
shots against the Suns, has become one of the league's best
finishers around the hoop. In the past, Malone has used Grant's
aggressive defense against him with backdoor cuts and lob passes.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Jazz in seven.
\Nsubheds:EASTERN 4. Atlanta Hawks vs. 8. New York Knicks
Season series: Hawks won, 2-1
</P>
<P>
   Hawks scouting report: Somehow beat New York twice in the
regular season despite shooting 34 percent. ... Should get a boost
from the return of PF Alan Henderson from an eye injury. ... Their
stingy defense, anchored by C Dikembe Mutombo, allowed only 73, 80
and 78 points in three games against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks scouting report: They have a huge edge off the bench in G
Latrell Sprewell. The Hawks got only two points from reserves in
their Game-5 victory over Detroit. ... After his Game 5 winner, G
Allan Houston will have his hands full against Atlanta's No. 1
option, Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Key matchup: Hawks C Dikembe Mutombo vs. Knicks C Patrick Ewing.
Given Mutombo's drastically improved low-post moves and Ewing's
aching knees and feet, Atlanta should have a big edge here. As the
Pistons finally figured out, however, Mutombo wilts under
double-team pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Knicks in six.

MAN IN THE NEWS: EHUD BARAK, AGAIN IN COMMAND
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The man who was elected prime minister of Israel on
Monday is accustomed to being in command: Ehud Barak, 57, left the
military just four years ago, after a beribboned 36-year career as
platoon leader, tank-battalion chief, senior intelligence analyst
and, from 1991 to 1995, head of the Israeli Army general staff.
</P>
<P>
   In a breathtakingly rapid political ascent, the freshly retired
lieutenant general was appointed interior minister in the Labor
government led by Yitzhak Rabin. After Rabin's assassination in
1995, Barak became foreign minister under Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, with the dust barely brushed off his epaulets, he
seized control of the Labor Party in the aftermath of Peres' loss
to Benjamin Netanyahu in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As his television advertisements relentlessly reminded Israeli
voters, Barak is the most decorated soldier in the country's
history. The late Rabin, another general-turned-politician, was
said to have remarked long ago that if Barak did not one day become
chief of staff, ``there is something wrong with the system.''
</P>
<P>
   His most celebrated military exploit _ the 1972 storming of a
Sabena airliner hijacked by Palestinian guerrillas at Tel Aviv's
airport _ is seen in retrospect as a classic Barak operation in its
meticulous planning and precise execution. All 97 hostages were
freed. The elite antiterror unit he commanded, the Sayeret Matkal,
included Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Burnishing his reputation, Barak crossed into Lebanon a year
later disguised as a woman on a mission in which three leaders of
the Palestine Liberation Organization were assassinated in their
Beirut hideout.
</P>
<P>
   But like many career military officers, Barak is not a man of
bravado, associates say, but of ``extraordinary caution,''
methodically assessing input from many sources before making
irrevocable decisions. He approached the election campaign not like
a former commando, they say, but like the Stanford-trained systems
analyst that he also is.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by Labor's one-point defeat in 1996, when he served as
campaign manager, Barak attributed the loss not to Netanyahu's
hard-line nationalism or television skills, but to Labor's
strategic mistakes and organizational oversights. As the Labor
Party leader, Barak rebuilt a grass-roots get-out-the-vote machine,
while recruiting high-priced American pollsters and media
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Barak graduated with a degree in physics and mathematics from
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1968, and received a master's
in economic engineering systems from Stanford University a decade
later. But as a schoolchild, his former classmates report, he was
considered a bit dreamy, renowned more for his skill as a
lockpicker than for his academic prowess.
</P>
<P>
   A charter member of Israel's Ashkenazi elite, Barak is the child
of Zionist pioneers. He was born in Feb. 12, 1942, in a kibbutz his
immigrant parents helped found in the remote Heffer valley, near
the Lebanese border. The family drama was typical of early Zionist
settlers: His father and uncle, after witnessing their parents'
killing by Cossacks in Lithuania, had fled to what was then
British-run Palestine as teen-agers, with little money and no local
family or friends, hoping to build a new life and a new Jewish
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Barak first met his wife, Nava, a teacher, while both were
serving in the Army. They have been married for 30 years and have
three daughters, and now live in Kochav Yair, a Tel Aviv suburb.
</P>
<P>
   By birth alone, Barak would qualify as the quintessential sabra,
the native-born Israeli of legend. But like the cactus fruit for
which they are named, second-generation Israelis are supposed to be
prickly on the outside and sweet on the inside. Barak is neither.
His bland, controlled demeanor is said by aides and rivals alike to
mask fierce competitiveness and intellectual rigor, even arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Until the final weeks of the campaign, Barak was viewed
primarily in contrast to the sharply defined images of his rivals
and predecessors: Shimon Peres, the ``New Middle East'' visionary;
Benjamin Netanyahu, the ``Greater Israel'' ideologue; and Yitzhak
Rabin, the slain warrior-turned-peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Still, telling aspects of his character came gradually into
focus: the tinkerer who likes to dismantle and rebuild fine clocks,
the pianist who practices finger runs on his desk during political
briefings, the jaded consumer of military intelligence who inspects
ostensibly neutral data for hidden bias.
</P>
<P>
   More important, as he emphasized his desire to revive
negotiations with the Palestinians, Israelis were reminded of
Barak's personal commitment to the peace effort. In 1994, as Army
Chief of Staff under Rabin, he supervised the first troop
withdrawals from Jericho and the Gaza Strip, and played what he
proudly recalls as a pivotal role in securing a peace treaty with
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his few memorable speeches as an opposition leader,
Barak praised Netanyahu's further withdrawal from Hebron in 1997,
saying Israelis must ``free ourselves of the burden of ruling the
Palestinians, who have been residents of this land for hundreds of
years.''  &QL;

 &HT;    BARAK OUSTS NETANYAHU, ISRAELIS LOOK FOR UNITY AFTER TENSE
CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    EDs: This story will be updated following Barak's statement.
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-BARAK-0518.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Offering a message of unity and change to a
conflict-weary public, left-wing army hero Ehud Barak scored a
landslide defeat Monday over the combative Benjamin Netanyahu to
become Israel's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Youths reveling in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square celebrated the win as
a return to the ideology of peacemaking championed by slain Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a mentor to Barak. Even in the narrow
streets of religious Jerusalem, a right-wing stronghold, young
Israelis drove with Barak banners on their cars and honked in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But, most analysts saw the vote as mainly a rejection of
Netanyahu's divisive leadership, which had been based on alliances
with the country's right-wing and fundamentalist religious parties.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection was sound and unprecedented. In a country known
for close elections, exit polls on Israeli television predicted
late Monday that Barak won with about 58 percent of the vote to
Netanyahu's 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, considered a tenacious battler, conceded defeat by
10:30 p.m. (local time), just a half-hour after polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   Just 49 years old and now Israel's youngest former prime
minister, Netanyahu also told supporters that he was taking a break
from politics and relinquishing the leadership of his right-wing
Likud Party, which was thrashed in the separate balloting for
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, after the storm is over, after the election campaign is
over, the time has come to calm down and to heal the wounds,''
Netanyahu said in congratulating Barak, his former Army commander.
</P>
<P>
   Observers from the Holy Land to Washington had focused on the
election as key to reducing tensions in the Middle East, which have
increased since Netanyahu froze the Oslo peace process in December.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who had clashed repeatedly with
Netanyahu over the peace process and at times even refused to meet
with him, avoided any public endorsement of Barak during the
campaign. But, he was pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also invited Barak, who was helped by Clinton political
consultant James Carville, to the White House as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will be the 10th prime minister in Israel's 51-year
history. A father of three daughters and Stanford University
engineering graduate, Barak is a former general and Israel's most
decorated soldier. He is famous for disguising himself as a woman
on a mission to assassinate PLO leaders in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   One old army buddy, Danny Michaelson, described Barak as an
``iceman'' under pressure. Now, the 57-year-old Barak faces a
multitude of thorny issues of concern to those inside and outside
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to resume the Oslo peace process and, maybe even
more tricky, given himself a year to pull Israel's troops out of
the 17-year war in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most pressing to Israelis is whether the secular Barak
will exclude from his government the fundamentalist parties that
have been expanding their influence over Israel's way of life.
</P>
<P>
   That issue was instrumental in turning Israel's 1 million-strong
community of Russian immigrants, most of whom are secular, against
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Russians turned, Barak was a decided underdog.
Doubters said the cerebral, short and paunchy Barak was too stiff
compared to the quick-tongued and telegenic Netanyahu, known by his
nickname, ``Bibi.''
</P>
<P>
   But his message of hope capitalized on the public's
dissatisfaction with three years of tumultuous Netanyahu
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Barak toured polling places to chat with volunteers
monitoring the vote -- dozens of whom were in the commandos with
him. Behind the normally heavy security detail and flanked by
guards with M-16 rifles, he met briefly with supporters in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the Israeli people want to see a new way of
government. People want to see unity, change and hope and we are
determined to bring it to them,'' he shouted over the applause and
a nearly violent crush of dozens of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Famously cautious and methodical, Barak had still not made his
victory speech by even 1:30 a.m. (local time) Tuesday. He was
reportedly planning to address the throngs in Rabin Square, where
Rabin was killed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other Israelis, however, were already reacting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi is gone!'' yelled 21-year-old Neta Shteiner(cq), from the
passenger side of a Fiat Tempra in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so bad. He was lying, he was cheating,'' said driver
Yoav Cohen, 22. ``Now, the peace process will be better, quicker.
Everything will be more honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this the election of backlash,'' said political analyst
Uri Dromi, of the Israel Democracy Institute. ``Most Israelis were
just fed up with what this prime minister was up to . . . you
cannot be in power for long anywhere if you base your power on the
extremists and that is what Bibi Netanyahu did.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders were clearly eager to rid themselves of
Netanyahu, who they repeatedly said they did not trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message the Israeli people sent out tonight was that they
want to make peace with the Palestinians and that they want
change,'' said Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian peace negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has 45 days to form a parliamentary government. That task
will be made tougher by Monday's vote, which fragmented the
parliament into a host of small parties. In addition to the loss of
several seats by Netanyahu's Likud, the parliament vote seemed to
accentuate the religious-secular rift in Israel. Both
ultra-religious and anti-religious parties picked up seats.
</P>
<P>
   The split parliament vote was expected from the typically
contentious five-month campaign. Israel, a country of six million
people, is comprised of news-addicts who love politics. Voter
turnout was expected to be the usual 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several planeloads of Israelis living in the United States
returned to vote and police reported more than 150 complaints about
possible voter fraud. A few people were arrested trying to vote
with others' identification cards and fist fights broke out between
some party activists.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the race hinged on the personality of Netanyahu, the
prime minister whose campaign and message began to unravel in
recent days. He desperately accused Barak of being a pawn and ally
of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In his three year term, Netanyahu seemed captive to the extreme
right wing members of his coalition. He had even enraged an Israeli
ally, the late King Hussein of Jordan, by attempting to apprehend a
Hamas official under Hussein's tacit protection. He quarreled
constantly with his own cabinet ministers and many of the moderates
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Israelis enjoyed the influence Netanyahu granted to
ultra-religious parties in his government and the green light he
gave to the construction of Jewish settlements in the disputed West
Bank -- land that the Oslo process is supposed to divvy up between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted that terrorism against Israelis had dropped
significantly during Netanyahu's term, which he claimed was a
result of demands he placed on Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was elected in 1996 as the hard-line alternative after
a series of Palestinian suicide bombings. In what supporters see
has a penalty for his own success against terror, Israelis did not
pick up on Netanyahu's security message this time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he did not try to remind them. His commercials showed
video from old bus bombings. His increasingly shrill attacks
accused Barak of being weak against the Arabs and, eventually,
actually making political deals with Arabs figures.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the message failed and it was Barak's message
that carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   Even Netanyahu loyalists seemed ready for the loss when going to
the polls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Netanyahu loses we will be fine,'' said 25-year-old
Asher Shakani, an ultra-religious theology student in Jerusalem.
``There is still a God in the sky looking out for us.''

BARAK BRINGS UNUSUAL TALENTS TO ISRAELI POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The most highly decorated soldier in Israel's
history, Ehud Barak, proved Monday he could marshal his military
skills and the forces loyal to him on Israel's political
battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   But the question ahead for the new prime minister is whether
those abilities as a commander in uniform will serve the country in
achieving ``the unity, and change, and hope'' that he has promised
to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Short and compact, Barak, 57, does not look the part of the
Israeli hero his lifetime of military accomplishments has made him.
</P>
<P>
   The most enduring image of him in his campaign commercials was a
black-and-white photograph of a young man with thick black hair
standing on the wing of a plane with a pistol strapped to his
waist. The image was broadcast nightly, as he portrayed himself as
a man who will be tough on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph is from the day after he led his elite commando
unit in the 1972 storming of a hijacked Sabena Airline's passenger
jet and freed the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   His exploits through three decades of conflict in the Middle
East became legendary: the assassination of Arab militants,
intelligence operations behind enemy lines, harrowing helicopter
escapes, and engineered wiretappings straight out of a Tom Clancy
novel.
</P>
<P>
   But the man is complex, somehow shy and brash at the same time.
His face is soft and round, but his movements are stiff and
straight out of the military. He is known to enjoy fixing pocket
watches and clocks, a master of technical engineering. He is a
skilled pianist and relaxes by playing sonatas in the quiet of his
home.
</P>
<P>
   He is a protege of the former general and slain prime minister,
Yitzhak Rabin, who signed the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace
agreeement in 1993 and was killed by a Jewish religious extremist
for it. Barak has said he ``adored'' Rabin and in many ways has
styled his political career after him.
</P>
<P>
   But Barak is also derided by critics on the left for trying to
``out-Bibi Bibi,'' referring by nickname to defeated Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, who has left the peace process deadlocked. As a
freshman member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Barak voted
against Rabin's last major agreement with the Palestinians in 1995.
He has maintained a tough image on security throughout his campaign
while simultaneously showing TV ads with photographs of himself
standing beside Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   As one friend put it, he is ``more Rambo than Rabin.''
</P>
<P>
   He was raised on a kibbutz, or collective farm, the son of an
electrician and Polish immigrant. Born Ehud Brog, he changed his
name in 1972 to the Hebrew ``Barak,'' which means ``lightning.''
Its secondary meaning in the Hebrew dictionary is ``bright and
shining.'' He came of age steeped in the secular Zionism of the
founding years of the Israeli state.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the military in 1959, he quickly rose through the
ranks. Within three years, he was a commander in the army's elite
commando unit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Six-Day War in 1967 he served as a reconnaissance group
commander. In the 1973 Middle East War, he was a tank batallion
commander on the southern front in Sinai. At the age of 37, he was
promoted to brigadier general. By 1991, he assumed the post of
chief of staff and the rank of lieutenant general, the highest in
the Israeli military. He has won the Israeli equivalent of five
medals of honor, making him the most decorated soldier in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shrum, part of the trio of American political strategists
he hired to help him win the election, said his unique technical
skills were evident the first time they met. They gathered in a Tel
Aviv office to discuss political strategy, and Barak was trying to
tell Shrum about technological advances that could improve the way
teleprompters work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can play Chopin, take a watch apart, tell us that we
should redesign the Teleprompter, run a military, run a campaign,
and in the end master Israeli politics? I don't think I've ever
seen anyone like him,'' said Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   Avshalom Horan, 54, a close friend of Barak since he served in
Barak's elite unit in 1963, said, ``He has an amazing mind, a
combination of technical genius and intuition. He was a brilliant
commander and you could trust your life on his decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The military environment is very nondemocratic, so the
decision-making process is very personal. It is done individually,
and he is very strong at that,'' Horan added.
</P>
<P>
   ``His challenge will be to succeed in achieving unity _ and this
will require something more than military leadership. I think he
can do it, he has already done it in this election. His success
depends on it.''

ALBANIANS BRING TANKS TO BORDER BESEIGED BY SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLAJ, Albania _ The sporadic, mostly one-sided ground war along
the northern Albanian border may not remain lopsided much longer.
</P>
<P>
   As Serbian troops continue to shell a half-dozen nearby
villages, forcing Albanians to abandon their homes, the Albanian
army Monday made what locals described as its first show of
strength in the region. Nine tanks, an armored personnel carrier,
and a truckload of soldiers passed through Golaj midafternoon
Monday, headed in the direction of the Albania-Yugoslavia border,
just kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, heavy shelling could be heard and dark plumes of
smoke could be seen in the hills on the Albanian side of the
border. Despite a flash similar to the one that typically
accompanies tank artillary, it was unclear whether the Albanian
soldiers had simply taken up positions or were engaging the Serbian
soldiers in direct conflict for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But the tanks alone marked an apparant escalation of Albania's
role in the two-month-old conflict. Until now, border skirmishes
have been between Serbian soldiers and the Albanian border patrol
or the Kosovo Liberation Army, which maintains three training camps
in the area. NATO has handled all air strikes, although the US
Army's powerful Apache helicopters have so far gone unused.
</P>
<P>
   The tanks appeared in Kruma, to the south, only minutes after
the monitor with the local office of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe explained that the Albanian army had
likely stayed away to avoid provoking the Serbs. In recent weeks,
shelling by Serbs has emptied at least five border villages and
destroyed three houses. Some displaced Albanians who lived along
the border also spoke of forced labor and killed cattle.
</P>
<P>
   From a short distance, Monday's initial shelling appeared to
take place in Qafa Prushit, where tens of thousands of Kosovar
refugees initially entered Albania on foot to circumvent Serbian
landmines. The border post has been unofficially bombed out of
existences by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be more than a maneuver,'' said Bjorn Kuhne, the
OSCE monitor who followed tanks column from Kurma to Golaj. ``I was
waiting for it. I was surprised the military had stayed so far away
from the border. I'm surprised this took so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers _ both those driven from their home and those
overwhelmed by the influx of Kosovar refugees _ appeared elated by
the army's unexpected presence. All along the winding 30- minute
route on a dirt road, children shouted and waved. The soldiers on
the well-worn, outdated tanks appeared excited too, waving and
smiling as they passed through Golaj going northeast on a road that
dead ends on the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for the government to do something, but they do
nothing,'' Vehvi Malaj, 53, shouted before the army arrived. ``My
whole village is totally emptied ... we all left together, walking
through the mountain during the night because it was safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bislim Malaj, 55, ``We didn't have time to take anything
but our children and maybe a little food.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with 300 people, the Malajs said, they were forced from
their homes after the Serbs began shelling their village in late
April. Armed with hunting rifles, perhaps 10-15 men sent their
wives and children on and stayed behind to protect their homes. But
the Malajs had no weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Men from another village, Letaj, regularly make the hour hike
from Golaj to their homes under cover of darkness, hunkering down
in the mushroom-shaped bunkers that are everywhere in Albania in
hopes of protecting their property.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's ethnic cleansing campaign has sent thousands of
refugees pouring into the lush mountainous areas known as the Has
district. Five of its 12 villages have been emptied, and only three
days ago artillery shells landed on the hills of Golaj. Although
the heaviest shelling continues farther to the north, locals must
now take care when they walk, because shell fragments that look
like small cans are sometimes found on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shoot at Albanian shepherds; they shoot at Albanian
cows,'' said Letif Koleci, a displaced Albanian, who added that he
had seen Serbs planting land mines inside Albania's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kruma, the district's largest town, has seen its population
more than double to 40,000, with Kosovar refugees and displaced
Albanians. Golaj, whose center is no more than a collection of
crumbling buildings, has doubled in number, too, with 2,100
displaced Albanians and 6,558 refugees now living with host
families there, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhne, the OSCE monitor, said the NATO airstrikes have only
exacerbated the Albanian evacuation, since the Serbs simply hide
from the airplanes and then retaliate with more shelling later.
Serb soldiers have also made brief incursions into Albania to get
rocks for fortifications and to provoke the border police, people
said. Several weeks ago, two villages were hit with fire launchers.
But until Monday's shelling, Kuhne said, ``the Serbian attacks
appeared to be on the wane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the shelling started, there really was no KLA presence
around here,''' he said. ``There was no real reason for them to
shell this side of the border, except to clear the border and to
cause chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Albanian government does not officially discuss KLA
operations in the country and the KLA does not officially admit its
presence there, rebel soldiers could be seen around the district
Monday. A half-dozen lunched at a restaurant in Kruma. A man
wearing a KLA teeshirt briefly followed the tank column and ordered
that no photographs be taken.
</P>
<P>
   The three training camps, including one that can hold as many as
1,500 soldiers, are an open secret. The KLA has also tried to
recruit young Kosovars and displaced Albanians who must relocate to
Kruma and the surrounding villages, residents and newcomers said
through a translator Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Now both the people who live in the area and those who were
forced to relocate here are worried that the Serbs will start
shelling farther into the interior. Hoping to get home again, they
don't want to be forced to move south or east or any more than they
already have.

JUSTICES ORDER TRIAL IN NORTH CAROLINA REDISTRICTING CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court set the bar a bit higher Monday
for federal courts faced with cases that challenge whether a
political district was drawn primarily to elect a minority
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected a summary judgment by a three-judge
federal panel in a North Carolina case and ordered a full trial. At
issue is whether one of the state's 12 U.S. House districts was
unconstitutionally configured to make election of a black more
likely.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from the Supreme Court's 1993 ruling that
outlawed racial gerrymandering unless there is ``a compelling
governmental interest.'' The fallout from that decision has
affected districting in a number of states.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Monday to reject the summary judgment was
unanimous, but the case again revealed a 5-4 split on the
substantive issue of whether race can be an overriding
consideration in drawing political districts.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the justices subscribed to the view, in an opinion by
Justice Clarence Thomas, the court's only black, that the evidence
before the three-judge court ``tends to support an inference that
the state drew its district lines with an impermissible racial
motive ... .
</P>
<P>
   ``Summary judgment, however, is appropriate only where there is
no genuine issue of material fact ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Four other justices joined in a separate, concurring opinion,
written by Justice John Paul Stevens, that raises questions about
whether race was the principal issue in how the North Carolina
district was drawn.
</P>
<P>
   The district is 47 percent black and held by Rep. Mel Watt, a
black Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The current district was drawn after the court's 1993 decision
that led to invalidating an earlier map. The original district was
more than 50 percent black and snaked for 160 miles across the
central and southern portions of the state, sometimes along a path
no wider than Interstate 85.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Reed, a professor at DePaul University College of Law in
Chicago who has represented black plaintiffs in a number of voting
rights cases, said the court ``took the easy way out'' by ruling on
the summary judgment issue.
</P>
<P>
   When courts begin to review cases arising from redistricting
that will follow the 2000 Census, Reed said, ``they just have to be
more careful. They're not allowed to make assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Glavin, president of Southeastern Legal Foundation, which
has challenged affirmative action plans, said the decision means a
closer examination of the Legislature's motivation.
</P>
<P>
   He said a trial could show that the new Watt district was the
result of political gerrymandering _ packing the seat with
Democratic voters _ rather than a racial maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said the latest North Carolina case was the first to reach
the Supreme Court on the basis of a summary judgment. Most of the
other cases have gone to the high court after a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Thomas in his reasoning were Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and
Anthony M. Kennedy _ the five who have provided the majority in the
earlier racial districting cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting in those previous cases were Stevens and the judges
who joined in his concurrence Monday: Justices David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.

BOSTON PATIENTS TO GET TUMOR-STARVING DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Patients in Boston will be the first volunteers this
fall to receive doses of endostatin, the tumor-starving drug whose
dramatic effects in mice have galvanized the medical community and
raised hopes of cancer patients everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin is the most potent yet discovered of substances
called angiogenesis inhibitors, which can destroy the blood vessels
that feed tumors _ without harming normal cells.
</P>
<P>
   In combination with other drugs, these inhibitors may open a new
chapter in which cancer will be kept harmlessly in check for many
years, without exposing patients to the grueling side effects of
today's treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The trials will be undertaken at Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer
Care, which includes the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and
Women's Hospital, and Massachusetts General Hospital, said
officials of EntreMed, the Maryland biotechnology company that is
developing the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The initial test, known as a Phase I trial, could take a year or
more, and will involve only about 25 patients in Boston. It is
sponsored by EntreMed, which licensed the rights to develop
endostatin from Boston's Children's Hospital. Two similar Phase I
trials, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, will begin
after the Boston trials are underway. The two other centers are the
M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute in Houston and the University of
Wisconsin in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston volunteers will be referred by cancer specialists at
the three hospitals. Candidates for the trial must have solid
tumors, including lymphoma. Some will have failed other therapies,
while some may not have been given other treatments, researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial trial's purpose is solely to check for adverse side
effects, but researchers will be looking for any signs that the
drug is halting the tumors' progress. If the drug is found safe,
EntreMed will move to larger Phase II studies that begin to
evaluate a drug's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's exciting, but of course you always have the risk
that something will fail'' in early testing, said Dr. Judah
Folkman, the Harvard and Children's Hospital researcher who has led
the field of angiogenesis research for 30 years. Endostatin, along
with another natural substance, angiostatin, was discovered in
Folkman's laboratory. About 20 less potent angiogenesis inhibitors
are already being tested in humans, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman will be on the team analyzing the results of the trials.
Supervising the research will be Dr. Donald Kufe, who heads a group
at the Dana-Farber that tests new cancer agents.
</P>
<P>
   Kufe said Monday that because endostatin has been so free of
toxic effects in animals, the researchers hope to quickly raise the
doses given to human patients, with the aim of giving them enough
of the drug to determine whether it's effective.
</P>
<P>
   In safety tests at EntreMed, monkeys were given endostatin in
doses ``up to 300 times what you would give a human, and there was
still no toxicity,'' said Mary Sundeen, an EntreMed spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Kufe said enrollment of patients will not begin until fall, and
eligibility requirements are still being worked out. ``We don't
have waiting lists,'' he said in an interview. ``When the time
comes we'll be evaluating patients for entry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, information about the trial will be posted on
the World Wide Web at http://www.dana-farber.net.

REP. NETHERCUTT PORTRAYED IN `DOONESBURY' AS `WEASEL KING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Term limits advocates have mounted billboards, run
television ads, and churned out news release after news release in
their efforts to shame Rep. George Nethercutt into honoring his
pledge to not serve more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   But over the weekend, the term limits advocates got the kind of
boost money can't buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doonesbury,'' one of the most widely circulated comic strips
in America's newspapers, viciously lampooned Nethercutt, R-Wash.,
as ``the Weasel King'' in the kind of political satire that makes
one question the wisdom of the old adage that there's no such thing
as bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to admit, it's pretty funny, and the difference with
a cartoon from a news story is that more people are going to see
it,'' said Steven Stehr, professor of political science at
Washington State University. ``I'm sure no politician wants to see
`weasel' in the same sentence as his name.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon illustrates the fact that the congressman who became
famous as a giantkiller is now in danger of becoming infamous as a
giant target.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt, a Republican lawyer from Spokane, drew national
publicity when he defeated House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., in
1994. In the race, Nethercutt repeatedly suggested that Foley had
lost touch with eastern Washington during 30 years in Congress, and
he promised to serve only six years himself.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt is now considering whether to break that pledge, and
plans to make an announcement within the coming weeks. Although
term limits will certainly be an issue in his campaign, his
district is fairly conservative, and the Democrats have not yet
come up with a strong challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the cartoon shows the kind of attacks Nethercutt is
likely to face. The Spokane County Democrats posted the cartoon in
their headquarters Monday, and county chairman Kenneth Pelo said
``I can see us making a lot of buttons for people to wear.''
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon ran in the major papers of Nethercutt's eastern
Washington district, including the Spokane Spokesman-Review and the
Moscow-Pullman Daily News. It features a radio talk show host
asking Nethercutt, a lawyer who represents an agriculture-dependent
district, ``So, Congressman, What's the deal? Why aren't you
returning to your plow?''
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon Nethercutt offers a few reasons _ the importance of
seniority, the desire of the voters, the rapid passage of time _
before the radio host interjects, ``And fourth, you the weasel
king, right?''
</P>
<P>
   The comic strip Nethercutt's rejoinder: ``Well, it's not like an
official title.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Nethercutt has generally sought to avoid
discussing the term limits issue, but his spokesman shrugged off
the cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressman saw it and had a laugh, but it's not going to
change his position that he's making a decision for best interests
of eastern Washington and his family,'' said the spokesman, Ken
Lisaius. ``(Cartoonist) Gary Trudeau, wherever he lives, can say
whatever he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But any issue that can be reduced to one frame of a comic strip
poses dangers for a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're lampooned in a cartoon that appears in the entire
country's Sunday newspaper, you can't run from the issue forever,''
said Jason Miller, the spokesman for U.S. Term Limits who saw the
cartoon in The Washington Post. ``No one wants to see their name in
a cartoon like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are a handful of other members of Congress
planning to run despite pledging not to, Nethercutt is likely to be
the symbol of the phenomenon because of the prominence of Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cartoon definitely raises this issue to a new level, and
brings it to a new audience,'' said Brett Bader, a Republican
political consultant in Washington state. ``You know you're part of
the cultural milieu when you're parodied in Doonesbury.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bader argued that the piling on might backfire in
Nethercutt's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the cultural elite train their focus on something, the
folks back home tend to rally around the hometown boy,'' Bader
said.

WHEN COOKING WHALE, GO HEAVY ON THE SPICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREWS SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the leaders of the Makah keep their word, the 1,600
members of their tribe will soon be eating tons of whale meat and
blubber.
</P>
<P>
   The problem the tribe now faces, is how to cook the gray whale
it killed Monday. Most everyone involved in cooking the last whale
the Makah caught, 70 years ago, is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy and you're only limited by imagination,'' said
Maggie Ahmaogak, the executive director of the Alaska Eskimo
Whaling Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can boil whale, stew it, roast it, grill it, pickle it,
make a soup of it and even serve it frozen. The taste of whale
changes depending on how you cook it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven cooks interviewed last fall in Alaska, Japan and Norway
suggest the Makahs remember two things: Don't expect whale to taste
like chicken and the more spices used, the better. It tastes, they
say, like a cross between shrimp and crab.
</P>
<P>
   A whale the size of the gray the Makahs killed, estimated to be
as least as long as the tribe's 32-foot cedar canoe, can feed most
of their tribe for a while, said sea mammal experts at the
University of Alaska. But tribal leaders admit that many Makah may
not be eager to add whale to their diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they're going to eat it. Why else would anyone catch
a whale?'' said Charlie Johnson, executive director of Alaska
Nanuuq Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the Makah luck. Once they get back to eating whales
they'll be much healthier. Whales are far more nutritious than land
animals. After a while, the kids will prefer it over burgers,
Twinkies and junk food,'' Johnson said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said gray
whales taste terrible because they are bottom feeders. Which
prompts some to question how the anti-whaling activist knows how
whale taste.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, experts disagrees with Watson's review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray whales are the most delicious of all,'' said Johnson.
``It's a very rich meat, slightly oily, but finely textured like
veal, or a little like lamb. And the female is tastier than the
male.''
</P>
<P>
   How to cook whale depends pretty much on personal or geographic
tastes, but, as one Eskimo cook said: ``The days of just boiling
the hell out of the whale are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese serve whale raw, or pickled or fried in a light
tempura batter with Wasabi sauce, made from green horseradishes.
</P>
<P>
   Several Norwegian recipes call for marinating whale meat in red
wine, cloves and sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Eskimos, anything goes, culinarily speaking,.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tabasco sauce is the secret. The real good old stuff from
Louisiana. We fly cases of it in here,'' said Hunter Michelbrink,
an extension service agent in Barrow, Alaska. The village of 5,000
far above the Arctic Circle catches and eats 22 whales a year,
usually Beluga and Bowheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pickled is my favorite way of cooking it,'' said Lilly
Leavitt, the 27-year-old daughter of a Barrow whaling captain.
``You boil it for a little while and leave it over night or for a
few days in vinegar, sugar and some spices. It's really
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Flora Brower's husband caught a 42-foot Bowhead last fall. Her
preferred method to cook muktuk, pieces of thick skin and blubber,
is to cut it into small cubes, boil it with hot chilies and other
spices and serve with a strong mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Pan-frying two-inch-thick steaks is also great, said Rebbi
Maakiki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown lots of garlic, peppers and onions cut in large pieces.
Sear the meat in a very hot pan, about four-minutes on a side and
you've got heaven in a pan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular, said Ahmaogak, is a form of whale Popsicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thin piece of frozen meat dipped in rendered blubber oil. It
is a real treat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these ideas interest the Makahs, the files of the
Department of Interior contains recipes for stuffed whale roast,
fillet of whale with mushrooms, whale pot roast and several other
selections.
</P>
<P>
   The Makahs have released few details on how they will butcher
and distribute the whale meat. In Alaska, the Eskimos usually
follow tradition that goes back decades.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of catch, after the butchering, the captain's wife
must cook for the whole town.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of the whaling boat gets the first choice of cuts.
It's usually two, 2- or 3-feet-wide pieces out of the center of the
whale and it's called the captain's belt, the most tender meat of
the whale.
</P>
<P>
   The back third get placed in storage or ice cellars to be cooked
and served to villagers on Thanksgiving and Christmas. The front
third is divided up among those other boats who helped with the
task of towing the whale in and butchering it.
</P>
<P>
   The whaling commission boss, Ahmaogak, has some words of caution
for the Makah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have forgotten a lot about cooking whale but they
must remember that if they're going to butcher the whale on a
beach, and not on the ice like we do, they had better watch for
rocks and shells in the meat or they can crack lots of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, make sure you clean the intestines really,
really well and cook them for a very long time.''

 &HT;    In Atlanta, it's hip to be proud
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A cynic might have looked at Outkast Day at City Hall
and seen just another feel-good photo op, but it was more than
that. It was as purely Atlanta an event as you're likely to see for
a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday luncheon, orchestrated by City Council member Michael
Julian Bond, brought together a classic Atlanta combination _
senior citizens, politicians, hiphop stars and recording industry
executives _ to celebrate both National Senior Citizens' Month and
the achievements of Outkast, the hottest act with Atlanta's LaFace
Records.
</P>
<P>
   Outkast, for those who don't know, are the duo of Big Boi and
Andre, who along with the other young artists of the extended
``Dungeon Family'' probably constitute the most revolutionary
musical development to have occurred in our town since Ray Charles
walked into a Georgia Tech radio studio in 1955 and recorded ``I
Got a Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also being sued by Rosa Parks, the civil rights
heroine, over the song which bears her name.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Rosa Parks,'' which seems to be mostly about partying
down, actually has to do with Rosa Parks is one of those riddles by
which the young are forever able to bedevil the old. But she was
offended by the lyrics, and objected to her name being used without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, then, the need for some image polishing had something
to do with the decision to bring a hundred senior citizens downtown
in limos for lunch, courtesy of LaFace.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, however, Outkast reflected a sense of
connectedness with their elders long before they got sued by one of
them. It is one of the things that makes them distinctively
Southern: Groups from New York and Los Angeles don't sing the joys
of cruising in a Cadillac with ``me and you, and your mama and your
cousin, too.''
</P>
<P>
   They are said to be socially conscious, which listeners can
decide for themselves, but they are indisputably place-conscious,
so much so that kids in Sweden now feel some familiarity with
Atlanta sites Perry Homes, East Point and Decatur. Being honored at
City Hall had to be a kick, for two young men who used to ride
MARTA making up rhymes and dreaming of the big time.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the seniors seemed proud of their local stars,
Rosa Parks and the limo ride notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Robert Hodo, who plays the harmonica on ``Rosa Parks,''
gave the invocation. The tireless community organizer, Ella May
Brayboy _ herself the heroine of countless voter turnout drives _
accepted a $2,500 check for the Fulton County Council on Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have brought attention to seniors. May God bless you and
your families and may you keep on keeping on,'' she told the young
rappers.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell came by to say the media pays scant
attention to good things like this and too much to the crime news,
although Big Boi and Andre have had a lot to say about crime
themselves. Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond called them a
``perfect example for all young men in our city.''
</P>
<P>
   So it had all the elements: a little self-aggrandizement,
commercial motive, plenty of politics - with a thoroughly genuine
sense of civic pride at the core. There were enough good intentions
to go around, and something in it for everybody. And what could be
more Atlanta than that?

 &HT;    Smoltz placed on DL with inflamed elbow
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Same elbow. Same discomfort. Same prognosis. For the
third time in two years, the Atlanta Braves placed John Smoltz on
the 15-day disabled list Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really come to hate those initials,'' Smoltz said. ``It's
safe to say none of my children will have the initials D.L.''
</P>
<P>
   The club made the decision following an afternoon examination by
orthopedist Joe Chandler, who determined through an MRI that while
there was no ligament or tissue damage in Smoltz's right elbow, it
was inflamed. Chandler also removed more than 2 c.c.'s of fluid
from the joint, which has twice since 1994 required surgery for
calcium deposit and bone chip removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco (last Monday) really took a lot out of me and my
side session (Friday) really wasn't very good at all,'' said Smoltz
(5-1), whose 2.59 ERA is third lowest in the National League. ``It
went through this the whole second half (of 1998) so it's nothing
new. But usually, it goes away during the game after two or three
innings. It really didn't (Sunday) in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   The move will cost Smoltz three starts and left-hander Bruce
Chen will be called up from Class AAA Richmond to fill his spot in
the rotation. In the meantime, the club brought up right-handed
reliever Russ Springer to help shore up the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for John because he doesn't want to do it,''
manager Bobby Cox said. ``It's just a matter where I have to use my
own judgement on this and make the right decision. If we're in
September, it's a different story. The season would almost be over
and you go for it. Right now, you don't.''

 &HT;    Quayle's wife says women can have it all
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Veering away from politics _ and not even mentioning
her husband's presidential campaign _ Marilyn Quayle told 200 women
Monday they can have it all, with the right mix of work, family and
attention to self.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of former Vice President Dan Quayle gave a bootstraps
formula for success at a motivational conference for working women
dubbed ``Powerchicks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect anyone to open doors for you. You have to
open your own doors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no references to government solutions in her keynote
speech, only an admonition that dwelling on ``women's issues''
fosters discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   She mentioned her husband only once, when she recounted the Cobb
County, Ga. connection that led to her invitation. Several years
ago, Dan Quayle was approached by Matt Towery, an author and former
Republican activist who was writing a book called ``Powerchicks,''
about the influence of women in government and business. (The
conference drew its name from the book.)
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's wife, who did not know Towery, admitted she was
initially put off by the title: ``Oh, come on, Dan,'' she recalled
saying. ``Yeah, I really want to be involved with something like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But she ended up in the book, as did five other women who headed
a roundtable discussion at the conference sponsored by Kennesaw
State University: Gail Evans, CNN vice president; Vicki Escarra,
Delta Air Lines vice president; Xernona Clayton, TBS producer; Tina
Flaherty, marketing executive; and Betty Siegel, Kennesaw State
president.
</P>
<P>
   Towery noted the irony that he, with his conservative
background, would end up inspiring a gathering of women determined
to shake up the old male-dominated workplace.
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle sees no inconsistency in her pro-career stance and
the social conservatism of her husband. She's headed to New
Hampshire this weekend to campaign for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social conservatives believe that both parents should spend
more time child-rearing,'' she said in an interview, referring to
her husband's well-known ``Murphy Brown'' speech on family values.
``To say that women should only be powerful in the home is
ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle carried the theme into the luncheon speech, advocating a
mix of child-rearing, professional growth and civic life. The trick
is to focus on one at a time, whether it be a few days or a few
years devoted to each. ``You can have it all. It's just hard to
have it all at once,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At 49, Quayle has three children in their 20s, a law practice
with a focus on mergers and acquisitions, seats on several
corporate and charitable boards, a yen for mountain-climbing
(though she's afraid of heights) and a notion that she'd like to
study architecture. ``I like taking homes apart and putting them
together again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a level of activity that could inspire inferiority, but not
in everyone. ``It's not that you have to be superhuman,'' said
Charlotta Dunkin, who took time from her job as manager of a
computer programming department to rub shoulders with other
powerchicks. ``You just have to set your goals, balance them and
keep focused.''

 &HT;    Redistricting gets new rules from Supreme Court
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday laid down new markers
in the still-simmering dispute over how courts and legislatures
determine if political districts have been drawn with an
unconstitutional emphasis on race.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling in a North Carolina case, the high court returned to the
district court for trial a challenge by a group of white voters to
the 12th congressional district held by Rep. Mel Watt (D-N.C.), who
is black.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court ruled last year that Watt's district, the subject
of three previous Supreme Court cases since 1993, was
unconstitutional because race was the predominant factor in its
redrawing. The lower court held no trial, ruling instead on a
motion for summary judgment by the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the high court ruled unanimously that the lower court
should have held a trial in order to answer the key fact in
dispute: was the motivation of the North Carolina legislature
political or racial when it created the district in 1997?
</P>
<P>
   ``The task of assessing a jurisdiction's motivation...is not a
simple matter,'' Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for the majority.
``It is an inherently complex endeavor, one requiring the trial
court to perform a 'sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and
direct evidence of intent as may be possible.'''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling will be closely scrutinized by courts and
legislatures around the country, coming as it does on the eve of
the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Following that national head count, legislatures will once again
redraw the political maps for Congress, state legislature and local
jurisdictions to reflect shifts in population.
</P>
<P>
   In previous cases, including one involving Georgia's 11th
Congressional district from 1995, the high court has ruled that
race cannot be the predominant factor in drawing district
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of those rulings was to invalidate portions of
congressional maps from Louisiana to North Carolina. Below the
congressional level, plaintiffs also challenged the
constitutionality of state legislative maps, county and school
board districts.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, county commission and school board boundary lines in
Putnam County are still in litigation over claims of racial
gerrymandering.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling will make it more difficult for plaintiffs to
challenge a redistricting plan on racial grounds, said Neil
Bradley, the associate director of the American Civil Liberties
Union southern regional office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just automatically win because you say the word
'race,''' Bradley said. ``The message to the district court judges
is that you really have to go into details.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the high court did not rule on the merits of the North
Carolina case, Thomas highlighted the central issue posed by the
case: Did the North Carolina legislature put more black voters into
the 12th District because they were black, or because they were
likely to vote Democratic?
</P>
<P>
   The issue is central because the courts have long recognized
that districts can be drawn for political reasons, such as
protecting incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas noted that when given a choice, the North Carolina
legislature included majority black precincts in District 12. On
the face, such choices would appear to support the claim that race
was a factor, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas also highlighted the expert testimony of a witness
for the state, who showed that the black voters chosen were also
much more likely to vote Democratic _ supporting the state's claim
that these voters were chosen for political, not racial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prior decisions have made clear that a jurisdiction may
engage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even it so
happens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be black Democrats
and even if the state were conscious of that fact,'' Thomas wrote.
``Evidence that blacks constitute even a supermajority in one
congressional district while amounting to less than a plurality in
a neighboring district will not, by itself, suffice to prove that a
jurisdiction was motivated by race in drawing its district lines
when the evidence also shows a high correlation between race and
party preference.''

   LOS ANGELES _ When making ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' George Lucas would have done well to follow the words of
that little green guru Yoda who once wisely instructed: ``Do. Or do
not. There is no try.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas had 16 years to think about how he wanted to continue his
``Star Wars'' saga. In fact, since he says he had the whole series
mapped out from the beginning, Lucas has really had some 25 years
to tweak the text that has become the holy writ of American pop
culture.
</P>
<P>
   And he still botched it. Big time.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Phantom Menace'' boasts a brilliantly realized
visual design and a couple of terrific action sequences, the movie
fails to bring its audience into its dazzling alien worlds. The
characters are bland, the script too chatty, the humor too
infantile.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the worst elements of ``Return of the Jedi'' _ Ewoks! _
and combine them with a complex, uninvolving story that never quite
taps into the series' mythology and you have an idea how
disappointing this new installment is. ``The Phantom Menace''? Try
``The Phantom Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatal flaw here can be summed up in three words: Jar Jar
Binks. This computer-generated amphibious Jedi sidekick stumbles
around in bell-bottoms speaking in an often unintelligible Jamaican
patois, supplying strained ``comic relief'' by stepping in alien
doo-doo and making jokes about flatulence.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in his own technical wizardry, Lucas doesn't seem to
care that the character grates like nails on a chalkboard. (If, as
rumored, Jar Jar meets his maker in the next movie, it will be the
most celebrated death in motion picture history.)
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas clearly loves Jar Jar, and that's the problem with
this movie. ``The Phantom Menace'' emphasizes computer effects at
the expense of storytelling, completely losing the sense of joy and
wonder that made the original movie so much fun.
</P>
<P>
   As a director (and this is his first movie since 1977's ``Star
Wars''), Lucas famously has only two sets of instructions:
``faster'' or ``more intense.'' Here he doesn't seem to have
bothered with either, and his cast, which includes some pretty
talented actors, flounders. But, boy, that Jar Jar sure is amazing
to watch, isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the only time you wish ``The Phantom Menace'' were a
silent movie. (This despite Ben Burtt's impressive sound design.)
The dialogue, never the series' strong suit to begin with, is
particularly tinny and often needlessly dense. In the first film,
Alec Guinness summed up the Force concisely in a sentence or two.
Here, someone is always blabbing about the mythology, giving the
movie the feel of a computer-generated civics lesson. (Memo to
Lucas: Show. Don't tell.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' certainly borrows freely from the previous
three films, now episodes IV, V and VI in the series. Taking place
some 40 years before ``Star Wars,'' we meet Anakin Skywalker (Jake
Lloyd), a cute 9-year-old moppet who, we know, eventually grows up
to become Darth Vader. There's an imperious princess (Natalie
Portman) trying to protect her little planet from the oppressive
Federation and its starship blockade. There's a mentoring Jedi
(Liam Neeson) given to solemn pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Other blasts from the past: A spaceship breaks down. There's a
funeral pyre and an awards ceremony. Large, menacing objects
explode. We revisit Tatooine, home of Skywalker and a skeletal
C-3PO, who meets his robot pal R2-D2 for the first time. There are
lots of weird aliens, but no cantina (or cantina band).
</P>
<P>
   The creatures themselves are a wonder to behold. Lucas uses some
2,000 effects shots in ``The Phantom Menace,'' and there's
something interesting to look at in practically every frame of the
movie. A 12-minute pod race scene that zaps young Skywalker and
competing alien racers through canyons and desert landscapes plays
as a thrilling outer space homage to the chariot race in
``Ben-Hur.'' (Note: The sound here is just as remarkable as the
visuals.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, such involving moments are too few and far
between. ``The Phantom Menace'' has a stilted, solemn tone and
sorely lacks the presence of a sarcastic space cowboy like Han Solo
who could lighten some of the saga's ponderous load.
</P>
<P>
   Neeson's Jedi, Qui-Gon, who finds Anakin and anoints him the
Chosen One (being born to a virgin probably doesn't hurt the kid's
cause), is a solid but flat presence. As the young Obi-Wan Kenobi,
Ewan McGregor does a fine vocal impersonation of a young Guinness
but has a second-banana part. Lloyd and Portman, playing Luke and
Leia's future parents, appear sadly adrift.
</P>
<P>
   The best new character, the devilish Sith lord Darth Maul (love
that double-bladed lightsaber), is grievously underused, appearing
on screen for maybe 10 minutes. Yoda, Jaba the Hut, Terence Stamp
and Sam Jackson also turn up for brief cameos, their personalities
apparently too sophisticated to cut into Jar Jar's screen time.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone _ even (and especially) the die-hard fans _ will have
their gripes about this movie. That doesn't mean it will be
unloved. With its pint-sized hero and sophomoric humor, ``The
Phantom Menace'' clearly has been geared toward kids, the
demographic that most loudly clamors for the toys and the tie-ins.
It's just a shame that Lucas has left everyone else so
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you could view ``The Phantom Menace'' as the (shaky)
foundation for the next two movies, episodes where we'll see Anakin
turn to the Dark Side. (You won't get any hint of that change from
Lloyd's ordinary performance here.)
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good, but Lucas could have explored some of
those character issues and themes during this movie's 133-minute
running time. Instead, it plays as a hollow design exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Lower your expectations. Drastically. &QL;

SUPREME COURT SAYS STATES CANNOT RESTRICT WELFARE FOR NEW
RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., Pa., Calif., Okla., D.C., Mass.)  (rm) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a ringing endorsement of the right of equal
citizenship for rich and poor alike, the Supreme Court ruled Monday
that state welfare programs may not restrict new residents to the
welfare benefits they would have received in their home states.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision declared unconstitutional California's two-tier
welfare system and, by implication, the provision of the 1996
federal welfare law that authorized California's approach. Fifteen
states had accepted Congress' invitation to hold newcomers, for
their first year of residency, to the benefit levels of the states
from which they had moved.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts have uniformly been striking the new programs
down, however, and they have been in effect only briefly if at all.
The California law had twice been blocked from taking effect by the
federal appeals court in San Francisco. New Jersey paid $585,000
this year to some 250 newcomers to whom the state had paid lower
welfare benefits before last summer, when its law was struck down
by the federal appeals court in Philadelphia. New York's similar
law was blocked in state court, and Connecticut repealed its law in
1997 because of the constitutional doubts.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority opinion Monday, Justice John Paul Stevens said
the Constitution prohibited states from dividing their residents
into classes and from discriminating among them. ``Citizens of the
United States, whether rich or poor, have the right to choose to be
citizens `of the state wherein they reside,' '' Stevens said,
quoting from the opening sentence of the 14th Amendment and adding,
``The states, however, do not have any right to select their
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
and Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. The chief justice called the
challenged law ``a reasonable measure falling under the head of a
good-faith residency requirement,'' similar to requirements of
residency for voting, getting a divorce, or obtaining reduced
tuition at state universities.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the ruling's obvious significance for welfare policy, it
has potentially enormous implications for constitutional doctrine
because of the route the court took to reach its result.
</P>
<P>
   While the court's precedents in this area have relied on a
loosely defined ``right to travel'' _ a much-critiqued phrase that
does not appear in the Constitution _ the majority anchored its
decision in the explicit language of the 14th Amendment, which
provides, ``No state shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentence from section one of the 14th Amendment, known as
the privileges or immunities clause, has been buried for years
under the weight of adverse Supreme Court precedent that has
treated the clause as a dead letter since shortly after the 14th
Amendment was ratified. In a ruling known as the Slaughter-House
cases, in 1873, a 5-4 majority held that the privileges or
immunities clause applied only to the privileges of national
citizenship and not to the states.
</P>
<P>
   But Stevens on Monday revived the issue by quoting at length
from the dissent in the Slaughter-House cases, in which Justice
Joseph P. Bradley said: ``A citizen of the United States has a
perfect constitutional right to go to and reside in any state he
chooses, and to claim citizenship therein, and an equality of
rights with every other citizen; and the whole power of the nation
is pledged to sustain him in that right.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the privileges or immunities clause has been
championed by legal scholars across the ideological spectrum, for
different if convergent reasons. Both liberals and conservatives
see it as a potentially powerful source of individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are attracted to it because the historical
evidence supports the Framers' understanding that the privileges of
citizenship included the right to pursue an occupation and own
private property. Liberals see the clause as a basis for protecting
individual rights, one that is more secure, because it is more
closely tied to the Constitution's text, than the general due
process guarantee to which the court turned for this purpose after
burying the privileges or immunities clause.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear how far the justices are prepared to take
the revival of the privileges or immunities clause beyond the
context of interstate travel. But however modest, the step the
court took in this case won an enthusiastic reception from
constitutional analysts who are most often ideological adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Mellor, president and general counsel of the
Institute for Justice, said the court's approach was ``very
exciting for constitutional jurisprudence'' because the privileges
or immunities clause could protect ``many attributes of citizenship
that people think of as part of the American dream.'' The
conservative legal organization represents entrepreneurs who are
trying to conduct business free of state regulation.
</P>
<P>
   On the liberal side, Professor Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law
School said the decision was ``quite wonderful'' because the
privileges or immunities clause was potentially the basis for ``a
jurisprudence of fundamental personal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion Monday, Thomas said that while the
majority had misapplied the clause in striking down the law at
issue, ``I would be open to re-evaluating its meaning in an
appropriate case.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   California, which has one of the country's most generous benefit
systems, had estimated that the lowered benefits for newcomers
would save $10.9 million in an annual welfare budget of $2.9
billion. Stevens noted that ``an even-handed, across-the-board
reduction of about 72 cents per month for every beneficiary would
produce the same result.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that ``the state's legitimate interest in saving
money provides no justification for its decision to discriminate
among equally eligible citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The case, Saenz vs. Roe, No. 98-97 (known until earlier this
year as Anderson vd. Roe), was brought by the American Civil
Liberties Union of Southern California on behalf of two welfare
recipients, who had moved to California from Oklahoma and
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Under California's law, their benefits would have been lowered
by more than $200 a month to match the levels in their former
states.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens indicated that the decision should not call into
question a state's right to require a nonresident to pay more for a
hunting license or for university tuition, because discrimination
between residents and nonresidents was permissible under some
circumstances while discrimination among categories of residents
was not.

LYCOS LOOKS TO NEOPLANET FOR SOFTWARE LIFT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lycos Inc., the Waltham, Mass. Internet portal, thinks it has
found a way to boost its popularity by doing an end-run around
Microsoft Corp.'s dominance of the computer desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos announced a deal Monday with NeoPlanet Inc., a Phoenix,
Ariz. firm that makes customized Internet software for Microsoft
Windows computers. Under the deal, NeoPlanet software will
automatically direct users to Web sites run by the Lycos Network,
such as the Lycos search service, the Tripod Web site- hosting
service and the Wired Digital news service.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos will market the NeoPlanet software to computer makers as
the primary browser on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   NeoPlanet's software forms a user interface or ``skin'' that
rests on top of Microsoft's own browser, which is built into the
Windows 98 operating system. The computer still uses Microsoft's
browser, but NeoPlanet lets computer makers give the browser a
customized look and feel _ without violating their contractual
obligation to distribute Microsoft's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway 2000 Inc., a major maker of home computers, signed an
alliance last week with CMGI Inc., which owns about 20 percent of
Lycos. Jeff Crown, Lycos' vice president of corporate development,
said that Gateway may use the NeoPlanet browser skin to create its
own customized browser, which would direct customers to Gateway and
Lycos Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   NeoPlanet is also at work on a browser skin that will work with
a new version of America Online Inc.'s Netscape Navigator browser,
set for release later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Lycos is purchasing an equity stake of up to 9
percent in FairMarket Inc., a Woburn, Mass. company that provides
Internet hosting services for companies that run on-line auctions.
Lycos plans to use FairMarket to host its own auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Lycos stock rose 1 3/8 to 108 1/2.

HASEK IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Dominik Hasek worked in privacy Monday, but he
didn't get any.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the overriding presence of the Sabres' ubergoalie in
this city and on this team that his most secret quirks _ of which,
like most geniuses at work, he has plenty _ become public fodder.
</P>
<P>
   So when Hasek practiced by himself for 20 minutes instead of
joining his teammates for a crisp 40-minute workout, there was an
epidemic of speculation. And when coach Lindy Ruff expressed
concern about the Buffalo savior's health _ specifically, the
lingering effects of a groin strain suffered three months ago _
alarms could be heard across Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that this was the eve of Game 6 at Marine Midland
Arena _ the Sabres' second chance to eliminate the Bruins from the
best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinals _ and further
considering that Hasek is almost maniacal in his zeal to face a
fusillade of shots in practice, the slightest deviation from the
norm raised eyebrows, if not blood pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Now for a dose of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody involved _ Hasek, his teammates, and his coach _ fully
expect him to play Tuesday night. And it is not unusual for Hasek
to opt for a separate session in which he faces a couple of
shooters, as was the case Monday, if he feels subpar physically or
is coming off a rough game. In this case, both scenarios apply.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said the groin injury suffered Feb. 17 against Toronto _
which caused Hasek to miss 12 games and prompted him to visit a
specialist in Germany _ has been ``maybe a little bit'' more
bothersome in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been hurting for 2 1/2 months,'' said Ruff. ``He gets
treatment before and after practice. It's just gotten where he
notices it again. Every day, he goes through a 40-minute process of
ice and massage. I don't believe it's any worse. It's a state where
if he's thinking about it, you know it's bothering him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff also acknowledged that Hasek's health was a consideration
when he was lifted from Sunday's 5-3 loss in Boston after the
Bruins built a 4-1 lead with three second-period goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did contribute,'' said Ruff. ``I think it did affect his
play. It affected his positioning on some of his saves.''
</P>
<P>
   And on three he didn't make in the second period _ a Sergei
Samsonov one-timer from the right circle into the far side of the
net, a Mattias Timander blast from the point, and a two-on-none
break that culminated in Jason Allison's feed to Dmitri Khristich
for the fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he wishes he had the Samsonov shot back,'' said Ruff.
``He didn't see Timander's. And if he feels all right, he'd play
the fourth goal differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, who detests alibis almost as much as he does relaxation,
wouldn't duck culpability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play well,'' he said. ``No excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   But he conceded that on the Khristich goal, ``in my mind, I
probably saved my groin'' and didn't challenge the attackers with
his usual abandon. ``But it won't happen anymore,'' he added,
``because I feel bad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise his groin: ``It's always pretty same. I've been playing
hurt the last 2 1/2 months.''
</P>
<P>
   But with characteristic stoicism, he won't allow himself to
believe it when it matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not OK,'' he said. ``But in a game, I don't think about
it. Once I go on the ice, I have to play 100 percent all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday he went on the ice only with Sabre spares Rob Ray and
Jean-Luc Grand-Pierre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent 20-25 minutes with a couple of players,'' he said.
``My head is clear and I'm ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ruff said, ``Everybody's concerned,'' that sentiment
apparently hasn't reached Hasek's teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed fine,'' reported Ray. ``He's just a guy, when he has
a bad day, he works his butt off. He felt he had a bad day Monday
and wanted to work on some things. We were mostly just shooting,
working his glove and blocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding volunteers to work with him was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gonna go out,'' said center Michael Peca, ``but I
decided not to. I wanted to save my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't out there,'' said winger Dixon Ward. ``They wanted
someone who could lift the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ward did contribute perhaps the best diagnosis of the entire
health crisis and the Sabres' attitude toward it: ``I'm never
concerned about Dom.''

U.S. TO PAY ALBANIANS FOR HOUSING KOSOVO REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the refugee population in Albania expected to
reach over 900,000 this summer, the United States announced on
Monday that it will pay thousands of Albanian families to host new
Kosovo refugees in their homes until a peace settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also said on Monday that it had selected a site
where it would build a second refugee camp in Albania to house
another 20,000 refugees. Already, the United States has opened Camp
Hope in southern Albania, which will eventually house 40,000
refugees. And the United States has offered asylum to 20,000
refugees who have begun arriving here.
</P>
<P>
   The three programs _ offering stipends for Albanian host
families, building camps in Albania and relocating refugees outside
the Balkans _ are all part of the United Nations and NATO programs
in Albania and Macedonia that have mushroomed over the past month
to accommodate Kosovar refugees fleeing Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where we can say we can handle the
refugees,'' said Brian Atwood, director of the Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
   Other NATO countries, led by Germany, Italy and Britain, have
built camps in Macedonia and Albania to house more than 100,000
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said on Monday they now believe
that more than 5,000 ethnic Albanians have been massacred by
Yugoslav forces as part of President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign
to expel Albanians from the province of Kosovo; these officials
said the final death toll may be much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fear that a significant percentage of the 100,000 draft-age
men who have been reported missing will never again appear and may
be dead,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and the Pentagon said on Monday that they have
received fresh reports that Yugoslav troops are using Kosovar
Albanians as human shields around military targets to prevent NATO
from hitting them. There were new reports, as well, that the
Kosovar Albanians killed in last week's NATO bombing of a Serb
military compound in southern Kosovo had been herded up and placed
there as human shields, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   However, those new reports came from refugees and are not
conclusive evidence that Milosevic's forces purposefully installed
the displaced Albanians around the military posts.
</P>
<P>
   With the mounting civilian casualties from NATO air attacks,
both European and U.S. officials have sought to deflect criticism
of the air campaign. NATO has already admitted that casualties were
variously caused by bombs that fell short of their targets, such as
the attack on Nis that hit a hospital rather than an airfield, or
by mistaken targeting, as in the bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade. With the suggestions that Milosevic is using Kosovar
Albanians as human shields, both NATO and the Pentagon are also
laying the blame for these deaths at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that as many as half or certainly a third of the
people who may have been killed in NATO attacks were put their
specifically by Milosevic as human shields,`` said Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said on Monday that they were tracking three
large bands of displaced ethnic Albanians, numbering between 40,000
and 70,000 in each group, who were trying to flee Kosovo but who
were being held back by Yugoslav troops. It is from these bands of
homeless Albanians that Yugoslav troops have herded out the
civilians who have been used as human shields at military compounds
and other obvious NATO targets, according to these officials.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the growing danger for these homeless Albanians, NATO
and the United States continue to rule out flying cargo planes over
Kosovo to drop food, fearing the planes will be hit by Yugoslav
anti-aircraft fire. Atwood said today that the United States is
continuing to work with private voluntary groups to figure out an
airlift plan, but they have yet to ask permission from Milosevic to
drop the food.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations team arrived in Belgrade on Monday to assess
the needs of Serbian as well as Kosovar civilians from the war. To
date, only the International Committee of the Red Cross and a
Greek, Russian and Swiss consortium have won permission from both
Milosevic and NATO to truck in supplies to Kosovo.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Three summers ago, Alexander Tolbonen, a scrawny lad of
18 only recently drafted into Russia's Interior Ministry army, set
off from his rural northern Russian hometown to fight rebel
guerrillas in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other Russian servicemen who died in the
breakaway region, Tolbonen never came back. Since the day in
September 1996, when she learned of his death, Tolbonen's mother,
Anna, has been trying to get the state to admit it was wrong to
send her only son to war.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Boris N. Yeltsin won his day in court over
the war in Chechnya. Anna Tolbonen lost hers. And over two years
after Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya, violence continued to
rock the Caucasus republic.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, the
State Duma, fell 17 votes short of impeaching Yeltsin on the count
of launching the disastrous conflict, which killed an estimated
80,000 people between 1994 and 1996 but failed to quell a
separatist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   In a much quieter decision, Russia's Supreme Court struck down a
decision by a court in Petrozavodsk, the capital of Tolbonen's home
region of Karelia, that had ordered the Interior Ministry to pay
damages for the loss of her son.
</P>
<P>
   And in events that barely made the news, three Russian officers
were killed in a shootout on the border of Chechnya, bringing the
death toll in such incidents to 10 servicemen in the past month. On
Sunday, an explosion killed five more people at a Russian military
base in Vladikavkaz, a regional capital near Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The violence demonstrated that the May 1997 peace agreement did
not brought peace to Chechnya, which won de facto independence, but
lost all semblance of law and order amid battles by armed factions,
violent crime and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, after suffering a humiliating defeat of its army to a
poorly armed band of rebels, continues to face loss of life and
ongoing instability in the Caucasus. Meanwhile, the brutal Russian
aerial bombardments of Chechen towns during the war diminished
Russia's prestige as a democratic nation, a stain made no less
embarrassing by Moscow's official indignation over NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechnya conflict gave birth to another irony when Yeltsin
picked Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin to replace Yevgeny
Primakov as prime minister. Opposition lawmakers fought hard to
impeach Yeltsin over his resposibility for Chechnya. But Monday
they seemed at least willing to consider approving Stepashin in a
confirmation vote scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, as head of Russian counterintelligence in 1994, was
one of the chief instigators of the failed Chechnya campaign. Poor
intelligence about rebel forces was one of the reasons for Russia's
early setbacks in the war. Stepashin was later fired for botching
an effort to release hostages held by Chechen guerrillas in the
Russian town of Budyennovsk in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the impeachment attempt was about politics, not
justice. The State Duma itself voted down draft resolutions
condemning the war in Chechnya proposed by the antiwar Yabloko bloc
in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky reminded the house that the
remains of nearly 400 unidentified servicemen and civilians killed
in the war still lie in refrigerators in southern Russia, awaiting
burial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boris Nikolayevich has not found money yet to bury the people
whom he himself sent to death,'' Yavlinsky said of Yeltsin on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin is not the only one who has forgotten about
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is extraordinary that Russia has sunk in to almost
immediate amnesia about the war,'' said British journalist Tom de
Waal, author of a book on the Chechnya conflict. ``In any normal
country there would have been political fallout; people would have
resigned; there would have been calls for justice, for
compensation, for lessons to be learned. In Russia there has been a
numbing silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Anna Tolbonen was one mother who tried to break that silence.
Her lawsuit charged that the Interior Ministry was negligent to
send her son, a green draftee, to a deadly conflict. To her
surprise, Petrozavodsk Judge Mikhail Balitsky ordered the Interior
Ministry to pay her $4,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy was 18 years old, he had never fired a gun, he had
never sniffed gumpowder,'' Balitsky said in an interview,
explaining his decision. ``My opinion, as a judge, as a father, is
that it was wrong to send such boys to Chechnya in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning an appeal to a higher court in April, Tolbonen
invited a reporter to her sparsely furnished home in Sheltozero, a
bumpy two-hour ride south of Petrozavodsk. Her husband, Alexander
Shevchenko, is unable to work because of an injury. Tolbonen
borrows money from neighbors for bread, and feeds her family by
growing vegetables on a small plot.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to talk about her son, she took a framed portrait of the
shelf in her small, sparely furnished apartment and hugged it,
crying softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired _ I spent all my energy on this, and I'm not sure
it's worth it,'' she said. Three weeks later, the Supreme Court
issued its ruling reversing Balitsky's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry won the appeal by arguing that Tolbonen's
parents are already receiving compensation for his death. That
monthly sum equals about $3.25.
</P>
<P>
   And besides, the ministry's lawyers argued, the military was
only following orders. They suggested that Tolbonen try suing
Yeltsin.

DRUGSTORE CHAIN CVS TO PAY $30M FOR SEATTLE ON-LINE FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a first for the drugstore industry, CVS Corp., the
4,100-store pharmacy chain based in Woonsocket, R.I., said Monday
it has agreed to pay $30 million to acquire Soma.com of Seattle, an
Internet pharmacy that sells prescription drugs on line.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of dollars, the deal is insignificant, but it may offer
hints of how consumers will buy medication in the future. Buying
prescription drugs over the Internet can be far more convenient
than making a trip to a drugstore and waiting in line while the
prescription is filled.
</P>
<P>
   But most Internet drugstores lack the size and clout to
negotiate good prices from the managed health care plans that pick
up the tab for most of these medications.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an emergency, such as when a child gets sick, few
consumers are willing to wait even one day for an earache medicine
to arrive by a home-delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring Soma, CVS, the nation's second largest drugstore
chain, wants to offer its customers the best of both worlds. ``This
is a home run deal,'' said CVS chairman and chief executive Tom
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceptually, it makes sense,'' said Gary Giblen, an analyst
with NationsBanc Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In part because health maintenance organizations are looking for
efficiencies and squeezing costs, the drugstore industry has been
consolidating rapidly. With $15.3 billion in sales, CVS has emerged
as one of the big players in the industry, along with Walgreen Co.
and Rite Aid Corp., among others.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, several upstarts, such as PlanetRx and Drugstore.com,
a company partly backed by Internet giant Amazon.com, have taken to
selling prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and vitamins
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   How much of a threat these virtual pharmacies are to the big
brick-and-mortar chains is still unclear, said analyst Eric
Bosshard of Midwest Research. Several big chains, including CVS,
have been experimenting with retail Web sites, and the acquisition
of Soma could give CVS an early head start.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said CVS would put its considerable buying and marketing
muscle behind Soma and widen the number of products Soma would sell
on line. Ryan declined to disclose sales figures for Soma.
</P>
<P>
   One concern: On-line marketing promotions can raise red flags
about privacy because many consumers are uncomfortable sharing
their medical history over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In buying Soma, CVS seems to be pursuing a strategy similar to
other chains in different segments of the retail industry.
</P>
<P>
   According to this line of thinking, Internet stores and
brick-and-mortar stores aren't necessarily direct competitors; in
fact, some observers think the successful retailer of the 21st
century will sell its wares at both traditional stores and Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, for example, now offers customers several options,
believing that the same customer who visits its department store
this month could well buy something from its Web site a month
later, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   CVS thinks a similar philosophy will work for drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about making life easier for customers,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Many drugstore customers, he believes, may someday place orders
for prescription drugs on line, then go to the local CVS store to
pick them up. At the current CVS Web site, customers are limited
mostly to ordering prescription refills.
</P>
<P>
   The Soma acquisition offers some other potential advantages. It
has a relationship with Microsoft Corp. that CVS may be able to
take advantage of, and it widens the chain's customer base.
</P>
<P>
   CVS has no stores west of the Mississippi River. The Soma
acquisition will help make CVS more of a national presence.
</P>
<P>
   There could, however, be a drawback to the Soma deal. As HMOs
have squeezed prescription drug prices, drugstores have relied on
impulse buys to boost profits. A customer comes into the store to
get a prescription filled, then also winds up buying a paperback
book, a greeting card, and a candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   If a Web site means that customers visit the drugstore less
frequently, won't that cut into impulse buys and overall sales?
Analysts don't think so. A few years ago, similar concerns were
raised when drugstores began adding drive-through windows. The
convenience of these windows improved customer loyalty and, over
time, that loyalty translated into higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, CVS shares rose 1/2 to close at
46.

FORD TO INTRODUCE CLEANER PICKUP TRUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (dal) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ The Ford Motor Co. said Monday that starting
this autumn its new pickup trucks, including the nation's
best-selling vehicle, would produce no more air pollution than
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Because of more lenient federal standards that have existed for
a quarter-century, full-sized pickups and sport-utility vehicles
are currently allowed to produce two and a half times as much
smog-causing gas as cars, and will be allowed to produce five times
as much next year when tighter rules for cars take effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford said that beginning with the 2000 model year, the
800,000 full-sized pickup trucks it makes annually, including the
top-selling F-150, will meet current pollution standards for cars.
All but the largest models will meet even the tighter rules taking
effect next year, and would meet the Clinton administration's
recently proposed standard for large pickups in the 2004 to 2007
model years.
</P>
<P>
   For Ford Ranger compact pickups, which sell at an annual rate of
360,000, emissions will be reduced in the 2001 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive and president, said Ford
wanted someday to make all light trucks _ a category that includes
pickup trucks, sport-utility vehicles and minivans _ as clean as
cars. Automakers that produce the cleanest light trucks could
benefit commercially, he said, adding, ``It's the right thing to do
and it is a competitive advantage for those enterprises that can do
it, while still balancing customer and shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, welcomed Ford's decision to make cleaner pickups, saying,
``through their leadership, Americans will be driving cleaner
vehicles and breathing healthier air.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it would not charge extra for the improved catalytic
converters and engine controls necessary to achieve the gains, nor
would the new equipment affect the vehicles' performance. The
change will probably cost the company about $100 per truck.
</P>
<P>
   Federal pollution standards for pickup trucks and sport-utility
vehicles were made more lenient than for cars when the rules were
developed in the early 1970s. The reasoning was that such vehicles
were used mainly by small businesses, which worried that the
pollution-control technology of the time would make the vehicles
less powerful for heavy loads. But now that such vehicles account
for half of all family vehicles, the situation has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Covering 1.1 million pickups a year, or a third of the nation's
pickup truck market, Ford's move is the latest in a series of
decisions by automakers to go beyond federal requirements in
reducing pollution by light trucks. Last autumn, Ford began
voluntarily building all its sport-utility vehicles to run as clean
as cars.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules approved early last year require automakers to
reduce emissions from minivans and the smaller sport-utility
vehicles and pickup trucks in the 2001 model year, although not to
car levels. Several automakers have complied early with these rules
_ for example, in Jeep Wranglers and Honda Passports.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford has been virtually alone in also reducing emissions
from full-sized light trucks, for which federal regulations are
particularly lenient. Toyota has reduced emissions from its Land
Cruiser and Lexus LX-470 full-sized sport-utility vehicles, and
plans to make its new Tundra full-sized pickup truck, which goes on
sale this autumn, meet the same low-emissions standards as the Ford
vehicles. But General Motors and DaimlerChrysler A.G., Ford's main
rivals in the full-sized light truck market, have not moved in this
direction and said Monday that they had no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of rejecting environmental concerns, a growing
number of auto executives say the public cares enough to make
cleaner-running vehicles a commercial success. But other managers
disagree, contending that few automobile buyers actually understand
emissions issues. ``People don't really care, they just presume
that we meet the standards and the standards are stringent,''
Bernard Robertson, senior vice president for North American
engineering at DaimlerChrysler, said in an interview last month.
</P>
<P>
   Light truck sales now equal car sales as millions of families
have been abandoning sedans. But the shift, combined with the ever
greater number of miles that Americans are driving each year, has
prompted concern. ``The emissions from our cars, particularly from
the larger, less efficient vehicles, threaten to erode many of the
air quality gains America has achieved,'' President Clinton said in
his weekly radio address on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced then that the EPA was proposing strict new
pollution regulations for gasoline and automobiles, to take effect
in 2004. The proposal, for which a public comment period will end
on Aug. 2, would require particularly steep reductions in pollution
from full-sized light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative depends partly on the administration's national
air quality targets, which a federal appeals court rejected on
Friday. EPA officials insist that the gasoline and automobile plan
can proceed without those targets, because previous air quality
targets remain in force and smog will worsen and violate those
targets unless something is done.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasser said that Monday's decision had nothing to do with
the legal battles. Indeed, Ford officials said they had been
working for months on Monday's plan, making sure that they could
mass produce vehicles as clean as promised.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the auto industry worry that unilateral pollution
reductions of the sort undertaken by Ford will only encourage
regulators to set even tougher emissions standards. ``You can't
satisfy the regulatory mind,'' grumbled a senior engineer for a
Japanese automaker, after insisting on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives contend that tighter emissions standards are
inevitable and that if affordable technology exists before the
standards take effect, it might as well be put on cars and other
family vehicles. ``Government regulators aren't stupid, they don't
live in a vacuum, they follow the technology'' and will quickly
require automakers to use it, said Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice
president for safety and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto executives say privately that until the last of couple
years, there was a ``gentleman's agreement'' among at least the
Detroit automakers not to compete on environmental issues. Ford has
broken that informal understanding by repeatedly and very publicly
going beyond what federal regulations require since early last
year, to the fury of executives at rival companies.

DATA GENERAL TO EXPAND DISK STORAGE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking a larger portion of the computer storage market, Data
General Corp. said Monday it will spend about $100 million to add
more than 450 people primarily in sales, technical support and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 18 months, the Westborough, Mass. company will add
about 100 new employees to its Clariion division in Massachusetts
and the balance spread out in US and overseas offices, a company
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 450 hires _ the company now employs 4,800 including 1,800
in the Bay State _ more than 250 will be in sales, with the balance
in engineering to assist in the sale of the Clariion product line.
The Clariion division currently has a sales force of 50 people who
sell primarily to companies that repackage the company's disk
storage system and software to reach corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   In expanding its disk storage division, which last year
accounted for just over $400 million of the company's $1.5 billion
in revenue, Data General hopes to get a leg up on archrival EMC
Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass., the leading supplier of disk storage
systems. Last year EMC had revenue of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're betting they can do better than EMC in this market,''
said William Milton, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. ``It's
a big gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Data General's product line includes a new technology
called Fibre Channel that uses specialized semiconductor chips with
fiber-optic cables and custom software to dramatically speed the
flow of data among a panoply of refrigerator-sized storage systems
and to computer servers, without impacting local area networks.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Fibre Channel communications is expected to grow
65 percent annually for the next few years, said Ronald L. Skates,
Data General president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   EMC does not have a competing Fibre Channel system on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   With a bigger sales force, Data General expects to focus on
major computer providers such as Sun Microsystems Inc., Compaq
Computer Corp., and Hewlett-Packard Co. along with big corporate
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a great opportunity for Data General in a market which
has enormous potential,'' said Skates.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on its sales expansion plans, Data General is
expected to announce Tuesday its strategy on storage systems linked
to create so-called Storage Area Networks. SANs are a new way for
Internet-based computer networks to store information.
</P>
<P>
   Data General shares closed at 12, down 1/4. EMC shares fell 1 to
102 3/4.

LAWMAKER SEEKS FINES FOR FANS WHO TRASH PLAYING VENUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A city councilor has proposed a new ordinance that
would slap a $50 fine on fans who throw objects onto the ice or the
parquet at the Fleet Center, or on the playing field at Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   A state law already prohibits throwing objects onto playing
surfaces, but prosecutors must prove the person meant to cause
injury. The city law, proposed by Councilor Daniel F. Conley (Hyde
Park), would have no such requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require passage by the City Council and the
signature of Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
</P>
<P>
   Conley said he drafted the measure after a recent Bruins game
where objects were thrown onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't reflect well on our city when a handful of unruly
fans disprupts a game on national TV,'' Conley said. ``For some
reason with hockey in particular, you have individuals who have
never played the sport, and they don't understand how dangerous it
can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Conley, an avid hockey player himself, said that ``even a piece
of tape on the ice is enough to knock you over.'' He said it was a
public safety issue because fans could be struck by hurled objects
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Conley said the ordinance has the support of Fleet Center chief
executive Richard Creswick.

MCCAIN PURSUES INDEPENDENT COURSE TOWARD PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Republican presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain of
Arizona carries a Douglas MacArthur-like message on the conflict in
Kosovo that has given him some recognition in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going to be involved in a foreign conflict, you
must figure out the price ... and do what is necessary to win,''
said the 62-year-old former prisoner of war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain appears to be taking the opposite approach in his bid
for the GOP nomination, which he cheerfully acknowledges has
``about as much chance as a snowball in Gila Bend, Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtful, reflective and independent-minded, McCain doesn't
use employ the TV sound bites, sexy themes and partisan rhetoric
that have been keys to victory in recent presidential nomination
races.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about meaty issues like restructuring the military to
emphasize rapid intervention around the world. He continues to
champion campaign finance reform legislation that has been treated
as anathema by Republican Senate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   McCain promises no negative campaigning. He singles out for
praise Democrats such as Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey and former
Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I lose this campaign, I lose,'' he said Monday in a meeting
with Seattle Post-Intelligencer editors. ``I get to live in Arizona
with my wife and four children. I get to serve in the United States
Senate, which is a great job and high responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   It happens that snow has fallen this spring, not in Gila Bend
but in Arizona's Sonora Desert. And McCain is showing signs of
catching on. A recent New Hampshire poll showed him rising from 5
percent to 14 percent support, well behind Texas Gov. George W.
Bush but not too far behind Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpected praise came from Dole's spouse, former Senate
Majority leader Bob Dole, who said he is thinking of giving money
to ``my friend'' McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to keep good people in the race,'' Dole told
The New York Times. ``So I've thought about ways to help McCain in
particular.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is unyielding on limiting the influence of money and
political action committees on running for office. He notes that
most House and Senate members support reform, but have been
thwarted by a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems we have majority rule in most democratic
institutions, except the U.S. Senate,'' he said. He noted the
influence of lobbyists, joking that ``The Telecommunications Act of
1996 protected everyone but the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is chairman of the influential Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee, and as such, his campaign has
become a magnet for donations from Washington, D.C., lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   He took $113,000 in PAC donations last month. While far behind
Bush, he reported $2.7 million cash on hand. And he was raising
money in Seattle Monday. He toured such companies as Airborne
Express and Amazon.com, and held a $1,000-a-head fundraiser Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   McCain promises to be a different kind of president than Bill
Clinton, who has concentrated on domestic issues and offered up
``bite-sized'' programs such as support of uniforms in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would spent a lot more time on foreign policy and national
security,'' said McCain. ``I would spend time talking and think
long-term policy, not policy du jour.''
</P>
<P>
   He would bring to the White House sages ``who think
conceptually'' to develop a bottoms-up approach to key issues _
China's emergence as a superpower, ethnic and tribal strife in the
world, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would seek to reduce what he calls ``the bitter
partisanship that permeates what we do in the nation's capital.''
He promised a kind of bipartisan blast from the past, seeking
counsel of such wise men as former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger, President Carter's security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski,
and George Bush security aide Gen. Brent Scowcroft.
</P>
<P>
   McCain indicated he would revive other aspects of lost
bipartisanship.
</P>
<P>
   A rare western Republican who says his party should do more on
the environment, McCain said he would emphasize reforming and
reauthorizing such environmental laws as the Endangered Species Act
and Clean Air Act. He talked about depletion of the ozone layer and
increased ocean temperatures that have decimated the world's coral
reefs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has emerged as a Senate centrist in the gun control
debate, insisting that regulatory loopholes be closed on such
questions as retrieval of handguns from pawn shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The availability of guns to young people is an issue that
needs to be addressed,'' he said. ``We need to respect both public
opinion and the fundamental protection of our right to bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his wife Cindy have four children, ages 7 to 14. They
have, as parents, received a pre-Littleton education in the
bombardment of young people with violent and explicit videos,
records, and Internet material.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a video game our 11-year-old had that was filled with
gratuitous violence. A guy went from room to room mowing people
down,'' said McCain, who confiscated the game.
</P>
<P>
   The McCains also found their 13-year-old and neighbor kids in
Phoenix were looking at explicit material on the Internet, ``things
I had never seen people doing to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a U.S. senator has advantages. The McCains and neighbor
parents called a meeting and invited an FBI agent to lecture the
kids on child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the pants off 'em,'' Cindy McCain said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, her husband promised, he will call for a universal
ratings system so parents know the violence content of what their
children are watching and hearing.

 &HT;    Corporate aircrafts fly in face of declining profits
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billionaire investor Warren Buffet once called his
aircraft ``The Indefensible,'' referring to its high price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, he named it ``The Indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   Others apparently share those sentiments because corporate
aircraft have made a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Buffet, for example, likes them so much he bought Executive Jet,
a company that arranges for companies to share Gulfstream jets.
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra Bosco, a spokeswoman for the National Business
Aircraft Association, said the industry is doing well because more
companies realize the use of corporate jets ``represents a very
productive and efficient use of employees' time. That's why this is
referred to as a business tool. Basically, it's an office in the
sky.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosco said about 8,000 companies operate business aircraft, from
turbo props to high-end jets like the ones made by Savannah,
Ga.-based Gulfstream. That's up from 6,600 companies in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, many corporations came under fire from
shareholders for owning pricey corporate aircraft in the face of
declining profits. Many decided to shed themselves of these perks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some companies opt for private air travel to avoid delays
at airports, the hassles of baggage check-in and retrieval, and
just for the ability to arrange flights to meet their schedules.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an executive using a corporate jet can hit several
sites in a day. Such a trip might require an overnight stay using
airline service. ``An employee can make it back in time for
dinner,'' Bosco said.
</P>
<P>
   And given the increasing global nature of business, executives
can dash to foreign lands at a moment's notice. A nonstop flight
between New York and Tokyo takes Gulfstream's GV about 12 hours, 40
minutes, compared with nearly 14 hours on commercial jets
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Jameson Inns owns two twin-engine planes to get
its employees to hotel properties throughout the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   President Craig Kitchin said many hotels are located in smaller
markets ``where commercial air isn't convenient, especially if you
have two or three people traveling. There's the convenience of
being able to leave when you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Kitchin's company acquired another hotel company,
which broadens its markets. For that reason, he said, the company
might consider using a private jet in a time-share arrangement with
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   That aspect of corporate travel is on the upswing, said Richard
Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Fractional ownership ``doesn't show up as huge capital spending.
You can get it off your books.''
</P>
<P>
   Aboulafia estimated that 1999 would be a major growth year for
the market, which reached $7.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate aircraft industry is on ``an exceptional high
right now.'' Although, he warned, it could be headed downward as
supply catches up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, Aboulafia said, it's likely to be a correction
and not a major plunge.

 &HT;    General Dynamics makes bid for Gulfstream in $5.3 billion stock
swap
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Savannah, Ga.'s luxury jet-maker Gulfstream Aerospace
would become part of military contractor General Dynamics under a
buyout announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics said it plans to acquire Gulfstream _ one of
Georgia's best-performing public companies of late _ in a
one-for-one stock swap valued at $5.3 billion at Monday's opening
share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Chabraja, chairman of Falls Church, Va.,-based General
Dynamics, said Gulfstream would become a wholly owned subsidiary
``with no change to its existing management, operations, facilities
or work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream executives said the new ownership should benefit the
company by improving access to growth capital and international
markets. A name for the subsidiary wasn't announced, but the
gold-plated Gulfstream brand almost certainly will survive.
</P>
<P>
   The company has built sleek, high-priced business jets for more
than 30 years, with more than 1,000 in use around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream built a record 61planes last year and posted profits
of $225 million on revenue of $2.43 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It makes two planes, the $38 million GV and the $28 million GIV,
and sells them to corporations, governments and the rich and
famous. It also offers ``fractional ownership'' _ basically a time
share.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been primarily owned since 1990 by New York
investment firm Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. The firm initially watched
Gulfstream's fortunes plummet but then overhauled management and
engineered a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann Little took Gulfstream public in 1996 and has made
more than $1.5 billion on stock sales. It would essentially trade
its remaining 23 percent stake for an investment in General
Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's opening prices of $55.63 for Gulfstream and $71.44
for General Dynamics, the stock swap represented a $16-a-share
premium for Gulfstream shareholders when announced before the
market opened.
</P>
<P>
   But initial investor reaction markedly cut that premium.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics shares tumbled $6.18 3/4 to $65.25, while
Gulfstream shares climbed $6.06 1/4 to $61.68 3/4. The true value
of the transaction won't be clear until closing, which executives
said they expect to occur in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes walkaway provisions if General Dynamics' share
price averages below $63 for a 15-day period prior to a Gulfstream
shareholder vote, or if a better offer emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream's annual shareholder meeting had been scheduled this
week but is now delayed to an unspecified date.
</P>
<P>
   The company's financial rebound _ coupled with Forstmann
Little's desire to reap the profits _ had spurred talk of a buyout.
But analysts hadn't expected General Dynamics to be the acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   The Falls Church, Va.-based company exited the aircraft business
in 1993, when it sold a jet fighter business to Lockheed Martin. It
now makes submarines, tanks and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is a little bit of surprise and the street is
viewing it as somewhat of a negative,'' said Paul Marshall of the
Robert W. Baird investment firm, an arm of Northwestern Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really moves away from what General Dynamics has done in
the recent past, which has been to acquire mostly defense
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of baffling to be honest,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics said it will make Gulfstream the foundation of
a revived aviation arm.
</P>
<P>
   Chabraja said General Dynamics expects to use its efficient
manufacturing and design expertise to ``add significant value'' to
Gulfstream, but he did not offer any specific plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream has about 4,500 employees at its main jet plant and
headquarters in Savannah, along with another 3,200 elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Executives there said corporate ownership will provide greater
long-term stability. They also said General Dynamics' focus on
electronics and military business may aid sales of Gulfstream jets
for special government missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a strong parent company like General Dynamics, a
continuing investment in the growth of this company is possible,''
said Gulfstream President and Chief Operating Officer W.W. ``Bill''
Boisture Jr. ``We certainly see good stable employment going
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream has a history of moving back and forth between
independence and control by a larger company.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally a a unit of aircraft-maker Grumman Corp., then
became independent in 1978 under the leadership of aviation
entrepreneur Allen E. Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Chrysler Corp. bought Gulfstream, but five years later
Paulson and Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. engineered an $850 million
buyback.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Gulfstream's fortunes sagged under the weight of
buyout debt and a recession. Forstmann Little Chairman Theodore J.
Forstmann in 1993 named himself chairman and began a management
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Forstmann, who calls his tenure at Gulfstream ``the most
rewarding experience of my business career,'' would remain chairman
of the subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream launched the GV in 1995 while continuing to produce
the older and smaller GIV. The dual product line _ a first for the
company _ hit the market just as the surging economy sparked new
demand for corporate aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The market for top-end business jets remains a narrow and
cyclical one, however, and Canadair is now selling a GV rival
called the Global Express.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Boeing and Airbus are marketing business jet
versions of the smallest airliners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gulfstream is a strong company with a strong product,'' said
Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with Teal Group. ``Whether
(General Dynamics) can make more money than Gulfstream or do a
better job remains to be seen.''

WILL THEY BE UP, OR DOWN (AND OUT)? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They're up, they're down. They are Hall of Famers one
period, a skating shame the next. They can chase Dominik Hasek from
the net one game, but can't get their names on the scoresheet, can
barely stand up on skates, in another.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Black 'n' Gold hockey team is a baffling bunch in the
playoff season of '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what it is,'' said forward Steve Heinze, only
minutes after the Bruins played a couple of sizzling periods
Sunday, for a 4-1 lead, and hung on for a 5-3 win over the Sabres.
``I just saw our team pyschologist and even he asked me, `What is
it? Why is it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Neff is the team psychologist, and he said Monday that
Heinze was one of three players he approached after the game,
soliciting opinions about why the club's play had undergone such
dramatic swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked out of my own curiosity, really, because I'm still
learning, too,'' said Neff. ``I want to understand it as well. It's
not something they really wanted to talk about after a win, but I
felt, hey, if not now, then when? Their answer was pretty much, `I
don't know.' That's OK, we'll delve into it in Sports Psychology
101 at another time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason(s), Sunday's game was the polar opposite of
the Bruins' 3-0 loss Friday night in Marine Midland Arena. After
taking a 2-1 lead into the third period of Game 3 two nights
earlier, only to collapse and lose, 3-2, the Bruins showed up in
Game 4 in desperate need of recovering their game.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious from the drop of the puck Friday night, however,
that their minds remained in suspended animation. The clock may
have been turned ahead by 48 hours, but they still were playing
with the same lethargy and lack of emotion that crept into their
game two nights earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to chase the blues away, they also barely were able to
chase the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an excuse, but I think that was part of it,'' said
No. 1 center Jason Allison. ``We played a couple of very good
periods in Game 3, then lost, and we felt we blew it with a bad
third period. The next game, it was like we couldn't get over it.
Maybe that sucked a little bit of the life out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritty center Tim Taylor, disappointed and angry after the
team-wide poor showing in Game 4, agreed that there was a carryover
of bad karma from the Game 3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to admit that, but it hurt us in Game 4,'' said
Taylor, who needs a series of pain-killing shots to his shoulder
and ribs to suit up. ``No question it carried over in Game 4. You
can say, `Be ready, don't let it happen,' and what have you, but
the truth is, it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor drew a direct comparison between his infamous
toe-in-the-crease viloation in last year's playoffs to what
happened in Games 3 and 4 with the Sabres. In Game 3 of the first
round against the Capitals last season, the Bruins appeared to have
the winning goal _ and a 2-1 series advantage _ until video replay
showed Taylor's miscreant toe had crept an inch or two into Olaf
Kolzig's crease. The Capitals went on to win, 3-2, and 48 hours
later the two sides returned to the ice with the emotional
sledgehammer still pounding on the Bruins' heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens? We lose, 3-0,'' said Taylor, who collected a
pair of key assists in Sunday's win, playing on a reconfigured line
that found Taylor and longtime linemate Rob DiMaio joined by
skilled winger Sergei Samsonov. ``You're ready physically, everyone
always is at this time of the year, and in your mind you think you
are ready _ but the truth is, you aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it just isn't there, and it's because of this
emotional roller coaster you're riding. Pat (Burns) likes to say,
`It's not how hard you get kicked to the curb that counts _ it's
how fast you get up.' Well, we didn't get up; we were still
hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing elimination in Game 5, the Bruins were back at their
puck-pursuing best, virtually unfazed when the Sabres connected for
a 1-0 lead on a quirky goal by Curtis Brown with only 37 seconds
ticked off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right there, you could see we were better,'' said Allison.
``It would have been easy to say, `Oh, my God, here we go again.'
''
</P>
<P>
   In part they were prompted by fear. An elimination game puts a
scare, and an accompanying emotional boost, into every team.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins also were motivated by an emotional plea from
their captain, Ray Bourque, who reminded one and all that there are
only so many kicks at the can. Before the start of the series, the
38-year-old Bourque referred to his Bruins as ``their team,''
noting that the present and the future of the club lies in the
hands of younger, vital performers, such as Allison, Samsonov, and
Anson Carter.
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday's faceoff approached, Bourque reminded everyone that
wishing upon tomorrow can be a dangerous practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't always think,'' said Bourque, now finishing up his 20th
NHL season, ``that you have another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Allison, for one, projected himself into the
not-so-distant future. How would he feel, he wondered, if he were
sitting home and watching the Stanley Cup finals on TV?
</P>
<P>
   How would he feel if one of the teams playing was the Buffalo
Sabres?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, God forbid, but you could play in this league for five
years and not even get out of the first round,'' said Allison, well
aware that the Bruins broke just such a drought with their
first-round victory over Carolina this season. ``That kind of makes
you look ahead right there, and maybe you say to yourself, `Why
couldn't we have won that second round?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When the playoffs started, I think everyone saw there wasn't a
dominating team in the Eastern Conference _ any one of eight teams,
including us, could get to the finals. Here we are now, and we're
one of four teams that could get there. I know, for me, it made me
think, `How disappointed would I be if Buffalo is that team?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Which Bruins team will show up for Game 6 Tuesday night in
Buffalo? If Allison's and Taylor's carryover theory holds, there's
a good chance they'll come out with their Game 5 faces. They not
only have the confidence of the Sunday win to motivate them, but
the added boost that the Sabres pulled Hasek after 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's good that we got him out of there,'' said
Taylor. ``That's a big plus. Let's say we'd had a 2-1 lead going
into the third, and we won a tight one, 3-2 or something, and Hasek
was great. It wouldn't be the same. Instead, we go in thinking,
`Hey, we got to him. We got to Hasek!' If you can get to him once
like that, then obviously he is thinking. Instead of us thinking,
`OK, where are we going to shoot it to beat this guy?' maybe he's
wondering, `Hmm, where are these guys going to shoot?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 of the Mind Games begins at 7:30 p.m.

ZIMMER LEADS A `DIFFERENT' YANKEES TO FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The words still bother Don Zimmer after all these
years. ``They choked!'' He didn't like hearing it in 1978, when he
managed the Red Sox. And he likes it even less today, as interim
manager of the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer heard words to that effect all last week as the defending
World Series champions went through a five-game losing streak that
finally ended Sunday with a 2-1 victory over Chicago. He'll hear it
again if the Yankees, who led the Red Sox by a game going into
Monday night, should drop out of the top spot in the American
League East in a three-game series that starts Tuesday night at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   It is only May, far too early to settle bragging rights. But
it's always special when the ancient rivals square off for the
first time. The rematch is next week in Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve days ago, everything was wonderful,'' said Zimmer. ``We
were 10-12 games over .500 and everything was great. But it got
turned around and we lost five in a row. Hopefully it can turn
around again in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't stand reading, `They choked.' I saw it in 1978 when
our team stopped hitting and lost a 12- or 14-game lead _ just like
our team did this year for 3-4 days. Then (the '78 Sox) started
playing the way we were capable of again and forced a playoff by
making up two games in the last week. To this day, I don't know how
anyone can use the word `choke' for a team that won 99 games.''
</P>
<P>
   A Yankees-Red Sox series always generates extra discussion among
fans in Boston and New York. It would be bizarre enough to see
Roger Clemens pitching in a Yankee uniform in Fenway Park (he is
eligible to come off the disabled list Thursday). Having Zimmer
show up as Yankee manager, while Joe Torre continues his recovery
from prostate cancer, is another added touch.
</P>
<P>
   Another unexpected development is that the Red Sox, who finished
22 games behind a Yankee team that won 114 regular-season games
last year, are neck and neck for first place with a team to which
most everybody conceded the division title. If you are a Yankee
fan, this just cannot happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was true that we weren't playing too well,'' said Yankees
outfielder Paul O'Neill. ``Offensively, we're not scoring runs.
We've wasted a couple of good pitching performances until Sunday.
By no means have we lost faith in what this team can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still think we're going to win the division. That's what
we're here to accomplish, no matter if we win by 22 games like we
did last year or whether we win it by a couple of games. Last year
spoiled a lot of people. But we said from Day One this season, last
year was last year. We're here to win a division and then roll the
dice on reaching the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee team that comes to Fenway is by no means the same one
that won 125 games overall last year. Clemens, the five-time Cy
Young winner, is the most notable new face, obtained in a trade
from Toronto that coast the Yankees David ``Perfect Game'' Wells,
infielder Homer Bush, and lefthanded specialist Graeme Lloyd. You
no longer will see Darryl Strawberry or Tim Raines, either. But
mainstays O'Neill, Chuck Knoblauch, Derek Jeter, Chili Davis, Scott
Brosius, Bernie Williams, and Tino Martinez all are back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had two strong relievers from the get-go in the
bullpen,'' said Zimmer. ``Last year we had Strawberry coming off
the bench and hitting three-run homers. We had a professional
hitter in Tim Raines. We had Homer Bush, who sat on the bench and
when we needed a pinch runner to steal second base came in and
stole second base. I'm not grading our team today. But I am saying
it's a different team.''
</P>
<P>
   And the results have been different. On May 18 last year, the
Yankees were 28-9, had a 3 1/2-game lead, and had won five of
seven. Today, they are 21-15 and have lost five of six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' said Martinez, ``but nothing to fret
about. We had a slump last year but it happened in August and we
had a big lead. When it happens at the beginning of the season,
people notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All teams hit those kind of streaks. You have to battle
through them and get hot again. We can very easily turn around and
win 8-10 in a row and it will all be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of things that don't seem right about the
Yankees these days, starting at the top. Owner George Steinbrenner
has yet to publicly explode, though his presence at Yankee Stadium
Sunday was duly noted, as was his pleasure with the victory.
General manager Brian Cashman, who could do no wrong in 1998, has
had to work even harder in 1999, with fewer results so far. The
loss of Strawberry, who also underwent treatment for cancer and
then ran afoul of the law, was unexpected. The absence of Lloyd in
the bullpen came up more than once during the recent slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned in the previous seasons that a good year has no
impact on the next year,'' said Cashman. ``Any time you defend a
championship, teams are going to be out gunning to knock you down.
We're not talking about a season that has gone down the drain. We
still have a winning record and are in first place. I don't see
anything for us to panic about. And as long as we continue to play
hard, do the little things, and take advantage of the other teams'
mistakes, we'll do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of Torre is a larger problem than the club wants to
admit. He had surgery March 18 and was expected to be out 8-12
weeks. Torre actually is up and about the clubhouse, consulting
players and Zimmer, but he refrains from the daily media sessions
at which he often took the heat off his players last year. So part
of Zimmer's job is to take on all comers. Suddenly, his days in
Boston don't seem so hectic anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my two years of coaching and five years of managing
in Boston,'' said Zimmer, thankful for any reprieve from a barrage
of ``what's wrong with the Yankees?'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good teams there. We were fighting for something every
year. To me, that's what makes a difference. We had some good
offensive teams and were always in something right down to the
wire. That's why I can honestly say I love Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't be saying that Tuesday. He is a Yankee now, and
even one of the darkest moments of his career _ Bucky Dent's home
run that turned around the 1978 one-game playoff _ has become
fodder for just another funny Zimmer story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to the Yankees as a coach in 1983,'' he recalled, ``and
rented Dent's house in New Jersey. Nice house, I thought. But when
I went inside, I saw white shag carpeting and a picture of Bucky in
his home run swing. I walked in the next room, same thing. Go to
the bedroom, same thing. Every room had a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran into him somewhere along the line much later and
couldn't wait to talk to him. I said I turned all the pictures face
down and spit tobacco juice on his shag carperting. He laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   After the past week, a little humor does break the tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know we haven't been playing baseball well,'' said
Davis, whose home run produced the only New York runs Sunday. ``We
don't like to get beat, especially at home. You have to put those
things behind you. Still, it could wind up as a good wakeup call
for us. It makes us realize that everybody we play this year will
be out to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we don't have one or two people who make or break
a team,'' said O'Neill. ``I think we have a group of people who
come together day in and day out and help us win. Some days it's
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is taking the Red Sox for granted, either, said Martinez.
New York was 4-2 against Boston at Yankee Stadium last year, 3-3 at
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox are a good team,'' said Martinez. ``But then, we
have several in our division. If their pitching stays healthy,
they're going to be tough to beat. They don't have Mo Vaughn back
but they have a bunch of guys who put the ball in play and make
things happen, which is what you do when you don't have home
runs.''

WHEN COOKING WHALE, GO HEAVY ON THE SPICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Fixes byline. No other changes.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If the leaders of the Makah keep their word, the 1,600
members of their tribe will soon be eating tons of whale meat and
blubber.
</P>
<P>
   The problem the tribe now faces, is how to cook the gray whale
it killed Monday. Most everyone involved in cooking the last whale
the Makah caught, 70 years ago, is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy and you're only limited by imagination,'' said
Maggie Ahmaogak, the executive director of the Alaska Eskimo
Whaling Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can boil whale, stew it, roast it, grill it, pickle it,
make a soup of it and even serve it frozen. The taste of whale
changes depending on how you cook it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven cooks interviewed last fall in Alaska, Japan and Norway
suggest the Makahs remember two things: Don't expect whale to taste
like chicken and the more spices used, the better. It tastes, they
say, like a cross between shrimp and crab.
</P>
<P>
   A whale the size of the gray the Makahs killed, estimated to be
as least as long as the tribe's 32-foot cedar canoe, can feed most
of their tribe for a while, said sea mammal experts at the
University of Alaska. But tribal leaders admit that many Makah may
not be eager to add whale to their diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course they're going to eat it. Why else would anyone catch
a whale?'' said Charlie Johnson, executive director of Alaska
Nanuuq Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the Makah luck. Once they get back to eating whales
they'll be much healthier. Whales are far more nutritious than land
animals. After a while, the kids will prefer it over burgers,
Twinkies and junk food,'' Johnson said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society said gray
whales taste terrible because they are bottom feeders. Which
prompts some to question how the anti-whaling activist knows how
whale taste.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, experts disagrees with Watson's review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray whales are the most delicious of all,'' said Johnson.
``It's a very rich meat, slightly oily, but finely textured like
veal, or a little like lamb. And the female is tastier than the
male.''
</P>
<P>
   How to cook whale depends pretty much on personal or geographic
tastes, but, as one Eskimo cook said: ``The days of just boiling
the hell out of the whale are gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese serve whale raw, or pickled or fried in a light
tempura batter with Wasabi sauce, made from green horseradishes.
</P>
<P>
   Several Norwegian recipes call for marinating whale meat in red
wine, cloves and sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Eskimos, anything goes, culinarily speaking,.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tabasco sauce is the secret. The real good old stuff from
Louisiana. We fly cases of it in here,'' said Hunter Michelbrink,
an extension service agent in Barrow, Alaska. The village of 5,000
far above the Arctic Circle catches and eats 22 whales a year,
usually Beluga and Bowheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pickled is my favorite way of cooking it,'' said Lilly
Leavitt, the 27-year-old daughter of a Barrow whaling captain.
``You boil it for a little while and leave it over night or for a
few days in vinegar, sugar and some spices. It's really
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Flora Brower's husband caught a 42-foot Bowhead last fall. Her
preferred method to cook muktuk, pieces of thick skin and blubber,
is to cut it into small cubes, boil it with hot chilies and other
spices and serve with a strong mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Pan-frying two-inch-thick steaks is also great, said Rebbi
Maakiki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown lots of garlic, peppers and onions cut in large pieces.
Sear the meat in a very hot pan, about four-minutes on a side and
you've got heaven in a pan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Also popular, said Ahmaogak, is a form of whale Popsicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A thin piece of frozen meat dipped in rendered blubber oil. It
is a real treat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If none of these ideas interest the Makahs, the files of the
Department of Interior contains recipes for stuffed whale roast,
fillet of whale with mushrooms, whale pot roast and several other
selections.
</P>
<P>
   The Makahs have released few details on how they will butcher
and distribute the whale meat. In Alaska, the Eskimos usually
follow tradition that goes back decades.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of catch, after the butchering, the captain's wife
must cook for the whole town.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of the whaling boat gets the first choice of cuts.
It's usually two, 2- or 3-feet-wide pieces out of the center of the
whale and it's called the captain's belt, the most tender meat of
the whale.
</P>
<P>
   The back third get placed in storage or ice cellars to be cooked
and served to villagers on Thanksgiving and Christmas. The front
third is divided up among those other boats who helped with the
task of towing the whale in and butchering it.
</P>
<P>
   The whaling commission boss, Ahmaogak, has some words of caution
for the Makah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have forgotten a lot about cooking whale but they
must remember that if they're going to butcher the whale on a
beach, and not on the ice like we do, they had better watch for
rocks and shells in the meat or they can crack lots of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, make sure you clean the intestines really,
really well and cook them for a very long time.''

 &HT;    Mariner Post-Acute to lay off over 7,000 workers
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mariner Post-Acute Network, citing deep Medicare
reimbursement cuts, announced Monday that it was laying off about
7,300 employees nationwide and nearly 300 in Georgia, due to
closing its rehabilitation business and a restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Mariner, among the top three nursing-home
operators nationally, also reported a second-quarter loss of about
$79 million. Mariner's shares fell 31 1/4 cents to $2.68 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The company was formed last year in a merger of Atlanta-based
Paragon Health Network and Mariner Health Group of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner's financial troubles, though, are part of an
industry-wide trend, as nursing home chains are reeling from
Medicare payment changes. Another nursing-home company, Sun
Healthcare, has announced huge losses and the elimination of 10,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare last year switched to a reimbursement system that pays
fixed daily fees for patients depending on their illness, instead
of reimbursing nursing homes for their costs. But the flat fees are
based on 1995 costs, said Fred Watson of the Georgia Nursing Home
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner said it's now getting $90 per resident per day less from
Medicare as a result of the change. ``There have been many bombs
dropped on our building, but the nuclear bomb was that one,'' said
Kirill Goncharenko, a company vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare also has capped the amount of physical, occupational
and speech therapy a patient can receive in a year. Mariner cited
those caps as a reason for closing its rehabilitation business.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter ending March 31, Mariner lost $78.8
million, or $1.07 per share, on revenues of $614.7 million. The
quarter included a $30 million charge related to bad debt. The
company, as Paragon, lost $4.5 million, or 11 cents a share, on
revenues of $487.2 million in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For the six months, Mariner lost $117.8 million, or $1.61 per
share, vs. a loss of $45.3 million, or $1.02 a share a year ago.
Revenues rose to $1.3 billion from $908.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting a weak quarter; this is far weaker than we
expected,'' said analyst Victor Seoane of Robinson-Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   The next six months are important for Mariner, Seoane added.
``They have to improve their cash flow, and I would expect to see
some asset sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariner already is selling 172 outpatient rehabilitation clinics
to Birmingham-based HealthSouth for an undisclosed price.

RUSSIA'S LARGEST OIL PRODUCER TO TAKE OVER COMPETITOR
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, announced Monday
that it planned a new share issue and stock swap to acquire another
domestic oil company, a move analysts said would give Lukoil a
sizable presence in one of the most promising oilfields in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Lukoil declined to identify the company it would buy, but oil
analysts here believe it to be Komitek, a small holding concern in
far northwestern Russia. Lukoil executives had said in the past
that they were holding acquisition talks with Komitek. With proven
reserves of 1.36 billion barrels, Komitek is far smaller than
Lukoil, which has reserves of about 16.86 billion barrels. But the
acquisition would allow Lukoil to consolidate a position it has
been building over the last year through buyouts and partnerships
with Western companies in the Timan Pechora basin, an oil shelf
that holds at least several billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Such deposits are increasingly valuable with the rise in oil
prices in the last several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal makes very much sense, businesswise,'' said Erik
Wigertz, an oil analyst with Brunswick Warburg, a brokerage firm
here. ``It gives Lukoil control over much of the major oil assets
in northwest Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition talks helped to lift Lukoil common shares nearly
13 percent, to $9.20, and its preferred shares rose 9 percent, to
$3.40. But the increase also reflected a broad rally in the Russian
stock market on news from Saturday that an impeachment effort
against President Boris Yeltsin had failed. The benchmark Russian
Trading System index rose 11.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In its announcement Monday, Lukoil said it would seek approval
at its annual shareholders meeting in late June for an issue of
11.5 million preferred shares. The share issue would dilute
preferred shares by about 12.5 percent, but most of those holders
are management and employees of Lukoil who had agreed in broad
terms last year to the issuing of preferred shares. Lukoil would
then swap the preferred shares for equity in the acquired company.
Lukoil said the terms of the swap would be announced by June 15.
</P>
<P>
   The investment banks Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and Nikoil have
been chosen as financial consultants for the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to this, Lukoil prices will most assuredly go up,''
said Valery Nesterov, an oil analyst with Flemings UCB, a Moscow
unit of the British investment house Robert Fleming Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of 1998, Lukoil has steadily moved into the
Timan Pechora region. The company's main fields are in western
Siberia, but those fields are gradually being depleted. As a
result, Lukoil has staked out major positions in southern Russia
and the northern Caspian Sea region, and now, northern Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already acquired an exploration company called
Arkhangelsk Geoldobychiye, which holds licenses to drill in some of
the best sites in the Timan Pechora region. Lukoil entered into a
project with Conoco, a unit of DuPont, called the Northern
Territories, which over time may yield about a billion barrels. It
is also involved in the Timan Pechora Co., a consortium of oil
concerns including Texaco and Exxon that has rights to fields with
an estimated twobillion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Komitek, this is an inevitability,'' said James Henderson,
an oil analyst with the Moscow brokerage firm Renaissance Capital.
``Lukoil is now the driving force in the region, and Komitek was a
junior company in comparison. And you need a major player like
Lukoil to bring in the foreign investment and the government
agreements to build the infrastructure to get the oil out of
here.''

VIRUS DAMAGED BASKETBALL STAR'S HEART, EXAMINER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The chief Massachusetts medical examiner said once
again Monday that Celtics star Reggie Lewis died because his heart
was damaged by a common virus and weakened by structural defects,
and that cocaine use played no role in his death.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in the medical malpractice lawsuit filed by Lewis's
widow, Dr. Richard Evans said scarring on Lewis's heart had been
caused by adenovirus, a simple virus spread by coughing and
sneezing. In addition, the aorta and mitral valve in Lewis's heart
were malformed, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans's testimony reiterated the findings made by a team of
local and out-of-state consultants four months after the
27-year-old Lewis collapsed and died while casually shooting
baskets at Brandeis University on July 27, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   It also mirrored the conclusions reached by state officials
after a review of the original autopsy findings in March 1995. The
review was prompted by a report in The Wall Street Journal
suggesting that cocaine use was a likely factor in Lewis's death.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewis's autopsy report, the former Celtics captain
died of a ``terminal arrhythmia'' caused by myocarditis, an
inflammation of the heart muscle that can cause scar tissue. That
scar tissue, in turn, can trigger fatal arrhythmias, uncontrolled
flutterings of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who supervised the investigation into the cause of
Lewis's death, said three other medical conditions also were
factors in the death: cardiac hypertrophy, or enlargement of the
heart; mild coarctation, or narrowing, of the aorta, the main
artery that carries blood from the heart; and mild mitral valve
prolapse, or malformation of the valve on the left side of the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   But under cross-examination by an attorney for Dr. Gilbert H.
Mudge Jr., Lewis's chief cardiologist, Evans acknowledged that four
medical consultants who assisted with the autopsy made no mention
of healed myocarditis _ the heart condition Evans reported as a
cause of Lewis's death _ in their reports to him.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy findings became the subject of considerable
controversy following publication of the Journal article, which
suggested that medical officials may have been under pressure not
to raise the possibility of cocaine use in the autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   The article also quoted two of the autopsy consultants _
cardiologist Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in
Brighton and John Fallon, a pathologist formerly of Massachusetts
General Hospital and now of Mount Sinai Medical Center and School
of Medicine in New York _ as saying the scarring to Lewis's heart
was ``consistent with'' the use of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Journal story was published, state health
officials ordered another investigation of Lewis's death. Conducted
by State Police, the review confirmed the autopsy's original
findings and found nothing to confirm that Lewis's widow, Donna
Harris-Lewis, or any other member of his family had pressured the
medical examiner's office to avoid mentioning cocaine as a possible
cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   From the witness stand Monday, Evans said several factors led
him to conclude that cocaine played no role in Lewis's death. For
one, he said, ``Cocaine often has to be used again and again and
again over time in order to produce significant heart damage,'' and
the player's heart did not show scarring consistent with repeated
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Evans also said other parts of Lewis's body, such as his
kidneys, showed no sign of cocaine damage, as they might if Lewis
had used the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no indication this man had been a chronic user of
this drug,'' Evans said. ``I did not get the idea at all that I was
looking at multiple repeated bouts of a noxious stimulant to the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans also noted that hospital records indicated Lewis had
suffered from an upper respiratory infection the winter before his
death, suggesting a recent bout with adenovirus.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that his findings were backed by Jesse Edwards, a
former president of the American Heart Association and a consultant
on the Lewis case. But Mudge's attorney, William J. Dailey Jr.,
suggested Monday that Edwards has never viewed a cocaine-damaged
heart in the course of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that I absolutely know that,'' said Evans.

LUCAS MAKES THE LONG WAIT WELL WORTH IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Rating: 3 1/2 stars 
(Editor's note: We are retransmitting this review that was for use
Sunday, May 9)  
By  BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The prequel has landed. ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas' madly anticipated follow-up to
his epic ``Star Wars'' movie trilogy, is finally here.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Phantom Menace,'' is pretty good. Outstanding in
many parts _ once it gets rolling. When you get past the setup, the
rest is intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   It's Lucas' first directing effort since the original ``Star
Wars'' film, which changed the movie dreamscape forever 22 years
ago. It has nearly 2,000 digital special-effects shots. That's by
far the most ever seen in one film _ four times the number that
``Titanic'' had. It also takes us to dazzling new worlds teeming
with outlandish alien creatures. There are even some fine actors
along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' strengths as a filmmaker and mythmaker have been nothing
but enhanced by the advances in computer graphics technology that
his own company, Industrial Light &AMP; Magic, has been at the
forefront of developing for the past decade. His genius for visual
grandeur and kinetic excitement has never been realized with the
photo-realistic detail seen here.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that ``Phantom Menace'' presents the most
elaborate, thoroughly integrated fantasy universe ever put on film.
You could watch it without sound and still be enthralled. More
enthralled in some stretches, since Lucas' main deficiency as a
writer and director _ which can be summed up as a tin ear for
dialogue and its delivery _ apparently can't be improved upon by
high-tech wizardry. And because the early parts of ``Phantom
Menace'' are the talkier ones, they're by nature the least
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's action from the get-go _ one short, early
monster bit is wittier and scarier than all of last year's
``Godzilla'' remake _ the film's first 45 minutes are devoted
mainly to extensive exposition and introductions. There probably
are not too many ways around that, though it would have helped if
the human characters displayed more personality than the sets.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Set three or so decades before the first ``Star
Wars,'' ``Phantom Menace'' mainly is concerned with the decay of a
democratic but ineffectual galactic republic and the origins of the
boy who will become Darth Vader, both key factors in the
forthcoming rise of the evil Empire. A plot summary follows, so
stop reading now if you don't want to know that happens.
</P>
<P>
   A masterful if somewhat unorthodox Jedi knight, Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson), and his eager young apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan
McGregor, not even trying to sound like Alec Guinness), are
dispatched to settle a dispute between the greedy, militaristic
Trade Federation and the teen-age Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman)
of the Eden-like planet Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   The monkish warriors, practitioners of the good part of that
cosmic spiritual essence called the Force, are almost immediately
attacked by the federation's skeletal, birdlike robot soldiers.
They barely escape with the deposed queen to the outlaw desert
planet of Tatooine.
</P>
<P>
   You'll recall that that's where we first encountered the hero of
the original trilogy, Luke Skywalker. This time, while hunting for
spare parts to repair their damaged spaceship, Qui-Gon encounters
9-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd, whom you may have seen
playing Arnold Schwarzenegger's kid in ``Jingle All the Way'').
</P>
<P>
   Though a slave to a kind of flying blue cross between a mosquito
and a vulture named Watto, young Anakin possesses a mechanical
genius (he's already built a humorously see-through prototype
version of the fussy droid C-3PO) and an attunement to the Force
that, by Qui-Gon's reckoning, is off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Young Anakin proves his mettle _ and kicks the movie into high
gear _ when he enters an all-or-nothing pod race that could earn
him his freedom or a ghastly early death. This long, grippingly
intense sequence is worth the price of a ticket alone.
</P>
<P>
   The pod racers are rickety constructs of twin jet engines
connected to small, exceedingly vulnerable driving modules. The
race itself, several laps around the rocky, barren Tatooine
landscape, is like the ``Ben-Hur'' chariot sequence in anti-gravity
overdrive. It's a senses-shattering suite of speed and sound
(forget what was said about watching in silence earlier; Ben Burtt,
Lucas' quadruple Oscar-winning sound designer, does the best work
of his career here) that elevates the movie, and the movies, to a
new level.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, ``Phantom Menace'' crisply careens from one
awesome spectacle to another. There's a visit to Coruscant, a
planet entirely covered by a city. There's plenty of fancy
spacecraft jockeying. A younger, greener Yoda, still puppeted and
voiced by the incomparable Frank Oz, makes a welcome appearance.
And there's the inevitable fight to regain the Italianate ice cream
castles of Naboo, which incorporates battle elements from all the
previous films and finds ways to top most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the key new characters, the computer-generated, comically
klutzy amphibian creature Jar Jar Binks is, as many feared,
initially annoying. But the floppy-eared goon grows more tolerable
as the film goes along, something that could not be said about
Ewoks. And the way he interacts so intimately with Qui-Gon, Anakin
and the gang is never short of astounding.
</P>
<P>
   As for main villain Darth Maul, the demonic practitioner of the
dark side of the Force is portrayed with great gymnastic vigor, if
not exactly deep resonance, by martial arts stunt master Ray Park.
Neither is likely to threaten Han Solo's position at the top of the
``Star Wars'' character canon. But it would be wrong to leave
anyone with the impression that Lucas hasn't written anything as
interesting as what he shows us here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace,'' by turns more serious and more childlike
than the earlier trilogy, truly seems to express the whole mythos
from young Anakin's point of view. This is not wrong; not only is
``Star Wars'' the ultimate boy's adventure of our era, the whole
saga is clearly now about Anakin's troubling evolution, and it is
only fitting that we start out on that path in his hopeful,
wonder-driven shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Lucas refines the scope of his mythic theme here,
moving from archetypal heroic elements to more specifically
Judeo-Christian ideas about the struggle between good and evil. He
even lays the ground for a pretty sophisticated political allegory
_ and a sadly relevant one. Debate in the Galactic Senate over the
Naboo situation sounds presciently similar to current discussions
of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There is, then, great storytelling in ``Phantom Menace.'' Lucas
just expresses it better with pictures than words. And this movie
has some of the greatest pictures ever whipped up in cyberspace or
on celluloid, which is certainly fitting for the millennial chapter
of the movie century's most popular fantasy. &QL;

4 BOYS CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY IN MICHIGAN SCHOOL THREAT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HURON, Mich. _ A third of the desks sat empty Monday at
Holland Woods Middle School because students and their parents were
afraid of what evils might prowl the school grounds after a bomb
was found and four boys were accused of planning a Colorado-style
school massacre here.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the most serious threat of school violence since
the deaths of 14 student and a teacher in Littleton, Colo. last
month, four Holland Woods Middle School students _ aged 12 to 14 _
were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after
they planned to imitate the Colorado shooting rampage, a school
administrator said Monday. Two boys were arrested Wednesday and two
were arrested Thursday. Hours after the last was in custody, a bomb
was found outside the middle school the boys had allegedly planned
to attack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was safely defused, and police are investigating
whether there was a connection between the four boys who were
arrested and the person who placed the bomb. Two 14-year-olds,
Justin J. Schnepp and Jedaiah D. Zinzo, were charged as adults. A
12-year-old and a 13-year-old were charged as juveniles, and
remained unidentified. The boys and their parents either declined
to comment or could not be reached for comment. Police and
prosecutors refused to release details about the boys' plans or the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The plot seems to be inspired by the attack in Littleton, Colo.
last month. ``There's no question that it was tied to that,'' said
Thomas C. Miller, the assistant schools superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that residents remain anxious. ``We don't have the
person that placed the bomb in custody,'' so parents and students
are worried, said Capt. Brian J. Moeller of the Port Huron police.
</P>
<P>
   Parents said they were afraid to send their kids to school.
Terrie Kendrick said she and her husband had come to the school
Monday because ``our daughter's in there.'' They would have kept
her home, but she will qualify for a $5,000 college scholarship if
she maintains her perfect attendance record through high school,
Mrs. Kendrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Their son is at home. ``He's scared,'' said his father, Steve
Kendrick. ``A lot of kids are really scared here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an unfamiliar feeling in this quiet midwestern city of
40,000. Holland Woods Middle School is in a bucolic middle class
neighborhood a few blocks from a beach on the St. Clair River,
which separates Port Huron and Canada. Students often gather there
to watch the Great Lakes freighters pass so close it seems you
could touch them from the shore.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 schools in Port Huron were closed Friday as a precaution
after the bomb was found, and Monday they reopened. At Holland
Woods Middle School, police and parents guarded the entrances,
backpacks were banned and bags were checked on entrance, but some
said students who came to school were in good spirits. Colleen A.
Reilly, 42, who has a sixth-grader at the school and who works in
the cafeteria, said a couple of kids told her ``it feels good to
have the school back to normal.'' Normal it was: lunch was hot
dogs, corn dogs, or fish patties with corn.
</P>
<P>
   She said the four kids involved did not seem like troublemakers,
and that the arrests here were unexpected. ``It happens anyplace, I
guess _ look at that little town in Colorado,'' she said, referring
to Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of school closings and even arrests
because of threats to schools nationwide since last month's attack
in Colorado. ``It becomes very real and very easy for a student to
make a threat and for school and law enforcement officials not to
know whether it is a prank or it is a serious threat,'' said June
Lane Arnette, associate director of the National School Safety
Center in Westlake Village, Calif. ``Our godsend right now is that
the end of school is in sight,'' she said. Most classes end next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Elwood L. Brown, the St. Clair County prosecuting attorney, said
it was not simply a case of kids making idle threats. ``I wouldn't
have charged them with the seriousness of the crime if it wasn't
that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the Littleton killings inspired something else here:
a girl who knew of the plans told school authorities, who alerted
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a hero,'' said Miller, the assistant superintendent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   In the Dallas suburb of Allen, Texas, school officials who last
week said they were suspending the final two weeks of classes after
repeated bomb threats said students would return later this week
for staggered classes. Officials said Sunday that they only wanted
to confuse those calling in the threats and were not canceling the
rest of the year outright. ``There has been a lot of
miscommunication,'' complained a parent, Scott Gleason. ``If they
weren't really closing down, why the heck did they let this get
publicized for two solid days?''
</P>
<P>
   In West Palm Beach, Fla., Saturday's prom at Palm Beach Lakes
High School ended early when a nail-studded pipe bomb was found
hidden inside an indoor tree planter by the hotel's ballroom
entrance. Police with bomb-sniffing dogs found nothing after a
search of the high school Monday and classes began on schedule.

CVS BUYS SOMA.COM IN MOVE TO ESTABLISH ONLINE PHARMACY
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that could signal tough competition for online
pharmacies, the CVS Corp., a leading drugstore chain, said Monday
it had purchased Soma.com, the first Internet drug store, for $30
million in CVS stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to close next month, gives CVS a
head start over other established drugstore chains like Walgreen
Co. and Rite Aid that have yet to bring their offerings fully
online, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they said, the low price suggests the slow
progress online pharmacies have made since entering the
electronic-commerce fray with great fanfare earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major victory for brick-and-mortar retailing, that a
dot.com company doesn't believe its business model is viable enough
just as a dot.com company,'' said Mark Husson, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch. ``Either CVS has gotten the biggest bargain in
history, or these online drugstores aren't worth very much as
stand-alone pharmacies.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Pigott, chief executive of Soma, said the deal represented
``a winning combination, out of necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, Internet-only pharmacies have been
unable to join many insurance networks that cover prescription
medications. As a result, no online pharmacy can guarantee that all
customers will have their prescriptions covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge barrier,'' Pigott said.
</P>
<P>
   Many health insurers hire outside companies to perform
mail-order subscription re-fills, which account for roughly 15
percent of the estimated $100 billion prescription market. Since
online pharmacies perform essentially the same service as
mail-order companies, some insurers have balked at the competition.
Pigott said some insurers, whom he declined to identify, ``have
told us they have their own plans for going online, and that has
made things very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as with traditional pharmacies, prescriptions are the
lynchpin of a successful drug store, since they attract the
customers, who then also buy other health-related items. Indeed,
Soma and its main rivals, Drugstore.com and Planetrx, have
projected that a large chunk of total revenues will come from
non-prescription items.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Dunlevy, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners, an
investment banking firm, said Planetrx and Drugstore.com would
eventually break the stalemate. ``Given the traffic on
Drugstore.com already, the insurance companies are going to get on
the bandwagon,'' she said. ``The only question is when.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without the insurers, the Internet-only pharmacies
suddenly face a fierce competitor in CVS, which claims more than 55
million prescription customers and more than 9,000 insurance
providers. In effect, that means nearly all insured customers who
visit the Soma site will have their prescription covered. CVS's
substantial marketing dollars and buying power will also insure
that it can survive price competition with Internet rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Zigerelli, executive vice president of corporate
development for CVS, said the company bought Soma for the same
price it would have paid to build its own site.
</P>
<P>
   CVS and Soma executives said Soma would continue to operate
under its own name and Web address until late summer, when it would
switch to the CVS location. Meanwhile, the CVS site will gradually
adopt components of the Soma site.

WAL-MART SETTLES LAWSUIT WITH MEXICAN COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Filed in the ``a'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRAVIS E. POLING and ADOLFO PESQUERA  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Lawyers for Wal-Mart Stores and a Mexican company
settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit Monday as a Texas jury
prepared to consider punishing the huge American retailer with
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides declined to reveal the settlement amount, but a
Wal-Mart statement said the deal would force the company to take a
3-cents-per-share charge against earnings, or roughly $133.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Bexar County jury ruled that Wal-Mart and a
subsidiary should pay $624 million in actual damages to the Valores
Corp., a grocery wholesaler in Monterrey, Mexico. The panel was to
meet again Monday in state District Judge Martha Tanner's courtroom
to set punitive damages against Wal-Mart and its subsidiary, the
McLane Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for both sides worked over the weekend to reach a
settlement and finalized a deal Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart issued a statement early Monday saying an agreement had
been reached for ``less than'' the actual damages of $624 million.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement stems from a 1993 breach-of-contract lawsuit
filed by Valores against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart and
McLane, a wholesale grocery company headed by Drayton McLane, the
Temple, Texas, businessman who owns Major League Baseball's Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Valores claimed that McLane _ at the behest of Wal-Mart
officials _ backed out of an agreement to team up in a wholesale
grocery distribution company in Mexico. Documentation in the
Valores lawsuit also showed that the final paperwork on the Valores
deal with McLane was slowed because Wal-Mart was working out a deal
in Mexico with that country's largest retailer, CIFRA, to create a
chain of Sam's Club warehouse stores in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While talking to jurors after the settlement, Kendall
Montgomery, co-counsel for Valores, passed out magnetic buttons _
part of a courtroom exhibit during the five-week trial _ picturing
a handshake and the words ``There was an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors, who were dismissed after the settlement, said they
agreed with the plaintiffs and would have awarded as much $1.8
billion in punitive damages if given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Cedillo, the lead lawyer for Valores, jokingly said he
would try to back out of the settlement if that was the case. One
juror screamed, ``No! We're not going back to court.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-week courtroom battle of big business embittered some
of the jurors. None of the 12 jurors and four alternates would be
quoted by name.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Friday's verdict, one juror said: ``We wanted to
make a statement that _ whether its an American company or not _ a
company can't go across the border, sign a deal with somebody and
then just drop that for another deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagal Wheatley, a lawyer for Wal-Mart, called the settlement
``a business decision'' and said an appeal would have taken at
least another three years of costly legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than to spend several more years in litigation, the
better course was to attempt to achieve a settlement that makes
much more sense than the verdict the jury rendered,'' Wheatley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery also characterized the decision as a smart business
decision for the family-owned Valores. He said it would now be
``business as usual'' for the 70-year-old Mexican company owned by
the Chapa family.

   Wal-Mart did not regard the lawsuit as being a threat to future
earnings. The company said it wasn't involved in any lawsuit other
than those that were ``routine (and) incidental to its business,''
according to its annual report dated April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The agreed-upon settlement made few waves on Wall Street. The
company's stock closed at $45.69, down 69 cents in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 6.2 million, lower than the
average of 9 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, too, were generally unconcerned. ``This is not going
to be an issue for investors,'' said Bernard Sosnick of JW Genesis
Capital Markets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Wayne Hood of Prudential Securities in Atlanta agreed
that ``this won't affect Wal-Mart's ongoing store operations.''

 &HT;    Exploding soda bottle sends students scurrying
 &HT;    By Katherine Ullmer and Margo Rutledge Kissell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The empty school cafeteria at Ankeney Junior High
School in Beavercreek said it all Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Half-eaten sandwiches, chocolate chip cookies with just one bite
gone, a nickel left on one tray, a dime on another. About 50 trays
or lunches left in a hurry. A large, gray trash can near the food
line, full of empty pop cans for recycling, showed little sign of
earlier events.
</P>
<P>
   About 12:30 p.m. Monday, a plastic pop-bottle exploded inside
the trash can, emptying the 880-student school and leaving some
parents in near panic when they heard various reports about an
``explosion'' at the school over the radio or television around
1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By late Monday, police charged a 16-year-old boy with a
delinquency count of inducing panic and took the teen to the Greene
County Juvenile Detention Center. The teen is expected to appear in
juvenile court today. A second student who police questioned was
released.
</P>
<P>
   No students or teachers were injured, though school custodian
Carl Watson and school security guard Christy Davis, received minor
burns. The two apparently touched some sort of ``acid'' or chemical
used to make the plastic pop bottle bomb, Beavercreek Police Sgt.
George Moody said. Watson refused treatment and Davis was
transported to Grandview Hospital, where she was treated and
released.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, who was doing his normal lunch-time cafeteria duty and
standing next to the trash can when the explosion occurred,
returned to clean the room up after police left the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like a small fire cracker,'' he said. ``It was very
serious when it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninth-grader Steven Scott, 15, was in the cafeteria when he
heard a loud bang across the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was a (potato) chip bag bursting at first ...
but it was a lot louder than that,'' Scott said, adding a few girls
screamed and then a hush came over the cafeteria as everyone tried
to figure out what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said students didn't panic and filed out orderly when
they heard the fire alarm go off.
</P>
<P>
   Moody described the bomb as 16- or 20-ounce plastic pop bottle
``with some type of acidy solution that went off in a trash can. If
it had been a more militant type explosive, we would have had a
bomb squad,'' he said. Moody said police got a call at 12:31 p.m.
from someone at the school on the report of a minor explosion. No
bomb threat had been called in previous to the explosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As students stood outside, police and school officials searched
lockers and made a room-by-room search to make sure no other
explosives were in the school. None were found.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities would not say whether they believed the device was
made at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are investigating the matter thoroughly,''
Beavercreek City Schools Superintendent G. Ronald Bickert said.
</P>
<P>
   He said students were evacuated as a precautionary measure in
the wake of the tragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., which has heightened parents' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have become very anxiety ridden, very concerned about
their children. We are concerned about their children and about
them so we have decided any incident at this point in time based on
the intensity of the concerns we would evacuate the building to
make sure a thorough investigation is conducted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As teachers stood with groups of students outside the building,
parents rushed to a field near a baseball diamond where the
children waited. Returning to their vehicles many had their arms
draped around their children.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Vincent said she almost drove her van into a ditch
hurrying to park. Once there, she couldn't find her son, Matt, 13,
a seventh grader. She said teachers assured her he was probably on
one of the buses called to take students home early, around 2 p.m.
Unnerved from worry, ``I couldn't remember what bus he rides,'' she
said. ``If all these kids wanted to do was raise the anxiety level
of fear and panic of parents, teachers and their fellow students by
doing this, they've done it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes every school in the district should have
an armed police guard to keep kids safe, and that if it takes a tax
to pay for it, everyone should be willing to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Parent Mike Creech said he heard about an ``explosion'' at the
school while watching TV. ``I flew over here,'' he said. He
retrieved his daughter Kelly, 14, an eighth grader. ``I'm pretty
scared,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to this school growing up, and we never had anything
like this,'' Creech said. ``I just don't understand why kids have
to resort to this kind of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Connie Wright was disturbed by what happened. Her son, Thomas
Wright, a seventh grader, was standing in the lunch line not far
from the trash can when the explosion occurred. He said the
incident makes him a little nervous to go back to the school, where
classes will be held until June 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kids thinking it's funny and they are going to scare
people but they are really causing people problems and they are
going to hurt somebody,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   After all of the students had left, Principal David Elliott
returned to the school building at 3:20 p.m. He said none of the
students expressed fear to him, but ``I supposed this is probably
bound to generate some. Our job now is to work with the students to
try to help them feel better about their level of safety in the
school environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said student assemblies would be held at the school this
morning about student responsibility and safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important for us to try to maintain every
sense of a normal school environment, that we have to try to work
with the students and let them know they have to be responsible for
their behavior and if they are aware of any potential threatening
behaviors they need to share that information with authorities,''
he said.

WAL-MART SETTLES LAWSUIT WITH MEXICAN COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Filed in the ``a'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRAVIS E. POLING and ADOLFO PESQUERA  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Lawyers for Wal-Mart Stores and a Mexican company
settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit Monday as a Texas jury
prepared to consider punishing the huge American retailer with
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides declined to reveal the settlement amount, but a
Wal-Mart statement said the deal would force the company to take a
3-cents-per-share charge against earnings, or roughly $133.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Bexar County jury ruled that Wal-Mart and a
subsidiary should pay $624 million in actual damages to the Valores
Corp., a grocery wholesaler in Monterrey, Mexico. The panel was to
meet again Monday in state District Judge Martha Tanner's courtroom
to set punitive damages against Wal-Mart and its subsidiary, the
McLane Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for both sides worked over the weekend to reach a
settlement and finalized a deal Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart issued a statement early Monday saying an agreement had
been reached for ``less than'' the actual damages of $624 million.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement stems from a 1993 breach-of-contract lawsuit
filed by Valores against Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart and
McLane, a wholesale grocery company headed by Drayton McLane, the
Temple, Texas, businessman who owns Major League Baseball's Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Valores claimed that McLane _ at the behest of Wal-Mart
officials _ backed out of an agreement to team up in a wholesale
grocery distribution company in Mexico. Documentation in the
Valores lawsuit also showed that the final paperwork on the Valores
deal with McLane was slowed because Wal-Mart was working out a deal
in Mexico with that country's largest retailer, CIFRA, to create a
chain of Sam's Club warehouse stores in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While talking to jurors after the settlement, Kendall
Montgomery, co-counsel for Valores, passed out magnetic buttons _

ANDALUSIAN DRIVES  
 BRAZILIAN AIR PASS  
 MILLENNIUM'S EVE IN PARIS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. (italics)I'm planning a driving trip in Spain and would like
to see Andalusia's White Towns. Can you give me some tips on
possible routes? _ Sandy R. Richardson, Seattle(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The White Towns in the region of Andalusia in southern Spain
are some 25 villages distinguished by their large numbers of
whitewashed buildings. There are several driving routes, but
tourism officials suggest that the trip start in Arcos de la
Frontera and end in Ronda, or vice versa, a distance of about 44
miles, which can be covered in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Arcos, with a population of 27,000, is on the banks of the
Guadalete River, and was inhabited in the Roman era. Its historic
section includes the Condes de Aguila Palace, a former home of
Muslim rulers and the Santa Maria de la Asuncion Church, done in
the Gothic-Mudejar style, both from the 15th century.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Ronda, population 34,500, was founded by the Celts.
It straddles the spectacular gorge cut by the Guadalevin River. The
Ronda bullring, built in 1785, is considered the oldest
bullfighting plaza still in use in Spain. The old town gates
include the 13th-century Puerta de Almocabar.
</P>
<P>
   Between the start and finish of the drive are such picturesque
towns as Ubrique, known for its leather goods, and Zahara de la
Sierra, next to the reservoir of the same name, a village that
Arabs founded in the eighth century and that has been declared a
national monument.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the drive, you can use either Highway N-342 or the
narrower, more winding C-344. Maps are available at the tourist
offices in Arcos (34-95) 6-702-264 and in Ronda (34-95) 287-1272,
which are generally open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other routes are the 30-mile Central Route, which goes
from Zahara de la Sierra to Prado del Rey, and includes a loop
through the towns of Grazalema, Villaluenga del Rosario, Benaocaz,
Ubrique, El Bosque, and Benamahoma; the 32-mile Western Route, from
Villa-martin to Algar, going through Espera, Bornos and Arcos de la
Frontera; the 44-mile Northern Route from Puerto Serrano to Olvera
and passing through Algodonales, El Gastor, Setenil, Alcala del
Valle and Torre Alhaquime; and the 40-mile Eastern Route from Ronda
to Algatocin, including Montejaque, Cortes de la Frontera, Atajate
and Benadilid.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact the Tourist Office of Spain, 666
Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10103; (212) 265-8822. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you know anything about a Brazilian air pass? _
Sophia R. Perkins, Albany, N.Y.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you're planning on taking more than two round-trip flights
within Brazil, the Brazilian Air Pass is the economical way to go.
It must be bought outside Brazil, either through travel agencies or
through the foreign offices of Brazilian airlines, like Varig or
Transbrasil. If bought at an airline office, the passenger must use
all the coupons with that airline. If bought through a travel
agent, such as Brazil Nuts, (800) 553-9959, the visitor can use
different airlines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pass is valid for 21 days and offers from five to nine
coupons. Prices depend on the number of coupons and whether it's
high season (Dec. 10 to Feb. 29 and June 25 to July 25) or low
season (March 1 to June 24 and July 26 to Dec. 9).
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a five-flight pass costs $540 in the high season
and $490 in the low season. In comparison, a recent one way, coach
fare from Rio de Janeiro to Fortaleza on Varig was $470. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I plan to spend New Year's Eve in Paris and would
like information on special events for the millennium. _
Annie-France Von Arx, Rumson, N.J.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. New Year's is always a big deal in Paris, but this year you
can even celebrate it aboard what is being billed as the biggest
helium balloon in the world. Exhibits, a parade and special
performances are among the other possibilities in the city's $6.5
million greeting to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some events will start this summer and run through the end of
next year. Information is featured on the city's Web site in
English, www.paris-france.org.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some events that might interest you:
</P>
<P>
   The Opera Bastille will be putting on Verdi's ``Falstaff'' in a
new production starring Jean-Philippe Lafond throughout December,
including on Dec. 31. Tickets, which range from $10 to $68, will go
on sale in September. Beginning Oct. 18, you can order tickets by
calling (33-8) 36.69.78.68. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Dec. 18 to Dec. 30 (excluding the 19th and 25th), the Opera
Garnier will present three short ballets: ``Capriccio'' by George
Balanchine, ``Reversibilite,'' by Michel Kelemenis, and ``Le Rire
de la Lyre'' by Jose Montalvo. On Dec. 31 a special event called
``The Year 2000'' is being planned, but details won't be available
until the end of next month. Information: (33-8) 36.69.78.68. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Dec. 10 to 31, 16 performances of ``The Nutcracker,''
reinterpreted and choreographed by Maurice Bejart, will be staged
at the newly restored Theatre du Chatelet, on the Place du
Chatelet, which is scheduled to reopen in early October. Call
(33-1) 40.28.28.00 or www.chatelet-theatre.com for updated
information. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The balloon ride is offered from July 1 to Dec. 31, 2000, during
daylight hours at the Parc Andre Citroen in the 15th
arrondissement. About 30 people at a time will get a 10-minute
panoramic view of the city. The cost is $10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Illumination will be a central New Year's theme, with more than
150 of the city's monuments lighted, including Paris' 36 bridges
and the promenades along the quays of the Seine. One way to get a
good view is on the Ferris wheel that will be installed on the
Place de la Concorde. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Place du Trocadero, overlooking the Eiffel Tower in the 16th
arrondissement, will be the gathering place for those who want to
watch the Tower's countdown clock; a light show is scheduled
shortly after midnight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Day, a parade will wind through the streets of
Montmartre. It begins at 2 p.m. from the Rue des Martyrs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While most major hotels and restaurants have been booked for
months (or years), their lobbies and bars _ such as the Ritz
Hotel's Bar Vendome or the bar at the Bristol _ promise to be
festive, if crowded, places to experience a luxurious millennial
atmosphere without having to worry about making reservations.

ROME, PARIS, WARSAW? POLISH TOURISM GIANS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 23) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poland has no Eiffel Tower or Colosseum, and the soot of a
half-century of communism is only beginning to wear off. But
according to the latest statistics of the World Tourism
Organization, since communism's collapse 10 years ago, Poland has
catapulted itself from 18th place among European countries as
tourist destinations, to No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Poland has dressed itself up since the old days,
when few vacationers from non-Communist countries ventured to its
Baltic Sea resorts or frolicked in the snow at Zakopane, the ski
resort in the Tatra Mountains. But in the last decade, new hotels
have gone up at a furious pace in Warsaw, the capital, and major
cities like Szczecin and Cracow.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish national airline, LOT, has upgraded its fleet. And
the national tourist agency, Orbis, has been broken up into
manageable units overseeing bus service, hotel operations and
tours.
</P>
<P>
   In glossy American magazines like the New Yorker, Poland makes
its pitch as a tourist playground. (``G'day,'' says the Australian
traveler to the Polish shopkeeper, in a typical ad. ``No, Gdansk,''
comes the retort, referring to Poland's Baltic port.)
</P>
<P>
   By last year, Poland had nearly 19 million tourist arrivals
(which the tourism organization defines as visitors staying at
least one night in paid accommodations). It drew a million more
visitors than Austria. Only France, the perennial No. 1, Spain,
Italy and Britain did better.
</P>
<P>
   But Poland in the same tourism class as France, Spain and Italy?
``Basically, it's totally misleading,'' said John Borrell, the
owner of a lodge south of Gdansk, referring to the way the
statistics are kept.
</P>
<P>
   Borrell, a British writer who retired to Poland to run Kania
Lodge, a quaint, tile-roofed resort in the Kashubian lake region,
is an unabashed booster of his adopted land. Since opening his
lodge not long after the downfall of communism, he has seen
business flourish, and this year he expects to add another 15 beds
to the 20 the lodge now has.
</P>
<P>
   Weekends see foreign diplomats and businessmen, as well as
young, affluent Poles from Warsaw's new emerging middle class
flocking to Kania Lodge. And increasingly, tourists from Western
countries like Britain and Denmark are landing at the Gdansk
airport, 12 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   But while Warsaw got its new Sheraton, and Trusthouse Forte, the
British chain, spent millions to refurbish the fabled Bristol Hotel
there, outside the large cities there are still few signs of
investment in the sort of small, homey tourist accommodations for
which areas of western Europe, from Tuscany to Touraine, are
famous.
</P>
<P>
   What partly explains Poland's statistical leap forward, said
Henryk Handszuh, who follows Polish tourism for the World Tourism
Organization, is the huge jump in visitors to the country that
began when borders were opened and visa restrictions dropped after
the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, he said, millions of people from neighboring
countries _ Germany to the west; Ukraine, Belarus and Russia to the
east _ flocked to Poland. People from eastern Germany, on day
trips, stocked up on inexpensive but wholesome farm products and
household goods; Ukrainians and Russians came for longer stays, and
returned home laden with meats, vegetables and household
appliances, for resale in their own impoverished economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to international definitions, this is not official
trade, done industrially, so it's tourism,'' Handszuh said.
</P>
<P>
   The receipts are substantial. In 1998, tourism revenues totaled
$8.4 billion, roughly equivalent to one-fourth of Poland's foreign
exports, and about one-third of that came from cross-border
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Poland hasn't made advances in
conventional tourism. In recent months, as the economic crisis in
Russia has cut buying power in countries to the east of Poland and
the war in Kosovo has caused a slight slowdown in reservations from
far-off places, cross-border receipts have fallen. But tourism
revenues from affluent Western countries like the United States,
Britain, France and Finland, have continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the number of visitors from the United States _ many of
Polish origin or Jewish families returning in search of their roots
_ rose 13 percent, to more than 270,000. Visitors from Britain were
up almost 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Poland's hope, said Krzysztof Lopacinski, director of the
Institute of Tourism in Warsaw, is for vacation tourism to continue
to expand. Already, hotel facilities are improving in the region of
Poznan, in western Poland, and in Lower Silesia, in the southwest,
a revival of the old German-founded spa culture is under way. In
eastern Poland, the Masurian lake district is attracting
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Big hopes are placed in the nomination of Cracow, with its
splendid cathedral and castle of the former kings of Poland on the
fabled Wawel Hill, as one of nine European cultural capitals for
the year 2000.

SOROS ADVISERS TO ESTABLISH SEPARATE FIRM
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three top investment specialists at Soros Fund
Management, the famed hedge fund company headed by billionaire
investor George Soros, are leaving the company to start their own
investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   The departing managers, Liefcq D. Rosenblatt, Mark D. Sonnino
and Gabe Nechamkin, have worked at Soros Fund Management for 11
years, heading up the firm's ``special situations'' investment
team, which has been one of the company's best, and steadiest,
performers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Their resignations come as Soros' largest funds continue to post
poor results, which began with last fall's global market decline.
</P>
<P>
   The managers will create a new firm called Satellite Asset
Management, and will be joined by three other Soros employees in
the special situations group.
</P>
<P>
   The group has specialized in buying distressed securities _
stocks and bonds of companies facing severe financial difficulties
or bankruptcy _ and in merger arbitrage, which involves trying to
profit from incremental movements in the value of companies that
have already announced plans for mergers or acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite Asset Management will employ the same strategies,
managing money for private and offshore investors, the group said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The special situations group has consistently recorded annual
profits even as the Soros funds were losing millions of dollars
through risky bets in emerging markets, hedge fund industry
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials said the departures were spurred in part by the
managers' desire to capitalize on their own investing profits and
to steer away from the sometimes-volatile performance that can
result from the risky global financial bets of the Soros funds.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Rosenblatt said, ``We are proud of the job we've
done for all the investors in the Soros funds, and especially of
the fact that we have been able to perform with such steadiness
over an extended period of time.'' The group claimed that it has
not had a losing year since joining Soros in January 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Soros Fund Management, said the
firm ``can confirm that the parting is amicable, and that the
relationship was mutually beneficial and favorable to both
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller, who manages the $6.75 billion
Quantum fund, the firm's largest hedge fund, declined to comment on
the departures, according to Pattison.
</P>
<P>
   The Satellite managers said that during a transition period,
they would continue to manage more than $2 billion in arbitrage and
high-yield investments for Quantum and other Soros funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Quantum fund gained 12.4 percent in 1998, lagging far behind
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and most equity mutual funds. Most
of the gain was contributed by the special situations group.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the fund lost more than 15 percent of its value in
the first quarter, in part because of bad bets on the Japanese yen.
Another Soros fund, the Quota fund, managed by S. Nicholas Roditi,
lost 14.5 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The poor results have led to rumors in the industry that
Druckenmiller would leave the Soros funds. Last week,
Druckenmiller, 45, said at an investment conference in London that
the speculation was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Pattison, the Soros spokesman, reiterated the denials on Monday.
``There is no truth to the stories whatever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, recent events have raised questions about the ability of
the Soros firm to maintain its prominence in the fast-growing world
of hedge funds. The Soros funds, which are incorporated in Curacao,
the Netherlands Antilles, are not registered for sale to U.S.
investors. But their performances are widely watched around the
world, in large part because of Soros' reputation as an astute
investor.
</P>
<P>
   But some trouble signs began to emerge last year. In August,
after Russia became the latest emerging market to suffer big
declines, Druckenmiller disclosed that Soros' funds had lost $2
billion in Russian markets during the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Then in October, Soros announced that he was considering closing
his Emerging Growth fund, which had lost more than 30 percent of
its value in the first 10 months of the year. But in January, he
decided to keep the fund open, citing complaints about the possible
closing from investors.
</P>
<P>
   Also last October, Roditi, one of the firm's brightest stars,
began a two-month medical leave. At the time, the fund was down
nearly 14 percent for the year. Roditi returned to the firm and the
Quota fund in January.

 &HT;    Survey shows human touch better in banking
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's somewhat odd that the world's No. 1 maker of
automated teller machines is touting the fact that people prefer
live tellers to their mechanical counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton-based NCR Corp. released the findings Monday of a survey
showing how Americans prefer to do their banking.
</P>
<P>
   In response to queries about how customer-oriented NCR was, the
company hired independent research company BMRB International,
which surveyed 1,237 Americans by telephone. The verdict: real-life
human interaction still beats dealing with someone over the
telephone or a faceless ATM.
</P>
<P>
   ``People appreciate the sense of security and personal
interaction that teller transactions offer,'' said Per-Olof Loof,
senior vice president of NCR's Financial Solutions Group, which
supplies banks with customer-oriented solutions ranging from ATMs
to data warehouses and branch automation systems.
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey findings:
</P>
<P>
   73 percent of Americans use a bank teller to make deposits.
</P>
<P>
   45 percent still visit a bank teller at least three times a
month.
</P>
<P>
   62 percent of people use ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   48 percent telephone their bank at least once a month.
</P>
<P>
   11 percent use a personal computer to do banking.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the 25 percent of Americans with online access at
home use their computer for banking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This supports our long-held belief that customers are seeking
old-fashioned service with a personal touch,'' said Geoffrey
Phillips, a spokesman for Dayton-based Liberty Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing acceptance of alternative banking,'' said
Phillips, pointing out Liberty Savings' addition of ATMs in the
area and expanded telephone access to customers. ``However, being
able to talk to a teller is going to continue to be important to
many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lander, a spokesman for NCR's Financial Solutions Group
in London, said the survey results didn't bother NCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not too unhappy about it. We make a lot of stuff that
goes into automated bank branches and that makes tellers' lives
easier by having data at their fingertips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just have technology for technology's sake,'' Lander
said. ``But it (also) doesn't mean people are going to stick with
bank tellers forever and a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year NCR shipped a record 46,509 ATM machines to its
customers worldwide. NCR controls more than one quarter of the
world's ATM market and one third of the U.S. market, according to
the latest Nilson Report, which tracks the ATM market.

   NEW YORK _ Last year, hip downtown girls were wrapping their
heads in little triangular kerchiefs tied under their hair in back.
The scarves were not so easy to find then but are now widely
available in a variety of colors and patterns and a range of
prices. Aside from being fashionable, they are useful in summer for
protecting the hair from sun damage.
</P>
<P>
   Cejon's scarves come in pastel floral prints and in solid pink,
white or black for $12 at Macy's and $12.50 at Bloomingdale's.
Macy's also has them in pink, lilac or black checks, also at $12.
</P>
<P>
   Lord &AMP; Taylor's choices include embroidered silks ($20) and
cottons ($15) by Spinosa in solids or patterns, and printed or
solid cottons by Charlotte ($12).
</P>
<P>
   More upscale versions are available at Barneys New York,
including a green-and-blue plaid, a giraffe print and a dancing
girls print, $40 each, all from Buzz by Jane Fox, and crocheted
triangles by Tracy Watts in a choice of eight colors, including
red, pink, purple and ivory ($98).

HEWLETT PACKARD'S PROFITS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (dal) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hewlett-Packard Co. reported second-quarter
earnings Monday that beat Wall Street estimates for the third
consecutive quarter, although revenue growth remained sluggish. But
orders grew by 10 percent, and executives said they expected
double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter ended April 30, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings
of $918 million, or 88 cents a diluted share, up 34 percent
compared with $685 million, or 65 cents a share, in the period a
year earlier. Per-share figures reflect a reduction in shares
outstanding from 1.08 billion to 1.05 billion shares. Revenue rose
3 percent, to $12.4 billion from $12 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif.,
to earn 80 cents a share, according to the First Call Corp., which
tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard executives said the improved results reflected
both better execution of the company's strategy as well as the
first signs of economic recovery in Asia. The company's sales in
Asia improved across all product lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the third consecutive quarter that we've exceeded
street expectations,'' said Lewis E. Platt, the company's chairman
and chief executive. ``We executed well and turned in an excellent
bottom line, and we're encouraged by improved order growth of 10
percent. Clearly, our challenge is to convert order growth into
stronger growth in revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's order rate reflected a strong turnaround from
the first quarter, when total orders were down 1 percent compared
with figures in the quarter a year earlier.
 &UR;  &LR; ``It's probably the best one of these reports we've seen in some
time,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J.P. Morgan.
``They're talking about strong order growth in enterprise systems;
they held their own in PC's, and printers were good.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard reported its results after the close of the
market. But in anticipation of a strong quarter, the company's
shares rose $4.5625, to $88.75, a new 52-week high. Analysts said
the consistent earnings showed the company's ability to cut costs
and operate efficiently and that the improvement in orders
indicated renewed growth going forward.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard shares have been rising since March, when the
company announced that it would split into two companies, one to
focus on computers, printers and scanners, the other on electronic
test equipment and medical technology products.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer, said
that the realignment of Hewlett-Packard into two companies was
insignificant for earnings in the second quarter. However, he added
that he did expect the costs associated with the creation of two
companies to increase noticeably in the third quarter.

PATTERNS: CROPPED PANTS IN FLOWERED PRINTS, AND STEP ON IT! 
ADULATING JULIA ROBERTS  
 SHOE PRODIGIES

   A Pants Flowering
</P>
<P>
   Last week, tanned and relaxed from a week of trekking in Utah,
Bud Konheim returned to his office at 525 Seventh Ave. to hear news
that really got his pulse going. His business partner, the designer
Nicole Miller, said she wanted to make cropped pants in flower
prints, and what's more, she wanted them designed, manufactured and
in the company's 30 boutiques in two weeks. Konheim, the company's
president, was for it, because, he said, ``all the cropped pants
out there are black or white, and they're going to be boring in 10
minutes.'' He also loves producing something immediately, rather
than six months in advance, which has become industry practice.
That's too sedate for him.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours, Ms. Miller had made a trouser pattern and
ordered three floral prints from a local fabric supplier. Asked if
anything had inspired her to do flowers, Ms. Miller smiled and
said: ``What do you mean? Like Gucci?'' Unlike Gucci's flashy
prints, however, Ms. Miller chose a subdued pattern, because, she
said, ``when you're wearing pants, it's better small.''
</P>
<P>
   Konheim didn't design a special print. ``Nobody cares if some
genius came up with a new flower,'' he said. ``A flower is a
flower.''
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to have one of its local factories cut 500
pairs, to sell for $85 each in Nicole Miller boutiques this month.
That number could change. ``The thing that's good about this kind
of item is that the risk is tiny,'' Konheim said. ``But if it turns
out to be great, hey, I know how to make more.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts in a Calvin
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts, the star of the new British comedy ``Notting
Hill,'' was at the post-premiere party last week at the Cipriani
catering hall on 42nd Street, saying that, no, she wasn't playing
herself in the movie, which is about a famous movie star. ``There
may be a similar thread that as an actor you can hang on to, but
Anna Scott is not me,'' said Ms. Roberts, alluding to her character
in the picture, which also stars Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts may not be Ms. Scott, but, to borrow a line from the
film, there was something ``surreal but nice'' about seeing such a
big star off screen. When Ms. Roberts, dressed in a slinky black
Calvin Klein dress with a keyhole back, emerged from a private
room, reporters waiting for her might have been tempted to act like
characters in the movie who gushed, ``I love your work!'' It was as
if the movie were still playing _ from the Ziegfeld Theater on 54th
Street to Cipriani, as the curious pushed forward and the
television camera lights bounced off Ms. Roberts' curly head.
</P>
<P>
   Young Shoe Ideas
</P>
<P>
   When Marlene Saunders' students at the Adolph S. Ochs Academy on
West 53rd Street began drawing pictures of sneakers and stilettos a
few months back, little did they imagine that their work would be
celebrated by the shoe designer Stuart Weitzman. Weitzman and the
300 sixth, seventh and eighth graders in Ms. Saunders' class at the
academy, which is part of Public School 111, were similarly
obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like to do something that's highly motivational, and
shoes are something that they're always talking about,'' Ms.
Saunders said. ``The kids are very tuned into shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   The students and the designer got together. (Ms. Saunders saw
one of his advertisements in Vogue and phoned him.) Weitzman was so
taken with the originality of the drawings _ like Alda Fernandez's
rendition of a leopard-print boot as a snarling cat, or Eric
Brito's picture of a shoe as a sinking Titanic _ that he also sent
someone from the advertising agency to speak to them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday and Wednesday evening, the students and their families
have been invited to a lemonade and cookies party at Weitzman's
boutique at 625 Madison Ave., where their drawings will be on
display for a month.

   Don't laugh. NBC is getting serious. Two seasons ago, its
prime-time lineup boasted 18 comedies. Last season, it was down to
14. Next fall, the number of yukfests (or yuckfests, as the case
may be) will be 10. Eleven, if you count a new one-hour series
described as a ``comedy/drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this new emphasis on the dramatic doesn't include room
for ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' one of the finest dramas in
the history of television. After seven seasons of struggling for a
bigger audience, the gripping, superbly acted show about homicide
cops in Baltimore joins five other veteran series at the NBC
guillotine, along with six that had their premieres this season.
</P>
<P>
   One of the canceled series, ``Mad About You,'' is bowing out
voluntarily after seven workhorse seasons, but ``NewsRadio'' (five
seasons), ``Caroline in the City'' (four), ``Working'' (two) and
``Lateline'' (two) officially got their pink slips with
``Homicide'' Monday as NBC unveiled for the advertising community
its 1999-2000 prime-time lineup. The fall schedule has five new
dramas, two new comedies and not much diversity as NBC tries to
hang on to its top-rated position among the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesdays and Thursdays will continue to be four-comedy nights at
NBC, but on Mondays the network will cut back to two. The rest of
the week _ Sunday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday _ will be
mirthless, or at least mercifully free of the bane of all viewers:
the sitcom laugh track.
</P>
<P>
   The big winner in the new crop of shows is likely to be ``Stark
Raving Mad,'' a comedy that replaces ``Veronica's Closet'' in the
cushy spot on Thursdays between ``Frasier'' and ``ER.''
(``Veronica,'' which deserved the ax, moves to Mondays.)
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' co-creator John Wells, whose ``Trinity'' tanked quickly
this season, returns with two new dramas, one co-produced by Aaron
Sorkin, creator of ABC's acclaimed ``Sports Night.'' Dick Wolf,
producer of ``Law &AMP; Order,'' adds a spinoff of the long-running
series, called ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a summary of NBC's new fall entries:
</P>
<P>
   Third Watch. One-hour drama from Wells about paramedics,
firefighters and police officers who work the 3-to-midnight shift.
Best character name: Bosco, a ``glory-hungry'' cop played by Jason
Wiles.
</P>
<P>
   Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit. One-hour drama about New York
police who investigate the most heinous crimes. Best character
name: Donald Cragen, only because it's the second time around for
Dann Florek's feisty police captain.
</P>
<P>
   The Mike O'Malley Show. Half-hour comedy about a bachelor who
realizes his slacker days are numbered. Best character name:
Weasel, Mike's best buddy.
</P>
<P>
   The West Wing. Hourlong drama that sounds a bit like Sorkin's
film, ``The American President.'' Sorkin is co-creator with Wells.
Cast includes Rob Lowe as deputy communications director. Best
character name: Josiah Bartlett (president of the United States),
played by Martin Sheen.
</P>
<P>
   Stark Raving Mad. Half-hour comedy from Steven Levitan, creator
of ``Just Shoot Me.'' Tony Shalhoub, the cabbie from ``Wings,''
plays a chaotic but successful author; Neil Patrick Harris, the
Doogie from ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,'' is his obsessively meticulous
editor. Best character name: Ian Stark, apt for a writer of horror
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Cold Feet. One-hour comedy/drama about three couples vacillating
between commitment and the opposite of commitment. Best character
name: Pick from among Adam, Shelley, Pete, Jenny, Karen or David.
</P>
<P>
   Freaks and Geeks: One-hour drama set in a suburban high school
in 1980. Best character name: Take your pick again; there's Sam,
Lindsay, Neal, Bill, Daniel, Nick and Ken.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also announced four midseason series ready to step into the
breach. Two are animated comedies: ``Sammy,'' based on comedian
David Spade's father, and ``God, the Devil and Bob,'' about an
autoworker trying to save the world. The others are ``The Others,''
a drama about people who connect with the spirit world, and
``M.Y.O.B,'' a comedy about a teen runaway.

   NEW YORK _ The wait is over.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people across the United States will start lining up
tonight for the 12:01 a.m. premiere of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace.'' The audience for the around-the-clock, first-day
showings of the hotly anticipated Star Wars prequel is expected to
top the 4.7 million people who saw ``The Lost World: Jurassic
Park,'' the record holder for biggest single-day gross, on its
opening day.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the country queues up at theaters, where will
the creators and cast of The Phantom Menace be spending the film's
opening day?
</P>
<P>
   George Lucas (writer, director, executive producer): ``I'm going
to be off on a beach in the South Pacific someplace. As far away
(as I can be), with no phone. I'm not going to know what happens.
I'm going to be just as happy about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick McCallum (producer): ``The Coronet (Theatre) in San
Francisco. Then on the 21st, L.A., Mann's Westwood and Chinese
(Theaters). I'm going to the real stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn): ``I think I'm going to be en route
to join Jay Leno (on The Tonight Show ). I'll still be on a
publicity tour, as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala): ``Taking my A.P. Bio
(advanced-placement biology) final.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu): ``Opening day, I think I'm
working. I'm shooting that day. I might drive by a theater and see
how many people are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Best (Jar Jar Binks): ``I'm going to be in the Ziegfeld
(Theatre in New York) at one time or another to see this movie.
Because the people who go see movies at the Ziegfeld are die-hards.
They are die-hard fans of everything.''

HOSPITAL GROUP SAYS MEDICARE CUTS DEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hospital industry, which says it has been
devastated by steep payment cuts in Medicare that Congress enacted
two years ago, Monday released a report claiming that the cuts were
far more extensive than lawmakers intended.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress aimed to eliminate
the federal budget deficit while also cutting taxes. To find
offsetting reductions in federal spending, lawmakers ordered
changes in the Medicare system they said would trim $53 billion in
payments to hospitals nationwide between 1998 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But the true cuts total $71 billion, or 33 percent more than
Congress anticipated, the American Hospital Association said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, seven out of 10 hospitals will lose money on Medicare
patients by the time the 1997 law takes full effect in three years,
the industry group said. The average profit margin on Medicare
patients in 2002 will fall to between negative 4.4 percent and
negative 7.8 percent, depending on how quickly hospital costs rise,
the group added.
</P>
<P>
   The estimates were calculated by The Lewin Group, a health care
research and consulting firm, which had been commissioned to study
the 1997 law by the hospital group. Using the slogan ``Real pain
for real people,'' the organization is lobbying Congress to reverse
some of the budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals nationwide say they are being forced to lay off staff
and close services, such as home health visits, because of the
budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Their claim was bolstered last month when Moody's Investors
Service, the credit rating agency, reported that the credit
worthiness of US nonprofit hospitals was sinking fast. The agency
said it downgraded the credit rating of 21 nonprofit hospitals in
the first quarter of 1999 with $4 billion in debt, far ahead of the
9 downgrades on $1.5 billion in debt for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's said hospitals were in declining financial shape because
of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act _ but also because of lower
payments from managed care insurance companies and because
hospitals lost money in buying physician practices and insurance
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, several large hospitals reported losses for
the first quarter of 1999, including Massachusetts General
Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's
and UMass Medical Center in Worcester. Those hospitals had either
made money or lost far less money in the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts hospitals rely on Medicare for $3 billion a year,
or about 30 percent of their revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The state hospital association had been saying that
Massachusetts hospitals would lose $1.7 billion in payments over
the five-year life of the Balanced Budget Act. But the Lewin Group
figures put the lost payments at over $2.1 billion, said Ronald
Hollander, president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   The American Hospital Association said the Medicare cuts were
larger than Congress intended for two reasons. The cuts grew in
size once federal agencies put the lawmakers' intent into specific
regulatory language, and the Congressional Budget Office, which
calculates the financial impact of legislation, understated the
effect on hospitals of some aspects of the new Medicare law.

BRITAIN RENEWS PRESSURE ON ALLIES FOR KOSOVO GROUND ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, France, Italy)  (With KOSOVO-BRITAIN, KOSOVO-MILITARY) 
(mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Britain is renewing its pressure on NATO
allies to consider a ground attack in Kosovo so that refugees can
return home before winter sets in.
</P>
<P>
   In separate appearances at NATO headquarters and with fellow
foreign ministers from the European Union on Monday, Foreign
Minister Robin Cook revived an earlier British proposal to send
ground troops into Kosovo without a peace agreement. The troops
would be sent after weeks more of allied air bombardment when
Yugoslav forces were weakened to the point where they could only
put up scattered resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France pressed the United States and other allies on
the same plan three weeks ago, just before the meeting in
Washington commemorating NATO's 50th anniversary. But the
differences were so pronounced then that the issue was left off the
formal agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance agreed instead to step up the air campaign. Since
then, the intensifying air attacks appear to have left the Yugoslav
military weakened but unbowed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the time it would take to deploy a ground force, the
British have become concerned that time is running out for a
possible land attack that would help the refugees return home
before winter.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 22,000 British, French, German and American troops
are in Macedonia and Albania, well below the number that NATO would
need to wrest control of Kosovo from the 40,000 Yugoslav soldiers
and police there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is aware of the severity of the Balkan winter and
that a military campaign in the Balkan winter is not a readily
practical objective,'' Cook said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cook is going to Washington on Thursday, where he is expected to
press his point with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of casualties and domestic dissent, the White House has
said NATO should stick with its airstrikes for now. A ground attack
would also pose major problems for some other NATO nations,
particularly Italy and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
the United States is opposed to ground troops. ``The U.S. position
is clear,'' Leavy said. ``We're steadfast against this.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the current NATO campaign came Monday from retired
Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the
Gulf war, who said that NATO might have achieved victory earlier if
it had not excluded using ground forces against the Yugoslavs in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have argued for a campaign that, if it couldn't
include ground troops, then don't take away also the threat of
ground troops,'' said Powell, in an address at the National Press
Club.
</P>
<P>
   There has been growing pressure in the Italian government for a
bombing moratorium. And on Monday the Italian foreign minister,
Lamberto Dini, complained that NATO's airstrikes ``certainly have
not produced the results that have been expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema has proposed a plan under which
the U.N. Security Council, with Russian and Chinese agreement,
would pass a resolution supporting NATO's position on Kosovo and
then order a bombing halt as an inducement for President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to comply. NATO has rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Without referring to ground troops, the NATO secretary-general,
Javier Solana, has agreed with the overall objective outlined by
Cook, but has never explicitly said how NATO can be assured of
achieving it.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said in an interview with the BBC over the weekend that
the allies would return the refugees ``before the winter.''
</P>
<P>
   The British plan would mark a sharp departure from NATO's
original plan, which is to send in a peacekeeping force, but only
if Milosevic agrees and withdraws his troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, NATO envisioned a peacekeeping force of 28,000
soldiers to carry out this mission, including 4,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has been
updating an earlier military assessment of what it would now take
to carry out the peacekeeping mission. The allies' current thinking
is that they would need perhaps 50,000 troops to help police and
rebuild devastated villages in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's argument is that airstrikes may weaken the Yugoslav
military to the point where a land attack can be carried out
successfully without large-scale allied casualties, a situation
they have called a ``semi-permissive environment.'' At the same
time, Britain is concerned that a long, drawn-out air campaign may
not compel Milosevic to yield to NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question we must examine very carefully,'' Cook said
Monday. ``How much longer can the Yugoslav army continue before
reaching a point where it cannot provide organized resistance?
Javier Solana is reviewing when we could take advantage of the
success we're having against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The morale of Yugoslav army troops in Kosovo is waning, Cook
insisted, citing reports from Kosovo rebel leaders to whom he has
been speaking by satellite phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of the bombing has been to keep the Serb units
apart and divide them up,'' Cook said. ``They cannot concentrate.
They cannot regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cook was the first senior NATO official to assert that Yugoslav
forces brought Kosovo refugees down from mountain hiding places and
forced them to remain around dug-in artillery and a command post in
Korisa that were bombed on Friday. Yugoslav officials have
contended that NATO intentionally attacked civilians, while NATO
contends that it aimed at and hit a military target and was unaware
beforehand that the civilians were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Serb forces that took the refugees off that
hillside,'' Cook said. ``It was the Serb forces that concentrated
them near the command post. It was the Serb forces that made them
not go back to their dwellings, but made them assemble between
those two courtyards.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there are 80 documented cases in which Yugoslav troops
had used refugees as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the contentions about Yugoslav tactics, the 19-member
NATO alliance is as divided now over the British plan as it was
last month. Greece and Hungary have ruled out staging a land
invasion from their soil.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany is now trying to keep
the Greens, a party in his political coalition, from splintering
over the issue and bringing down his government. Schroeder met
Monday in Helsinki, Finland, with Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, who has been asked by NATO to serve as a mediator with
Milosevic over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian Parliament's concern goes well beyond any ground
action, as leftist lawmakers in Rome are insisting that the Italian
coalition government demand that NATO suspend bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to paper over the strains, NATO's spokesman, Jamie Shea,
sought to shore up support for the air war, now approaching the end
of its second month, while at the same time addressing the issues
raised by Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air campaign still has work to do,'' Shea said. ``We want
to see Yugoslav forces in an even worse shape.''
</P>
<P>
   One NATO diplomat suggested that the British were isolated.
``This is like the dog that didn't bark,'' the diplomat said.
``Britain is the only one pushing this, and it's because they don't
want to be caught unprepared if it ever comes to this, and they
want to push Clinton to take a little more engaged stance.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior officer on the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington
voiced the Pentagon's concern that any discussion of ground troops,
other than peacekeepers enforcing an agreement, would distract the
allies' attention from the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Voicing the hope that the airstrikes alone might still persuade
Milosevic to accept the allies' terms, the officer said that
several additional A-10 tank-killing jets and Marine Corps FA-18
Hornets were preparing to fly to the region this week as part of
176 additional aircraft requested by Clark.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook and other British officials, including Prime Minister
Tony Blair, say they are pointing out the realities of the
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said NATO must not become trapped by the conditions it
imposed on Milosevic and allow him to dictate the timing of when a
ground force enters Kosovo to escort the hundreds of thousands of
refugees home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said that Milosevic has no veto,'' Cook said.
``We're not going to hang around in Macedonia until there is a
grand signing ceremony in front of flags and cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the minister added in a note of caution, ``We do need to
know when it will be appropriate, when it will be safe, and when it
will be right to enter Kosovo.''

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Faton remembers his mother standing on the
balcony of his family apartment waving goodbye as he and his father
left Kosovo March 30. She had expected her husband to return for
her and her other son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring me a pack of cigarettes on your way back,'' she told her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   But once the pair crossed the border to Macedonia there was no
going back.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Faton, who withheld his last name so as not to endanger
his family, called his mother from a cellular phone for the first
time. He asked simple questions, afraid that anything too detailed
may be misconstrued by eavesdropping Serbs and could be used to
accuse his mother of spying. It's a fear many refugees have when
they call relatives back in Kosovo. They keep the conversations
brief.
</P>
<P>
   Faton's mother uses a friend's telephone. Her own no longer
works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just called to ask you how are you? When did you get there
(at the friend's apartment)'' Faton asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came about an hour ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is Beni?'' Faton asked of his older brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's OK. He is watching the news all the time with his
friends. Your grandmother is at home as well. But we check her
apartment every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have food?'' Faton asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get anything, but you have to wait in long lines for
bread and milk. How are you? Are you eating? Eat a lot of soups,''
she instructed her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you try and come here,'' he pleaded, adding that
hundreds of people arrived by train in Macedonia Monday at the
Blace border.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. We are OK. It's too risky to come. I think it will get
better. It's quieter,'' she said. ``I miss you.''
</P>
<P>
   Faton, 22, did not respond and told her that his father would
also be calling her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you,'' she told her son, who abruptly hung up the
phone. ``I couldn't bear it,'' he said afterwards. ``I couldn't
finish the conversation. Her last words broke my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Faton's family lived in a two-bedroom apartment on the first
floor of an 11-story building near Pristina's main public library.
Nearly 50 percent of the building's residents are Serbs. Serbian
women visit Faton's mother and tell her that they have to protect
each other: They will protect her from the Serbs if she agrees to
protect them from the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic Albanian
guerrilla group fighting Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Faton was the first to propose that the family leave Kosovo,
afraid of what the Serbs might to do to him, his sister and
brother, and his father, a professor and doctor of prosthetics and
facial reconstruction. Now his father regrets not taking the rest
of the family with them. He and Faton, staying in separate friends'
apartments in Macedonia, call Pristina a few times a week to check
on the rest of the family. ``It's my fault,'' he said. ``It is
because of me that the family is separated.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Faton, many refugees manage to call their families left
behind in Kosovo. A few, like Faton's grandmother, return home
despite the danger. ``She just took a bus and left. She wasn't
afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pristina may be a little safer than many places. According to
aid organizations, most of the refugees crossing the border have
been coming from villages. Sunday's train carrying 600 people _
twice as many as the day before _ arrived from villages west and
south of Pristina. Aid organizations said some of the people
voluntarily left because the Serbs robbed them of all their
valuables and food. ``Even though they are not being forced from
their homes, they can no longer exist,'' said UN High Commissioner
of Refugees spokesman Ron Redmond. He added: ``Serbs forces are
blending in with civilians,'' bolstering NATO claims that Serb
forces may be using ethnic Albanians as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   One man said that the Serb police are placed throughout the
villages. ``It's a lie that (they're) withdrawing,'' he said,
boarding a bus that was to take him to a refugee camp.

LOTT WARNS HE MAY SHELVE BILL WITH GUN RESTRICTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott warned Democrats
on Monday that if they did not agree to strictly limit debate and
get to a vote on a juvenile-crime bill, preferably by Tuesday
night, he might put the legislation on the shelf so that the Senate
could proceed to other business.
</P>
<P>
   That warning, delivered on the floor of the chamber Monday
afternoon, seemed to heighten the possibility that the bill and the
various gun control measures that have been attached to it would
come to naught, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's remarks, and the responses they elicited from Democrats,
underscored the degree to which the bill has become enmeshed in
intense political maneuvering, with members of each party striving
to portray their colleagues across the aisle as stubborn,
unreasonable obstacles in the path of progress.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide $1 billion in grants to help local
governments prevent, prosecute and punish juvenile crime. But in
the wake of the Colorado school shootings last month, it has also
become a vehicle for amendments imposing new limits on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Democrats were unwilling to pare their list of
amendments because they wanted to goad Lott into putting the bill
aside. Then, Republicans charged, the Democrats will blame
Republicans for the destiny of amendments that the Senate has
already approved, including provisions that would restrict minors'
access to semiautomatic assault weapons and promote background
checks on people who buy firearms at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democrats think they have found a good issue,''
Lott said in the chamber as he made clear that he would not spend
much more time now on the juvenile-crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said that Lott was overstating his concerns about
the time already devoted to the bill _ a week _ and that he was the
one not interested in passing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority leader is paving the way to kill this bill and to
shift the blame, mostly because of the gun-related issues that have
come up during this debate,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said late last week that he wanted work on the bill wrapped
up by Tuesday. But it became clear Monday that because of
parliamentary procedures put in place at the end of last week, the
Senate on Tuesday will debate another measure, concerning liability
problems posed by the year 2000 computer bug, unless the members
reach unanimous consent to turn back to the crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said on Monday that the terms of that consent were a strict
limit on debate, and he suggested 6 p.m. Tuesday as a finishing
point. But he was rebuffed by Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, who
was speaking for Democrats in the chamber at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been dilatory,'' Wellstone said. ``We're going
through the amendments. That's how you do it in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott replied that the Senate simply had to move on to other
pressing matters, like a vote on an emergency spending bill to pay
for the military effort in the Balkans. If the Senate moved on,
further debate on the juvenile-crime bill would be delayed past
Memorial Day and possibly for months.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that they had winnowed their own list of
remaining amendments to seven but that Democrats still had more
than 40. Democrats would not specify the number of amendments they
still had but said they too were trying to shorten the list.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Democratic aide said some Democrats were reluctant to
shorten the debate on the bill because they felt it was to their
political advantage either to prolong discussions about gun control
or to have Lott end those discussions and be perceived as less
concerned about gun control than they are.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking reflects their belief that in the wake of the
school shootings in Littleton, Colo., last month, most American
voters now agree with the Democrats' longtime advocacy of more
stringent regulations for firearms.

   ``Time is short,'' writes &UR; Wayne LaPierre &LR; , executive vice
president. ``I am counting on you, as a gun owner and as a
patriotic, law abiding American, to accept your place in the
history of freedom by joining the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre, whose letter is quoted by U.S. News &AMP; World Report,
says that anti-NRA feelings are caused by nothing but propaganda
from the media. ``Instead of doing their homework, and giving the
American people the real facts about guns and crime, the national
media has simply repeated the lies put forth by the gun-ban
lobby.''

 &HT;    Outdoor activities may tick off many
 &HT;    By Tim Tresslar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN CO., Ohio _ Let the biting begin.
</P>
<P>
   A mild winter and a warm spring have caused the number of ticks
_ particularly the dog tick _ to surge over last year, experts say.
While this is good news for the blood-sucking arachnids, it means
tense moments for the urban transplants and outdoor enthusiasts
encountering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to be a bad tick year,'' Chris Dauner,
assistant park manager for Caesar Creek State Park in Warren
County, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dauner, who spends much of his workday outside, has found ticks
crawling on him this season. Dan Collins, director of environmental
health for the Warren County Combined Health District, has pulled
20 from his dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But Dauner stresses that more ticks shouldn't mean less time
outdoors, provided campers and enthusiasts take precautions. He
suggests people check themselves for ticks, wear long pants with
the ankles closed and monitor bites for telltale signs of Lyme
Disease or Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these diseases pop up each year in Ohio. The Ohio
Department of Health received reports of 49 Lyme Disease cases and
10 Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever cases in 1998, said Bob Restifo, a
medical entomologist with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In Warren County, the combined health district recorded 10 cases
of Lyme Disease during over the plast decade, but none in the plast
four years, Collins said. Health officials haven't encountered
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in at least a decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County Health Department has recorded 23
instances of Lyme Disease and three cases of Rocky Mountain Spotted
Fever since 1990, officials said. Figures for Greene and Miami
counties weren't available Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dog ticks, which carry Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, account for
much of the state's tick population. But instances of Lyme Disease
continue to outpace Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, even though the
deer tick that which carries the disease, is rarely found in the
state. Restifo said only nine deer ticks have been found in Ohio
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   People sometimes contract the disease while traveling out of
state. Others theorize that disease-carrying deer ticks come into
the state on raccoons hitching rides on trains and trucks or by
falling off of migratory birds, said Mark Case, supervisor for
Montgomery County Health Department's bureau of special services.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, health departments, hospitals, clinics and
individuals have sent the state health agency 500 ticks for
identification or disease testing, Restifo said. That's twice the
number the agency received during the same period in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees the increase, though. Miami County extension
agent Jeff Layman believes the grub worm and carpenter bee
populations grew this year, but he doesn't see a similar increase
for ticks, he said. Greene County extension agent Jerry Mahan knows
there's are a lot of ticks out there, but not necessarily any more
than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Warren County. The health district office receives six
or seven calls each week from people asking questions about ticks
and the diseases they carry, Collins said. In a typical year, the
office receives one call each week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many calls to rolling into Collins' office come from people who
moved to Warren County from larger cities. Though they may have
encountered the bug before, they find them in much larger numbers,
which prompts a flurry of questions for health officials, he said.
One woman who moved to the rural county from Detroit had never
before seen a tick, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To keep both families and pets safe from ticks, experts say to
keep grass and other vegetation around homes cut short. They also
advise wearing light-colored clothing so ticks can be easily seen;
tucking pants into the socks; using bug repellants.
</P>
<P>
   Don't smash the bugs while they're on the skin since their
bodily fluids can spread infection, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Collins has his own method for disposing of them once they're
pulled from his dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to do is flush them down the toilet,'' Collins
said. ``That's what I do with mine. I've never seen one swim back
up.

MALCOM X FAMILY MAY TRY TO BLOCK AUCTION OF DIARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his coat pocket the day he died, Malcolm X carried a small
red diary, scribbled with notes of of upcoming meetings and phone
numbers of personal friends like actor Ossie Davis.
</P>
<P>
   When assasins burst into the Audobon Ballroom and fired 16
bullets into the civil rights leader's body, three tore through the
diary, leaving it punctured and stained with his blood.
</P>
<P>
   The tattered, tiny diary became evidence when three men went on
trial for Malcom X's murder in 1965, and a valuable piece of
history, logged and stored in the city's municipal archives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, somehow it has been removed from its file in a Brooklyn
warehouse, and turned up for sale at a San Francisco auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm X's children are stunned by the book's mysterious
disappearance, and want it returned. The city is investigating
whether the diary was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very intimate item as far as the last moments of
their father's life is concerned and they were shocked and angry to
find it appear at an auction house on the west coast,'' said James
Fleming, a Manhattan-based lawyer for Malcolm X's family. ``They
very much would like it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The family is prepared to go to court, if necessary, to halt the
scheduled May 27 auction at Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The auction house claims it took it on good faith that an
unidentified seller had legitimately acquired the red imitation
leather booklet. It was expected to be sold for as much as $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The seller said he bought the 146-page datebook from another
unidentified seller who, in a letter signed ``to whom it may
concern'', claimed he had purchased the diary in the early 1990s
when the New York City Police Department was purging its files.
</P>
<P>
   New York City officials, however, said it is not customary to
sell the personal effects of muder victims.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said late Monday that city officials told him that they
could find no evidence that the diary had been part of any police
department purging.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of such activity there is only one conclusion _
the item was stolen,'' Fleming said. ``We will work with the city
to get the auction house to voluntarily discontinue the auction of
the diary and if they don't then we'll go to California and get an
injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Butterfield and Butterfield said the auction house
would remove the diary from the auction if city officials can prove
that it was stolen or illegitimately acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would anxiously await paperwork from the city attorney, and
at that point we would most likely remove it from sale should
questions about title be raised,'' said Levi Morgan, a spokesman
for the 134-year-old firm that enjoys a high reputation in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the New York City law department said
officials were still trying to trace the diary's route from
Brooklyn to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The book contains names and phone numbers of Malcolm's friends
and associates, personal notes and details of his schedule. For
example, a few days after he was gunned down, Malcolm was scheduled
to attend a meeting at Brown University.
</P>
<P>
   City officials thought the diary was in a manila envelope inside
a New York Police Department evidence voucher listing one ``1965
Red Diary with 3 bullet holes (belonging to) Malcolm X Little.''
</P>
<P>
   But the envelope was empty on Friday when Kenneth Cobb, director
of the New York City Municipal Archives, went to check.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb said there is no way to tell right now when the diary was
taken out of the envelope. ``I'd certainly like to know that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The archives had inherited two boxes of files, which included
the now empty envelope, from the Manhattan District Attorney's
office in 1993, 25 years after the case involving Malcolm's killing
was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the diary was stolen then it would have happened somewhere
between the police property property room, the district attorney's
office and the municipal archives,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   In most crime cases, city officials said, evidence is passed to
the archives after 25 years in the district attorney's office. They
said family members can claim items after a case is closed.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said Malcolm X's children knew the city had been storing
material from their father's murder and were ``shocked'' to learn
that the diary was being sold by a San Francisco auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's children want to make their father's artifacts
available to the public in a proper setting, Fleming said, adding
that the slain black nationalist's family would be happy to provide
the municipal archives a copy of the diary.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Byron Rushing (D-South End) said any sale should be
stopped, and questions about the diary's ownership answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a historical perspective this is a very important
document that would be of extreme interest to scholars and
researchers,'' said state Rep. Byron Rushing (D-South End), who is
a historian.

FOR MANY ISRAELI VOTERS, IT WAS A QUESTION OF CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the end, Ariella Bivas said, it was Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's character that decided her vote on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving a polling station on Monday morning, Mrs. Bivas, 35,
said she had voted for Ehud Barak, but not because his peace
platform was so different from Netanyahu's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both want to make peace because that's what the people
want, and they'll both have to give up territory,'' said Mrs.
Bivas, who had not supported Netanyahu in the 1996 election either.
``What bothered me was that the country is being led by a person
who is dishonest and untrustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Character issues figured prominently in conversations with
voters who chose Barak, many of whom felt that Netanyahu's style
and statements had undermined good government and polarized
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used his power for incitement and divisiveness,'' said
Tamar Greidinger, 40. ``There was a lot of hatred, and it will take
a long time to rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   In what became a bitter campaign laced with blunt ethnic
appeals, Netanyahu had repeatedly lashed out at liberal ``elites''
who he said despised the groups that had brought him to power and
were the core of his governing coalition: working-class Sephardic
Israelis of Middle Eastern and North African origin, Russian
immigrants and ultra-Orthodox Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But even some voters who had backed Netanyahu, in this election
and the last, cited character as a decisive factor, arguing that
his tough posture was an asset for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's brilliant and clever, he stood firm and protected the
Land of Israel,'' said Marusia Nagar, 50. ``He stuck to his
principles, withstanding pressure at home and from the whole world,
including America. It wasn't a simple matter. He had to walk a fine
line between the Jewish settlers and the Oslo agreements, putting
his own government at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Mor, 26, who was also casting a vote for Netanyahu for a
second time, said this stance had brought results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Security has improved under Bibi, there are fewer terrorist
attacks,'' he said. ``He was strong on that issue, and Arafat
definitely had to take that into account. Arafat wants Barak,
because he knows that he'll give in more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   But at polling stations on Monday, it was clear that significant
numbers of Netanyahu's former supporters had deserted him,
disenchanted by a style of government that alienated even some of
Netanyahu's closest political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Meir, a taxi driver who would only give his first name, voted
for Netanyahu in the 1996 election after Palestinian bus bombings
shook his faith in the Labor-led government of Shimon Peres. Since
then, he said, Netanyahu had squandered the faith people had put in
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for Bibi because the terrorist attacks were a
catastrophe, and I figured that it can't get any worse,'' Meir
said. ``He was young and new and I thought I would give him a
chance. But he turned out to be an operator and a manipulator, and
he let the ultra-Orthodox run wild. His policies left us isolated
in the world, and he had a negative impact on our political
culture. His only interest was political survival, no holds
barred.''
</P>
<P>
   Nissim, a 39-year-old of Iraqi origin from the depressed Katamon
neighborhood, also switched from Netanyahu to Barak, attracted by
his promise to create jobs and improve education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted economic change,'' Nissim said, declining to give his
full name. ``In my neighborhood we have no after-school programs
that will keep the kids busy in the afternoons. We need subsidized
day-care centers. I have four children and I can barely make it
through the month. The economy is more important right now than
security.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As news of Barak's victory spread through Jerusalem on Monday
night, elated supporters honked their car horns downtown. Earlier
in the day, Netanyahu's backers, who were sluggish during the
campaign, made an 11th-hour effort to close the gap with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign volunteers handed out stickers and leaflets to
motorists, and sound trucks plastered with Netanyahu's pictures
plied the streets, booming out campaign jingles.
</P>
<P>
   Members of ultra-Orthodox parties allied with Netanyahu worked
hard to get out every last vote. At one polling station, two men
from one ultra-Orthodox party assisted a paraplegic from their car.
Vehicles driven by party workers ferried people to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, wall posters carried rabbinic
injunctions to vote for Netanyahu, asserting that it was ``a sacred
duty'' to vote for the candidate who was more likely to uphold
``the spirit of religion and the tradition of Israel.''
Ultra-Orthodox pirate radio stations broadcast calls throughout the
day to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Netanyahu's message wore thin, no longer
resonating with most Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a polling station, Najat Mahanna, 62, a die-hard
Sephardic supporter of Netanyahu, sang the praises of the prime
minister. ``He's strong and he doesn't give in easily,'' she said.
``He wants a real peace, not a fake peace in which we give and the
Arabs do what they want. We shouldn't just give.''
</P>
<P>
   But Raheli Mizrahi, 23, who is dating Mrs. Mahanna's son, shot
back: ``No one wants to give, but we have no choice. We have to
live with them and they're also human beings. Bibi's too
stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't live in the past, you have to deal with today's
reality,'' Ms. Mizrahi went on. ``At least Barak will make peace.
That's the main thing _ that there should be peace.''

GOP APPROACHES WARILY ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During last week's Senate debate over gun control,
Senator Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, called Governor George W.
Bush of Texas with an urgent question. Did Bush support an
amendment requiring mandatory background checks of purchasers at
gun shows?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: Yes and no. Yes, Bush supported the mandatory
checks, but, no, he did not support the amendment for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The muddled answer reflects what happened in the Senate last
week _ and is expected to continue Tuesday _ as Republicans
struggle with an issue that could blow up in the party's face in
the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, initially at Craig's behest, rejected the
background check. Then, after a conversation between aides to Bush
and Craig on the following day, the Senate Republicans reversed
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To some GOP strategists, the back-and-forth over guns is a case
study of how the line between the two parties can be blurred,
rather than highlighted, as occurred in the political revolution
led by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressional Republicans have just decided their main
function in life is to get the presidential candidate elected in
2000,'' said Republican strategist Bill Kristol. ``They think Bush
is ahead by 15 points, so why pick a fight? They have decided,
`Let's blur all the issues.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has far more endorsements from congressional
Republicans than any other candidate, could benefit from this
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate votes last week could also help another
candidate, Elizabeth Dole. Just days before the Senate action, Dole
called for the party to take a tougher stance on gun control,
drawing a flurry of headlines and criticism from conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Senate Republicans reversed themselves, it showed
that ``Dole cracked the code,'' said her spokesman, Ari Fleischer.
``She got there first, and now the party is chasing to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole is basing much of her exploratory campaign on the notion
that she is an outsider willing to take on her party and the
National Rifle Association. Fleischer proudly noted that Dole is
``a target of the NRA,'' although it is unclear whether that would
help in the early caucus and primary states.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, the Arizona
Republican, also has been affected by the vote. Last Wednesday, he
voted against the mandatory background check. But 24 hours later,
after the amendment was modified at the urging of several
Republicans, McCain issued a news release headlined: ``McCain
closes loophole, requires background checks at gun shows.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, through its mobilization of voters and campaign
contributions, clearly has influence in presidential and
congressional elections. Bush's father, former President George
Bush, tried to lead the Republican Party out of the NRA's grip by
resigning from the organization in May 1995 after it sent out a
fund-raising letter referring to federal agents as ``jack-booted
government thugs'' who wear ``Nazi bucket helmets and black
storm-trooper uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am outraged,'' the former president wrote, asking to be
removed from the NRA rolls as a life member.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, his son, who is not an NRA member, won
accolades from the gun lobby for signing a law that allows Texans
to carry concealed handguns, a position that could become an issue
in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of weeks, especially since Dole began
criticizing Bush's stance on gun issues, the governor has appeared
to be carefully maneuvering his way on the subject. Bush said
through his aides last week that he opposed the Democratic
amendment that included mandatory background checks on gun-show
purchases. Craig, who led the opposition to that amendment and
instead pushed for voluntary background checks, called Bush last
Wednesday, according to Bush spokesman David Beckwith.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said Bush told Craig he was not familiar with the
senator's proposal but could not back the Democratic amendment on
mandatory background checks. The Democratic proposal was rejected
51-47.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, Senate Republicans faced a deluge of
criticism for rejecting background checks. Bush then asked for a
detailed description of the amendments, so he could figure out what
the fuss was about. Bush told his aides he could support a modified
version of the Democratic proposal. A Bush aide then called a Craig
aide to relay that message, Beckwith said. Craig offered a modified
proposal for mandatory checks, which passed the Senate 48-47 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A Craig aide said Bush had no influence on changing the
legislation, and Beckwith said it was not clear whether Bush played
any role.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point they switched their position,'' Beckwith said
about the GOP senators. ``Whether Bush had anything to do with it,
I don't know. They happened to then adopt our position.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Bush has not supported another Democratic
proposal, which calls for safety locks on certain guns. A
spokeswoman said Bush only backs voluntary safety locks, presenting
another possible campaign issue.

 &HT;    Ohio man files lawsuit against NFL famer Warfield
 &HT;    By Wes Hills
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ What's the value of an introduction to National
Football League Hall of Fame star Paul Warfield?
</P>
<P>
   At least $620,000 and still counting, a local man's lawsuit
scheduled for a Tuesday U.S. District Court trial in Dayton claims.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit hinges on Washington Twp. businessman Richard J.
Rentz's contention that his introduction of Warfield to two Miami,
Fla., businessmen led to them to a lucrative license to design,
manufacture and distribute National Football League athletic
sportswear that feature team and NFL logos.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the introduction and license, Rentz was to
receive 1 percent of the gross sales of Dynasty Apparel Industries,
Inc., according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence Rentz will introduce to prove this verbal
contract are tape recordings of his telephone conversations with
Warfield and Dynasty principals Armando Mendez and Ignacio Mendez.
</P>
<P>
   Rentz's attorney, Christopher J. Cornyn, said he believes the
recordings ``support the premise that there was a contract entered
into between Mr. Rentz and Dynasty Apparel.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1990, the lawsuit claims, Armando Mendez met
Rentz at a baseball game in Cincinnati and they soon became
acquainted socially.
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio Mendez and Armando Mendez told Rentz that their
business, Dynasty, ``would stand to substantially profit
financially'' if they could secure an NFL apparel license.
</P>
<P>
   Rentz, in turn, ``offered to secure the personal services'' of
Warfield, who was dismissed as a defendant in the lawsuit, to
obtain the license from NFL Properties, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said Rentz knew Warfield because Warfield was renting one
of Rentz's properties for a placement service company he operated
here.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Oct. 30, 1990, Ignacio Mendez, Armando Mendez
and Warfield met with Rentz in Dayton and agreed to pay Rentz 1
percent of Dynasty's gross NFL sales for his personal services in
assisting them in obtaining the license, the lawsuit claims.
</P>
<P>
   But after ``numerous conversations and meetings,'' Ignacio
Mendez told Rentz in January 1991 that Dynasty did not receive an
NFL license ``through the efforts of Paul Warfield but primarily
through the services of another undisclosed individual,'' the
lawsuit claims.
</P>
<P>
   Warfield, the lawsuit claims, ``concealed that he was the
promoter of a closely held Ohio corporation registered under the
name of Jemesco which was incorporated in December 1990 for the
purpose of obtaining or assisting in the obtaining of one or more
NFL apparel licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing Warfield from the lawsuit, Chief U.S. District
Court Judge Walter H. Rice found that there was not a contract
between Warfield and Rentz.
</P>
<P>
   Dynasty also denies there was a valid contract with Rentz and
insists it never made any promises of payments to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jemesco, Cronyn states, has a joint venture with Dynasty in
which Jamesco receives 3 percent of Dynasty's gross sales, which
has made Warfield ``a very wealthy man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the inception of the Dynasty-Jemesco licensing
relationship with NFL Properties, Dynasty has accumulated gross
sales of NFL licensed merchandize in the aggregate amount of
$62.952 million,'' according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Dynasty has subsequently secured similar licenses with the
National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The jury trial is expected to last three days.

JUSTICES TO DECIDE HOW FAR STATE, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN GO IN
BANNING NUDE DANCING IN BARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional trim) 
 
By JENNIFER DAY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
Pennsylvania's high court was wrong to strike an ordinance
prohibiting nude dancing in public as a violation of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, in Barnes vs. Glen Theatre Inc., the court
issued a divided decision upholding a similar Indiana ordinance.
The city of Erie, Pa., contends the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
disregarded precedent set by that decision in ruling that the
Erie's 1994 ordinance prohibiting ``appearing in a state of
nudity'' in a public place is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our courts are bound by precedent, whether that precedent is
agreeable to the jurists or not,'' wrote Gregory Karle, an attorney
for the city, in his brief urging the justices to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a lawsuit filed in 1994 by Kandyland, an
Erie establishment that provides nude dancing. It was supported by
two local theater companies that were concerned the ordinance would
prevent dramatic productions, such as ``Hair'' and ``Equus,'' both
of which contain nudity.
</P>
<P>
   An Erie County court found the ordinance an unconstitutional
violation of the First Amendment, and the city appealed. The
appellate court reversed that ruling, using a second U.S. Supreme
Court ruling to determine which opinion in Barnes should be
considered precedent-setting.
</P>
<P>
   The state appellate court decided that the ordinance should have
been tested according to guidelines articulated by U.S. Supreme
Court Justice David Souter in Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Further, it found the Erie ordinance survived the test, which
required that the law had to be designed to ``prevent secondary
effects associated with adult entertainment,'' and should be
allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, however, overturned the lower
court, finding the justices' decision ``hopelessly fragmented'' and
a ``hodgepodge of opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the appeals court ruled that Souter's opinion set a
binding standard, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that no
single opinion commanded a majority of five justices, so there was
no binding precedent.
</P>
<P>
   The state's high court then conducted its own review as to
whether the ordinance was intended to ``impact negatively on the
erotic message of the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   It ruled that it was attacking expression based on its content
and struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philip Friedman, an attorney for Kandyland, argued the city did
not ignore the ruling in Barnes. In his brief, he wrote that even
if Souter's decision was treated as precedent-setting, the city
never presented evidence to show there were harmful effects
resulting from nude dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he wrote, the city was clearly targeting dancing in
venues such as Kandyland because it allowed nudity in a production
of ``Equus.``
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pennsylvania Court viewed the Erie ordinance as
content-based as the only difference between nudity at Kandyland
and nudity in `Equus' was the message conveyed by the dancer,''
Friedman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arguments, which will focus on whether the Pennsylvania court
willfully ignored the U.S. Supreme Court's established precedent,
will be heard this fall or early in the new year. A decision will
be rendered before July 2000.

U.N. TEAM ARRIVES IN BELGRADE TO STUDY REFUGEE CONDITIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A U.N. mission has arrived here on its
way to Kosovo, where it hopes to establish the fate of tens of
thousands of refugees in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by the undersecretary-general for emergency relief,
Sergio Vieira de Mello, the 13-member team plans to spend two to
three days in Kosovo, despite NATO's refusal to guarantee its
safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot wait for a settlement of the problem to assist the
immense need of the people inside Kosovo,'' Vieira de Mello said at
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   NATO supported the mission and had given assurances, but not
guarantees, for its safety, he added. NATO had advised the group to
give 48 hours' notice of its itinerary, use clearly marked vehicles
and to travel only by day.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said none of the parties had welcomed the
mission. The Yugoslav government, which will escort the mission
throughout, had nevertheless promised a certain flexibility, Vieira
de Mello said. The mission had also informed the Kosovo Liberation
Army of its plans, and it awaited a response.
</P>
<P>
   The main aim is to review civilians' conditions like shelter,
food and health, as well as human rights. ``Human rights are
everything,'' Vieira de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   One objective is to find people reportedly taking refuge in the
hills, he said, but he conceded that such work would be extremely
difficult.

NATO PLANS WINTER SHELTER FOR 1 MILLION REFUGEES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO planners are preparing to shelter up to one
million refugees from Kosovo in Albania for the winter, in case the
war in the Balkans does not end soon and Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic unleashes a flood of new exiles.
</P>
<P>
   Masses of ethnic Albanians who were driven from their homes by
fear of the ethnic-Serb-dominated Yugoslav military or fear of NATO
bombers almost derailed the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia in its
early days, as their sheer numbers threatened to destabilize
Macedonia and widen the war.
</P>
<P>
   During the past week, Yugoslav forces near border crossings into
Albania and Macedonia have been turning back trains packed with
refugees and groups of refugees on foot, causing Western officials
to worry that Milosevic may be building up escape pressure among
the hundreds of thousands of displaced Kosovars prior to releasing
a large mass all at once.
</P>
<P>
   With the war in its 55th day Monday, J. Brian Atwood, who is
administrator of the Agency for International Development and the
chief US refugee-relief official, announced a joint US-United
Nations program to shelter an additional 345,000 Kosovar Albanians
with host families in Albania proper.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recruiting more host families in Albania, Atwood
said about 4,000 unused buildings in the country have been
identified that could be converted to shelters once they were
repaired and winterized.
</P>
<P>
   He said studies have begun on how to winterize the refugee
camps, most of which are tent cities and would require, at minimum,
floors and heaters. While an immediate decision to winterize the
camps was not necessary, he said it would take ``a couple months''
to do the work once the research is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 900,000 ethnic Albanians have fled or were expelled from
Kosovo, a province in Serbia where they once made up 90 percent of
the population, since the onset of NATO's campaign to stop
persecutions by Serbs which had long been driving Kosovar Albanians
out at a slower rate. About that number remain in the province, an
estimated 700,000 of them as displaced persons, unable to return to
their homes and livelihoods, according to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said that although officials do not expect all 700,000 to
be pushed out of Kosovo ``we've been surprised before'' _ by the
huge numbers in the early days of the conflict -- ``and we have to
prepare for the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects that the Yugoslavian regime will want to
retain about 300,000 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo for use as human
shields against NATO strikes, and to serve propaganda purposes, but
that ``there is a real possibility that 400,000 more people will
come out. It depends on the state of the diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In other major developments Monday:
</P>
<P>
   --Television in Montenegro, a small republic which is part of
Yugoslavia but which has broken ranks with Serbia in the current
crisis, reported that riots were occurring in Serbian towns whose
residents opposed their men being sent to Kosovo. Broadcasts
monitored by the BBC reported that a crowd of angry Serbs in
Aleksandrovac lynched the chairman of the town assembly, and that
in Krusevac more than 5,000 people, mainly women and children,
gathered to demand the return of soldiers from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   --NATO military strikes slowly began to spread over the country
after two days in which the pace of activity was severely limited
by the weathers. Several fuel depots were hit, and missiles struck
a military airport in the suburbs of Belgrade. Residents reported
hearing planes and heavy anti-aircraft fire in various parts of the
capital. Underscoring fears the conflict could spread, witnesses
said Serb artillery Monday shelled an area along the border with
Albania after nine Albanian tanks approached within a mile of the
frontier. The shelling stopped when the Albanians withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   --German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder traveled to Finland for a
meeting with President Martti Ahtisaari, who is working with
Russian special envoy Victor Chernomyrdin to broker an end to the
fighting, and to Italy, where Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, like
Schroeder himself, is under domestic pressure to make peace. No
information was released about the meeting in Finland. In Italy,
D'Alema's spokesman said, the two leaders discussed a proposal for
an immediate ceasefire based on a UN resolution accepting NATO's
program for returning the refugees to Kosovo. US Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott is to meet Chernomyrdin and Ahtisaari
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   --Greek officials said Foreign Minister George Papandreou
planned to propose a temporary 48-hour halt to the bombing to give
diplomacy time to work. In a newspaper interview, Papandreou said
he would make the same proposal to Moscow and Washington. Belgrade
would have to give a positive response to the truce, he said, or
bombing would resume.
</P>
<P>
   --Ibrahim Rugova, a pacifist Kosovar Albanian leader, said that
photos of him shaking hands with Milosevic and signing a document
calling for an end to the airstrikes were taken under duress, and
that he allowed them to be taken in an effort to gain freedom for
his family. Rugova and his family were allowed to leave Yugoslavia
May 5. They went first to Rome, then settled in Bonn, where he
repudiated the propaganda photos in an interview with a leading
German newspaper. Rugova said he would visit refugee camps in
Macedonia next week, and advocated continued NATO bombing until
Serb forces leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   --Hundreds of unarmed Yugoslav troops poured into Cetinje, an
ancient capital of Montenegro and home of its present-day
independence movement. Tensions between soldiers and residents were
reportedly running high, but there was no violence. ``I'm afraid
that everything will blow up, possibly,'' said Dragisa Burzan,
Montenegro's deputy prime minister and spokesman for the republic's
reform-minded administration. Military police were chased from the
area last month after they tried to hand out draft notices.
</P>
<P>
   The program to create more housing for refugees in Albania will
include a stipend to be paid host families by the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees and a one-time assistance package of
essential household goods from the United States, such as
mattresses, clothing, cooking implements and blankets. Host
families also will receive an increase in food rations.
</P>
<P>
   The incentive payment from the UN will be $30 per host family
each month, plus $10 for each refugee the family takes in, an
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood and other US officials, who reviewed the refugee-relief
efforts during and after Monday's briefing at the State Department,
said the International Committee of the Red Cross and some Greek
non-governmental organizations have been given limited
opportunities to deliver food and medical supplies to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But, they said, no decision has been made about the possibility
of air-dropping the large quantities which are believed to be
needed. A State Department official said last week that air-drops
would begin within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how effective it's going to be,'' said
Lieutenant General John M. McDuffie, director of the Pentagon
logistics directorate.``I mean, we really wouldn't know if we're
feeding the Serbs or if we're feeding the IDPs'' -- internally
displaced people.

OUPLE BACK IN COURT AFTER FIRM'S $1.5 BILLION SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Before the Internet, before high-tech startups made
billionaires of entrepreneurs overnight, there was Mr. and Mrs.
Kenan Sahin.
</P>
<P>
   After toasting their marriage in the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology student union in May 1967, Selcuk and Kenan Sahin spent
the next 15 years juggling their careers as university professors
and caring for their three sons.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1982, Kenan Systems Corp., a Cambridge software company
and the brainchild of Kenan Sahin, was born.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Sahin scoured the country for the best technological
minds, while his wife, she says, scrubbed office walls and shopped
for discount supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The investment paid off in January, when Lucent Technologies
Inc. paid $1.48 billion for KSC.
</P>
<P>
   But the sensational payoff came too late for Selcuk Sahin, who
walked away with just $1.5 million in 1996 when her 29-year
marriage ended in divorce. At the time, a judge valued the company
at $4.9 million _ 300 times less than what it sold for 32 months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in what financial experts, technology specialists, and
divorce lawyers see as a crucial test of fairness and equity in
these high-tech times, the former Mrs. Sahin wants a new day in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just common sense,'' said corporate trial attorney Ned
Leibensberger, who represents Selcuk Sahin. ``At the end of the
day, he's got more than a billion dollars and she's got a million.
I think that in cases involving high-tech software companies,
judges have a very tough job trying to determine value. Now we see
this purchase. . . . Now we know for sure how much the company was
worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal specialists say the KSC case, and the drastic difference
between the court estimate and the market price, represents a
growing problem in divorce cases, where his-and-her expert
witnesses race to keep track of an exploding technology market.
</P>
<P>
   Boston business and tax attorney Kenneth Vacovec, who represents
many high-tech entrepreneurs, said he believes mistakes are common
in company value estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is just so unpredictable these days,'' Vacovec
said. ``The economy is very logical; that's headed in the same
direction. But some of the prices we are seeing are amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vacovec thinks the Sahin divorce settlement should be voided,
solely because of the huge discrepancies in the estimated worth of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 divorce trial, Kenan Sahin's expert estimated
for the court that his company was worth $4.2 million; Selcuk
Sahin's specialist believed it was worth about $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Without a public stock exchange to consult, and two wildly
different estimates offered by expert witnesses, Norfolk Probate
and Family Judge Eileen Shaevel pegged the value of the company at
$4.9 million, saying that Kenan Sahin's expert used a formula that
seemed more logical.
</P>
<P>
   While neither spouse came close to estimating the true value of
the company, Sahin's former wife now says she has evidence that her
ex-husband knew his company's true worth, or close to it, long
before it was purchased by Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Several legal specialists who have seen Selcuk Sahin's motion to
void her initial divorce action say the testimony of Dr. R. Glenn
Hubbard of Columbia University, an adviser to the president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, may prove invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard concluded that financial data on 70 software firms
between 1996 and 1999 show that the $4.9 estimate was far low,
based on the sale price. In order for a company valued at $4.9
million in 1996 to sell for $1.48 billion in 1999 it would have had
to grow three times faster than the fastest-growing company in the
country, which he said was highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the company's value cannot be attributed to a new
product or a signifigant change in demand for it, Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Sahin's attorney, Norman Jacobs, said the notion of going
back to court because his client's company has done so well is
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that the views she articulates are
outrageous,'' said Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   He called the notion that Selcuk helped build KSC ``ludicrous,''
along with her attorney's allegations that a closer estimate of
worth could have been provided at trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs did acknowledge that the messy divorce is a sign of the
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States today, there must be hundreds of
companies that didn't even exist four years ago,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rapidly changing area of economy,'' he said. ``Forty
years ago, we didn't have problems like this in divorce court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs added that Selcuk Sahin was not a credible witness at
trial.
</P>
<P>
   By her own account, Selcuk Sahin made mistakes throughout her
messy divorce. She parted ways with six attorneys before hiring
Leibensperger _ in some cases because she could not pay their
bills, in others because they differed on courtroom tactics.
</P>
<P>
   She admits that her courtroom conduct was harshly criticized at
the close of the trial by the same judge she will face in a hearing
scheduled for May 24, when her former husband will move to have the
prior decision upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sahin said, she realizes she needs to approach her divorce
as the trained researcher she is, without emotion and anger.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard University's School of Public Health,
Selcuk Sahin began a breast cancer foundation in 1990 with money
from KSC, but funding halted when she initiated the divorce, she
says, after years of private battles and her husband's threats to
divorce her.
</P>
<P>
   Now her biggest financial concern is her oldest son, Ayral, who,
despite having graduated from Boston College and displaying talent
and passion for music, is mentally challenged and cannot support
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I am mortal,'' Selcuk Sahin said. ``I don't want to
wait to make this right. I want to make this right now, for women
everyhwere, for me, but mostly for Ayral.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's two other sons are KSC employees, she said, who
have sided with their father throughout the painful process.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Sahin, citing his attorney's advice and the pending court
matter, refused to comment on the case or on any allegations made
by his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known divorce attorneys in the region, Monroe
Inker, who consulted with Selcuk Sahin early in her divorce
proceedings, said the problem of fair estimates for high-tech
companies will become even greater as they multiply.
</P>
<P>
   He's represented clients whose ex-husbands vowed that they would
not take their companies public, then did just that, he said.
Spouses often do not have the money to properly investigate the
potential of companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find today, with all these new issues, and new technology,
that you should always ask for shares of the stock if you can,''
Inker said. ``It's very tough to value this market.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is crazy,'' Inker said. ``You show me how you get the
difference between $4 million and $1 billion.''

WHITE HOUSE PLEASED WITH RESULTS OF ISRAELI ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration greeted the results of
the Israeli election on Monday with public decorum, congratulating
the winner, Ehud Barak, but with private satisfaction that Benjamin
Netanyahu had lost.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's relations with Netanyahu started off poorly
and deteriorated to the point where Clinton snubbed the Israeli
leader during a visit by him here two years ago. Their personal
differences were barely papered over during tortuous negotiations
last October that ended in a modest pact brokered by Clinton
between Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when exit polls showed Barak likely to win by a large
margin, a senior administration official noted approvingly that
Israeli commentators were calling the results a ``blowout,'' the
Israeli term for a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the last Israeli election, when Clinton embraced
Shimon Peres as the best hope for peace, exulted in early polling
that predicted his victory and then was disappointed and
embarrassed to find he had backed a loser, the administration
remained circumspect about this race.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton looked on as three of his own best campaign
advisers, led by James Carville, moved to Israel and helped Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton telephoned both Netanyahu and Barak late Monday
afternoon. In a statement afterward, Clinton said he reaffirmed to
Barak that he would ``work energetically for a just, lasting and
comprehensive peace that strengthens Israel's security.'' Vice
President Al Gore called Barak early Monday evening from a hotel
room in Boston and later called Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   In the fairly grim landscape of Clinton's foreign policy
problems at the moment, Barak's victory came as good news.
</P>
<P>
   He is perceived by administration officials as a military figure
of stature who will be more conducive than Netanyahu to dealing
with the final phase of talks with the Palestinians, the critical
negotiations that will help define Israel's future.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have also said that Barak, with his
military background, is different in outlook than the former Labor
Party leader, Shimon Peres. Barak, they have said, will be
steadfast in ensuring that Israel's security is protected as the
peace process moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   It was too early to tell how soon the process, originally set
out in accords made in Oslo in 1993 and 1995 and then last October
at Wye, Md., would resume, a senior administration official said
Monday.

EDITORIAL: ISRAEL SELECTS A NEW LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 18:
</P>
<P>
   The decisive election victory of Ehud Barak, and the rejection
of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after three years in office,
is a political earthquake in Israel and throughout the Middle East.
Now Barak, one of the most decorated military men in Israeli
history, confronts a full range of opportunities and perils. He has
promised to unify the country's feuding factions, revive peace
negotiations with the Palestinians and energize the economy, though
he has provided few details on how to achieve these aims. His first
priority must be to form the broadest possible ruling coalition in
parliament, consistent with his principles and the need for bold
action.
</P>
<P>
   The voting suggested that Israelis had grown impatient with the
slow and erratic peace process under Netanyahu, whose claims that
Barak would weaken Israel seemed to backfire. In three turbulent
years in office, Netanyahu was a tough and eloquent defender of
Israeli security needs. He reached important agreements on Hebron
and parts of the West Bank, but each was defended as a grudging
step rather than put forward as part of a larger strategic vision
enlisting the Palestinians as Israel's partners. Netanyahu's
concession statement was gracious, in contrast with the angry and
divisive tone of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Early returns in the election for parliament show that, as
expected, smaller splinter parties made gains at the expense of the
larger parties headed by both Barak and Netanyahu. But while the
Labor Party lost a few seats, the Likud bloc all but collapsed, and
is certain to go through a bitter leadership fight now that
Netanyahu has resigned as party leader. Barak should be able to
construct a center-left ruling coalition. But it will be difficult
for him to reconcile conflicting demands among all groups that
might wish to join his government, especially those representing
Russians, Sephardic Jews and a new party of secular Jews that
criticized the grip of religious Jews on the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat and other Arab leaders hailed Barak's victory, and
indeed the election may portend an easier time in negotiations over
the final status of a Palestinian homeland, the contentious issue
of Israeli settlements on the West Bank and Jerusalem and even
negotiations with Syria. No doubt President Clinton will move
quickly to help restart the discussions in these areas. But
Palestinians should not expect any dramatic changes. One reason
Barak won was that he convinced voters that he would not trifle
with Israeli security. The Palestinians, who avoided violence
during the campaign, would do well to continue in that vein.
</P>
<P>
   With Barak's victory, Israelis have proven themselves to be
impatient voters. This is the second time in a row they have
repudiated a sitting prime minister and turned to someone basically
untested from the younger generation. Barak, a stolid campaigner
who pulled well ahead of Netanyahu in the last few days, surely
knows that it can happen again. His toughest challenge may be to
restore a sense of unity of purpose to a divided electorate, which
has grown weary of having its divisions exploited by politicians.
Israel's new prime minister has won an overwhelming victory few of
his supporters thought would be possible a few weeks ago. He must
now heal his nation and reawaken the dormant peace effort. &QL;

WHEN GOLF BALLS BECOME EASELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Like master painters, some pro golfers decorate
their golf balls with fancy artwork or personal messages.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But this isn't beauty for the sake of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   There is a method to the madness of marking a Max Flight, a
method to ensure a PGA pro doesn't whack the wrong Wilson out of
the rough. Those methods will be on display this week when 113
golfers tee off at the MasterCard Colonial beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Playing your golf ball, and not the ball of your playing
partner, can be a tricky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo was believed to be the only golfer to mark his ball with
No. 11, in honor of winning his first two Masters championships in
a playoff on the 11th hole. But on the second day of the 1994
British Open, Faldo lost his tee shot in the heavy rough on the
course in Turnberry, Scotland, and mistakenly hit Jim McGovern's
lie. Faldo took a two-stroke penalty, triple-bogeyed and finished
the tournament tied for eighth place.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers on the PGA Tour mark their golf balls to avoid a
Faldo-like miscue in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons.
For instance, on some of Tiger Woods' balls is the animal that
bears his namesake. John Daly has the University of Arkansas
razorback stamped on his ball. Duffy Waldorf has his golf balls
marked by his wife and children with messages and reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Frazar has superstitions about the number he uses to
mark his ball. For him, the number on his Titleist could in some
weird way have an impact on the score he shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't use No. 4s because I don't want to shoot a four on a
hole,'' Frazar said. ``I practice with No. 4s, but if I hadn't used
them all up by Thursday, I just throw them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, I like using the No. 3s. A three is good on any hole.
And I'll use a No. 2. But never, never a No. 4.''
</P>
<P>
   For other golfers, there is not a whole lot of magic involved
with marking their balls. If one golfer in a twosome uses a blue
magic marker to identify his ball, the other golfer might use a red
magic marker. Some golfers simply have their initials engraved on
the ball. But initials can have their drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing about putting your initials on the balls is that
when you give them out and a guy hits one into the pool or
something,'' said Billy Ray Brown. ``A golf club member finds the
ball and thinks I'm the one that hit the ball crazy into the pool.
I say, `Hey, it wasn't me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Painting Pinnacles for identification purposes has, of course,
gone on for a long time. The late Ben Hogan would put a black dot
on his ball, but he took it a step further. He'd pour about 100 or
so Spaldings or McGregors into a tub of Epsom salt, then rotate
each ball to see the position of the dot to find if the core was
evenly weighted. He'd use the ones that were, toss out the ones
that weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben tried to identify the variables he could control,'' said
Hogan's biographer, Curt Sampson, ``and Ben was a control freak
when it came to golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan was meticulous and is not known to have hit the wrong
ball. But despite hours of preparation, some golfers still do the
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a shadow on the ball in some deep rough at a pro-am
in Las Vegas,'' said D.A. Weibring. ``It was on the same line as my
amateur's ball was. It looked like my ball. But as soon as I hit
it, I knew it was wrong. When that happens in a pro-am, that is
when the relationship between the `pro' and the `am'
deteriorates.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth native Clark Dennis has taken great precautions not
to mistake his ball for another. Marked on the balls he uses are
his kids' initials, CWD and TAD _ for Clark William Dennis and
Thomas Alexander Dennis, four dots on each side of the number on
the ball, and a solid line through the word, ``professional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got it all marked up so that I can't possibly mistake it
for anyone else's,'' Dennis said. He then turned to his wife,
Vickie, and said, ``We can't have anymore kids, or I'll run out of
room on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vickie: ``Oh, I think we can squeeze one more in.'' nn

COOL FEATURES IN STORE FOR PGATOUR.COM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine being at work on a Thursday or Friday afternoon and
being able to follow your favorite PGA Tour golfers via a
customized, real-time leader board while you're accessing
PGATour.com.
</P>
<P>
   While you have one eye on the boss, a tiny leader board pops up
as a separate window on your Web browser with live stroke-by-stroke
updates of your favorite golfer(s).
</P>
<P>
   For typical golf fans, it beats getting elbowed in a gallery
full of fans. For fantasy-golf enthusiasts, it's a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's pretty cool,'' said Charlie Schmitt, general
manager of PGATour.com.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if it pans out as planned, it will be.
</P>
<P>
   However, the feature won't be available until at least July 1 or
until PGATour.com's agreement with SportsLine USA is complete.
</P>
<P>
   For fans who intend to follow this week's MasterCard Colonial at
Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, it's not cool _ but it should
be worth the wait. A customized leader board is expected to be just
one of the enhancements in store for the July relaunch of
PGATour.com (www.pgatour.com); the staffs for the PGA Tour and
SportsLine USA are meeting today to brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   The multiyear agreement between Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based
SportsLine USA and the Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.-based PGA to
co-produce the 2-year-old site is based on each organization's
accurate perception that each site complements the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the kind of deal where we felt we were really stronger
together than apart,'' Schmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   PGATour.com has real-time scoring for PGA Tour, Senior PGA Tour
and Nike Tour events and multimedia features, all powered by IBM.
SportsLine's GolfWeb has news from the United States Golf
Association, LPGA, European PGA Tour and other international tours
in addition to content about travel and commerce for the average
hacker.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also increases exposure for PGATour.com.
SportsLine USA, which produces CBS SportsLine, has steadily
increased its assets by absorbing domestic and international sports
sites the past five months. SportsLine already has a sizable sports
presence on America Online, the Web's most-popular site.
</P>
<P>
   ``By combining what we had in place, we now have by far the best
golf destination on the Web,'' said Michael Levy, president of
SportsLine USA.
 &LR; subheds:Bytes
</P>
<P>
   SportsLine goes Euro: In SportsLine's continuing expansion to
everything sports, it has announced that it has partnered with
Intel, MediaOne, and Reuters to create SportsLine Europe.
</P>
<P>
   SportsLine plans to use the multilanguage site to focus on
soccer, auto racing, rugby, cricket, skiing and other
European-style sports. The first SportsLine Europe sites will be
developed for the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, Germany,
Sweden and Italy. The first, in Britain, is expected to be
operational by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any of the other sports companies, CNN/SI or
ESPN.com, with an interest or making a move in this direction,''
Levy said. ``We see a void and a great opportunity to build the
biggest site out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN.com spokesman Eric Handler said ESPN.com also has plans to
build an international audience through its relationship with ESPN
International, which has 20 networks overseas amounting to 150
million households in 21 languages.

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis overwhelmingly elected Ehud Barak, the
Labor Party leader, as prime minister on Monday, rejecting the
tumultuous leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, whose galvanizing
character has dominated Israel for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a complete reshuffling of the political deck, Israelis also
remade their parliament: The right wing withered as the center grew
with four new parties, changing the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barak can now assemble a large block of secular parties,
he has the option to form a government without any ultra-Orthodox
representation. The ultra-Orthodox appear to have lost their
exclusive role as a swing vote between left and right to the
Russian immigrants and other centrists.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m. Monday, Barak was leading with 58.8 percent to
Netanyahu's 41.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A highly decorated former general, Barak, 57, is a dovish hawk
in the image of his mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, and the vote is a
resounding call for a revival of the languishing
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yitzhak is looking down on us from where he may, he knows
that we together will fulfill his legacy,'' Barak said in his
victory speech. ``We need to strengthen our country's security by
moving forward to peace agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also sounded a call for unity. ``It is my intention to be
everyone's prime minister,'' he said. ``All of Israel is part of
each of us, and we extend a courageous hand to all, to secular and
religious, to those of Ashkenazi and of Sephardic background, to
those who immigrated from the former Soviet Union and from
Ethiopia, to the Arabs, the Bedouins and the Circassians.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 35 minutes of the first television exit polls, before
Barak made any public comment, Netanyahu not only conceded defeat,
but stepped down as the leader of the conservative Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian officials gloated over
the political demise of a leader whom they considered hostile and
intransigent. Israeli Radio reported open celebrations in the
office of Paesltinian leader Yasser Arafat, who called to
congratulate Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu fell into the trash bin of history,'' Fraih Abu
Meddien, the Palestinian justice minister said in an interview in
Gaza. ``He will be gone forever and good riddance. He's a racist
and no other Israeli leader will ever be as bad as he was. The
Palestinian people were patient for three years through his
arrogance. We helped bring him down. We are the ones who made this
statue fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight in Tel Aviv, a huge celebration erupted
in Yitzhak Rabin Square, the site of the late prime minister's
assassination. With mixed emotions, tens of thousands of mostly
young Israelis both cheered Barak's victory and lit candles in
honor of Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabin, we have won!'' they shouted repeatedly into the balmy
evening air, crying and hugging each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel, a few miles away, Netanyahu, a
fixture in Israeli politics for 15 years, strode off the political
stage quickly, cleanly, and with cordial congratulations to his
opponent. Flanked by his wife, Sarah, and by a grim Ariel Sharon,
his foreign minister, Netanyahu, with a serene look on his face,
addressed weeping supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation decided and we respect that decision,'' Netanyahu
said, stunning his audience, which is unaccustomed to the sight of
their prime minister conceding anything. ``That is the way it has
to be in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's Likud Party, traditionally one of the two major
parties of Israel, suffered from his collapse at the polls.
Netanyau's Likud coalition held 32 seats in 1996, and the party was
down to about 20 with slightly fewer than half the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the defectors left for Shas, the ultra-Orthodox
Sephardic party. In a stunning gain, Shas seemed to have garnered
six new seats in the new parliament, giving it about 16.
</P>
<P>
   This growth spurt came despite the recent criminal conviction on
corruption charges of Aryeh Deri, the party's leader, which many
religious Sephardic Jews believed was intended to persecute Deri
because he is Moroccan-born and ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thank the creator of the world,'' Deri said in
Jerusalem, as he sat atop the shoulders of a supporter. ``All those
who wanted to step on us _ the Lord gave us power today.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Netanyahu's defeat was not merely a rejection of him,
but of the right wing's perceived obstructionist agenda on the
peace effort. Most Israelis not only endorse the peace effort, but
accept that a Palestinian state is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the prime minister's office,
President Clinton sent Netanyahu a message: ``I appreciate the hard
work you did. You're a strong man with a strong historical
awareness and we all believe you will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also according to the statement, Netanyahu responded, ``Thank
you very much but I'm taking a long vacation.''

</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis were driving through the streets beeping their
horns, or popping the corks on champagne bottle. ``As soon as Bibi
said he was resigning, the champagne came out as did the
pistachios, cake and popcorn,'' said Lisa Feinmesser, 51, an
administrative assistant in Jerusalem. ``We're so sick of the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking drawn and defeated, Gila Gamliel, a 24-year-old Likudnik
who lost her bid for parliament, said, ``Despite the great
accomplishments of the government, everyone was against us and
against the prime minister out of personal hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   A kibbutz-born Israeli who spent 35 years in the army and
retired as chief of staff, Barak is brainy and complex. He has
confidence in his own judgments, which are based, like those of any
serious military strategist, as much on input as intuition. Friends
say he is his own best counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He has conducted his campaign like a military exercise. Building
on a network of army buddies, he revitalized the Labor Party's
aging infrastructure with a far more professional campaign on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also relied on layers of American consultants, including
two top American pollsters, who field-tested every question raised
by Barak about the mood of the Israeli public and the sectors
within it.
</P>
<P>
   He personally sought to commandeer a remake of the Labor Party,
which is traditionally both leftist and elitist in a peculiarly
Israeli combination, into a party of the center. He ran at the head
of the One Israel coalition, forged with Meimad, a moderate
Orthodox group, and the Sephardic Gesher Party of David Levy, the
Moroccan-born former foreign minister of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate at the helm of the left, he sees himself following
the lead of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political advertising has stressed his military
background, which includes a string of derring-do missions that are
an integral part of Israeli legend. His campaign has repeatedly
broadcast images of him liberating a Sabena airplane from
Palestinian terrorists, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, he has said he would move quickly to kick start
the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, to plan the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, and to reopen
negotiations with Syria over Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elections, many Israelis said they considered Barak
and Netanyahu to be cut from the same cloth, as Ashkenai members of
the elite who both served in the same elite military unit and both
studied in the United States. Israelis said they were confused
about what differentiated the candidates' stand on peace, since
both said they supported a tough peace with security.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men hold very different views about Israel's
relative position in the Mideast, which fundamentally shape
different approaches to peacemaking. Netanyahu believed Israel to
be in a constant state of threat from its Arab neighbors,
approached them with suspicion and refused to make concessions
until concessions were given.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, on the other hand, sees Israel as the strongest country
in a tough neighborhood, negotiating from a vantage point of
greater military might, higher economic standing and a sounder,
more democratic political system.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks peace agreements must be reached before conditions are
perfect, and that relationships should be sown to encourage
cooperation on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give a new momentum to peace agreements,'' he said
in an interview in April. ``I'm not going to compromise any of our
vital interest. I will definitely fight against terror, I did it
all my life. But I learned during many years, decades of fighting
that the right way to bring about personal security to Israelis and
overall security to Israel is through peace agreement with our
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Four and a quarter million Israelis voted, almost all the adults
in the country. Voter turn-out is always high here. Statistics say
it is 80 percent, but, given that about 10 percent of the
population lives abroad and there are no absentee ballots, the
figure is closer to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israelis have been arriving from abroad to vote,
too.

FOUR KOSOVAR REFUGEES ARE RELEASED FROM DETENTION BY INS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four Kosovar refugees, who had been sent to jails in
Pennsylvania for having misled immigration officials in Macedonia
in order to reach the United States, have been released and sent
back to the refugee camp at Fort Dix, N.J., where they will remain
eligible for residency in the United States, a spokesman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected reversal by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service came after the agency drew sharp criticism for having sent
the four refugees, one of them a minor, to jails and detention
centers in York, Carbon and Berks counties.
</P>
<P>
   Detention in the county jails was the first step in what would
have been the forced return of the four to the Balkans through what
the INS calls an ``expedited removal process,'' an immigration
spokesman said, though the four did not have homes to return to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field folks and everyone realized very quickly that we had
to work out a more appropriate process,'' said Mike Gilhooly, a
spokesman for the INS. He said the four were all legitimate
refugees with no criminal records, but had entered the United
States without proper documentation. They were released on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Resettlement officials said that in the crowded refugee camps in
Macedonia, rumors were circulating that the United States would
give preference to resettling intact families, and so some people
who had lost touch with their relatives in the confusion of fleeing
Kosovo might have patched together substitute families. Others may
have lied about their ages, since the United States did not intend
to admit unaccompanied minors.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials have so far found that slightly more than
1 percent, or 33 of the 2,627 Kosovar Albanians at Fort Dix,
entered the country with improper documentation. Gilhooly said on
Monday that the INS had sent only the first four to county jails,
and had moved to find other solutions well before the criticism
late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at these small number of cases and determine what
additional steps are needed to complete the resettlement of these
people in the United States,'' Gilhooly said. He said the same
procedure would apply to any similar problems that arise in the
future. ``We don't intend to place anyone into the expedited
removal process, unless it turns out that they're not refugees, or
they pose some threat to the public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty
International U.S.A., said that he had heard conflicting reports
about the immigration agency's plans for handling future
discrepancies among the Kosovar refugees. He said that if, indeed,
the INS no longer planned to jail any Kosovar refugees, ``then
naturally we commend them for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the agency's reversal only underscored ``how utterly
inappropriate the general practice is.'' The human rights
organization has criticized the INS severely for sending both the
Kosovars and foreigners who seek political asylum to county jails,
where Schulz said they are at times mixed with the general criminal
population.
</P>
<P>
   Gilhooly said that only foreigners who claim asylum as a last
resort on the verge of deportation are sent to county jails. He
said the INS did not have an estimate of how many people fit into
that category. He added that the INS' latest decision only applies
to the Kosovar Albanians, whose inability to return home is not a
matter of dispute.

WHEN GOLF BALLS BECOME EASELS (corrects Maxfli in third graf) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Like master painters, some pro golfers decorate
their golf balls with fancy artwork or personal messages.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But this isn't beauty for the sake of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   There is a method to the madness of marking a Maxfli, a method
to ensure a PGA pro doesn't whack the wrong Wilson out of the
rough. Those methods will be on display this week when 113 golfers
tee off at the MasterCard Colonial beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Playing your golf ball, and not the ball of your playing
partner, can be a tricky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo was believed to be the only golfer to mark his ball with
No. 11, in honor of winning his first two Masters championships in
a playoff on the 11th hole. But on the second day of the 1994
British Open, Faldo lost his tee shot in the heavy rough on the
course in Turnberry, Scotland, and mistakenly hit Jim McGovern's
lie. Faldo took a two-stroke penalty, triple-bogeyed and finished
the tournament tied for eighth place.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers on the PGA Tour mark their golf balls to avoid a
Faldo-like miscue in a variety of ways for a variety of reasons.
For instance, on some of Tiger Woods' balls is the animal that
bears his namesake. John Daly has the University of Arkansas
razorback stamped on his ball. Duffy Waldorf has his golf balls
marked by his wife and children with messages and reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Frazar has superstitions about the number he uses to
mark his ball. For him, the number on his Titleist could in some
weird way have an impact on the score he shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't use No. 4s because I don't want to shoot a four on a
hole,'' Frazar said. ``I practice with No. 4s, but if I hadn't used
them all up by Thursday, I just throw them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, I like using the No. 3s. A three is good on any hole.
And I'll use a No. 2. But never, never a No. 4.''
</P>
<P>
   For other golfers, there is not a whole lot of magic involved
with marking their balls. If one golfer in a twosome uses a blue
magic marker to identify his ball, the other golfer might use a red
magic marker. Some golfers simply have their initials engraved on
the ball. But initials can have their drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad thing about putting your initials on the balls is that
when you give them out and a guy hits one into the pool or
something,'' said Billy Ray Brown. ``A golf club member finds the
ball and thinks I'm the one that hit the ball crazy into the pool.
I say, `Hey, it wasn't me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Painting Pinnacles for identification purposes has, of course,
gone on for a long time. The late Ben Hogan would put a black dot
on his ball, but he took it a step further. He'd pour about 100 or
so Spaldings or McGregors into a tub of Epsom salt, then rotate
each ball to see the position of the dot to find if the core was
evenly weighted. He'd use the ones that were, toss out the ones
that weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben tried to identify the variables he could control,'' said
Hogan's biographer, Curt Sampson, ``and Ben was a control freak
when it came to golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan was meticulous and is not known to have hit the wrong
ball. But despite hours of preparation, some golfers still do the
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a shadow on the ball in some deep rough at a pro-am
in Las Vegas,'' said D.A. Weibring. ``It was on the same line as my
amateur's ball was. It looked like my ball. But as soon as I hit
it, I knew it was wrong. When that happens in a pro-am, that is
when the relationship between the `pro' and the `am'
deteriorates.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth native Clark Dennis has taken great precautions not
to mistake his ball for another. Marked on the balls he uses are
his kids' initials, CWD and TAD _ for Clark William Dennis and
Thomas Alexander Dennis, four dots on each side of the number on
the ball, and a solid line through the word, ``professional.''

   ``I've got it all marked up so that I can't possibly mistake it
for anyone else's,'' Dennis said. He then turned to his wife,
Vickie, and said, ``We can't have anymore kids, or I'll run out of
room on the ball.''

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR DRIVERS' PRIVACY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., S.C., Neb. Fla., Pa.)  (dal) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court broadened its exploration of
federalism issues on Monday by agreeing to decide whether Congress
had violated states' rights when it prohibited state motor vehicle
agencies from revealing personal information about drivers who did
not consent to the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The case is an appeal by the Clinton administration of a ruling
last year that declared the Drivers Privacy Protection Act of 1994
unconstitutional. The 2-1 ruling, by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Richmond, Va., said that the law had offended ``our
system of dual sovereignty'' by telling the states what they could
and could not do with their drivers' records.
</P>
<P>
   The law has been unpopular among the states, where marketers and
operators of commercial databases had provided a new source of
revenue in return for access to names, addresses, telephone numbers
and medical and disability information on licensed drivers. New
York earned $17 million in one recent year from charging for access
to the state's computers for examining driver information. Media
organizations have also objected to the law on the ground that it
blocks public access to information.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by states in federal courts nationwide, the law has
so far been upheld in two federal circuits and struck down in two
others. That made Supreme Court review almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The court has been deeply split on federalism issues, with most
recent cases decided by votes of 5-4 in favor of the states. This
case is especially interesting, beyond the fate of the Drivers
Privacy Protection Act, because the 4th Circuit majority wrote an
aggressively states' rights opinion that requires the justices to
confront the meaning and implications of some of their most
disputed recent precedents.
</P>
<P>
   All but inviting the justices to overturn a 1985 decision that
made federal minimum wage-and-hour regulations applicable to state
employees, the appeals court quoted from Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist's dissenting opinion in that 5-4 case, which itself
contained an unusually explicit vow to revisit the issue ``in
time'' and to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The case Monday, Reno vs. Condon, No. 98-1464, originated with a
lawsuit filed by South Carolina seeking an injunction against
enforcement of the drivers' privacy law.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the law in response to the murder of an actress,
Rebecca Schaeffer, whose home address was obtained by a stalker
using motor vehicle records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence gathered by Congress revealed that that incident was
similar to many other crimes in which stalkers, robbers and
assailants had used state motor vehicle records to locate, threaten
and harm victims,'' the administration said in its Supreme Court
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In voiding the law, the 4th Circuit interpreted the Supreme
Court's precedents as permitting Congress to bind the states only
to generally applicable laws. This law failed that test, the
appeals court's majority said, because only states operated motor
vehicle departments. When the justices hear the case in the fall,
the administration is likely to argue vigorously that the 4th
Circuit misread the precedents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the court began its annual end-of-term rush, these were among
the justices' other actions on Monday:
</P>
<P>
   Car Seizure
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 7-2, that police do not need a warrant to seize
a car that they have reason to believe is subject to forfeiture
because it has been used to commit a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The decision overturned a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court
that held that police should have obtained a warrant before
seizing, from an office parking lot, a car that they had videotaped
months earlier being used to deliver cocaine. After a search of the
car turned up two pieces of crack cocaine in the ashtray, the owner
was charged with and convicted of drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   All states except Nebraska have laws that classify automobiles
as subject to forfeiture under similar circumstances and that
permit seizure without a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas said that
Supreme Court precedents going back many decades had upheld
warrantless seizure of contraband, particularly in public places
where no invasion of privacy is involved.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth
Bader Ginsburg said the court should have adhered to the basic
presumption that a warrant was required. Although there are
exceptions to the warrant requirement, they said, the decision
Monday ``suggests that the exceptions have all but swallowed the
general rule.'' The case was Florida vs. White, No. 98-223.
</P>
<P>
   Nude Dancing
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to revisit the question of whether states can
ban nude dancing, an activity that the court's precedents regard as
having some ``expressive content'' entitled to a measure of
protection under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   In the court's last treatment of the subject, in a splintered
1991 decision, the justices held that nude dancing could be
regulated as long as the goal was not to suppress a message but to
protect health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the court has become more protective of
speech and more demanding of states that offer vague or unsupported
justifications for their speech regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down a
nude-dancing ban in Erie, rejecting the city's argument that the
ban was justified as a crime-control measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it highly circuitous to prevent rape, prostitution,
and other sex crimes by requiring a dancer in a legal establishment
to wear pasties and a G-string before appearing on stage,'' the
state court said. Pennsylvania's appeal, Erie vs. Pap's a.m., No.
98-1161, asked the justices to clarify the law in this area.

MEXICO, HOUSTON OFFICIALS DISCUSS POSSIBLE TRAVEL WARNING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Zuniga)

and JENALIA MORENO 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The consul general of Mexico in Houston met Monday
with city police officials to discuss the police shootings of three
Mexican citizens, incidents that caused some Mexican officials to
consider warning citizens not to travel to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Consul General Rodulfo Figueroa said police officials
agreed to give him those details of their investigations next week.
He also said he had offered to give a cultural sensitivity course
at the police academy.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Fred King would provide no details of
Figureroa's meeting with Assistant Chief J.L. Breshears, Capt.
Richard Holland of the homicide division and community liaison
Faustino Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussion is ongoing, but we cannot reveal the substance,''
King said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican government officials said last week that they were
considering warning their citizens to avoid traveling to Houston,
the fourth-largest city in the nation, because they were unhappy
with the investigations into the shooting deaths of Eulogio Perez
last month, Pedro Oregon Navarro in July and Uvaldo Garcia
Armedariz in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope we do not have to issue such an advisory,''
Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon was shot 12 times by Houston police in an aborted drug
bust. Oregon had a gun but tests showed it was not fired. Garcia
was shot by officers responding to a domestic disturbance call when
he brandished a chair and began charging at one. Eulogio Perez was
shot last month when he fired at officers after being stopped,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior government official in Mexico City, who asked not to be
identified, said the Mexican government has never considered
issuing such a travel warning before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are upset certainly because there is a pattern emerging
here,'' he said. ``We feel that this is our duty to put a warning
to our citizens who very often go to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   He said such a warning would come from Mexico's foreign affairs
department and would probably be posted on the Internet. However,
he said, only two to three million of the 93 million Mexicans have
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they don't want to issue such a warning
because it could affect business between Houston and Mexico, but
they said they would not tolerate Mexicans being shot by police.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Houston Authority Commissioner Vidal Martinez said
business ties with Mexico might have already been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is being looked at as being anti-Latin or
anti-Hispanic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Cantu, a Houston Latino activist, criticized Mexico's
threat as ``political strategy for internal consumption in
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted Mexico's human rights violations against its own
citizens and U.S. tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico doesn't have a leg to stand on and thus cannot accuse
nor has any credibility to accuse others,'' Cantu said.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Orlando Sanchez said his office is also
reviewing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is scheduled to speak in June
at an economic conference in San Antonio. He has canceled any plans
to also visit Houston, Dallas or Austin, but consul general
Figueroa said that cancellation had to do with time limitations and
not the possible advisory.

TCU's Huffman looks back on a two-sport course in college 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Nearing the end of a career that has brought
him All-America recognition and national acclaim as an outstanding
two-sport athlete, TCU third baseman Royce Huffman feels that a
brief testimonial is called for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have to thank \Rbaseball coach\S Lance Brown,'' he
said, ``for taking a chance on me when I was a short, fat
freshman.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice call, Lance. Take a bow.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has a year of football eligibility remaining,
Huffman is winding down a four-year baseball career that earned him
second-team All-America status in 1998 and has made him a strong
candidate for postseason honors this year.
</P>
<P>
   It has also left him at or near the top of virtually every
career category in the school record book, as the second-place
Frogs (29-24, 19-10) ready themselves for the Western Athletic
Conference tournament that starts tomorrow and runs through
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman is TCU's career leader in hits (310), doubles (58), home
runs (42), total bases (514), runs batted in (218) and walks (154).
He has the second-highest career batting average (.3995) and also
ranks second in slugging percentage (.662), games played (208),
at-bats (776) and runs (222).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he tied the single-season record for hits (89) and
compiled the second-highest batting average at .420. Thus far, he
has 87 hits this year and is hitting .422 with 13 home runs and 57
RBI.seasons, including 115 in a row _ a string that ended last week
when a sprained ankle benched him for the second game of the San
Jose State series. He was back in the lineup the next day, batting
1-for-3 as the designated hitter.]
</P>
<P>
   He has had a string of 115 consecutive starts that ended two
weeks ago when a sprained ankle benched him for the second game of
the San Jose State series. He was back in the lineup the next day,
batting 1-for-3 as the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Known in TCU football circles as ``Slash'' for his multipurpose
play as punter/runner/receiver/punt returner/passer, Huffman has
been Old Reliable for four years in the baseball program. In
Brown's view, he has also been something of a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest thing you can say about Royce is that
every year he's been here, he's gotten better,'' Brown says.
``That's a very hard thing to do, especially for someone who was
good to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You rarely see a player do that _ somewhere in there they'll
have a bad year, or sometimes just level off. But Royce has worked
every day to improve himself, and I think what he has achieved
there is probably more amazing than all his records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says a lot about the type of person he is.''
</P>
<P>
   For Huffman, the explanation is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never be personally satisfied with any season,'' he says.
``Not until I bat 1.000 and hit a million home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his focus at the moment is on the WAC tournament,
Huffman says it sometimes hits him that his TCU career is nearly
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to think about it,'' he says, ``especially being
a senior and not knowing exactly when it will end. I only know it
seems to me like I just got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it started four years ago when the members of a team
from Elkins High School in Missouri City, near Houston, scattered
like buckshot across the Texas collegiate landscape.
</P>
<P>
   They had just finished a 32-2 state championship season, and
Huffman _ also the quarterback on the football team _ had earned
all-state honors for the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Among others, the group included Rice outfielder Jason Gray,
Texas A&AMP;M outfielder Steve Truitt and Baylor second baseman Eric
Nelson. There was also pitcher Kip Wells, who left Baylor after
last season as a first-round draft choice of the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was also a guy named Mike Peterson, who was drafted by
the Rockies,'' Huffman said. ``There were about 12 to 14 seniors
who got Division I scholarships. We all grew up together, and we've
known each other all our lives. We're still very close, and
everyone keeps up with everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of that group, Huffman _ whose father, Royce, played
football at TCU from 1970-72 _ made a choice dictated solely on the
opportunity to play both football and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my coach to tell the recruiters that,'' Huffman says.
``The school that offered me the chance was TCU.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved fortuitous. Last fall, as TCU rose from the dead
under new football coach Dennis Franchione, /Sports Illustrated''
identified Huffman as one of the top 10 dual athletes in America.
</P>
<P>
   Undrafted in baseball last year, Huffman remains uncertain about
his immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have said the reason I wasn't drafted was because
of football,'' he says, ``but I don't really know what the deal
was. I want to play \Rpro\S baseball, and I still have a year of
\Rfootball\S eligibility left at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the ideal situation would be to do both, but I'll just
have to wait and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, I guess I'm reaching a point where one part of
your life ends, and it's time to start something new.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis overwhelmingly elected Ehud Barak, the
Labor Party leader, as prime minister on Monday, rejecting the
tumultuous leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, whose galvanizing
character has dominated Israel for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a complete reshuffling of the political deck, Israelis also
remade their parliament: The right wing withered as the center grew
with four new parties, changing the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barak can now assemble a large block of secular parties,
he has the option to form a government without any ultra-Orthodox
representation. The ultra-Orthodox appear to have lost their
exclusive role as a swing vote between left and right to the
Russian immigrants and other centrists.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m. Tuesday, Barak was leading with 57 percent of the vote
to Netanyahu's 42.8 percent, with almost half the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   A highly decorated former general, Barak, 57, is a dovish hawk
in the image of his mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, and the vote is a
resounding call for a revival of the languishing
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yitzhak is looking down on us from where he may, he knows
that we together will fulfill his legacy,'' Barak said in his
victory speech. ``We need to strengthen our country's security by
moving forward to peace agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also sounded a call for unity. ``It is my intention to be
everyone's prime minister,'' he said. ``All of Israel is part of
each of us, and we extend a courageous hand to all, to secular and
religious, to those of Ashkenazi and of Sephardic background, to
those who immigrated from the former Soviet Union and from
Ethiopia, to the Arabs, the Bedouins and the Circassians.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 35 minutes of the first television exit polls, before
Barak made any public comment, Netanyahu not only conceded defeat,
but stepped down as the leader of the conservative Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian officials gloated over
the political demise of a leader whom they considered hostile and
intransigent. Israeli Radio reported open celebrations in the
office of Paesltinian leader Yasser Arafat, who called to
congratulate Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu fell into the trash bin of history,'' Fraih Abu
Meddien, the Palestinian justice minister said in an interview in
Gaza. ``He will be gone forever and good riddance. He's a racist
and no other Israeli leader will ever be as bad as he was. The
Palestinian people were patient for three years through his
arrogance. We helped bring him down. We are the ones who made this
statue fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight in Tel Aviv, a huge celebration erupted
in Yitzhak Rabin Square, the site of the late prime minister's
assassination. With mixed emotions, tens of thousands of mostly
young Israelis both cheered Barak's victory and lit candles in
honor of Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabin, we have won!'' they shouted repeatedly into the balmy
evening air, crying and hugging each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel, a few miles away, Netanyahu, a
fixture in Israeli politics for 15 years, strode off the political
stage quickly, cleanly, and with cordial congratulations to his
opponent. Flanked by his wife, Sarah, and by a grim Ariel Sharon,
his foreign minister, Netanyahu, with a serene look on his face,
addressed weeping supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation decided and we respect that decision,'' Netanyahu
said, stunning his audience, which is unaccustomed to the sight of
their prime minister conceding anything. ``That is the way it has
to be in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's Likud Party, traditionally one of the two major
parties of Israel, suffered from his collapse at the polls.
Netanyau's Likud coalition held 32 seats in 1996, and the party was
down to about 20 with slightly fewer than half the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the defectors left for Shas, the ultra-Orthodox
Sephardic party. In a stunning gain, Shas seemed to have garnered
six new seats in the new parliament, giving it about 16.
</P>
<P>
   This growth spurt came despite the recent criminal conviction on
corruption charges of Aryeh Deri, the party's leader, which many
religious Sephardic Jews believed was intended to persecute Deri
because he is Moroccan-born and ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all thank the creator of the world,'' Deri said in
Jerusalem, as he sat atop the shoulders of a supporter. ``All those
who wanted to step on us _ the Lord gave us power today.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Netanyahu's defeat was not merely a rejection of him,
but of the right wing's perceived obstructionist agenda on the
peace effort. Most Israelis not only endorse the peace effort, but
accept that a Palestinian state is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the prime minister's office,
President Clinton sent Netanyahu a message: ``I appreciate the hard
work you did. You're a strong man with a strong historical
awareness and we all believe you will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also according to the statement, Netanyahu responded, ``Thank
you very much but I'm taking a long vacation.''

</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis were driving through the streets beeping their
horns, or popping the corks on champagne bottle. ``As soon as Bibi
said he was resigning, the champagne came out as did the
pistachios, cake and popcorn,'' said Lisa Feinmesser, 51, an
administrative assistant in Jerusalem. ``We're so sick of the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking drawn and defeated, Gila Gamliel, a 24-year-old Likudnik
who lost her bid for parliament, said, ``Despite the great
accomplishments of the government, everyone was against us and
against the prime minister out of personal hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   A kibbutz-born Israeli who spent 35 years in the army and
retired as chief of staff, Barak is brainy and complex. He has
confidence in his own judgments, which are based, like those of any
serious military strategist, as much on input as intuition. Friends
say he is his own best counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He has conducted his campaign like a military exercise. Building
on a network of army buddies, he revitalized the Labor Party's
aging infrastructure with a far more professional campaign on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also relied on layers of American consultants, including
two top American pollsters, who field-tested every question raised
by Barak about the mood of the Israeli public and the sectors
within it.
</P>
<P>
   He personally sought to commandeer a remake of the Labor Party,
which is traditionally both leftist and elitist in a peculiarly
Israeli combination, into a party of the center. He ran at the head
of the One Israel coalition, forged with Meimad, a moderate
Orthodox group, and the Sephardic Gesher Party of David Levy, the
Moroccan-born former foreign minister of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate at the helm of the left, he sees himself following
the lead of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political advertising has stressed his military
background, which includes a string of derring-do missions that are
an integral part of Israeli legend. His campaign has repeatedly
broadcast images of him liberating a Sabena airplane from
Palestinian terrorists, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, he has said he would move quickly to kick start
the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, to plan the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, and to reopen
negotiations with Syria over Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elections, many Israelis said they considered Barak
and Netanyahu to be cut from the same cloth, as Ashkenai members of
the elite who both served in the same elite military unit and both
studied in the United States. Israelis said they were confused
about what differentiated the candidates' stand on peace, since
both said they supported a tough peace with security.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men hold very different views about Israel's
relative position in the Mideast, which fundamentally shape
different approaches to peacemaking. Netanyahu believed Israel to
be in a constant state of threat from its Arab neighbors,
approached them with suspicion and refused to make concessions
until concessions were given.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, on the other hand, sees Israel as the strongest country
in a tough neighborhood, negotiating from a vantage point of
greater military might, higher economic standing and a sounder,
more democratic political system.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks peace agreements must be reached before conditions are
perfect, and that relationships should be sown to encourage
cooperation on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give a new momentum to peace agreements,'' he said
in an interview in April. ``I'm not going to compromise any of our
vital interest. I will definitely fight against terror, I did it
all my life. But I learned during many years, decades of fighting
that the right way to bring about personal security to Israelis and
overall security to Israel is through peace agreement with our
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Four and a quarter million Israelis voted, almost all the adults
in the country. Voter turn-out is always high here. Statistics say
it is 80 percent, but, given that about 10 percent of the
population lives abroad and there are no absentee ballots, the
figure is closer to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israelis have been arriving from abroad to vote,
too.

IN REJECTING NETANYAHU, ISRAELIS CHOOSE A MAN OF RESTRAINT
</HEADLINE>

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The leftist Meretz Party presented the political
commercial most insulting to Benjamin Netanyahu during this
campaign. It showed him dancing furiously, faster and faster, to
the music of a klezmer band whose musicians were ultra-Orthodox
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   It was a merciless mocking of the prime minister of Israel.
Critics of Netanyahu found it uproariously funny. Yet it also left
them sad, many said in interviews. It was time, they said, to have
a leader who didn't open himself up to such ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   It would be insulting both to Ehud Barak and to the Israeli
electorate to suggest that this was nothing more than a
throw-out-the-Netanyahu vote.
</P>
<P>
   Very clearly, Israelis were not just rejecting but choosing,
too. Weary of conflict, they were electing what they considered the
best path to internal and external peace, a resolution of both the
conflicts within their society and those on their borders. They
wanted normalcy, order, and integrity in government.
</P>
<P>
   And to get these things, they wagered, with the choice of Barak,
on an old model: a kibbutznik and decorated general who to them
seemed capable of both toughness and compassion. They wanted
someone who could be as conciliatory as he was firm, and someone
without the taint of corrupt associates.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Netanyahu's Cabinet members and his former chief of staff
are under criminal investigation. One of his closest allies, Aryeh
Deri, leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, was recently
convicted on corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   In Barak, Israelis consciously, or unconsciously, chose a former
protege of the late Yitzhak Rabin, although one who, like he did,
faces his first term in office after decades of experience as a
commander but little experience in the consensus politics of
governing.
</P>
<P>
   Barak deliberately evoked the link with Rabin throughout his
campaign. Following his lead, his supporters spontaneously gathered
at Rabin Square in Tel Aviv Monday night, where he ended up
delivering a second victory speech. Many talked about his victory
serving as a means for them to resolve the undigested trauma of
Rabin's death.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, in the way he ran his very professional campaign,
skillfully led them to these conclusions and associations. Gerald
Steinberg, a political scientist here, called the campaign ``a
triumph of avoidance.'' It was totally intentional.
</P>
<P>
   After three years of a prime minister who was the relentless
subject of national attention, Barak bet that a low profile would
be a strong selling point. And he didn't bet blindly. Using an army
of consultants, he conducted continuous field polls, and
cross-tabulated the results with every sector of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is not a man lacking in self-confidence, and running for
the top office in Israel is hardly an exercise in humility. Yet as
much as could be possible within the constraints of his character
and the campaign, Barak did not blow his own horn.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again in the last few months, the trait he demonstrated
most clearly was restraint. And in the volatile Mideast, that can
be a very appealing characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu is too provocative and too controversial to heal
this nation,'' said Tamar Harel, a saleswoman in Jerusalem. ``For
three years, everything has been about Bibi. It's time for Israel
to be the important subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Ben David, a hotel worker, agreed. ``Barak is my flavor of
the day, because he's vanilla,'' he said. ``I'm dying to be bored.
That would be so normal. To have a boring leader who just does his
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brainy, competitive and and capable of being a show-off, Barak
resisted all temptation to display this part of himself on the
public stage. Last week, he was on the verge of giving a classical
piano concert to Russian immigrants in Rishon Letzion. The piano
was supposedly on the stage, awaiting his fingers. But he must have
sensed that while his direct audience would have loved it, the
larger Israeli public might have be tempted to poke fun. He didn't
play.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Barak made a strategic choice to present himself as a
calm, almost bland voice of reason and integrity: the dovish hawk,
the Maimonides-quoting secular Jew. Tonight he quoted scripture and
appealed to his ``brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that many chose Barak because they did not like
Netanyahu. For all those who admired the prime minister because he
was ruthless, there were others who were depressed by the way he
antagonized both associates and leaders of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   This election was clearly a referendum on Netanyahu, whose
personality loomed large on the Israeli stage for the last three
years. He galvanized the Israeli public in a way that is probably
without precedent. Those who chanted ``Go, Bibi!'' at his rallies
idolized him with a loyal passion; those who criticized him,
including did so with what seemed to be outraged enmity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabin was hated by the right wing for his policies,'' Nachum
Barnea, a columnist for the Yedioth Arhonoth newspaper wrote on
Monday. ``Netanyahu was hated both by left and right because of his
character, because of his winks, because of his shocking
appearances. The hatred went overboard _ what Menachem Begin could
be forgiven for, Netanyahu could not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak successfully co-opted a principal part of Netanyahu's
appeal. Netanyahu has hammered the phrase ``peace with security''
into the Israeli psyche. Only he could deliver a peace agreement
with teeth, he said _ one that guaranteed Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   With his military credentials, however, Barak seemed tough
enough to many Israelis, and few believed he would jeopardize
Israel's security after a career spent fighting terrorism.

MEXICO, HOUSTON OFFICIALS DISCUSS POSSIBLE TRAVEL WARNING 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The consul general of Mexico in Houston met Monday
with city police officials to discuss the police shootings of three
Mexican citizens, incidents that caused some Mexican officials to
consider warning citizens not to travel to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Consul General Rodulfo Figueroa said police officials
agreed to give him those details of their investigations next week.
He also said he had offered to give a cultural sensitivity course
at the police academy.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Fred King would provide no details of
Figureroa's meeting with Assistant Chief J.L. Breshears, Capt.
Richard Holland of the homicide division and community liaison
Faustino Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discussion is ongoing, but we cannot reveal the substance,''
King said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican government officials said last week that they were
considering warning their citizens to avoid traveling to Houston,
the fourth-largest city in the nation, because they were unhappy
with the investigations into the shooting deaths of Eulogio Perez
last month, Pedro Oregon Navarro in July and Uvaldo Garcia
Armedariz in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly hope we do not have to issue such an advisory,''
Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon was shot 12 times by Houston police in an aborted drug
bust. Oregon had a gun but tests showed it was not fired. Garcia
was shot by officers responding to a domestic disturbance call when
he brandished a chair and began charging at one. Eulogio Perez was
shot last month when he fired at officers after being stopped,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior government official in Mexico City, who asked not to be
identified, said the Mexican government has never considered
issuing such a travel warning before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are upset certainly because there is a pattern emerging
here,'' he said. ``We feel that this is our duty to put a warning
to our citizens who very often go to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   He said such a warning would come from Mexico's foreign affairs
department and would probably be posted on the Internet. However,
he said, only two to three million of the 93 million Mexicans have
access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they don't want to issue such a warning
because it could affect business between Houston and Mexico, but
they said they would not tolerate Mexicans being shot by police.
</P>
<P>
   Port of Houston Authority Commissioner Vidal Martinez said
business ties with Mexico might have already been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is being looked at as being anti-Latin or
anti-Hispanic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Cantu, a Houston Latino activist, criticized Mexico's
threat as ``political strategy for internal consumption in
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted Mexico's human rights violations against its own
citizens and U.S. tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico doesn't have a leg to stand on and thus cannot accuse
nor has any credibility to accuse others,'' Cantu said.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Orlando Sanchez said his office is also
reviewing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is scheduled to speak in June
at an economic conference in San Antonio. He has canceled any plans
to also visit Houston, Dallas or Austin, but consul general
Figueroa said that cancellation had to do with time limitations and
not the possible advisory.

CONFERENCE DIVIDED OVER HIGH-DOSE BREAST CANCER TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., N.Y., Mich.)  (mk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cancer experts at an international conference here on
Monday were in such disagreement over the best way to treat
advanced breast cancer that one of them, Dr. Karen Antman of
Columbia University, said she was jokingly advised by her
colleagues to wear a flak jacket while making her presentation.
</P>
<P>
   At issue were five studies testing the efficacy of a
controversial procedure: high-dose chemotherapy followed by bone
marrow transplant or, more commonly, by a transplant of stem cells,
specialized cells that help marrow regenerate, from the patient's
own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Summaries of the studies, which were formally presented here
Monday, had been posted on the Internet last month, and their
equivocal results caused consternation among advocates of the
procedure and women who contemplate having it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the treatment has been proved to help people with
leukemia and other cancers affecting the blood and immune system,
it has never been definitively proved useful in breast cancer.
Nonetheless, since the 1980s it has been held out by some doctors
as the best hope of survival for women whose outlook is grim
because their breast cancer has spread to 10 or more underarm lymph
nodes, or even farther, to bones or other organs. About 12,000
American women with breast cancer have undergone the high-dose
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The five studies were discussed Monday in a vast, echoing hall
the size of a football field at the Georgia World Congress Center,
where 20,000 cancer experts from 70 countries were attending the
annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. There
was so much interest in the data that two extra conference halls
were set up with video equipment to hold the overflow crowd from
the main hall.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the studies were from the United States, one from
Scandinavia, one from France and one from South Africa. Only the
South African study showed a benefit from high-dose treatment; the
other four simply showed no difference in survival between women
given high doses and those receiving standard therapy.
</P>
<P>
   When the summaries were released, experts said the high-dose
technique still merited further study. They also suggested that new
data and scientific debate at the meeting might shed more light on
the findings and help patients decide whether to undergo the
treatment, which has harsher side effects and greater risks than
standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But patients and doctors hoping for guidance from Monday's
meeting might have been disappointed. ``It won't change anything,''
said Dr. Larry Norton of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
in New York, an author of one of the papers that said no benefit
had yet been shown. ``People who like to transplant will continue
to transplant, and people who don't will continue not to.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his co-authors, Dr. William Peters of the Karmanos Cancer
Center at Wayne State University in Detroit, said it was important
for women to make sure they had the procedure done at a center that
performed at least 20 a year. He said that at centers that did
fewer transplants, there was a higher death rate from complications
from the procedure itself.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's meeting, two researchers who did not participate in
the studies, Dr. Antman of Columbia University and Dr. Gabriel
Hortobagyi of the Anderson Cancer Center at the University of
Texas, presented their views on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Hortobagyi called the findings disappointing, and though he said
they deserved further study, he also said that at this time
bone-marrow transplant could not be recommended to women as having
any advantage over standard therapy. He said the South African
study must be replicated by other researchers to determine whether
the findings held up.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Antman found the studies encouraging, saying that if the
findings seemed disappointing, it was because the data were being
examined too early. She said that with time the high-dose treatment
might prove to prolong women's survival and also give them more
time free of signs of the disease, a major factor in determining
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   High-dose treatment is one of the most contentious subjects in
breast cancer therapy. Passionate advocates who have staked their
careers on it say it is the only hope for women with advanced
disease. But opponents argue that the hope is false and that women
should not be subjected to the risks and harsh side effects of the
treatment, because it has not been proved to lengthen their
survival.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment itself can be fatal: In early studies, the toxic
drugs killed 15 percent to 20 percent of patients, and though some
centers now report death rates of 3 percent or less, some studies
that combine data from different centers still report rates
averaging 7 percent. Side effects go far beyond the nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue and hair loss usually associated with
chemotherapy. They include severe infections, bleeding, organ
damage and painful mouth sores that may make it impossible to eat
for weeks on end.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Monday's meeting said they could not explain why
the South African findings on high-dose treatment were so different
from those of other researchers, though the South Africans used
different drugs from those given in the United States and also
performed the high-dose procedure in a different way. In other
studies, patients were first given a course of standard treatment,
followed by the high doses. But the South African team, led by Dr.
Werner Bezwoda of the University of Witwatersrand Medical School in
Johannesburg, gave patients the high doses right away, without the
initial course of standard therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers said that going straight to high doses might be
the secret to Bezwoda's success, and they suggested that other
teams should try it as well. But one researcher said a group of
scientists had asked the National Cancer Institute to send a
scientist to South Africa to re-examine the study data.

 Bill Would Make It More Difficult to File for Bankruptcy
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Many people who file for bankruptcy protection could find it much
harder to escape their debts if a bill recently passed by the U.S.
House of Representatives is signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ inspired by a growing credit crisis that prompted 1.4
million U.S. households to file for bankruptcy last year _ will be
debated soon by the Senate, perhaps as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   That record number of bankruptcy filings _ in the face of a
strong, growing economy _ was about five times the number filed in
1984. California, with 12 percent of the nation's population,
accounted for 205,000 filings, or nearly 15 percent of the national
total.
</P>
<P>
   The filers were allowed to wriggle out of an estimated $40
billion in debts. Virtually all of that _ equivalent to $150 per
U.S. resident _ is likely to get passed along to other consumers in
the form of higher prices and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill would greatly strengthen the hand of the
credit card industry by allowing card issuers to legally challenge
individual bankruptcy filings.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, though, say the root of the problem isn't abuse of
the present law. They accuse creditors of making credit too
tempting and accessible for people in marginal _ or worse _
financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the bill on May 5 by a lopsided 313-to-108 vote
after heavy lobbying by banks, credit card issuers, retailers and
finance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, the bill would tighten the qualifications
for Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings. Under Chapter 7 of the federal
bankruptcy law, you can shrug off all your debts and start again
with a clean financial slate.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would make it harder to qualify for Chapter 7 by
subjecting filers to a strict income and means test.
</P>
<P>
   The test could force many filers into Chapter 13 instead. Under
Chapter 13, individuals must agree to a schedule of payments that
would liquidate at least part of their debts.
</P>
<P>
   At present, federal bankruptcy judges are free to determine
which individuals qualify for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 and which are
not legally entitled to bankruptcy protection. In practice, more
than 70 percent of filers wind up in Chapter 7.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House-approved bill, judges would be allowed less
discretion.
</P>
<P>
   A Chapter 7 filing probably would be prohibited if both of the
following are true:
</P>
<P>
   _The filer's household income exceeds the state median. (In
California, that figure is $58,000.)
</P>
<P>
   _The bankruptcy trustee affirms that the filer should be able,
over a five-year period, to pay back either $5,000 or 25 percent of
the outstanding debt, whichever is less.
</P>
<P>
   The judge could make exceptions in special cases _ for example,
if the filer or another member of the household has serious medical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The bill contains numerous other provisions that give creditors
more legal rights and restrict the ability of debtors to walk away
from their obligations.
</P>
<P>
   It allows creditors to sue to challenge individual bankruptcy
filings, and it exempts creditors from certain types of
class-action lawsuits brought successfully by debtors in the past.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sears Roebuck paid around $300 million in penalties
and reimbursements in the past two years to settle class-action
lawsuits accusing it of improperly collecting credit card debts
from 180,000 bankruptcy filers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House-approved bill, such class actions would be
prohibited, according to Frank Torres, legislative counsel for
Consumers Union. Debtors who felt they were mistreated by their
creditors would have to file suit individually, he says, and
chances are they wouldn't, because of the attorney fees.
</P>
<P>
   Torres is one of those who blame the credit card industry for
fueling the bankruptcy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that card issuers mailed out 3.8 billion solicitations
last year, most of them offering tempting and ``misleading'' teaser
interest rates good for only a few months before rates of 18
percent and higher kick in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who might not have been extended credit 10 years ago
now get it,'' he observes. ``That includes people who can be
severely affected by small changes in the economy. Then the credit
industry wonders why people go bankrupt, and wants the government
to take the responsibility off their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres urges financially shaky consumers to fight temptation, to
``think twice before you pull out the plastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Use credit cards only to buy absolutely essential goods and
services for which you don't have cash on hand, he says _ not for
impulse purchases that you can't afford. If you let the credit
balance mount up, he warns, the interest charges can overwhelm you.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Climo, group director for financial industry affairs with
the American Bankers Association, disputes the notion that
creditors offer credit indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the never-ending torrent of credit card
solicitations, applicants are carefully screened once they apply,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in no creditor's interest to extend credit if a person
doesn't have the capacity to pay,'' she insists.
</P>
<P>
   A co-sponsor of the House bill, Representative George W. Gekas,
R-Pa., hailed its passage as a blow against financial chicanery. He
contends that people ``who can afford to pay their debts'' are
abusing the bankruptcy system, using it as ``a financial planning
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous horror stories to support that
contention _ for example, cases where people binged on
ultra-expensive vacations just before filing for bankruptcy,
knowing that they wouldn't be able to pay their credit card
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the bill also cite former Baseball Commissioner
Bowie Kuhn, actor Burt Reynolds and the late Texas Governor John
Connally, all of whom were permitted to keep multimillion-dollar
homes after filing for bankruptcy, thanks to liberal homestead
exemptions in their states.
</P>
<P>
   Under the House bill, the nationwide homestead exemption would
be capped at $250,000 _ meaning that any value in the home above
that figure could be taken by the bankruptcy trustee to settle
debts.
</P>
<P>
   This provision of the bill was weakened, however, by states
rights advocates in the House. Under a compromise, the bill permits
state legislatures to override the cap by allowing homestead
exemptions greater than $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does require two years of residency in a state before a
bankruptcy filer can take advantage of that state's homestead
exemption. The idea is to discourage debtors from moving out of
states with low homestead caps and into those with high ones or
none at all.
</P>
<P>
   It's not certain that the House bill will become law.
Congress-watchers say the Senate is less hawkish toward bankruptcy
filers, and that a final, compromise version could be watered down.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, President Clinton has vowed to veto any bankruptcy
bill that he considers too harsh. And he has stated outright that
the bill passed by the House fits that description.
</P>
<P>
   However, the lopsided vote in the House suggests that a
presidential veto could get overridden. It takes a two-thirds vote
of both houses to override a veto, but the House bill was approved
by just under three-fourths of those voting.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Randall Newsome, a federal bankruptcy judge in Oakland,
says the House version of the bill could have ``nightmarish
consequences'' for bankruptcy courts, adding greatly to the
bureaucratic burden.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the bill requires bankruptcy applicants to produce
their three most recent income-tax returns, to help the bankruptcy
trustee assess their finances.
</P>
<P>
   If they fail to do so within a specified period, their cases
would be automatically dismissed. They can file again, but the
second time around they get only 30 days to complete the entire
bankruptcy procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy applicants, by and large, are not sophisticated or
well informed, Newsome observes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them, who may not be able to lay hands on their old tax
returns, will be out of luck because ``there are no exceptions'' to
that requirement. Newsome envisions an avalanche of aborted
filings, dismissals and reapplications that will overtax his court
and its staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have to go through all this?'' Newsome wonders. ``Is
it to move people into Chapter 13? No. It sounds to me as though it
is to keep them out of the bankruptcy system altogether.''

 No Way to Skip Bill For '96 Tax Goof
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I contributed $2,000 to my Individual Retirement Account
in 1996 and deducted that much from my income in figuring my taxes
for the year. Recently, I received a notice from the Internal
Revenue Service informing me that I was not allowed to make the IRA
contribution because I did not have any earned income.
</P>
<P>
   My only income is from a pension, interest, dividends and rents;
I earn no wages. They want me to pay taxes on the $2,000, plus
interest on the unpaid tax, and penalties. Is there any way for me
to avoid this? Can I plead ignorance? Also, is there some way for
me to take the $2,000 out of the IRA without paying a penalty?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You definitely will have to pay the taxes and
interest on the $2,000 you improperly deducted from your income for
1996. There is no escaping that because, as the IRS indicated, you
had no earned income.
</P>
<P>
   As for the penalty, try appealing it to the IRS. IRS spokesman
Jesse Weller makes the well-worn point that ``ignorance of the law
is no excuse.'' But he says that if you had a sound reason for
thinking that you were entitled to make the $2,000 contribution
that year, you should explain it in a detailed letter. Don't get
your hopes up _ but you should at least try.
</P>
<P>
   You are entitled to withdraw the $2,000 from your IRA without
penalty, and you had better do it promptly _ along with any
earnings the money has produced. The longer your money remains in
the IRA, the more the IRS can penalize you. And don't forget to pay
taxes on the earnings as well as the principal.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if you are younger than 59-1/2 years old, you will
have to pay not only income taxes on the earnings, but also a 10
percent early withdrawal penalty on those earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: Always read the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P vs. Russell 2000
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me the difference between the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index and the Russell 2000 index? I hear both of them mentioned
a lot, but nobody bothers to explain what they are.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: There is a huge difference in the makeup of those two
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index consists of 500 of the largest
publicly held companies in the United States, spread across every
major industry. Among the stocks are Microsoft, General Electric,
Intel, IBM and Citigroup, to mention a random few. Taken together,
the 500 represent the bulk of the value of all stocks traded in
U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 is near the other end of the spectrum. It
consists of 2,000 small to midsize public companies. Have you ever
heard of Agribiotech, Brookdale Living, Felcor Lodging and Regency
Realty? All of them _ and a lot of other nonhousehold names _ can
be found on the Russell 2000 roster.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a huge difference in the way the two indexes have
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Small stocks have been relatively weak during the raging bull
market of the past four-plus years, while big-name companies have
been overachievers. Since the end of 1994, the S&AMP;P 500 has enjoyed
an average annual gain of about 30 percent. During that same
period, the Russell 2000 has gained an average of about 15 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
   A Penny Saved
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in purchasing a penny stock _ a company
valued at less than $1 per share. I am prepared to invest $10,000,
but my broker at Merrill Lynch tells me that this will cost me in
the neighborhood of $700 in commissions, or 7 percent of the
purchase price. Is there some less costly way to purchase these
shares?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: There almost always is a less costly alternative to
Merrill Lynch. Venerable old Merrill, bless its heart, regards
itself as the Tiffany of the brokerage industry and charges
Tiffany-like commissions to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Try one of the online discount brokers instead. You probably can
make the trade you describe through most of them for a commission
of less than $200. I would rather not recommend any particular
broker, but I'll point out _ as an example _ that Suretrade
 &LR; (www.suretrade.com)  &LR; would charge you $112.95 in commissions to
buy 10,000 shares of a $1 stock.
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad you didn't tell me the name of the stock or what _ if
anything _ the company does. If you had, I might have been tempted
to tell you not to risk your money _ or at least not so much of it.
Penny stocks as a class are notoriously risky.

 &HT;    BARAK OUSTS NETANYAHU, ISRAELIS LOOK FOR UNITY AFTER TENSE
CAMPAIGN
 &HT;    1000&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-BARAK-0518.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Offering a message of unity and promising to revive
the long-stalled Middle East peace process, army hero Ehud Barak
became Israel's next prime minister with a landslide victory over
combative incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was celebrated by tens of thousands of youths
reveling in Tel Aviv's Rabin Square, who saw the win as a return to
the ideology of peacemaking championed by the slain Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, a Barak mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Though the victory was apparent soon after the voting ended, the
famously methodical Barak waited until nearly 3 a.m. (local time)
to address his supporters in a Tel Aviv hotel.
</P>
<P>
   There, the 57-year-old former general and Israel's most
decorated soldier invoked Rabin's name and linked together his two
great challenges -- making peace between Israel and its Arab
neighbors; and bringing harmony to an Israeli society fractured
between rich and poor, secular and religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will undoubtedly cost us a lot of sweat, a lot of hard
work,'' the left-wing Barak said to supporters who sang ``May he
make peace,'' a traditional Hebrew song. ``In order for us to be
able to bring peace and security to Israel, we are going to have to
know how to first bring peace among us.''
</P>
<P>
   He then went to address throngs gathered at the open square in
Tel Aviv. The tragic site, where Rabin was killed in 1995 by a Jew
who is against the peace process, was jubilant over his protege's
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But, most analysts saw the vote as primarily a rejection of
Netanyahu's divisive leadership, which had been based on alliances
with the country's right-wing and fundamentalist religious parties.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection was sound and unprecedented. In a country known
for close elections, Barak was winning 57 percent of the vote to
Netanyahu's 43 percent with 42 percent of the polling stations
counted.
</P>
<P>
   Just 49 years old and now Israel's youngest former prime
minister, Netanyahu also told supporters that he was taking a break
from politics and relinquishing the leadership of his right-wing
Likud Party, which was thrashed in the separate balloting for
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, after the storm is over, after the election campaign is
over, the time has come to calm down and to heal the wounds,''
Netanyahu said in congratulating Barak, his former Army commander.
</P>
<P>
   Observers from the Holy Land to Washington had focused on the
election as key to reducing tensions in the Middle East, which have
increased since Netanyahu froze the Oslo peace process in December.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who had clashed repeatedly with
Netanyahu over the peace process and at times even refused to meet
with him, avoided any public endorsement of Barak during the
campaign. But the result was sure to please the administration.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton pledged to work toward a completion of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working closely with Ehud Barak and his new
government as they strive to reach that goal with their Palestinian
and Arab partners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will be the 10th prime minister in Israel's 51-year
history. With his wife Nava, Barak is the father of three
daughters. He has an engineering degree from Stanford University,
but it is his military exploits that have made him famous.
</P>
<P>
   In the Six Day War of 1967, he lead reconnaissance missions
behind enemy lines. In 1973, he disguised himself as a woman to
sneak into Beirut and kill PLO operatives.
</P>
<P>
   One old army buddy, Danny Michaelson, described Barak as an
``iceman'' under pressure. Now, Barak faces a multitude of thorny
choices that could literally redraw the maps of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He has promised to resume the Oslo peace process and, maybe even
more tricky, has given himself a year to pull Israel's troops out
of the 17-year war in south Lebanon. Even Monday night, northern
Israel came under rocket attacks from Lebanese guerillas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most pressing to Israelis is whether the secular Barak
will exclude from his government the fundamentalist parties that
have been expanding their influence over Israel's way of life.
</P>
<P>
   That issue was instrumental in turning Israel's 1 million-strong
community of Russian immigrants, most of whom are secular, against
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Russian's turned, Barak was a decided underdog.
Doubters said the cerebral, short and paunchy Barak was too stiff
compared to the quick-tongued and telegenic Netanyahu, known by his
nickname, ``Bibi.''
</P>
<P>
   But his message of hope capitalized on the public's
dissatisfaction with three years of tumultuous Netanyahu
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi is gone!'' yelled 21-year-old Neta Shteiner(cq), from the
passenger side of a Fiat Tempra in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so bad. He was lying, he was cheating,'' said driver
Yoav Cohen, 22. ``Now, the peace process will be better, quicker.
Everything will be more honest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this the election of backlash,'' said political analyst
Uri Dromi, of the Israel Democracy Institute. ``Most Israelis were
just fed up with what this prime minister was up to . . . you
cannot be in power for long anywhere if you base your power on the
extremists and that is what Bibi Netanyahu did.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders were clearly eager to rid themselves of
Netanyahu, who they repeatedly said they did not trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message the Israeli people sent out tonight was that they
want to make peace with the Palestinians and that they want
change,'' said Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian peace negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has 45 days to form a parliamentary government. That task
will be made tougher by Monday's vote, which fragmented the
parliament into about 17 parties. In addition to the loss of
several seats by Netanyahu's Likud, the parliament vote seemed to
accentuate the religious-secular rift in Israel. Both
ultra-religious and anti-religious parties picked up seats.
</P>
<P>
   The split parliament vote was expected from the typically
contentious five-month campaign. Israel, a country of six million
people, is comprised of news-addicts who love politics. Voter
turnout was expected to be the usual 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Several planeloads of Israelis living in the United States
returned to vote and police reported more than 150 complaints about
possible voter fraud. A few people were arrested trying to vote
with others' identification cards and fist fights broke out between
some party activists.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the race hinged on the personality of Netanyahu, the
prime minister whose campaign and message began to unravel in
recent days. He desperately accused Barak of being a pawn and ally
of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In his three-year term, Netanyahu seemed captive to the extreme
right wing members of his coalition. He had even enraged an Israeli
ally, the late King Hussein of Jordan, by attempting the
assassination of a Hamas official under his tacit protection. He
quarreled constantly with his own cabinet ministers and many of the
moderates resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Israelis enjoyed the influence Netanyahu granted to
ultra-religious parties in his government and the green light he
gave to the construction of Jewish settlements in the disputed West
Bank -- land that the Oslo process is supposed to divvy up between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted that terrorism against Israelis had dropped
significantly during Netanyahu's term, which he claimed was a
result of demands he placed on Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was elected in 1996 as the hard-line alternative after
a series of Palestinian suicide bombings. In what supporters see
has a penalty for his own success against terror, Israelis did not
pick up on Netanyahu's security message this time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he did not try to remind them. His commercials showed
video from old bus bombings. His increasingly shrill attacks
accused Barak of being weak against the Arabs and, eventually,
actually making political deals with Arabs
</P>
<P>
   figures, like Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the message failed and it was Barak's message
that carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Even Netanyahu loyalists seemed ready for the loss when going to
the polls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Netanyahu loses we will be fine,'' said 25-year-old
Asher Shakani, an ultra-religious theology student in Jerusalem.
``There is still a God in the sky looking out for us.''

 The Force of Licensing
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Dan Fost  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
In the ``Star Wars'' universe, money flies like sparks from a
supernova.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Lucasfilm Ltd., director George Lucas' Marin
County company, holds most of the purse strings by virtue of making
the wildly popular movies, the latest of which _ ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' _ opens tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm shares the wealth, however, through a range of
licensing agreements _ some with companies in the Lucas family,
like computer gamemaker LucasArts Entertainment Co., and some with
the makers of toys, books, fruit snacks, toothbrushes and
pillowcases. These range from major players like Hasbro Inc.,
Pepsico Inc., Hallmark and Colgate-Palmolive to Internet firms like
Amazon.com and Yahoo, to ordinary entrepreneurs who see a chance to
cash in on a major marketing phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to licensing, Lucasfilm wouldn't even need to sell a
single ticket to ``Phantom Menace'' in order to recoup the $115
million cost of production.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandising of ``Star Wars'' seems obvious in an era in
which movies routinely have massive licensing blitzes. It's
remarkable to realize that the first ``Star Wars'' movie in 1977
not only pioneered dazzling special effects, but also blazed a
trail for moviemakers to cash in with sales of ancillary products
like toys, clothes, backpacks and party favors.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the story of ``Star Wars'' has grown into a
quasi-religion, a modern myth laden with rich conflicts between
good and evil, the business now has grown beyond images flickering
on a screen, bigger even than toy Luke Skywalkers and light sabers
flying off store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   It's now the sort of financial behemoth that has Hasbro paying
nearly $400 million for the rights to make toys based on the movie
_ and Hasbro is just one of 75 licensees making a total of hundreds
of products.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern age of movie merchandising that many say started
with the first ``Star Wars'' film 22 years ago, ``The Phantom
Menace'' appears destined to break all sorts of records _ for toys,
not just ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a game of how many products you can get out there,''
said Howard Roffman, Lucasfilm's vice president of licensing. He
said the company just aims to satisfy its legions of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Movies that try to imitate the merchandising success of ``Star
Wars'' almost always fall short, he said. ```Star Wars' is unique
in the way it touched people,'' Roffman said. ``It's that bond that
made the merchandising possible. You can't create that. It happens
or it doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lucasfilm faces some significant challenges in maintaining
order. It works hard to protect its trademarks from pirates looking
to rip off the ``Star Wars'' brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken an aggressive stance,'' particularly
internationally, Roffman said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Lucasfilm said it received $1 million as a settlement
from two unnamed companies that made counterfeit products. Roffman
said the company also received a temporary restraining order
against a collector's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Lucasfilm and its distributor, Twentieth Century Fox, have kept
their advertising to a minimum, choosing instead to let the media
hype and other merchandising promote the movie for them.
</P>
<P>
   So many ``Star Wars'' products are on the market, and are in so
many places, that Lucasfilm almost doesn't need to advertise the
film on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi, for instance, plans a summer-long ad campaign featuring a
character created by Lucas' effects house Industrial Light and
Magic. The ``spokes-alien,'' Marfalump, does not appear in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pepsi plans to sell 8 billion cans of soda
emblazoned with photos of Anakin Skywalker, Darth Maul, Queen
Amidala, Chancellor Valdrum, Jar-Jar Binks and Qui-Gon Jinn _
including a special 250,000 ``gold Yoda'' cans.
</P>
<P>
   With so much demand for ``Phantom'' products, Roffman said the
company must exercise caution that it doesn't dilute the brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably could have been on every product in the
supermarket,'' Roffman said. Instead, the company stopped with
Pepsi and Frito-Lay. ``We drew the line there and made an awful lot
of enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a candy dispenser that toy licensee Hasbro Inc. is
making, Lucasfilm rejected many pitches for candy bars, Roffman
said. ``We look at what's the reason for a product,'' Roffman said.
``If it's cool and creative and new, that speaks volumes to us. If
it's simply putting a wrapper on a candy bar, we don't see the
value in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, the main ``Phantom'' toy vendor, won't say what it
expects to earn from the movie tie-ins, other than to say it
anticipates a good summer. ``The initial reaction has been just
phenomenal,'' said Hasbro Senior Vice President Wayne Charness.
``It's not often you see stores opening their doors at midnight to
welcome a new line.'' On May 3, the first day Lucasfilm allowed the
sale of toys from the new movie, many toy stores across the country
opened at the stroke of midnight to sell to lines of eager fans.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is cashing in with Lucas's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Foster City entrepreneur Chris Sherman, for instance, hawked
three Internet domain names _  &LR; www.episodei.com &LR; ,
 &LR; www.episodeii.com &LR;  and  &LR; www.episodeiii.com &LR;  _ as a $1 million
package on the Internet auction site eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman didn't get any buyers, and another site _
 &LR; www.starwarsnet.com &LR;  _ brought him a notice from Lucasfilm over
his unapproved use of the ``Star Wars'' trademark.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to build up enough traffic that the sites will fetch a
princely sum from ``eToys or Toys R Us or someone who wants to be a
major player in the online retailing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies like eBay, Yahoo, Amazon.com and Reel.com are
having a field day with ``Phantom Menace'' mania, setting up
separate ``Star Wars'' stores on their sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though `Episode I' won't be out on video for a while,
we've made a large marketing deal out of it,'' said Jeff Jordan,
president of Reel.com, an Emeryville firm that sells movie videos
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Reel.com has caught the fever in a big way. First, the company
snapped up and hoarded as many copies as it could of the video
cassette of the ``Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition.'' It claims
to have virtually cornered the market. Amazon.com is sold out, for
instance, but the packate is available at Reel.com.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a new commercial venture cashing in on ``Star
Wars'' e-tailing: Lucasfilm itself. The company has its own site,
 &LR; www.shop.starwars.com &LR; , run by a longtime Lucas licensee, Dan
Madsen, president and publisher of Fantastic Media in Denver. The
site sells the same toys available in stores as well as some
exclusive products.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen was a die-hard ``Star Wars'' devotee who ran the official
fan club for Lucasfilm since 1985. He's turned it into a booming
business, growing from 15 employees five years ago to 110 employees
today. Although he doesn't disclose revenues, he says the figure is
``in the millions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucasfilm started to rejuvenate the licensing program five
years ago,'' Madsen said. ``Its fans never dropped off the face of
the earth. They just hibernated.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen's loyalty has paid off in a big way, and not just in his
licensing arrangements. The 37-year-old fan-turned-businessman has
a cameo role at the end of ``Phantom Menace.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Betsey Johnson bounces into a room exuding energy, her
rag-mop of blatantly dyed red hair swinging, you half expect her to
turn a cartwheel. But no. ``I do only two cartwheels a year,'' she
said. That would be at the finale of her spring and fall runway
shows, where they are as much of a signature as the colorful jersey
prints and sweaters, the laced-up corsets and frilly petticoats she
finds new ways of showing every season.
</P>
<P>
   But she did turn a mental cartwheel when she heard about the
special award she will be getting for ``timeless talent'' from the
Council of Fashion Designers of America on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely shocked,'' Ms. Johnson said the other day,
curled up in a chair in her sunny yellow and hot pink Seventh
Avenue showroom. ``I really did not expect anything until Lifetime
Achievement time. There was buzz before, but there was never an
award for me. I'm not at that mega-level with Donna and Calvin and
Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sales are less than $40 million a year, a fraction of what
those high-powered designers sell. And she knows she would never
get the Designer of the Year Award from the council, because she
doesn't follow fashion trends and is rarely taken seriously as a
designer by her peers or the fashion magazines. But Ms. Johnson has
survived for more than 30 years despite changes in fashion that she
has pretty much ignored, sticking to what she calls a formula.
``It's no big thing,'' she said. ``Take a leotard and add a
skirt.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration came from her early training as a dancer, and
she has managed to work enough variations on the theme to
constantly attract a new generation of young women who find the
clothes both comfortable and feminine. And affordable, to boot,
with prices from $60 to $300. (Since 1996 there has also been
Ultra, a second line with more costly fabrics and trimmings, priced
from $500 to $1,000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If a girl comes to me first for a prom or a bar mitzvah and
she likes the way she looks and her boyfriend likes the way she
looks,'' Ms. Johnson said, ``she'll come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kal Ruttenstein, the senior vice president for fashion direction
of Bloomingdale's, said: ``Everybody talks about the fact that a
designer who wants a long life in fashion has to have a look and
keep updating and refining it. Betsey Johnson was one of the first
to establish a look back in the '60s. She's always had her own
little niche.''
</P>
<P>
   Stan Herman, the president of the fashion designers' council,
calls her one of the first ``emancipated'' designers. ``Back in the
'60s,'' he said, ``she was at the forefront of designers doing
clothes that were not expensive. She never overreached herself. She
found her metier very quickly. Her clothes changed slightly but
have always been consistently irreverent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not getting the award this year because of this year's
collection or last year's collection,'' he said. ``There's
something to be said for history. There's something to be said for
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson is a perennially youthful 56 in tight T-shirts and
stretch denim Capris, who readily admits to having had breast
implants when she was 48 and a face lift at 50. ``I used to design
for my body, which was flat-chested with big hips,'' she said.
``That's why my clothes were tight on top with full skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   She felt she needed the face lift to look good for public
appearances, photography and television, which she is doing more
and more frequently. Yet her stomach does cartwheels when she
thinks about the thank-you speech she will make at the fashion
awards ceremony, this year renamed the American Fashion Awards. (An
edited version will be shown on E! Entertainment Television on June
13.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never be able to get through saying the speech,'' she
said, her voice choking up and her heavily made-up hazel eyes
filling with tears.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long wait since 1971, the year she received a Coty
Fashion Critics Award for the innovative knits she designed for a
junior sportswear house called Alley Cat. (It was the same year in
which Halston was honored for his high-fashion work and Elsa
Peretti for her jewelry.)
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Betsey Johnson had made a name for herself in the
mod '60s, designing for a string of hip boutiques called
Paraphernalia and the trendy Betsey Bunky Nini boutique in
Manhattan. She had already established the exuberant, cheerfully
sexy style she stuck with after Alley Cat folded and she was
reduced to freelance work and designing children's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '70s my girl moved up to work and dress-for-work
clothes, and my customer disappeared,'' Ms. Johnson recalled.
``Then all of a sudden in the late '70s there were the English and
punk and the CBGB's. That kind of youth thing came in again, so I
thought maybe it's my time again. But I couldn't get anyone to put
money behind me. I decided I needed a partner.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1978 she hooked up with Chantal Bacon, who had been in charge
of sales for Betsey Johnson Kids, and opened the Betsey Johnson
business with money she had made in the stock market, help from her
father and a bank loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chantal was from New Jersey, but she'd been a model in London
in the '60s and was a friend of rock stars,'' Ms. Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bacon also knew how to run a business, it turned out, and
the partnership has endured. They now have 26 boutiques, including
four in New York and one in London, and sell to major stores like
Neiman Marcus as well as to 700 specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partnership is better than a marriage,'' Ms. Johnson said.
``We keep our private lives separate, but we've been through a lot
together. She keeps the books and I keep the look.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Ms. Johnson first put her toe in the business pond
when she ran a dancing school while attending high school in
Connecticut. She was born in Wethersfield, outside Hartford, and
started to study dancing at age 4 _ ballet, jazz, tap and
acrobatic. She learned the construction of clothes by making
patterns and samples of dance costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Syracuse University, followed by a summer guest
editorship in 1964 at Mademoiselle magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betsey was a blond bombshell, so full of beans and so
talented,'' recalled Edith Raymond Locke, who was the magazine's
fashion editor at the time. ``It all began with her making a
T-shirt top. It was the era of the tight high armhole, and we all
thought it was terrific. We ran a little thing about it in the
Mademoiselle shopping column and she got orders. Then Paul Young
called and said he needed a young, with-it designer for this new
company called Paraphernalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, a British retailer, who brought the swinging London
concept to New York, featured Ms. Johnson's designs alongside those
of such '60s icons as Mary Quant and Emmanuelle Khanh. In March of
1966, Mademoiselle ran a photograph of Julie Christie wearing a $35
dress designed by Betsey Johnson for Paraphernalia, and soon her
clothes were being worn by the likes of Twiggy, Penelope Tree,
Brigitte Bardot and Raquel Welch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edie Sedgwick was my fitting model at Paraphernalia,'' Ms.
Johnson recalled. ``For five years I had nobody say do this or do
that. It was so fabulous. I'd go to work every day and think, `What
do I want to wear?' If it sold, I still had a job. There was
nothing negative. Now, you have to think of the negative and the
positive constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the positive success of winning an award, two
negatives have intruded on her recently: the breakup of her third
marriage, and the departure from her business of her 24-year-old
daughter, Lulu, who has worked with her mother virtually all her
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for the first time in my life looking at what else would I
have done if fashion wasn't there,'' Lulu Johnson explained. ``I'm
taking acting classes with Stella Adler. Not that I want to be an
actress. I'm talking about hosting on MTV or something like that.
...'' Her voice trailed off.
</P>
<P>
   But she will still be an unofficial sounding board. ``She is so
cut out for this business, a real natural,'' her mother said,
obviously regretting the loss of her daughter's everyday presence.
``I always talk over my ideas with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Lulu Johnson has a style of her own, her opinion will
always be valued. As her mother said: ``In the '60s there was a
look. In the '70s there was a look, and in the '80s. Now, it's a
free-for-all.''

LIQUIDATOR TAKES CONTROL OF HOWARD &AMP; PHIL'S CHAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARITA _ Hounded by creditors and still struggling years
after a bankruptcy reorganization, Howard &AMP; Phil's Western Wear is
finally hanging up its spurs.
</P>
<P>
   A liquidation firm took control of the company's assets late
last week, and it will sell off what remains of the once
high-flying Western wear empire May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Canyon Country-based chain was founded in 1962 by Howard and
Phyllis McKeon, parents of Congressman Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon,
R-Santa Clarita, and four other sons. At its height, the company
had annual sales of $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's road got rough in the mid-1990s, and in 1996
it filed for Chapter 11 reorganization. That plan failed this year
when the company did not make required debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Joseph McKeon was unavailable for comment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buck'' McKeon said through a spokesman that the firm's closing
was a sad event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unfortunate turn of events,'' said spokesman David
Foy. ``Congressman McKeon had a lot of fond memories of building
Howard and Phil's into a successful business.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 bankruptcy filing came after Santa Monica, Calif.-based
Maerich Management Co., the landlord at the company's Antioch store
in in the Bay area, sued the company for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials have blamed its problems on the end of the
booming Western wear markets in the 1980s and early 1990s. Those
spurts _ fueled by the rising popularity of country music, line
dancing and the movie ``Urban Cowboy'' _ fed an expansion to 56
stores by the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Phil's will be missed as a strong competitor, said
Randy King, owner of King's Western Wear Inc. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-flying firm's failure highlights the pitfalls of
growing too fast, King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can't rule the entire industry,'' he said.
``Sometimes you just have to be good at what you do in your own
back yard.''

 Former Insignia Execs Settle SEC Charges
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Two former officials of Insignia Solutions agreed yesterday to pay
a total of $100,000 to settle Securities and Exchange Commission
charges that they falsified the software-maker's 1996 financial
results.
</P>
<P>
   David Gibbs and Stuart McIntosh, formerly sales executives at
the British company's U.S. headquarters in Fremont, will pay
penalties of $75,000 and $25,000, respectively, to end an SEC
lawsuit that accused them of scheming to inflate Insignia's
revenue. Insignia's stock is publicly traded in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement of the suit, filed yesterday in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco, the two also agreed to permanent
injunctions barring them from violating anti-fraud provisions of
federal securities laws. The two neither admitted nor denied the
SEC charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate SEC administrative action, Insignia agreed to
cease and desist from violating federal financial reporting
requirements. The company didn't admit wrongdoing, and the agency
didn't impose a fine.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Gibbs and McIntosh shipped far more software than
they knew distributors could sell and that they entered secret
agreements with them that granted unusually liberal return rights.
To conceal the over-shipment, the two ordered a subordinate to
report only 10 percent of the inventory held by distributors,
according to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Insignia restated its 1996 financial results in May 1997,
trimming previously reported sales by $2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company addressed the matter and gave full cooperation to
the SEC,'' said Timothy Roake, Insignia's outside attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs and McIntosh left Insignia about the time the company
restated earnings. The two couldn't be reached for comment.
Insignia makes software that permits computers with different
operating systems, such as Apple McIntoshes and Windows-based PCs,
to communicate.

 High-Tech Workforce Gap in The Valley
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Benny Evangelista &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
A shortage of local high-tech employees costs Silicon Valley firms
as much as $4 billion per year in recruiting and lost productivity
costs, according to a study to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   And the problem may get worse in the future because about
two-thirds of local middle and high school students seem
uninterested in pursuing high-tech careers, according to the report
from the nonprofit Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network.
</P>
<P>
   About 160,000 jobs _ one-third of the Silicon Valley high-tech
workforce _ are taken by workers recruited from outside the region
or who commute from long distances or simply go unfilled, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   This ``workforce gap'' could hinder the region's economic
growth, the group warned.
</P>
<P>
   The gap costs Silicon Valley employers between $6,000 to $8,000
for each vacant position, said Ben Smith, a principal with
management consulting firm A.T. Kearney, which prepared the report
for free.
</P>
<P>
   The loss includes the higher salaries needed to recruit workers
in the Bay Area compared to other regions and the constant turnover
as skilled workers hop from job to job, Smith said. The workforce
gap also costs tech industries by limiting their ability to grow,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The workforce gap is projected to grow to 200,000 by the year
2010. ``For Silicon Valley to remain the capital of high
technology, we need to produce qualified high-tech workers,'' said
Ruben Barrales, Joint Venture president and CEO. ``Our kids need to
be better prepared to take advantage of the opportunities here.''
</P>
<P>
   Joint Venture is a regional public-private group based in San
Jose and co-chaired by Hewlett-Packard Co. chief executive Lewis
Platt and San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales. The group tracks economic
and lifestyle trends in Silicon Valley, which it defines as the
South Bay plus San Mateo and Alameda counties.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that only one-third of 1,160 students in grades
eight through 11 planned to pursue high-tech related majors in
college.
</P>
<P>
   The findings echoed a similar study of college students last
month. Industry trade group the American Electronics Association
found that the number of high-tech degrees granted annually in the
United States _ including engineering, math, physics and computer
science _ is declining.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an area flooded with technology billboards and
advertisements, most of the students in the Joint Venture study
were intimidated by the belief that all computer jobs required
extensive educations at four-year universities.
</P>
<P>
   The study found many students didn't know there were other
well-paying positions, such as network administrators, computer
repairers and administration, that were within their reach after
two years of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are by no means McDonald's workers,'' said Smith. ``They
make significant salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The study comes as critics like the Rev. Jesse Jackson say
technology firms are not doing enough to bridge a Digital Divide by
recruiting from local African American and Latino communities that
are underrepresented in Silicon Valley's workforce.
</P>
<P>
   An unrelated study released last week by the ad hoc Coalition
for Fair Employment in the Silicon Valley found the percentage of
African American and Hispanic employees at 253 high-tech companies
in the Bay Area declined slightly from 1996 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact there aren't enough African Americans, Hispanics and
Native Americans in the pipeline is not a sufficient excuse for
discrimination,'' said coalition founder John Templeton.
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Geiger, executive director of OpNet, a San Francisco
nonprofit that trains teens from low-income and minority
communities for multimedia and Internet careers, said educating a
new generation is a key to the future of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what they're (high-tech firms) saying, that
they're looking for very highly qualified Ph.D. and masters-level
people, but there are a lot of untapped resources and people
here,'' Geiger said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ With repeated thrusts from steel harpoons and
two finishing shots from a .50-caliber armor-piercing assault
rifle, the Makah Indian tribe on Monday conducted the first legal
killing of a gray whale in American waters in nearly 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was described, in joyful terms by tribal leaders, as part of
the proud resurrection of the Makahs' great seafaring traditions,
but the kill of the juvenile whale also enraged environmentalists
who had gathered in protest boats nearby and provoked a modern
media spectacle, with the whole event captured live by television
crews from Seattle hovering in helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of their mission, the eight hunters in a
32-foot cedar canoe, assisted by other Makah men in a motorized
boat, were not able to get to the whale in time to conduct the
traditional sewing up of its mouth, and thus the great mammal
filled with water and sank to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But using a large fishing boat, tribal members managed to
refloat it several hours later and tow it ashore, with two hunters
standing atop the whale in a triumphal pose. Hundreds of Makah
gathered on a beach late Monday afternoon, near the northwestern
tip of the continental United States, for a celebratory ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt was the third effort at a whale kill in the last week
by the tribe, which had gained permission from the International
Whaling Commission, official support from the Clinton
administration and a $310,000 grant from the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   As the men circled in for the kill shortly before 7 a.m. on
Monday, many Makah gathered to watch the event on television. They
cheered as the men drove harpoons into the juvenile gray whale's
back and it rolled over. Then came the gunshots, and soon the water
turned red.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are elated,'' said Joddie) Johnson, owner of the Makah
Maiden, a diner on the main road of the reservation here, who said
she planned to sell whale meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make a whale of a burger,'' she said. ``This brings
meaning and purpose back to the Makah men. For 70 years, they had
what they did best taken away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The successful kill ``restores a missing link in our heritage,''
said Arnie Hunter, vice president of the whaling commission, who
rode in the support boat Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But environmental groups, who had massed at Neah Bay in protest
and sent a flotilla of boats out to try to disrupt the hunt in
recent days, described the event as a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have killed an intelligent, beautiful animal _ just blown
it away with an anti-tank gun,'' said Paul Watson, leader of Sea
Shepherd International, a conservation group. ``There's nothing
honorable about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunt was conducted just off the Makah's tribal land, on the
remote, storm-swept tip of Washington's Olympic Peninsula, but it
was played as huge news across much of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's unsuccessful hunt, which led to the Coast Guard's
seizure of at least three protest boats, was broadcast live for
almost 10 hours by Northwest Cable News, prompting a Seattle Times
television critic to describe it as ``this region's own CNN-style
epoch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray whales were driven almost to extinction by global whaling
earlier this century, and the Makah stopped hunting in the 1920s.
The United States banned all whaling of the grays in 1937, as part
of what turned out to be a successful bid to protect the species:
There are now an estimated 23,000 whales in the Pacific Ocean. The
whales' status as an endangered species was lifted in 1994,
prompting the Makah's petition for new international whaling
rights. It is the only tribe whose rights to hunt the whales are
guaranteed by a federal treaty, signed in 1855.
</P>
<P>
   Gray whales can grow to 40 feet in length and weigh as much as
40 tons. The whale killed Monday was a juvenile, and appeared to be
about half that size, though no formal measurement had been taken
as of Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional cultural clash sparked by the hunt was illustrated
Monday evening by separate gatherings called to mark the event.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah were jubilant, and many of them described the event in
mystical terms, a powerful reconnection with the whaling practice
that helped define their culture and is the source of numerous
legends, songs, traditions and tribal ceremonies. For centuries, it
was a principal male rite of passage, and many Makah said the
anticipation surrounding the hunt had been a huge inspiration for
young people in the 2,000-member tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made history today,'' said Ben Johnson, chairman of the
tribe's whaling council. ``This is a great day for the Makah
Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, who had come together in boats and on the shore at
Neah Bay, bearing signs that said ``Tradition can be altered'' and
``Stop the killing,'' held mournful observances near the village
and in downtown Seattle, nearly five hours away by car and ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash., a bitter critic of the hunt, said
the killing could pave the way to an international assault on the
whales.
</P>
<P>
   ``These majestic, highly intelligent creatures deserve better
than to be brutally slaughtered as pawns in a political game
orchestrated by Japanese and Norwegian whaling interests and
supported by the Clinton-Gore administration,'' he said in a
statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah tribal leaders say they will only kill whales for
subsistence and ceremonial purposes, and said all the meat, blubber
and oil from Monday's kill would be distributed among tribal
members.
</P>
<P>
   Though they have the right under the whaling commission's
decision to kill up to 20 whales for the next five years, they said
they have no plans to try to sell whale meat or parts on the
international market, and they do not currently have permission to
do so. (Whale meat is considered a delicacy in many Asian countries
and a single gray whale can be worth up to half a million dollars.)
</P>
<P>
   The young men on the whaling team spent months last year in
training for the hunt, and tried briefly for a kill during the
whales' fall migratory season. This spring, with the whales
returning on their northward journey toward the Bering Sea, the
Makah hunters decided to go all out.

   In recent days, they have paddled through the coastal fog,
passing Shi-Shi Beach and Father and Son Rock at the Olympic
National Park, as well as other stretches of wilderness beach where
carvings of whales that were made by Indian hunters centuries ago
remain.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the past week, hunters had thrown harpoons at passing
whales, but either missed or delivered glancing blows that did no
harm. They were deterred in part by protesters, several of whom
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   At least one was charged, paradoxically, for violating the
Marine Mammal Protection Act by disturbing the route of a migratory
whale, while others were charged with throwing smoke bombs,
shooting flares and shooting chemical fire extinguishers in the
air.

POLITICS: TAKING THE `HELP' OUT OF `HELPMATE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editorial Observer)  
 (af)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 18: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Elizabeth Dole seriously wants to be a presidential
candidate, the first thing she is going to have to do is lock up
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm her biggest fan and supporter,'' Bob Dole told Richard
Berke of The New York Times this week. Dole then went on to say
that he was thinking about writing a check to Sen. John McCain,
Mrs. Dole's competitor.
</P>
<P>
   With spouses like this, who needs opponents? Dole, who benefited
mightily from his wife's nonstop campaigning during his two runs
for president, says he wants to ``do for her what she did for me.''
But it is hard to imagine Elizabeth Dole philosophically
announcing, in the middle of a critical fund-raising period, that
her husband could always quit if things didn't pick up. ``If
there's no response out there, or if it looks impossible, this is
not her whole life,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   He obviously does not have a clue about what his wife actually
``did'' for him _ the abnegation of self and perpetual
cheerleading. When asked how Mrs. Dole would fare in a race against
Al Gore, her husband opined ``It's too early to tell.'' The correct
answer, obviously, is ``terrific.'' Elizabeth Dole went around
saying ``terrific'' in one form or another through two campaigns
during which her husband's performance was almost always
non-terrific in the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   There was a drop _ well, perhaps a whole gallon _ of bile in the
former presidential candidate's remarks. Asked why he never
memorized his speeches as Mrs. Dole does, her husband said, ``I
knew a lot about issues,'' which seems to hint that his wife
doesn't. Anybody who has heard Bob Dole speak off the cuff
understands that the proper response would be: ``I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   People have been wondering why Bob Dole chose to appear in TV
commercials about erectile dysfunction right at the time that Mrs.
Dole was launching her bid for a prize he had always wanted for
himself. The effort to educate fellow prostate cancer victims was
commendable, but the timing seemed peculiar. Was it principle or a
deeply sublimated desire to distract attention from his wife? The
betting continues, but when Dole started talking about how he was
looking for ``ways to help McCain in particular,'' the odds
certainly shifted in the direction of subconscious sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   At best, Dole seems to be taking the tone of one of those awful
Little League parents who specialize in withholding praise.
Defending his wife's lack of specificity on the stump, Dole said:
``You're going to get more answers than you ever thought from
Elizabeth once she hits her stride. And she's getting there. She's
got to catch up after eight years in the Red Cross.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this is a presidential campaign in which the Republican
front-runner, George W. Bush, has yet to emerge from his Fortress
of Solitude in Austin. There are plenty of men out there talking
generalized glop, and Elizabeth Dole has made some surprising, and
specific, position statements on gun control, abortion and the
situation in Kosovo. We all know she is spontaneity-deprived, a
heavily programmed candidate. But her husband's failure to come
racing to her defense full throttle makes you want to get in there
and argue for her side.
</P>
<P>
   Being a politician on the national level requires an enormous
amount of ego, and while all candidates say they are in it to make
America a better place in the next millennium, a lust for the
center spotlight is usually an important factor. Perhaps a person
with the psyche of a candidate is simply incapable of spending
months directing all conversations toward the merits of somebody
else. If so, Lord help Hillary Clinton.

DOW JONES AND REUTERS FORM JOINT INTERNET VENTURE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dow Jones &AMP; Co. and Reuters Group PLC, perennial
rivals in the business of business information, are combining
forces to create an Internet-based service providing corporate news
and information for professionals, the two companies announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second Internet-related initiative to be announced by
Dow Jones within the last month. But unlike Dowjones.com, a site
for individual investors, which is being built from the ground up,
this joint venture will take the existing news articles distributed
on Dow Jones Interactive and its erstwhile competitor, Reuters
Business Briefing, and distribute them over the Internet, including
links to relative corporate data like securities filings or
executive biographies.
</P>
<P>
   The combined 1998 revenues of the competitors was $225 million.
The new company, Dow Jones Reuters Business Interactive LLC,
expects to earn 60 percent of its revenue from North and South
America, and most of the rest from Europe and Asia, the markets
where the company hopes to grow most quickly, according to Timothy
M. Andrews, the joint venture's president and chief executive.
Currently, 95 percent of Dow Jones' revenue is earned in the
Americas, and most of Reuters' revenue comes from Europe (70
percent) and Asia (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The kind of information delivered on Dow Jones Interactive and
Reuters Business briefings is tailored for professionals who want
to be alerted to developments in their own industry or others, but
do not have a stock trader's need for second-by-second
developments. Neither these two services nor the new venture, which
is expected to start within a year, will carry breaking news
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the wire services of the two companies will
remain competitive. As Philip Melchior, the chief operating officer
of Reuters' corporate and media information group, said at Monday's
news conference, ``Global interest would not be best served by
having one global news wire.'' Competition, he said, is likely to
produce better products, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, depending on the volume of news, they will carry complete
stories about the day's developments anywhere from 10 minutes to a
couple of hours after the news happens in addition to extensive
archives of their own and many other outlets' articles and
transcripts. Among the industries that the service will focus on
are financial services, computer hardware and software, chemicals,
aerospace, telecommunications, automotive and media and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Peter R. Kann, the chairman and chief executive of Dow Jones,
appeared at the New York news conference Monday, side by side with
a blurry video image of Peter Job, the Reuters chief executive. Job
noted, ``It's very rare that two well-established organizations
have such a coincidence of interest in a specific business that we
can get together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows how quickly the world is changing and how size
matters,' said Lauren Rich Fine, a media analyst with Merrill
Lynch. ``For the business user this is a very powerful
combination,'' she added. But she also pointed out that users with
broader interests in medical and scientific developments might
prefer the competing service provided by the Dialog Corp. PLC. The
dominant service in the industry, Lexis Nexis, offers a comparably
broad range of information, including extensive legal archives.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wagner, Dialog's chief executive, put out a news release
Monday in which he gave a backhanded welcome to the new competitor,
saying, ``What is interesting to note is that this new service will
be comprised mainly of news. As we have said many times before,
news is increasingly a commodity, available for free on numerous
Internet sites. In this context, news-only services are more and
more difficult to sell on a stand-alone basis.''

 &HT;    MEXICO'S RULING PARTY TO ALLOW FOLLOWERS TO PICK PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After more than 70 years in power, Mexico's ruling
party announced Monday it has voted to hold the first-ever primary
election to allow followers to select their candidate for Mexico's
2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party, or
PRI, has won Mexico's presidency, sometimes under a cloud of
suspicion of fraud. The party's candidate has always been
hand-picked by the man who won Mexico's presidency before him.
</P>
<P>
   That secret selection process, dubbed the ``dedazo,'' or ``big
finger,'' will be replaced later this year by a national vote
conducted in 300 electoral districts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The party will supervise the vote Nov. 7 of this year. Because
there is no party registration list, the vote will be open to any
Mexican with a voter registration card.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big step for the PRI, one that changes 70 years of
history,'' said analyst Luis Linares of the Mexico City think tank,
Specialized Information Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's lacking is a series of points that define who are
going to be the possible candidates, where the polling booths are
going to be and who is going to control it all,'' Linares added.
</P>
<P>
   Polls are showing that Mexico's July 2000 election could be the
most competitive ever because strong challengers to the PRI are
emerging, including Vicente Fox of Mexico's conservative National
Action Party, or PAN.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI is deeply divided over who would be its best contender;
even before Monday's announcement, several PRI politicians had
already broken with the tradition of waiting for the president to
pick his successor and begun television ad campaigns to tout
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the PRI is obligated to go through its own democratic
transition,'' PRI party president Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez
said Monday in a statement commenting on the new selection rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country has advanced toward democracy . . ,'' he said,
``but within (the party) we haven't done enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gonzalez's comments were passed out to the press
before the vote had been officially counted.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to establish a nationwide primary with open voting
to select the 2000 candidate was made by the PRI's 331-member
National Political Council. Three hundred and seven members voted
for allowing the direct vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only eight voted for a system that would allow a convention of
political advisers to select a candidate and only twelve voted for
a convention of delegates to have that power.
</P>
<P>
   The new party rules also bar contenders from campaigning for the
primary before Aug. 1. There are limits of spending and no
government funds can be used.

THERE'S LITTLE REST FOR THE WEARY AND BATTERED EWING
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing was grimacing and laboring like a man staggering
through the desert by the end of Sunday's Game 5 in Miami. Worn
down by injury, depleted by exhaustion, he pushed the boundaries of
his threshold for pain to help win a first-round playoff series for
the Knicks that had everything riding on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, futures and major franchise decisions were at stake when
Ewing's performance left Allan Houston in position to hit a
dramatic game-winning shot that propelled the Knicks into the
second round, where they will face the Atlanta Hawks in Game 1
Tuesday night at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Another matchup with a Georgetown center _ this time Dikembe
Mutombo _ another test of Ewing's physical limitations. Ewing is
expected to start Game 1 even though he was writhing in pain during
the third and fourth quarters Sunday because of a muscle strain in
his rib cage. This is on top of his sore left Achilles' tendon, and
on top of the tendinitis in his knees.
</P>
<P>
   How far can he go before his tolerance for pain snaps? It seems
almost unfair to expect him to replicate his 22-point, 11-rebound
performance in Game 5 on 48 hours' rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can expect that,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said
during a conference call before his team departed for Atlanta
Monday. ``On Sunday, that was a man who went above and beyond in
terms of pain tolerance. I don't think you can do that on a nightly
basis. Hopefully, he can play effectively. With the schedule, who
knows? Whatever he can give us, we're thankful for.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's health will be pivotal to a series that may lack the
soap opera subplots of the Knicks' playoff rivalry with the Heat _
especially since these two teams have not met in the post-season
since 1971 _ but is still vital to the job security of Van Gundy,
whose status is considered unstable unless the team advances to the
conference finals. But with the Heat series so emotionally and
physically draining, Van Gundy is wary of a hangover.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be right both mentally, emotionally and physically
as much as we can,'' Van Gundy said. ``We don't want to give one
away from a mental standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense edge of their series with the Heat was a great
motivation for the Knicks, but it is not as if they have not had
their brushes with the Hawks. On April 9, the gangly, sharp-edged
Mutombo threw an elbow that knocked out one of Chris Childs' teeth.
After he had put his tooth in his locker following the game, Childs
vowed revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get him back,'' Childs said. ``It's going to be a
12-round fight. You can call Don King. It was an intentional elbow.
I'd already passed the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   After the league fined Mutombo $7,500 and Childs cooled down,
the Knicks' game against the Hawks on April 28 unfolded without
further incident. But in that last meeting of the season, there was
a competitive back-and-forth that surfaced between Latrell Sprewell
and Steve Smith as they tried to one-up each other.
</P>
<P>
   While the Heat-like animosity is not there, there will be an
edge to this four-of-seven-game series if only because both teams
are physical. On the surface, the No. 4-seeded Hawks do not elicit
awe. They are a bare-bones team that relies on three rugged players
for the heavy lifting _ Mutombo, Smith and Mookie Blaylock. Without
the injured Alan Henderson, the Hawks are even more limited
offensively. Time after time, their core of veterans has relied on
intimidating, tenacious defense and has got by despite injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how talented they are,'' Van Gundy said.
``They beat Indiana three out of four, and beat us two of three.
They quietly and efficiently go about their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks took the season series against the Knicks with
Blaylock leading the way. As many point guards before him have
done, Blaylock took advantage of the Knicks' soft perimeter
defense. Childs, who has been limping with a thigh contusion, is
the better defender against Blaylock. But most often, Charlie Ward,
who has had difficulty keeping track of Blaylock, will be on the
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the defensive burden will fall on Houston as well.
Defending against Miami's Dan Majerle and Voshon Lenard is far less
risky than trying to stop Smith. Houston has had problems trying to
limit Smith's diverse game. He can shoot a 3-pointer, post up with
his 6-foot-8-inch frame, drive and hit his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Smith is different,'' Van Gundy said. ``Reggie Miller is
a big-shot player, but more catch-and-shoot. Steve has a very
versatile game. He can hurt you in so many ways. He's a legit
6-foot-8, great size. And so Allan has got to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   So does any Knick who dares to venture in the paint for a layup.
Mutombo is always a threat to wield an elbow and shatter a nose. He
has broken three noses this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes teams jump-shooting teams,'' Van Gundy said. ``It's
also foolish just to shoot over him. You've got to be
intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to dilute Mutombo's impact is to make him defend his
man. And if Ewing is able to drag his body on the floor, his range
will force Mutombo to do something besides sit back and swat away.
Whatever Ewing has left will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Often this season, Ewing has not been thought of in such
praiseworthy terms. There were cries for his role at age 36 to be
reduced, for him to defer to the up-tempo style some of his
teammates wanted to run. There were times when Ewing did step back
this season, but Sunday was not one of them. Too much on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him getting out on the floor uplifts our team,'' Van Gundy
said. ``In the fourth quarter, when he got another injury, and his
Achilles was killing him, and he plays like he did, that to me says
it all about him.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Van Gundy, Ewing's unwavering supporter for 10 years,
understands the limitations on heroics. Before the Knicks' series
with the Hawks begins, he will most likely have the same kind of
conversation he had with Ewing before the Heat matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I didn't want him to be frustrated with what
he couldn't do, because he couldn't be Patrick Ewing the whole
Miami series,'' Van Gundy said. ``I wanted him to think about what
he could do to win the series, because that was more than
enough.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: SUDDENLY, EWING HAS A `PRESENCE'
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds., spelling Micheal, in 3rd graf, is CQ)  
(ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you hear what Steve Smith had to say about Patrick Ewing
after Smith and the Atlanta Hawks finished off the Detroit Pistons
and set the Knicks in their playoff sights?
</P>
<P>
   ``The man has a presence,'' said Smith, obviously a couch potato
on Sunday afternoon, when Ewing heroically grimaced and gimped his
way past Alonzo Mourning in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Seems like yesterday, not last June, that the entire National
Basketball Association and half the planet was bowing in the
presence of old what's-airs-name. Suddenly Ewing, 0 for 13 in pro
championship attempts, ``has a presence.'' To borrow from the
immortal logic of Micheal Ray Richardson (``ship be sinkin''' ...
how low can it go? ... ``sky's the limit''), the bar has been
lowered and the sky's the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson is certainly a second-round playoff presence, and
people can now clearly see beyond the graffiti on his arms and what
the fuss is about. Tim Duncan, definite presence. Shaquille
O'Neill, Reggie Miller, Karl Malone and a platoon of talented
Portland Trail Blazers are all present and accounted for in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen, not here. But then, neither is Michael Jordan or
the charred remains of his Chicago Bulls. Yet for some reason, they
are insisting on going through with the playoffs this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Remember all the talk of how the NBA would curl up in the fetal
position and cry itself to sleep after Jordan retired? That
speculation seems to have been counterfeit, not counting Pat Riley,
who at the very moment is dreaming that it was Kareem, not
Mourning, posting up against Ewing late in the fourth quarter of
Game 5. Sky hook's the limit. Dream on, Riles.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, the ever-sanguine commissioner, had a standard
response to questions about the Jordan Apocalypse. ``The sun will
come up and the Celtics will go to training camp,'' Stern liked to
say. Unfortunately, training camp for everyone was delayed by
Stern's lockout, and the resulting 50-game regular season was a
blur of busted bodies and butchered plays. At least now, in the
light of May, the sun has come out, and an entertaining batch of
playoff teams have stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   Any minute now, the television ratings will be released, and we
may learn that at precisely 14 minutes after four Sunday afternoon,
there was a .16 percent decline in viewership from the same time
slot last season. This will indicate that an electrical storm took
out two dozen sets just north of Dubuque, but, quite frankly, who
cares?
</P>
<P>
   If I can watch Xavier play Mississippi State in the college
tournament, I can enjoy the young and hungry Sacramento Kings in
the playoffs. All I know is that every time I turned on an NBA
playoff game during the last week, it was May Madness, right down
to the last seconds of regulation or overtime. In a few of them _
especially those featuring the Kings _ the final score wasn't
47-44, and even the Knicks experienced a couple of games when they
accelerated their dribble and experienced the joy of what was once
known as the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   They probably won't set any scoring records against the Hawks,
starting in Game 1 tonight in Atlanta. Most of the recent games
between these teams have been uglier than Knicks versus Heat, but
just as fierce, without the mutual contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Who could hate the Hawks, who for years have played in a
half-empty building and have a point guard named Mookie? To his
credit, when the owner Ted Turner was pressured to build a new
arena in the Gingrich-ville suburbs, he said nothing doing, we're
staying downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's coach is the all-time game winner, the classy Lenny
Wilkens, out of Boys High in Brooklyn. The Hawks' best player,
Steve Smith, gave $6 million to his alma mater, Michigan State.
Dikembe Mutombo points his finger at lane trespassers like a
nursery school teacher and swings his elbows like he's playing
roller derby, but he's also trying to raise $44 million to
construct a hospital in his native Democratic Republic of Congo.
Mutombo steps up to take his crack at Ewing in the round two of the
Georgetown intramurals. He has a profound shot-blocking presence,
but the Knicks have the better team, especially with two Atlanta
starting forwards injured and maybe out.
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost surreal that these Knicks could be favored to
win any series, being that they've been teetering at the edge of a
cliff for months, with only Ernie Grunfeld being shoved over.
Survival is the game now, for Jeff Van Gundy, the beleaguered
coach, and Ewing, the battered star.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't Jordan, and the ratings may yet sink, but the drama is
building, and the sky's the limit. &QL;

IN THE SHORT RUN, DRANSFELDT IS IMPRESSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers like what they've seen from Kelly
Dransfeldt at shortstop. His performance _ while Royce Clayton has
been on the disabled list _ reinforces the possibility he could be
the Rangers' second baseman of the future.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dransfeldt is expected to return to the minor leagues Friday
when Clayton comes off the disabled list. Dransfeldt will continue
to play shortstop at Triple-A Oklahoma in case Clayton gets hurt
again, but the Rangers know that won't be his position next year.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton signed a four-year, $18 million contract in the
off-season, and second baseman Mark McLemore and third baseman Todd
Zeile are free agents. Dransfeldt can play second and third, but
his offense seems to suggest second base is the more logical spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure for a third baseman to hit,''
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``A lot of guys fail at third
base because they couldn't hit enough; they're expected to hit 20
home runs and drive in a lot of runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dransfeldt hit 27 home runs and drove in 112 runs in 471 at-bats
in the minor leagues last year, splitting time between Class-A Port
Charlotte and Double-A Tulsa. But the Rangers don't see that kind
of power potential yet at the major-league level, even though he
hit his first home run Sunday against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is he doesn't have third-base power potential,''
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``From what I've seen of Kelly
Dransfeldt, he's a major-league shortstop. That's his natural
position. There's no doubt in my mind he can play second base in
the major leagues. But you'd have to have a special offensive team
for him to play third base.''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore can't be discarded lightly, now that he's healthy
again. He's a team leader, steady defensively and was batting .328
going into last night's game. The Rangers would also be without a
leadoff hitter if Dransfeldt replaces McLemore and Ruben Mateo
takes over for Tom Goodwin in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said Dransfeldt's future will be decided at the end of
the year. But the decision might have to come sooner if the Rangers
still need pitching this season. Dransfeldt's play has not gone
unnoticed by major-league scouts at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to play shortstop in the major leagues,'' Dransfeldt
said. ``I've been there my whole life, and I feel most comfortable
there. But you definitely have to be adaptable, especially if
you're a young player coming up, just to get a chance to play.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: SOUND OF FCC SILENCE IN A BIG MERGER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all of the analysis of Monday's $37 billion merger of U S
West Inc., the smallest of the regional Bell phone giants, and
Global Crossing Ltd., the international communications upstart, the
most telling commentary may have been the sound of silence coming
from the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, none of the Bells are
currently allowed to sell long-distance voice or data
communications in their traditional service areas. Through its
pending acquisition of the Frontier Corp., Global Crossing is set
to become the nation's No. 5 long-distance carrier with about 10
percent of its domestic long-distance revenue generated in U S
West's 14-state region.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a Bell company tried to merge with a long-distance
carrier _ when SBC Communications discussed such a deal with the
AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1997 _ Reed E. Hundt, then the commission's chairman,
called such a combination ``unthinkable.'' And that was before AT&AMP;T
and SBC had even announced anything.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as U S West and Global Crossing announced their deal
as expected, William E. Kennard, Hundt's successor, told a meeting
of the National Consumers League in Washington: ``We have to be
careful in trying to be too categorical about this _ in saying that
all mergers are bad, that we've reached a point where we can't have
any more mergers. They all have different competitive dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on the U S West-Global Crossing deal in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Global Crossing is no AT&AMP;T and U S West is no SBC. Perhaps
Monday's deal makers simply lacked the star power, or the market
power, to elicit an immediate response from the commission.
</P>
<P>
   But in his diplomacy, Kennard seemed to feed a growing hunch
among the Bells that their time may have come _ that they can
expect to win broad entry into the long-distance market over the
next 18 months, that the FCC will not try to slow the wave of
telecommunications takeovers, and that they ought to move quickly
to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   While the ultimate timetable for the Bells' getting
long-distance approval remains unclear, it became fairly clear on
Monday that the regulatory hurdles standing before U S West and
Global Crossing, while significant, are not monumental.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that in the big scheme of things, Frontier's
long-distance business is relatively small, and the portion of it
that comes from U S West's territory is tiny _ about $110 million
last year, according to Robert Annunziata, Global Crossing's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Frontier's No. 5 standing in the long-distance
business, Hundt, the regulator the Bells loved to hate when he was
in office, said Monday: ``No. 5 is just too small. I think that
being No. 5 in long distance is not a material objection to the
merger.''
</P>
<P>
   John T. Nakahata, who resigned as Kennard's chief of staff late
last year, said, ``If there's not a lot of long-distance traffic
from the U S West region, it's not clear there should be
significant regulatory issues.''
</P>
<P>
   James D. Ellis, SBC's general counsel, said, ``I don't mean to
minimize it or say it will not take a lot of effort,'' but added,
referring to U S West and Global Crossing, ``If I were in their
position and the deal otherwise makes sense, I would not see this
as a barrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Before they offer long-distance service within their regions,
the Bells must convince the FCC that they have opened their
networks to potential competitors. No Bell company has yet passed
that test, and there does not appear to be a provision for a waiver
from it. U S West appears to be further away from winning
long-distance approval than the other Bells.
</P>
<P>
   But a combined U S West-Global Crossing could remove the
conflict as simply as selling Frontier's customers within U S
West's region to another company. Given the relatively small
importance of that particular slice of the combined companies'
business, selling it could be a small price to pay.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to imply that the FCC will simply roll over. People
close to the commission said Monday that such a sale could pose
problems of its own, in that telling people they can no longer use
the long-distance provider of their choice may not serve the public
interest. And it is also not a great way to build customer
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The GTE Corp., which is slogging through regulatory reviews as
it tries to merge with Bell Atlantic, has about 100,000
long-distance customers in states included in Bell Atlantic's
region, and they can be expected to generate about $50 million in
annual long-distance revenue.
</P>
<P>
   That is less than half the size of Frontier's long-distance
business in U S West's region, and still GTE has resisted selling
those customers.
</P>
<P>
   For U S West and Global Crossing, the bigger problem stemming
from U S West's regulatory situation might not be in winning
approval of their deal but in fully exploiting it afterward. U S
West's region includes Seattle, Portland, Ore., Phoenix and Denver,
and the combined company will be prohibited from selling
long-distance voice or data communications to users in any of those
places.
</P>
<P>
   Many communications analysts are expecting Bell Atlantic to get
into the long-distance market in New York and SBC to win approval
for Texas perhaps this fall. Some of the Bells appear to be
expecting those events to open the floodgates for them to win
long-distance approval in broad stretches of the country.
</P>
<P>
   They may be mistaken, but if they are right, their best ally may
turn out to be AT&AMP;T. As AT&AMP;T prepares to invade the Bells' core
local communications markets by way of cable television systems,
some of the regional Bells are expecting to win compensatory breaks
from the FCC, some Bell executives said Monday.

CLINTON'S FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE LISTS LEGAL DEBTS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's financial holdings have
remained steady throughout the last year, but because of his
impeachment, his legal bills soared, according to financial
disclosure forms released Monday by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual financial statement, which requires only a range
of figures rather than precise numbers, the president and his wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, reported assets of $1.2 million to $5.57
million for 1998. The biggest chunk _ worth more than $1 million
but less than $5 million _ came from a blind trust in Mrs.
Clinton's name.
</P>
<P>
   The assets fall within the same range as they did in 1997. A
year earlier, the assets ranged from $760,000 to $1.7 million and
were raised substantially by the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear from this year's report how much the Clintons have
benefited from the stock market's continued rise, but a White House
official said their assets were at the lower end of the range.
</P>
<P>
   The president owed an estimated $10 million in legal bills
stemming from his defense in the Monica Lewinsky affair and in the
Paula Jones suit. His legal defense fund, which has collected about
$4.5 million since it was set up in January 1998, paid $2.6 million
of Clinton's legal fees. This was reported as a gift on the
disclosure statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reported owing the Washington law firms of Williams &AMP;
Connolly more than $1 million and Skadden, Arps, Slater, Meagher &AMP;
Flom more than $1 million. The president also reported owing
$100,000 to $250,000 to the Little Rock, Ark., firm of Wright,
Lindsey &AMP; Jennings and $250,000 to $500,000 to Mayer, Brown &AMP;
Platt.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons reported keeping more than $18,000 in gifts from
various individuals. These included a film frame of ``Animaniacs''
from Steven Spielberg, the director, valued at $400, and a
collection of videos of the top 100 movies, as rated by the
American Film Institute, worth $1,750, from Sumner M. Redstone, the
chairman of Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive gift the Clintons kept was a saxophone and
two books, worth a total of $3,000, from an individual in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Carly Simon, the singer, gave Clinton a framed oil painting
worth $300, and Sammy Sosa gave him a bat and Cubs jersey with his
signature, worth $350. Robert Squier, the political consultant,
gave him a ``Doonesbury'' cartoon, inscribed by the cartoonist,
Garry Trudeau, worth $1,500. The Clintons also kept a cashmere
sweater coat from Mongolia valued at $395.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, reported assets of
$1.4 million to $1.7 million, including properties in Arlington,
Va., and Carthage, Tenn.

MILSTEIN SUES REDSKIN OFFICIALS, ALLEGING SABOTAGE OF BID
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howard Milstein charged Monday in a federal lawsuit that his
group's $800 million bid to acquire the Washington Redskins was
sabotaged by John Kent Cooke, the team's president, and Charley
Casserly, the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit against Cooke and Casserly, Milstein and his
brother, Edward, contended that the two Redskins officials
orchestrated a clandestine plan to keep the team in their hands.
The Milsteins also accused certain National Football League
officials of complicity in the failure of their Washington Sports
Ventures firm to buy the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the team, Cooke said, ``If I must, I
will gladly defend myself against these petulant charges, which
have no merit whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   A league spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was
filed in Federal District Court in Washington. The Milsteins have
extensive real estate holdings in the New York area, and a group
they headed bought the Islanders professional hockey team last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees of the estate of Jack Kent Cooke, John's father,
approved the sale to the Milsteins in January, but the offer was
withdrawn last month when it lacked the support of enough team
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Cooke also made an offer, of $680 million, which he withdrew
after the Milsteins backed out. Daniel Snyder, a partner in
Washington Sports Ventures with the Milsteins, then organized an
$800 million offer, which is expected to be approved.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that Cooke and Casserly lobbied NFL owners
against the Milsteins, leaked false information to the news media
and worked with league officials to frustrate the bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after the trustees entered into the sales contract,'' the
Milsteins charged, ``Cooke continued his secret campaign to
frustrate the outcome of the public auction and block the sale of
the Redskins to anyone other than himself.'' Cooke's actions, it
was alleged, violated his responsibility as an executor of his
father's estate to secure the highest price.
</P>
<P>
   Other executors directed Cooke not to attend the NFL owners'
meetings in March. Still, the suit alleged, Cooke boasted that he
had lined up enough votes to block the sale ``and that he would
ultimately take control of the Redskins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milsteins' lawsuit charged that various league officials
offered Cooke waivers of financial rules that where not available
to Milstein or other bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The Milsteins and the league wrangled repeatedly over the amount
of debt included in their bid and how the financing was to be
structured. But such concerns, they charged, ``were plainly a sham
because of the blatant double standards.''

EXCERPTS FROM COURT'S WELFARE RULING AND REHNQUIST'S DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-WELFARE and related stories.) 
(mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision on Monday barring states from paying lower welfare
benefits to newcomers than to longtime residents. The vote in Saenz
vs. Roe was 7-2. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority
decision, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Stevens
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, California enacted a statute limiting the maximum
welfare benefits available to newly arrived residents. The scheme
limits the amount payable to a family that has resided in the State
for less than 12 months to the amount payable by the State of the
family's prior residence.
</P>
<P>
   The questions presented by this case are whether the 1992
statute was constitutional when it was enacted and, if not, whether
an amendment to the Social Security Act enacted by Congress in 1996
affects that determination.
</P>
<P>
   California is not only one of the largest, most populated, and
most beautiful States in the nation; it is also one of the most
generous ... In one year ... Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC), which was replaced in 1996 with Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), provided benefits for an
average of 2,645,814 persons per month at an annual cost to the
State of $2.9 billion. In California the cash benefit for a family
of two _ a mother and one child _ is $456 a month, but in the
neighboring state of Arizona, for example, it is only $275.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, in order to make a relatively modest reduction in its
vast welfare budget, the California Legislature enacted 11450.03 of
the state Welfare and Institutions Code. That section sought to
change the California AFDC program by limiting new residents, for
the first year they live in California, to the benefits they would
have received in the state of their prior residence. ...
</P>
<P>
   On December 21, 1992, three California residents who were
eligible for AFDC benefits filed an action in the Eastern District
of California challenging the constitutionality of the durational
residency requirement ...
</P>
<P>
   Each plaintiff alleged that she had recently moved to California
to live with relatives in order to escape abusive family
circumstances. ... Each alleged that her monthly AFDC grant for the
ensuing 12 months would be substantially lower under 11450.03 than
if the statute were not in effect. ...
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Levi found that the statute ``produces
substantial disparities in benefit levels and makes no
accommodation for the different costs of living that exist in
different states.'' Relying primarily on our decisions in Shapiro
v. Thompson (1969), and Zobel v. Williams (1982), he concluded that
the statute placed ``a penalty on the decision of new residents to
migrate to the State and be treated on an equal basis with existing
residents.'' Green v. Anderson (1993). In his view, ... even if the
purpose was only to conserve limited funds, the state had failed to
explain why the entire burden of the saving should be imposed on
new residents. The Court of Appeals summarily affirmed for the
reasons stated by the district judge.
</P>
<P>
   We granted the state's petition for certiorari. We were,
however, unable to reach the merits because the secretary's
approval of 11450.03 had been invalidated in a separate proceeding.
... We vacated the judgment and directed that the case be
dismissed. Accordingly, 11450.03 remained inoperative until after
Congress enacted the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity
Reconciliation Act of 1996. ...
</P>
<P>
   The new statute expressly authorizes any state that receives a
block grant under TANF to ``apply to a family the rules (including
benefit amounts) of the program of another state if the family has
moved to the state from the other state and has resided in the
state for less than 12 months.'' ... The California Department of
Social Services therefore issued an ``All County Letter''
announcing that the enforcement of 11450.03 would commence on April
1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, 1997, the two respondents filed this action in the
Eastern District of California making essentially the same claims
asserted by the plaintiffs in Anderson v. Green, but also
challenging the constitutionality of PRWORA's approval of the
durational residency requirement. ... Judge Levi concluded that the
existence of the Federal statute did not affect the legal analysis
in his prior opinion in Green.
</P>
<P>
   The state did not disagree with plaintiffs' contention that
11450.03 would create significant disparities between newcomers and
welfare recipients who have resided in the state for over one year.
</P>
<P>
   The state relied squarely on the undisputed fact that the
statute would save some $10.9 million in annual welfare costs. ...
It contended that this cost saving was an appropriate exercise of
budgetary authority as long as the residency requirement did not
penalize the right to travel. ... Judge Levi concluded, however,
that the relevant comparison was not between new residents of
California and the residents of their former states, but rather
between the new residents and longer-term residents of California.
He therefore again enjoined the implementation of the statute.
</P>
<P>
   Without finally deciding the merits, the Court of Appeals
affirmed his issuance of a preliminary injunction. We now affirm.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``travel'' is not found in the text of the
Constitution. Yet the ``constitutional right to travel from one
State to another'' is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence. Indeed,
as Justice Stewart reminded us in Shapiro v. Thompson, (1969), the
right is so important that it is ``assertable against private
interference as well as governmental action a virtually
unconditional personal right, guaranteed by the Constitution to us
all.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Shapiro, we reviewed the constitutionality of three statutory
provisions that denied welfare assistance to residents of
Connecticut, the District of Columbia and Pennsylvania, who had
resided within those respective jurisdictions less than one year
... We squarely held that it was ``constitutionally impermissible''
for a state to enact durational residency requirements for the
purpose of inhibiting the migration by needy persons into the
State.
</P>
<P>
   In this case California argues that 11450.03 was not enacted for
the impermissible purpose of inhibiting migration by needy persons
and that, unlike the legislation reviewed in Shapiro, it does not
penalize the right to travel because new arrivals are not
ineligible for benefits during their first year. ...
</P>
<P>
   The ``right to travel'' discussed in our cases embraces at least
three different components. It protects the right of a citizen of
one state to enter and to leave another state, the right to be
treated as a welcome visitor rather than an unfriendly alien when
temporarily present in the second state, and, for those travelers
who elect to become permanent residents, the right to be treated
like other citizens of that state.
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue in this case, then, is this third aspect of the
right to travel, the right of the newly arrived citizen to the same
privileges and immunities enjoyed by other citizens of the same
State. That right is protected not only by the new arrival's status
as a state citizen, but also by her status as a citizen of the
United States. That additional source of protection is plainly
identified in the opening words of the 14th Amendment: ``All
persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of
the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any
law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite fundamentally differing views concerning the coverage of
the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment, most
notably expressed in the majority and dissenting opinions in the
Slaughter-House Cases, (1873), it has always been common ground
that this clause protects the third component of the right to
travel. Writing for the majority in the Slaughter-House Cases,
Justice Miller explained that one of the privileges conferred by
this clause ``is that a citizen of the United States can, of his
own volition, become a citizen of any state of the union by a bon
fide residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of
that state.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Because this case involves discrimination against citizens who
have completed their interstate travel, the state's argument that
its welfare scheme affects the right to travel only
``incidentally'' is beside the point. ... Since the right to travel
embraces the citizen's right to be treated equally in her new state
of residence, the discriminatory classification is itself a
penalty. ...
</P>
<P>
   Disavowing any desire to fence out the indigent, California has
instead advanced an entirely fiscal justification for its
multitiered scheme. The enforcement of 11450.03 will save the state
approximately $10.9 million a year. The question is ... whether the
state may accomplish that end by the discriminatory means it has
chosen. An evenhanded, across-the-board reduction of about 72 cents
per month for every beneficiary would produce the same result. But
our negative answer to the question ... rests on the fact that the
Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment expressly equates
citizenship with residence: ``That clause does not provide for, and
does not allow for, degrees of citizenship based on length of
residence.'' It is equally clear that the clause does not tolerate
a hierarchy of 45 subclasses of similarly situated citizens based
on the location of their prior residence.
</P>
<P>
   Thus 11450.03 is doubly vulnerable: Neither the duration of
respondents' California residence, nor the identity of their prior
States of residence, has any relevance to their need for benefits.
Nor do those factors bear any relationship to the state's interest
in making an equitable allocation of the funds to be distributed
among its needy citizens. As in Shapiro, we reject any contributory
rationale for the denial of benefits to new residents: ...
``Appellants' reasoning would logically permit the state to bar new
residents from schools, parks, and libraries or deprive them of
police and fire protection.''...
</P>
<P>
   The state's legitimate interest in saving money provides no
justification for its decision to discriminate among equally
eligible citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The question that remains is whether Congressional approval of
durational residency requirements in the 1996 amendment to the
Social Security Act somehow resuscitates the constitutionality of
11450.03. That question is readily answered, for we have
consistently held that Congress may not authorize the states to
violate the 14th Amendment. ...
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of the United States, whether rich or poor, have the
right to choose to be citizens ``of the state wherein they
reside.'' The states, however, do not have any right to select
their citizens. The 14th Amendment, like the Constitution itself,
was, as Justice Cardozo put it, ``framed upon the theory that the
peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that
in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not
division.'' Baldwin v. GAF Seelig Inc., (1935).
</P>
<P>
   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

 WASHINGTON: is affirmed. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Chief Justice Rehnquist
</P>
<P>
   The Court today breathes new life into the previously dormant
Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment, a clause
relied upon by this Court in only one other decision, Colgate v.
Harvey, (1935), overruled five years later by Madden v. Kentucky,
(1940). It uses this clause to strike down ... a reasonable measure
falling under the head of a ``good-faith residency requirement.''
Because I do not think any provision of the Constitution and surely
not a provision relied upon for only the second time since its
enactment 130 years ago requires this result, I dissent.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot see how the right to become a citizen of another state
is a necessary ``component'' of the right to travel, or why the
Court tries to marry these separate and distinct rights. A person
is no longer ``traveling'' in any sense of the word when he
finishes his journey to a state which he plans to make his home.
Indeed, under the Court's logic, the protections of the Privileges
or Immunities Clause recognized in this case come into play only
when an individual stops traveling with the intent to remain and
become a citizen of a new State. ... Indeed, the same dicta from
the Slaughter-House Cases quoted by the Court actually treats the
right to become a citizen and the right to travel as separate and
distinct rights under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the
14th Amendment. At most, restrictions on an individual's right to
become a citizen indirectly affect his calculus in deciding whether
to exercise his right to travel in the first place, but such an
attenuated and uncertain relationship is no ground for folding one
right into the other.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Court has, in the past 30 years, essentially
conflated the right to travel with the right to equal state
citizenship in striking down durational residence requirements
similar to the one challenged here. See, Shapiro; Dunn v.
Blumstein, (1972). ...
</P>
<P>
   The Court in these cases held that restricting the provision of
welfare benefits, votes, or certain medical benefits to new
citizens for a limited time impermissibly ``penalized'' them under
the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment for having
exercised their right to travel. The Court thus settled for
deciding what restrictions amounted to ``deprivations of very
important benefits and rights'' that operated to indirectly
``penalize the right to travel. ... In other cases, the Court
recognized that laws dividing new and old residents had little to
do with the right to travel and merely triggered an inquiry into
whether the resulting classification rationally furthered a
legitimate government purpose. ... Under its new analytical
framework, a state, outside certain ill-defined circumstances,
cannot classify its citizens by the length of their residence in
the State without offending the Privileges or Immunities Clause of
the 14th Amendment. The Court thus departs from Shapiro and its
progeny, and ... does little to explain how the right to travel is
involved at all. Instead, as the Court's analysis clearly
demonstrates, this case is only about respondents' right to
immediately enjoy all the privileges of being a California citizen
in relation to that State's ability to test the good-faith
assertion of this right. The Court has thus come full circle by
effectively disavowing the analysis of Shapiro. ... In unearthing
from its tomb the right to become a state citizen and to be treated
equally in the new state of residence, however, the Court ignores a
state's need to assure that only persons who establish a bona fide
residence receive the benefits provided to current residents of the
state. The Slaughter-House dicta at the core of the Court's
analysis specifically conditions a United States citizen's right to
``become a citizen of any state of the Union'' and to enjoy the
``same rights as other citizens of that State'' on the
establishment of a ``bona fide residence therein.'' Even when
redefining the right to travel in Shapiro and its progeny, the
Court has ``always carefully distinguished between bona fide
residence requirements, which seek to differentiate between
residents and nonresidents, and residence requirements, such as
durational, fixed date, and fixed point residence requirements,
which treat established residents differently based on the time
they migrated into the state.''
</P>
<P>
   If states can require individuals to reside in-state for a year
before exercising the right to educational benefits, the right to
terminate a marriage, or the right to vote in primary elections
that all other state citizens enjoy, then states may surely do the
same for welfare benefits. ...
</P>
<P>
   There is no link between the need for an education or for a
divorce and the length of residence, and yet states may use length
of residence as an objective yardstick to channel their benefits to
those whose intent to stay is legitimate. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Court tries to distinguish education and divorce benefits by
contending that the welfare payment here will be consumed in
California, while a college education or a divorce produces
benefits that are ``portable'' and can be enjoyed after individuals
return to their original domicile. But this ``you can't take it
with you'' distinction is more apparent than real, and offers
little guidance to lower courts who must apply this rationale in
the future. ...
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, this foray into social economics demonstrates
that the line drawn by the Court borders on the metaphysical, and
requires lower courts to plumb the policies animating certain
benefits like welfare to define their ``essence'' and hence their
``portability.'' As this Court wisely recognized almost 30 years
ago, ``the intractable economic, social, and even philosophical
problems presented by public welfare assistance programs are not
the business of this Court.'' Dandridge.
</P>
<P>
   I therefore believe that the durational residence requirement
challenged here is a permissible exercise of the State's power to
``assure that services provided for its residents are enjoyed only
by residents.''

EDTORIAL: IS THIS FIGHT NECESSARY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 18: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has the raw political strength to
run Schools Chancellor Dr. Rudy Crew out of town. He clearly
believes that as an ``agent of change,'' he has the right to rout
anyone he thinks moves too slowly. But this would be a good time
for the mayor to show that strength can be used for conciliation as
well as raw conquest. Keeping Crew in place would be good for the
stability of New York City's school system. It would allow time for
analyzing the managerial and educational progress the chancellor
says he has made. It would also serve Giuliani's political interest
by showing that he can curb the authoritarian streak that troubles
many of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that Giuliani is entirely to blame for the
sudden freeze in relations between two guys who used to loaf around
the Gracie Mansion fireplace, drinking Scotch and smoking cigars.
But for mayoral aides to say that Giuliani's patience with Crew has
evaporated along with their friendship misses the point that
professionalism on both sides, not friendship, must be the enduring
basis for educational reform.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words that began two months ago has a Rashomon
quality. Each participant has his own version of the mixture of
machismo, ideology and hurt feelings that brought the two to
swords' point. Giuliani felt betrayed when the chancellor said he
would resign over the mayor's voucher plan. Crew felt demeaned by
the mayor's comment that the school system should be ``blown up.''
Each man has grievances that roll on for miles. But as the prison
guard said in ``Cool Hand Luke,'' what we really have here is ``a
failure to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   What we also have here is a school system with more than a
million students who will be hurt if there is a traumatic,
politically riven change at the top. Up to two years will be lost
in searching for a new chancellor and allowing him or her to settle
in. From the standpoint of continuity and protecting gains that
have been made, it makes far more sense for Giuliani to finish his
term with the chancellor he praised until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city cannot afford revolving-door chancellors,'' Bronx
Borough President Fernando Ferrer said at a gathering of black and
Hispanic officials supporting Crew. The event made another
important point. Given the mayor's reputation for a tin ear on race
relations, the removal of a black Chancellor widely regarded as
effective would further alienate New York's minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani insists that he cannot deliver the improved schools he
promised without a chancellor committed to fundamental change. That
formulation slights the chancellor's gains in imposing tougher
standards, reforming corrupt school boards, monitoring local
superintendents and pushing to end principals' tenure. Crew, for
his part, has let it be known that he is tired of being bullied,
and he is lobbying the state legislature and the city council to
strengthen his hand. Both men, it seems to us, are being needlessly
apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is right on some issues, such as the need to replace
the Board of Education with a body answering to the mayor. Crew is
right on the deleterious effect Giuliani's voucher program would
have. The two men appear to be resolving differences over social
promotion and can surely settle other issues using that
old-fashioned technique _ negotiation between grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Provided Crew does not become mindlessly provocative, the
greater responsibility to restore dialogue rests with Giuliani. In
governing, the person who has the power ought to make the peace, if
it is in the public interest. Right now the public interest lies in
stable leadership and orderly moves toward reform, rather than the
precipitate, litmus-test approach to reform adopted by Giuliani.

RODRIGUEZ'S FOUNDATION TO AID BOY WITH LEUKEMIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE SANCHEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez has had
a grip on major-league base runners for several years. His hold on
the base paths is so tight that runners don't often stray too far
from first base.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the seven-time All-Star catcher is taking his hands-on
approach in another direction _ his foundation and Britton Chism of
Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Britton, 3, suffers from a rare form of leukemia called Acute
Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), of which there are two types _ Type B
and Type T. Britton has the more rare Type T, and the revamped Ivan
``Pudge'' Rodriguez Foundation has chosen Britton as the first area
child it will aid with a grant. Britton's medical bills already
have reached $53,000, and his insurance policy covers only 80
percent of the costs, according to his mother, Mary Meenen.
</P>
<P>
   Although openly seeking corporate sponsorship, it's exactly what
Rodriguez and his foundation have wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund was set up to support families in the Metroplex and
Puerto Rico, but Pudge wanted to get more of a hands-on approach,''
said Jamie Adams, executive director of the Ivan ``Pudge''
Rodriguez Foundation. ``Now we are trying to concentrate on
individuals, where in the past we were aimed at charities and
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pudge wants a one-on-one basis relationship with the people he
helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1993, in conjunction with The Dallas Foundation, the
Ivan ``Pudge'' Rodriguez Foundation has raised nearly $200,000 in
six years, with most money coming from Rodriguez himself. Adams
said the foundation expects to grant $35,000-$40,000 in aid to
families in Puerto Rico and the Fort Worth-Dallas area in 1999 with
an increased amount of money granted in each of the following
years. Through the Dallas Foundation, the Ivan ``Pudge'' Rodriguez
Foundation has donated money to the Texas Neurofibromatosis
Foundation Fund, the Ronald McDonald Houses of Fort Worth and
Dallas, Children's Medical Center of Dallas, and American Cancer
Society of Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez built a youth baseball field in Fort Worth and said he
aspires to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love kids,'' Rodriguez said. ``I do what I can to help them
because they are all special and they mean a lot to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I turned pro I wanted to help kids, all kids. I
wish I could do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first choice of the new ``hands-on'' foundation, recently
relocated to a suite at The Ballpark in Arlington, is
coincidentally a Texas Rangers fanatic. Britton always dons his No.
7 jersey, knows most of the starting lineup, and hits baseballs
until dark. He has all the catching gear of a major-league player,
and is in the process of ``negotiating'' a red mask to replace his
black one.
</P>
<P>
   Already in his young life, baseball is playing an important
role. In fact, Britton's father, Randy Chism, discovered the
cancerous lumps on his son's neck two months ago, while the two
were playing their daily game of catch in the front yard.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Chism initially thought his son had mononucleosis or
strep throat, but a few visits to the doctor proved otherwise.
Britton was diagnosed with leukemia March 11, and the road since
his diagnosis has not been an easy one. It's been a combination of
good days and bad days, but Britton's mother said being chosen by
Ivan Rodriguez has brought unexpected joy to Britton. The family is
very grateful, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the thought of Pudge gets him excited,'' said Meenen, a
teacher at Austin Elementary in Grand Prairie. ``To have this
happen is just a dream for Britton. We are very thankful for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Chism, 29, said he has accepted his son's illness,
appreciates the opportunities provided by the foundation, but is
anxiously awaiting the return of their normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what they are doing for Britton and for us ... if he
knew what a dream come true was, this would be it,'' Chism said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would trade it all back if I could have him healthy. We
are just trying to keep a normal life, but it's weird because this
is not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months, life has been anything but normal for
Britton's family.
</P>
<P>
   Three days a week, twice a day, Britton takes his antibiotic
drugs. He takes an oral dosage of chemotherapy and receives
``normal'' chemotherapy treatment every Friday in sessions ranging
from 21/2 to seven hours. The routine will continue for the next
21/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he will get better and there is an end to this,'' Chism
said. ``We'll just ride it out to the end, and he'll be back to
normal in no time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Aiding Britton's family and families like his is the goal of the
Ivan ``Pudge'' Rodriguez Foundation, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a ways to go, but this is what it's all about,''
said Adams as he watched Britton run around the foundation's suite
at The Ballpark. ``The family is great and he is full of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' assistant, Jennifer Garza, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look how happy he is just to take a picture with a Pudge
poster,'' Garza said. ``That's the best the part of all this,
seeing how happy he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's so neat.''

   MEXICO-PRI-0518 _ MEXICO CITY _ After more than 70 years in
power, Mexico's ruling party announced Monday it has voted to hold
the first-ever primary election to allow followers to select their
candidate for Mexico's 2000 presidential election. For decades, the
ruling Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI, has won Mexico's
presidency, sometimes under a cloud of suspicion of fraud. The
party's candidate has always been hand-picked by the man who won
Mexico's presidency before him. That secret selection process,
dubbed the ``dedazo,'' or ``big finger,'' will be replaced later
this year by a national vote conducted in 300 electoral districts
nationwide. (Ferriss).

TERROR SUSPECT'S INDICTMENT TO BE SOUGHT AFTER TALKS FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After eight months of secret negotiations in which
the government sought to win the cooperation of a suspected chief
lieutenant to Osama bin Laden, talks have broken down between the
parties, and federal officials have decided to seek his indictment,
lawyers said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Ali A. Mohamed, 46, is a former sergeant in the
U.S. Army who is suspected of switching sides and joining what
federal prosecutors have described as a worldwide terrorist
conspiracy led by bin Laden against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, which could be returned as early as this week,
is expected to include a charge of conspiring to kill American
citizens abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers suggest that the government became involved in a
worldwide effort beginning in the early 1990s to find people in the
bin Laden organization who could describe its inner workings. The
government's major known success so far has been a shadowy figure
referred to only as ``CS-1,'' who appears to have left the group
and begun to cooperate with investigators around 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrest of Mohamed in September, which has officially
been kept secret by the government, raised hopes that the
authorities might be able to press him into providing a more
contemporary look at the group and its reputed leader.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, a former major in the Egyptian army, was granted a visa
to enter the United States in 1985 and eventually became an
American citizen. In 1986, he enlisted in one of the American
Army's elite units, at Fort Bragg, N.C., and while there began
traveling to the New York City area, where he trained a group of
Islamic militants in basic military techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the group, which was based in Brooklyn, were
later convicted of plotting a series of terrorist attacks in New
York, including the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed also made at least two trips to Afghanistan to train
rebel commanders in military tactics, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been indicted in the bombings of the two American
embassy buildings in Africa in August and in other acts of
terrorism abroad. He remains a fugitive, as do other members of his
group named in the public indictments.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the government's effort to win cooperation from
Mohamed, the authorities have kept him under a cloak of secrecy
rarely seen in the public courts, closing the courtroom when he
first appeared before a judge, listing him in the dockets as ``John
Doe,'' and holding him in a high security cell in the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe that Mohamed established ties with bin
Laden as early as 1991. He became adept at obtaining false
documents for bin Laden's organization, officials have said, and
assisted with logistical tasks for bin Laden, such as his move in
1991 from Afghanistan to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   While at Fort Bragg, where he spent three years as a supply
sergeant assigned to Special Forces, Mohamed was befriended by
other Army officers who said they found him to be engaging and
intelligent, although his support for Islamic causes and curiosity
about intelligence matters raised some questions. He was honorably
discharged in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He had lived much of the last decade in California, and was
charged last Sept. 11 after testifying before a federal grand jury
in Manhattan that was investigating bin Laden's activities.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the federal investigation refused comment on
Monday night, as did a defense lawyer, James Roth, who represents
Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
   But others said the government's long and delicate negotiation
with Mohamed had ultimately failed to persuade him, in effect, to
switch sides again, and become an informant against bin Laden and
his group.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, in cases where the government seeks to win a
suspect's cooperation, investigators will entertain a proffer, or
offer of information, from the suspect about the evidence or leads
he may be able to provide. The suspect will often then seek, in
return, leniency in sentencing, or perhaps seek to avoid prison
altogether and to be placed in the witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, which is leading
the bombing investigation, is known to have a strict policy of
requiring that potential cooperating witnesses disclose all that
they know, even topics of which the government may not yet be
aware.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the talks with Mohamed suggests that he may not
have been as forthcoming as the government believed he could be, or
that he offered what prosecutors saw as a mixture of truths and
lies, which would have disqualified him under the rules from
obtaining a traditional cooperation agreement.

SHARES END MIXED, WITH THE DOW DROPPING 59.85 POINTS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock prices were mixed Monday, in large part because of an
afternoon rally in technology shares. But with Federal Reserve
policy makers scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss a possible
increase in interest rates, investors were reluctant to make new
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volume was low, as it should be when you don't know what you
are looking at,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about interest rates rose significantly on Friday after
the government reported that consumer prices rose at their fastest
clip in nine years during April.
</P>
<P>
   The report sent stocks sharply lower on Friday, and broad-based
selling continued when markets opened on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While stocks sensitive to the interest rate, like banks and
financial service companies, suffered throughout the session,
reports that Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer were set to post
better-than-expected quarterly earnings helped to stem the decline
during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average, down by
167 points at one point, stood at 10,853.47, a loss of 59.85
points, or six-tenths of a percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes did better.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by strong gains in Microsoft, America Online and Dell,
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which had also been lower
for much of the session, reversed course and closed up 1.69 points,
or one-tenth of a percent, at 1,339.49. And the Nasdaq composite
index gained 33.98 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,561.84.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology stocks really turned things around,'' said
Michael Molnar, a managing director in retail sales and trading at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rally, most stocks had a tough day. Almost two
stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange,
and 61 of the S.&AMP; P. 500's 89 industry groups declined.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, volume was light, at 679.7 million shares. On
the Nasdaq market, 788 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates on Tuesday,
but many think the central bank will signal that it is leaning
toward a rate increase in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Most traders and analysts see a rate increase as an unqualified
negative for the stock market. But Molnar said it could be
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the market would necessarily view it as a
negative,'' he said. ``The selloff in the bond market has been so
substantial that a surprise move by the Fed now might be seen as
being pre-emptive. If anything, a pre-emptive move has more appeal
than more waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks, which are most sensitive to changes
in interest rates, were losers Monday. And auto stocks slumped
after a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst said sales might have
peaked.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup fell 1, to 70. J.P. Morgan &UR;  &LR; slumped 4, to 135 15/16.
Bank One declined 1}, to 60 5/16. And Merrill Lynch lost 1 11/16,
to 79 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor was the biggest loser in the S.&AMP; P. 500, dropping 3
1/16, to 57 11/16. And General Motors, a Dow component, declined 2
13/16, to 80 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of a strong earnings report helped to send
Hewlett-Packard's stock higher. The stock rose 4 9/16, to 88}.
After the close, the world's second-biggest computer maker reported
quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, which is expected to report its results Tuesday, was
another good performer. It rose 2 1/16, to 43\.
</P>
<P>
   America Online was the most actively traded issue on the New
York Stock Exchange, jumping 10 1/16, to 136.
</P>
<P>
   Concern that the combination of U S West and Global Crossing
will be closely scrutinized by regulators caused prices of both
companies to fall Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U S West fell 4[, to 58[. Meanwhile, Global Crossing slipped 1[,
to 60\.
</P>
<P>
   Other long-distance companies gained. Qwest rose 6[, to 90~ and
Level 3 Communications gained 3 15/16, to 88{.

AT&AMP;T DIGITAL MUSIC UNIT LOSES MORE THAN HALF OF ITS WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a setback to AT&AMP;T's efforts on the digital music frontier,
more than half the employees of its A2B music initiative are
leaving the company to join another venture.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 who are leaving include Larry Miller and Howie Singer,
co-founders of A2B, which was established 18 months ago and
developed a digital format for transmitting music over the
Internet. The group will join Reciprocal Inc., a privately held
company that creates software for managing rights to digitally
distributed material, where they will start a new division
dedicated to music. Microsoft invested $15 million in Reciprocal in
March.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he and others were leaving A2B, which has an
overall staff of 26, Miller said the new business would give his
team the chance to work in a ``better place'' that will allow them
to ``accelerate their work'' in creating widespread acceptance for
digital music.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is the latest in a complicated web of alliances
in the frenzied rush to sell music on line.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is a founding member of the Secure Digital Music
Initiative, an effort by the recording industry and technology
companies to combat the threat seen in digital music formats like
MP3, which is enormously popular on the Internet but provides no
safeguards against piracy. The group is trying to develop standards
for portable digital music devices.
</P>
<P>
   The A2B format, which uses encryption to prevent unauthorized
copying, is considered technically superior to MP3 but has not
gained widespread acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T said it intended to continue A2B's work on digital music
distribution. Mercedes Walton, a vice president of corporate
strategy for AT&AMP;T, said Chris Varley, a former executive of the
online service Compuserve, would be named managing director of A2B.
</P>
<P>
   An executive at one online music retailer said Reciprocal's
plans could advance the sale of digital music. The executive, David
Pakman, vice president of strategic development for CD Now, said
that for music labels and artists, ``the more widespread
availability of rights software, the more content they'll feel
comfortable making for sale.''

PATAKI'S COYNESS FEEDS SPECULATION OF A SENATE BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He didn't really say anything. He hedged, hinted
and dodged, but in the end, New York Gov. George Pataki said
absolutely nothing Monday about either his political plans or a
gathering shrouded in secrecy that he has called for next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that did not stop this state capital _ and, to a
lesser degree, Washington, D.C. _ from buzzing with speculation
about what the governor intends, and precisely what he meant by his
oblique comments Monday morning at an Albany supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Most intriguingly, with the governor's testing of the
presidential waters failing to gather any momentum, he repeatedly
refused Monday to rule out a campaign, instead, for the U.S. Senate
next year. Such a campaign would put him in a primary battle
against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ with whom Pataki has had
a long, bitter feud _ and perhaps a November showdown with Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, one of the governor's closest aides, Zenia
Mucha, tried to dispel the rumor of a Senate candidacy, leaving
unanswered the question of why the governor would be so coy about a
prospect that he had rejected in the past, and that a top adviser
says he still rejects.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki acknowledged that he had called a meeting of prominent
Republicans from around the state, including state legislators and
members of Congress, in Manhattan next Monday, and that the
gathering will include some kind of announcement from him. The
people invited say they have no inkling what the topic will be,
adding to the cloak-and-dagger air. The few Pataki confidants who
claim to know the agenda for the event are not saying.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday at a Price Chopper supermarket,
Pataki steadfastly refused to answer questions about a possible
Senate campaign, put to him by reporters no fewer than eight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens next Monday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that he had ruled out a Senate race in the past, he
said, ``Then I've said it in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marc Humbert of The Associated Press asked why the governor
could not simply give a clear answer, Pataki said: ``I like
aggravating you, Marc. It's fun.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a striking turnabout for a governor who said in
December, ``I would think it's more likely that the Hindenburg
would come back together than I would step down as governor and
become senator.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, a Senate Republican, Thomas Libous of Binghamton,
said: ``Anything is possible. If he were to announce for the U.S.
Senate, it would not surprise me a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, director of the mayor's political exploratory
committee, told a reporter, ``We know about as much as you do
regarding the governor's plans.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, Ms. Mucha, Pataki's communications
director, said of the Hindenburg analogy: ``The governor stands by
that statement. The governor has not changed his position on that
matter. His position remains unchanged.''

GENERAL DYNAMICS TO BUY GULFSTREAM, MAKER OF JET PLANES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The General Dynamics Corp., a military contractor that
specializes in making nuclear submarines, surface ships and tanks,
announced Monday that it would acquire the Gulfstream Aerospace
Corp., a maker of corporate jets, for $5.3 billion in a deal that
returns General Dynamics to a business it once shed.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulfstream acquisition, a 1-for-1 stock swap that would give
General Dynamics shares to Gulfstream shareholders, would add a new
and potentially cyclical business to General Dynamics' product
line, which is heavily laden with armaments that are steady cash
generators.
</P>
<P>
   It would also move General Dynamics back to the aerospace
industry, a business it stepped away from in the early 1990s when
it sold Cessna Aircraft, a maker of business jets, to Textron and
when it sold its F-16 fighter jet operations to Lockheed Martin as
well as its missile division to Hughes Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   The deal for Gulfstream elicited mix reaction on Wall Street.
General Dynamics tumbled nearly 10 percent, or $6.1875, to $65.25,
after having traded as low as $63.25 by midday. Still, while many
on Wall Street were skeptical about the deal, others said
Gulfstream would add a strong cash generator to the company, even
if it took General Dynamics in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal makes a lot of sense from a financial perspective,''
said Pierre Chao, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
``General Dynamics is adding a company with a solid background and
great cash flow, which will allow them to fuel further defense
acquisitions.'' He said the market was forgetting that General
Dynamics used to be in the aerospace business.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics' chief executive, said
Gulfstream ``is well within our core competencies and one of the
strategic areas where I said we would move.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the company still had executives who were
responsible for efficiencies in aircraft ``and can help Gulfstream
with its internal plans. This company hit us right in the gut as a
very nice opportunity and a very fine company.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics, however, wondered why General Dynamics would consider
taking on a business-jet company at what may be the top of a
decade-long business expansion. But, they acknowledged that a trend
in the business-jet business toward fractional ownership, or a type
of corporate time-share, should protect Gulfstream from the next
economic downturn. Gulfstream currently has a $4-billion backlog of
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Dynamics' business may be boring, but they make a lots
of cash,'' said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment
Partners, a Los Angeles-based aerospace advisory firm. ``Gulfstream
is a commercial business that is being acquired near the top of a
business cycle. It's a lot more volatile, although less volatile
since the advent of fractional ownership. This is one that
investors are scratching their heads over. But I think extremely
highly of the General Dynamics management team, so you are willing
to give them the benefit of the doubt on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream was bought for $825 million by the New York leverage
buyout firm of Forstmann Little &AMP; Co., which took the company
public in 1996 and still owns 23 percent of the stock. The firm
expects to gain a total of about $3 billion in cash and General
Dynamics stock from the deal, which is expected to close in 90 to
120 days, assuming it gets shareholder and regulatory approval, as
expected. The current value of the Gulfstream acquisition was based
on last Friday's closing price. The final price will be based on
General Dynamics share price on the day the deal closes. The deal
can be canceled if General Dynamics shares fell below $63 a share
in the 15 days before the deal's closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Dynamics is not a company that makes ships, it's a
company that makes money, and it will diversify into those areas
that add to that,'' said Loren Thompson, an industry analyst at the
Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., research firm. ``Gulfstream
has a superior backlog of orders; it's an area where General
Dynamics has a long history and a lot of current management talent
and, with the anticipated expansion of Pentagon spending, General
Dynamics is not buying it at the top of its own business cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the government blocked an attempt by General
Dynamics to buy Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. for $1.4 billion,
citing antitrust grounds. Chabraja of General Dynamics said of the
two deals, ``They were both perking along at the same time, and we
were fully prepared to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics, based in Falls Church, Va., which earned $364
million last year, or $2.86 a share, on sales of $5 billion, said
Gulfstream would increase 1999 earnings by 25 cents a share and
2000 earnings by 35 cents a share. Gulfstream, based in Savannah,
Ga., earned $225.3 million in 1998 on revenue of $2.4 billion. &QL;

WINNICK WEAVES A SINGLE CABLE INTO AN EMPIRE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Mass.) (With USWEST-GLOBAL) 
 (ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two years ago, Gary Winnick, a financier with
little experience in telecommunications, undertook a project to lay
an optical fiber cable across the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Winnick has become the telecommunications industry's
newest, and by far one of its richest superstars.
</P>
<P>
   With its announcement Monday that it is merging with US West
Inc., Winnick's company, Global Crossing Ltd. has entered the ranks
of the nation's major telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   And Winnick has parlayed his initial personal investment of $15
million in the trans-Atlantic cable into a roughly 25 percent stake
in Global Crossing worth more than $6 billion. That will make
Winnick, 51, the largest shareholder in the company formed by the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning rise of Winnick and of Global Crossing is at least
partly the result of investor frenzy for anything related to the
Internet. Global Crossing's stock, which was priced at a
split-adjusted $9.50 when first offered to the public Aug. 14,
closed Monday at $60.25.
</P>
<P>
   But Winnick, a former aide to Michael R. Milken, has been quick
to seize upon the opportunity provided by the soaring stock to
build an empire through mergers, not only with US West but also
with the Frontier Corp., a long distance company that Global
Crossing agreed to acquire in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'd be the first to say he didn't envision what you
see today,'' said Lodwrick M. Cook, the co-chairman of Global
Crossing with Winnick. But he added: ``He saw the opportunity to
build quickly. He's the driving force behind the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnick, who prefers to operate behind the scenes, agreed.
``Sometimes things happen,'' he said. ``But you need to get to the
plate to have things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnick is described by those who know him as a master salesman
with a quick wit. He is also driven, even conducting evening
business meetings while exercising on the treadmill in his Beverly
Hills office, with company executives sitting around him. While
Global Crossing is supposedly based in Bermuda, its executives work
in Beverly Hills in the same building used by Pacific Capital
Group, Winnick's investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   He has been willing to spread the instant wealth his company has
generated in order to quickly do mergers and recruit experienced
executives. ``He's actually one of those businessmen who does go
for the win-win situation,'' said an investment banker who has
worked with him. ``He's not looking for the last nickel on the
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Winnick grew up in Roslyn, N.Y., and earned a degree in
economics from C.W. Post College in Greenvale, N.Y. He worked in
New York as a bond salesman for a predecessor of Drexel Burnham
Lambert, and then transferred to the company's Los Angeles office
in the late 1970s to become a close aide to Milken, who pioneered
the market for junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Winnick left Drexel in 1985, several years before the firm's
collapse, to start his own investment fund, Pacific Asset
Management. Milken was an investor in that fund, but he is not in
Winnick's current company, Pacific Capital Group. Winnick was
ordered by a court to testify in Milken's case in exchange for
immunity from prosecution, but Milken, charged with violating
securities laws, reached an agreement with prosecutors before the
testimony took place.
</P>
<P>
   Until Global Crossing, Winnick was a low-profile financier with
mixed results. A furniture chain and a mattress company he bought
in the late 1980s both declared bankruptcy within weeks of each
other in 1991. He had more success with the Ornda Healthcorp, a
hospital company he sold to the Tenet Healthcare Corp., and with
Optel, a company that provided cable television service to
apartments and was sold to Le Groupe Videotron. Winnick also owns a
27 percent stake in Playa Vista, a real estate development in Los
Angeles in which Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks SKG will be building
its studio.
</P>
<P>
   Winnick said he was drawn to the trans-Atlantic cable project
that became the seed of Global Crossing because deregulation and
new technology are opening the telecommunications industry to new
players.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Capital turned to CIBC World Markets, part of Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, to finance most of the $750 million
needed for the project. Funds associated with CIBC now own about 94
million shares in Global Crossing, worth $5.66 billion, making the
transaction ``without a doubt'' the most profitable investment the
company has ever made, said Dean Kehler, managing director and
co-head of the high-yield group at CIBI World Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Most undersea cables had been installed by consortiums of big
telephone companies. With less bureaucracy, Global Crossing was
able to move quickly, and finished the cable in time to catch a
huge spurt of demand generated by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge pent-up demand and there was not enough
capacity to meet it,'' said Michael Ruddy, a fiber optic analyst
with Pioneer Consulting in Cambridge, Mass. Global Crossing
fashioned itself as a carrier's carrier, selling capacity to
telephone companies, not to end users. With the success of that
first cable, still the only one the company has in operation,
Winnick decided to turn that one project into a company and to
build a worldwide network of transoceanic and terrestrial fiber
optic cables linking the world's major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Its agreements to merge with Frontier and US West move Global
Crossing toward becoming a full-fledged telecommunications carrier,
serving both the retail and wholesale markets. That could add risks
because other carriers, now its competitors, will be more reluctant
to buy transmission capacity from Global.
</P>
<P>
   Winnick has positioned Global to be a major telecommunications
player by hiring a team of experienced executives, all of whom have
become wealthy. Winnick has given stock to everyone in the company
and to others close to him, including his housekeeper. Former
President George Bush accepted stock in lieu of an $80,000 fee for
making a speech at a Global Crossing event. That stock is now worth
millions of dollars.
 &UR;  &LR; Winnick will not have an executive position in the company after
it merges with US West. Robert Annunziata, who was the founder of
Teleport Communications before being recruited by Winnick last
year, and Solomon D. Trujillo, the head of US West, will be
co-chairmen and co-chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   Winnick would not comment on his role in the combined company,
but others say he will be on the board and remain a power behind
the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll ever turn his back on Global,'' Cook said.
``He will do other things, yes, but he will be involved in
Global.''

NHL IS MONITORING INTIMIDATION FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- After Game 5 of this Eastern Conference semifinal,
Bruins coach Pat Burns and Sabres coach Lindy Ruff engaged in a
sort of off-ice trench warfare designed to help their respective
clubs curry some favor with the officials.
</P>
<P>
   The skippers took their cases to the public, saying their
players were being targeted, their players were being cheap-shotted
behind the play, their players should have drawn more penalties.
</P>
<P>
   An old trick, really. Sure, the series has been hard-hitting,
quite a bit nasty and desperate as the teams head into Game 6 in
Buffalo Tuesday. But NHL director of officiating Bryan Lewis said
the league is monitoring all the matchups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be the time of year when it becomes, I don't
want to say a secondary story, we don't want to be a secondary
story, but we had a preplayoff meeting and one of the subjects was
intimidation,'' said Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The intimidation to which Lewis refers is the type demonstrated
by Burns and Ruff Sunday, trying to gain an edge, however small.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Burns reiterated his position, saying the officials
hadn't made it easy for his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given it to us early,'' said Burns. ``How many times
have we been put five-on-three all year, maybe once or twice? In
this series, it seems to be every game. I don't want to get into
that situation but they've certainly used it a lot, about how we
were playing and how Ray Bourque was getting away with things. I've
watched the last couple of games and Mike Peca has been getting
away with murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns acknowledged, ``You have to get people's attention
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Burns said, enforcer Ken Belanger couldn't even
step on the ice without being targeted as a penalty waiting to
happen. Lewis said that was patently false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this what this is, intimidation?'' said Lewis. ``Belanger
is entitled to go out on the ice and play, don't slash, don't hack,
don't elbow or do whatever. It's his game to play the same as it is
for everyone else. We don't hit the ice with the idea that someone
is being targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of aggressive players who play at playoff time
and you can see they don't break the rules. It's not pick on
Belanger or Smith or Jones or whomever. Is this part of the
intimidation language? I don't know if it is or isn't. You'd have
to ask Pat Burns that question.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just try to not get drawn into those debates. We know
there's going to be controversy. It's not something we want.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the issue comes down to subjectivity. One man's
two-minute minor is another man's non-call. Lewis said there's
another category of penalty called the ``one-minute infraction'':
something has been done, but it's not enough to warrant a minor
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I could sit in the press box and you'd say, `I think
that's a penalty' and I'd write down, `Good non-call,' '' he said.
``So that debate goes on. You're dealing with two teams who are
battling for the rights to play on. We try to separate ourselves
from what is a genuine concern and what isn't. It's just a
heightened awareness to our end of the business. We're all talking
now about short series.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said it's expected that coaches, general managers, and
even players will try to sway the officials, whether by yakking at
them during the game, waiting for them after the game _ as Burns
pointed out about Ruff _ or going public at news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this hockey talk? It seems to be,'' said Lewis. ``I have
too much respect for the coaching staffs to say we don't have
concerns or issues. But to do it via (the media), I'm not too sure
if that's the way to get it properly addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we start to factor in what is intimidation or a form of
intimidation in either direction by either club. That becomes the
series supervisor's role, and Denis Morel has raised with me some
legitimate concerns, yes. It's his responsibility to provide
continuity from game to game. His role and his responsibility are
to remove the prejudiced point of view which we know is there,
everyone knows is there, then address what is a legitimate concern
in order to forewarn the officials. From there, he can set aside, I
don't want to say a frivolous claim of foul but those things that
are not the important matters that have to be addressed game to
game.''

   IRS SCALES BACK EFFORTS TO COLLECT UNPAID TAXES
</P>
<P>
   Internal Revenue Service tax collectors, under intense pressure
from Congress to be nicer to taxpayers, have drastically scaled
back efforts to collect unpaid taxes, newly available statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the drop-off in enforcement is because the IRS has been
shifting some resources to pay for customer service, new computers
and retraining. But IRS officers in six states said the biggest
reason for the retreat was their fear of being dismissed for
running afoul of a new law intended to protect taxpayers from
overzealous collectors.

   FORD TO IMPROVE TRUCK EMISSIONS
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor said that starting this autumn, its new pickup
trucks, including the nation's best-selling vehicle, would produce
no more air pollution than do cars.

<P>
   GENERAL DYNAMICS TO BUY JET MAKER
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics announced it would acquire Gulfstream
Aerospace, a maker of corporate jets, in a $5.3 billion stock swap.
The deal elicited mixed reaction on Wall Street, where General
Dynamics stock tumbled nearly 10 percent. It would return General
Dynamics, which specializes in making nuclear submarines, surface
ships and armored tanks, to a business it once exited.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END MIXED AS DOW FALLS
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices were mixed as investors waited to see what the
Federal Reserve would decide on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 59.85 points, or six-tenths of a percent, to
10,853.47. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.69 points,
to 1,339.49, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 33.98 points, or
1.34 percent, to 2,561.84.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year &UR;  &LR; bond fell to 5.89 percent from 5.92
percent on Friday.

   ONLINE BOOK SELLERS CUT PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com cut the prices of best-selling books by 50 percent

   AN ULTIMATUM FOR PHILIPPINE AIRLINES

   The embattled owner of Philippine Airlines, Lucio C. Tan, has
been given a week by Joseph E. Estrada, the president of the

NBA playoffs are wacky, wide open 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Given the dramatic, wacky first round of the
NBA playoffs, perhaps the league should change its slogan to I Love
This Parity!
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's mid-May, and seven teams still have legitimate hopes of
winning the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be more competitive with Michael
\RJordan\S on the sidelines,'' Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone said.
``And, boy, were we right. Surviving is the name of the game, and
it only gets tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight teams battling in conference semifinals the next 10
days, apparently only the Philadelphia 76ers and their one-man
Allen Iverson show would shock the league by winning the title. The
San Antonio Spurs, Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Lakers,
Jazz, Indiana Pacers, Atlanta Hawks and New York Knicks each played
well enough during the regular season and first round to show the
ability to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team that goes into Miami and wins twice in the playoffs
is a contender,'' said Pacers coach Larry Brown, referring to the
Knicks, who became the second No. 8 seed in NBA history to knock
off a No. 1. ``The seedings don't mean a thing anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite advancing, every team except the Blazers and Pacers had
major weaknesses exposed. The Spurs lost at home to the
scoring-impaired Minnesota Timberwolves; the Lakers couldn't guard
6-foot-6 forward Charles Barkley in the post; the Jazz was
uncharacteristically rattled by the Sacramento Kings; the Hawks
were blown out by 16 and 21 in consecutive games; the Knicks
suffered major physical and emotional letdowns after victories
against the Miami Heat; and the 76ers are the ultimate one-man
gang.
</P>
<P>
   In the Eastern Conference, the Pacers seem to be the favorites
because the two teams they tied for best record _ Miami and Orlando
_ were upset in the first round. Indiana, which swept Milwaukee,
has won 11 consecutive playoff games at Market Square Arena after
defeating Philadelphia, 94-90, last night, and has the calm,
veteran leadership of coach Larry Bird and guard Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pacers try to contain Iverson and his 30-point
outbursts, the fourth-seeded Hawks and eighth-seeded Knicks each
have game-dominating defenses anchored by former Georgetown centers
(Patrick Ewing and Dikembe Mutombo) and clutch scorers at shooting
guard (Allan Houston and Steve Smith). Their rugged series should
be close and low-scoring; neither team topped 86 points in three
regular-season meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As close as I think the teams are matched now, I think our
defense could be a decisive factor,'' Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens
said. ``From what I've seen, a couple of stops here and there could
take you a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference, the Jazz were an 8-foot hook from
Vlade Divac away from a shocking elimination Sunday. They will
either be re-invigorated by their escape or worn out by survival.
The deep Blazers, disappointed at not facing a Kings team they went
4-0 against, enter tonight's Game 1 at Delta Center off their
longest rest of the season after sweeping the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs proved capable of completely shutting down an
opponents' offense with the inside tandem of Tim Duncan and David
Robinson, but got little production off its bench against
Minnesota. The Lakers, meanwhile, are suddenly clicking offensively
despite often falling into the trap of dumping the ball to
Shaquille O'Neal then standing and watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're peaking,'' said O'Neal, who averaged 29.5 points per
game in the four-game dismantling of the Houston Rockets. ``If we
play hard and play together, we can win this whole thing.''

GOLDMAN SACHS TRIES SOMETHING NEW: PROMOTING ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group, which went public earlier this month when
it sold shares, plans to go public again, this time with its first
global advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with ads this week in print outlets worldwide, Goldman
intends to define itself as the blue-chip investment bank that
listens _ and never gives the same advice twice to its corporate
clients. All its advertising will carry the same tag line:
``Unrelenting Thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will not catch competitors flat-footed. Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Citigroup, J.P. Morgan
and many others heavily outspend Goldman to market their brands.
Many of these firms have recently introduced new advertising
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, however, has long been a happy enigma, known by its
clients but largely inscrutable to outsiders. Visitors have to look
hard to find the Goldman name on its headquarters at 85 Broad
Street in downtown Manhattan. Like all investment banks, Goldman
promotes deals it is involved in with staid print ads in the
financial press, known as tombstones. But rarely has it tried to
define itself publicly or reduce its mission to a pithy phrase.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman executives insist that the timing of the campaign is
purely coincidental with the stock offering earlier this month. But
both are part of the firm's plan to emerge from its shell. It faces
increasingly tough competition from investment banks that often
have more capital and much bigger ad budgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the noise out there, it's good to remind people who
we are and how we do business,'' said David W. May, Goldman's vice
president for global marketing. ``We need to have a consistent
presence for the brand regardless of market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman declined to comment in detail on the campaign, citing
Securities and Exchange Commission rules about seeking publicity
just after a public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected for a firm where employees have only
recently begun to wear blue Oxford shirts instead of the once
uniform white, Goldman's ads are tame and understated. By Madison
Avenue standards, the message is subtle.
</P>
<P>
   One print ad features identical twins. The caption reads: ``If
we ever find two companies that are exactly alike, we'll offer two
recommendations that are exactly alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Another shows a wide-eyed man at a hair salon examining his
pointy coiffure. The text: ``An honest opinion. Extremely rare when
asking about a future spouse, a new haircut, or whether you should
sell your company.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman will spend about $10 million on the campaign this year,
according to industry experts. The ads, designed by Ammirati Puris
Lintas of New York, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies,
will appear in publications like The Financial Times of London, The
Economist, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and Business
Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firm does not have a client base of 50 million people like
some of our competitors,'' May said. ``It has a very small target
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Most other Wall Street firms are also scrambling to put out a
fresh message, especially after a series of mergers that reduced
some well-known independent firms, like Smith Barney and Dean
Witter, to subsidiaries of giant corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, one of the financial industry's heaviest
marketers, introduced a campaign in March that plays down its
historic symbol, the bull, in favor of the abstract theme, ``human
achievement.'' Merrill plans to spend $75 million on that campaign
alone.
</P>
<P>
   And Morgan Stanley now uses as its corporate slogan ``We measure
success one investor at a time'' _ the ad line of the old Dean
Witter, the retail brokerage firm it merged with in 1997. The
firm's overall ad spending is estimated by industry experts at more
than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, a smaller investment bank
that is controlled by AXA's Equitable Companies, plans a
significant marketing push after it sells shares in its online
brokerage subsidiary, DLJ Direct, that would dwarf Goldman's
outlay.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Shevack, chief executive of Partners &AMP; Shevack/Wolf, an
advertising agency in New York owned by the Wolf Group, said that
Goldman needed to respond to the brand-building efforts of
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really need to pre-emptively brand the company vis a vis
the competition,'' Shevack, whose agency does not represent any of
the companies discussed here, said. ``They're trying to communicate
with a rarefied business population. But otherwise, it's no
different than Tide. You have to distinguish yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Goldman had an opportunity to do that now that others
are consolidating. Some well-honed brands, Shevack said, are
getting lost in the merger mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the others firms are worried about how to maintain the
equity they built up in their brands, while Goldman can approach it
with a clean slate,'' he said.

CASE-NEW HOLLAND DEAL REFLECTS TREND IN FARM INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Iowa)  (mk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The deal that was struck Monday to combine Case Corp.
and New Holland NV, two of the world's largest makers of farm and
construction equipment, is just the latest effort to consolidate an
embattled farm industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. economy remains robust, the sharp drop in
commodity prices that began just over a year ago has jolted nearly
every company in the agriculture business, and many have chosen to
combine in mergers that promise to cut costs and bring renewed hope
to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The deal making, of course, has raised concerns among some farm
organizations that fear the long-term effects of a highly
concentrated industry in which corporate farms dominate and smaller
farmers have fewer and fewer choices.
</P>
<P>
   But a host of companies tied to the agriculture market _ from
seed and fertilizer concerns to tractor makers and farm
cooperatives _ are rethinking the way they do business and finding
ways to team up.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, which has been moving aggressively to establish a
position in the life-sciences business, has acquired Pioneer
Hi-Bred, the world's largest seed company. Cargill and Continental
Grain, the two largest grain traders, agreed to merge in November.
And just last week, Farmland Industries and Cenex Harvest States,
two of the nation's largest food cooperatives, agreed to join
forces, creating a company with $20 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, it was Case and New Holland officials saying that new
synergies and productivity gains would create an awesome
combination with the kind of global heft that would make the new
entity a strong rival to Deere &AMP; Co., the world's largest maker of
farm equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Case and New Holland had been suffering, like other farm
equipment makers, through what analysts say is a nearly 25 percent
drop in the sales of farm equipment in the last year, with little
expectation that the farm economy would improve much this year.
Profits are down substantially from a year ago, and the stocks of
both companies had been sharply depressed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   So Monday's deal, one that calls for New Holland, which is 71
percent owned by Fiat of Italy, to pay about $4.3 billion, or $55 a
share, for Case, suggests that restructuring at a time when
globalization is all the rage was simply not enough for the farm
equipment makers, according to analysts. There needed to be a
bigger company to restructure.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which had combined sales of nearly $12 billion
in 1998, will be based in Racine, Wis., where Case is now based.
Jean-Pierre Rosso, the chief executive at Case who will head the
new company, said at a news conference here that he expected the
company to save up to $500 million annually within the next four
years. The company will sell both the Case and New Holland lines of
tractors, combines and construction equipment. But administrative
and other operations will be fused and financial services outfits
united in a company that will soon be renamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about cutting costs,'' said Lisa Shalett, who
covers the farm equipment industry for Sanford C. Bernstein. ``This
is a huge deal, but we won't see one of these for a while. This was
the last stroke in an evolutionary consolidation of the farm
equipment industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say that because the agriculture industry
is already so highly concentrated and because the Justice
Department is scrutinizing this concentration, it is unlikely there
will be other such deals.
</P>
<P>
   Bold moves by Monsanto, DuPont, Cargill and several meat
packers, including IBP, have also raised concern among farmers in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very grave concerns about this whole concentration
trend because when there is that kind of concentration, those with
power exert more power,'' said Gene Paul, president of the National
Farmers Organization in Ames, Iowa. ``There are that many fewer
buyers that we can buy from.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul said that his organization was most concerned about grain
companies and food processors, but that the general trend was
troublesome and one that farmers' organizations were pushing the
Justice Department to look into.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Duvick, a food industry analyst at Bank of America, said
the deal between Case and New Holland might be seen in its broadest
context as a result of a farm economy that could remain depressed
for some time because of a weak outlook for commodity prices around
the globe and changes related to the Freedom to Farm Act.
</P>
<P>
   Low commodity prices and pressures from big retailers are
squeezing farmers and middlemen, thereby reaching suppliers of farm
products and equipment. And that, he said, was what led to the
Case-New Holland deal, which was brokered by Credit Suisse First
Boston; Goldman, Sachs, and Lazard Freres.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is tied together,'' Duvick said. ``This is a new
era in agriculture, one in which we've already seen a major
consolidation of the industry.''

U.S. SEARCH ENGINE IS STOPPED HOURS AFTER DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A few hours after starting a fee-based search
engine for federal government Internet sites and documents, the
Commerce Department put the project off Monday to review whether it
conflicts with the Clinton administration's policy on unrestricted
access to government information.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce officials said the administration wanted to review the
joint venture by the National Technical Information Service and
Northern Light Technology Inc. from all policy angles, not just
that of the Information Service, which is a for-profit agency.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that the project was being delayed came several
hours after the Information Service and Northern Light officials
held a news briefing to demonstrate the search engine at the
National Press Club and after newspaper articles about the project
had appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``In announcing the product and joint venture with Northern
Light, we did not anticipate any conflict with government
information policies,'' the acting under secretary for technology,
Gary R. Bachula, said in a statement. ``But questions that have
arisen today point up the need for a review of this service from a
policy perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachula added, ``Specifically, press reports today raise
questions of consistency with government information policy, and we
want to make sure that this search service, which was to be sold by
subscription, is appropriate and fits within government policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's longstanding policy is to insure that all
government information is open and unrestricted, the Commerce
Department said. Any fees are to cover only the cost of
dissemination.
</P>
<P>
   The National Technical Information Service, a Commerce
Department agency that falls under Bachula's purview, by law
charges users for its products and services.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Information Service is financed from fees for its
products and services. It is also authorized by law to enter joint
ventures with private-sector entities to make government
information not otherwise available accessible to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed fee in the Northern Light joint venture would be
for the use of the search engine. The government data that the
search engine, to be known as usgovsearch.com, would analyze would
remain free and accessible independently to the public, the
department emphasized.

NEW JERSEY RABBI TO HEAD REFORM CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New Jersey, Pittsburgh)   (dal) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There could hardly be a more transformative moment than this to
take over the reins of the largest rabbinical organization in the
country, the Reform movement's Central Conference of American
Rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, after two years of soul-searching, deliberation and
debate, the 1,700-member conference will vote at its convention in
Pittsburgh on a new platform of 10 principles that will define what
it means to be a Reform Jew in the 21st century. The following day,
it will install Rabbi Charles A. Kroloff, 63, the senior rabbi at
Temple Emanu-El in Westfield, N.J., as president.
</P>
<P>
   Kroloff will start his two-year term with the prospect of
recognition and respect for the Reform movement in Israel, after
Monday's electoral defeat of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by
Ehud Barak, which seems likely to dilute the power of Orthodoxy
over the other branches of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will mean that Americans will feel more
comfortable about their relationship with Israel,'' Kroloff said.
``We should have a prime minister who understands the needs of
non-Orthodox Jews in Israel, and he understands that the future of
Israel depends on an end to religious coercion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the view of many, if the Principles for Reform Judaism, the
fourth set in 110 years, are approved as expected, they will mark a
return to more traditionalism.
</P>
<P>
   The platform calls for increased familiarity with and use of
Hebrew, and for more emphasis on the mitzvoth, the 613 laws and
commandments of daily living. It also spells out the importance of
Tikkun Olam, the call to repair the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some rabbis and congregational leaders have criticized the
principles for signaling a return to Orthodoxy, or as one critic
put it, ``Conservative Judaism Lite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The principles do call for more tradition but in a very modest
way that emphasizes personal autonomy,'' Kroloff said Monday. ``No
one says you must do X, Y or Z in order to be a good Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroloff said another priority of his administration would be to
address the emerging shortage of rabbis and other religious
professionals. Forty-six students are being ordained at Hebrew
Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion at commencement
ceremonies in New York and Cincinnati this year but there were 80
positions to be filled at congregations around the country.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to improve rabbis' quality of life. ``My main
crusade for the next two years will be to put more emphasis on
taking care of ourselves so that we can take better care of others
and also have a life,'' he said, referring to the constant demands
on a rabbi's time.
</P>
<P>
   Kroloff, who entered Yale at 16, was ordained at Hebrew Union
College in 1960 and served in several synagogues before joining
Temple Emanu-El in Westfield in 1966. He and his wife, Terry, have
two sons, a daughter and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He takes his own advice about leisure to heart, by sailing,
working out and trying to learn golf. ``If I were not a rabbi,'' he
said, ``what I really wanted to do was to be first baseman for the
Mets.''

ROBERT GOLDMAN, 60, BRIDGE ACE WHO WON 4 WORLD TEAM TITLES
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Texas, Ga., La.)  (ms) 
 By ALAN TRUSCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Goldman, the winner of four world bridge titles, died of
a heart attack on Sunday. He was 60 and lived in Highland Village,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He died on the way to a hospital, said his stepdaughter, Renee
DeSaye of Atlanta. He had just returned from a tournament in
Boissier City, La.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's four world titles were the Bermuda Bowl for Open Teams
in 1970, 1971 and 1979 and the Mixed Teams in 1972. He was on the
World Bridge Federation's list of Grand Masters, players of the
highest rank.
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1974, he was a member of the Aces team, which
dominated the American tournament scene and had several epic
battles with the Italian Blue Team.
</P>
<P>
   He won 13 major national team titles: the Vanderbilt in 1971,
1973, 1978, 1997 and 1998; the Spingold in 1969, 1978, 1983, 1986
and 1988, and the Reisinger in 1970, 1976 and 1980. He finished
second in three events 12 times. He also won seven other national
titles and hundreds of regional titles, and ranked ninth on the
all-time list of master point winners.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, he and Paul Soloway were the anchor pair
in a series of Internet challenge matches.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman was named the American Contract Bridge League's Honorary
Member for 1999, and is scheduled to be inducted into the league's
Hall of Fame in San Antonio in July.
</P>
<P>
   His bridge activities were wide-ranging away from the card
table. He taught classes, compiled computer practice hands and
created a program to evaluate bidding probabilities. He wrote
scripts for a bridge television series and two books, ``Aces
Scientific'' (self-published, 1973) and ``Winners and Losers at the
Bridge Table'' (Max Hardy, 1979).
</P>
<P>
   Goldman devised many conventions, notably Super Gerber and
Exclusion Blackwood. He was a consultant to the bridge league in
appeals, conventions and ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Other survivors are his wife, Bettianne; his son, Quinn; another
stepdaughter, Cherri McKinstry of Dallas, and a stepson, Russel
Taylor of Atlanta.

KYRIACOS DEMETRIOU, BARBER WEDDED TO TRADITION, DIES AT 80
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kyriacos Demetriou, a master barber whose
old-fashioned barber shop on the Upper West Side of Manhattan was
such an authentic butterfly in amber that it went into the Museum
of the City of New York when he retired in 1996, died on Friday. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   His son-in-law, Paul Galietti, said Demetriou had appeared to be
in good health, but died suddenly while watching television at his
home on East 86th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Demetriou, who was called Kay by his customers, was proud that
the Broadway Barbershop, which he took over in the early '50s, was
the oldest in the city, having been founded in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   But it was during the 40 years of his custodianship that the
shop on Broadway between 103rd and 104th streets became an
institution, and so did its owner. As unisex salons proliferated
and stylists replaced barbers, and fewer men knew how to provide
close and bloodless shaves with well-honed straight razors, Kay and
the Broadway Barbershop were often described in newspaper and
magazine articles as throwbacks to a time that was less impersonal
and blow-dried.
</P>
<P>
   Max Ferguson, a painter and a customer of Kay's, included a
portrait of the barber at work in his shop in his series of New
York subjects that he considered doomed. In February 1985, The New
Yorker ran a cartoon of Kay by Ed Koren that showed the barber
preparing to cut the hair of a shaggy man who says: ``There is
something you should know before you begin; my hair works hard and
it plays hard.'' And when the shop finally closed, many newspapers
devoted long articles to the subject, all mentioning an end of an
era.
</P>
<P>
   While the old, shiny appliances and the milk-glass bottles
marked lilac water and witch hazel helped establish the shop's
atmosphere, so, too, did Kay's unchanging routine: removing the tin
covers from his barber pole by 8 in the morning, presenting
lollipops to younger customers and keeping his radio set tuned to
WQXR, so that classical music filled the shop.
</P>
<P>
   There were also more mysterious rituals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, every workday evening from 5:30 to 6, a busy time
when Kay almost always had customers backed up in the waiting area,
a man, apparently returning from work and carrying a briefcase,
would stick his head into the shop and address the barber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello,'' he would say.
</P>
<P>
   Kay would pause and answer, ``Hello, Mr. Wilson, how are you
tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miserable,'' the dyspeptic Wilson would reply as he went on
his way.
</P>
<P>
   If Kay knew more about Wilson, he kept it to himself. He was a
good conversationalist, but a discreet one. He sometimes mentioned
famous customers, though he never hung their portraits in the shop,
believing that all his customers were worthy of respect.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Once, he casually noted that he had cut the hair of the actor
Yul Brynner, when he had hair. Among others he had trimmed and
shaved were Humphrey Bogart, George Gershwin and Aaron Copland, a
particular favorite.
</P>
<P>
   He also told of how in 1950, when he had five barbers working
for him, he had sent them in turn to tend to Gen. Dwight David
Eisenhower, then the president of Columbia University. None of the
men wanted to go back. Finally, he went himself and learned why.
``You see,'' he said, snipping away at a customer's short back and
sides, ``the general did not tip.``
</P>
<P>
   There were many other stories, but the ones he liked best were
about families. He kept track of customers' children, asking what
had become of the boys and girls he had once given lollipops to. It
was not unusual for people who had moved away years ago to come by
when visiting New York, bringing their old barber up to date and
learning his news.
</P>
<P>
   One story Kay loved to tell was about a young man who had come
into the shop because he believed his father, whom he had not seen
since early childhood, was a customer. Kay figured out who the
older man was and engineered a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, without any pushiness, he would also tell his own
story.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kay was born in Cyprus but as an infant was taken to London. The
family was poor and his father had lost an arm. The child began
working as a shoeshine boy in the West End, taking up a position
outside a barber shop. After some time the barber invited him
inside. He watched and learned, and recalled that in order to give
his first haircuts, he had to stand on a milk crate.
</P>
<P>
   He had a gift for barbering; while in his 20s he won a contest
as the best barber in England. For a while he had his own
barbershop in London. He arrived in New York before World War II,
cutting hair in a number of places before finding his way to the
Broadway Barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the '80s and '90s, as barbershop demographics shifted to
younger people and longer hair, and his rent went up, Kay's
business suffered. He had to let the manicurist go, as well as the
other barbers. Location scouts for movies and television came by
regularly with offers to tape and film in the shop. Kay always
declined, saying that would disrupt his customers. Increasingly, he
thought of retirement, but put the idea aside when he considered
customers like the postal worker who stopped by each morning for a
shave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows how to give a good shave anymore,'' Kay said.
``They call themselves stylists, but you ask them to give you a
shave and they don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finally closed the shop at age 78, donating its
furnishings to the museum, Kay still practiced barbering, regularly
visiting some of his old customers at their homes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Niki, and his daughter, Gloria
Galietti of Queens.

N.Y. LEGISLATURE ENDS COMMUTER TAX
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: N.J., Conn.)  (dal) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Unabashedly using its power to try to influence
an upcoming suburban election, the Legislature on Monday brushed
aside Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's protests and voted to rescind a
33-year-old tax on commuters who work in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which Gov. George Pataki said he would sign, carves
at least $210 million _ and as much as $360 million _ from the city
treasury. It was approved after legislative leaders from both major
parties, acting with surprising dispatch in a year when the Capitol
has often seemed paralyzed by partisanship, decided that a tax cut
would bolster their respective candidates in a May 25 special
election for a state Senate seat northwest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to pass the bill left even some supporters
acknowledging privately that lawmakers were perhaps not setting the
best example by altering the city's longstanding tax structure with
no hearings or study, little debate and political considerations at
the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   The measure created unusual rifts in a Legislature where party
discipline rarely breaks, pitting loyalists against one another and
urban members against suburban ones. The dissenters were
Republicans and Democrats from the city, many of whom passionately
denounced the measure.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Roy Goodman, a Manhattan Republican who is a close
ally of Giuliani, said the bill would ``go down in the annals of
this house as one of the most foolish pieces of fiscal folly ever
perpetrated on the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's prime sponsor, state Sen. Dean G. Skelos, a Nassau
County Republican, repeatedly defended the measure as an
appropriate move by the state to lighten the tax burden on suburban
residents at a time when the city enjoys a surplus of more than $2
billion and wants hundreds of million of dollars in tax cuts for
its residents and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a matter of sticking it to the city or doing
anything negative for New York City,'' Skelos said at a news
conference before the vote. ``The issue is one of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 commuters pay the tax, which is .45 of 1 percent
on earned income for most people. The bill approved Monday would
repeal the tax for New York State residents, 58 percent of the
total, who pay $210 million annually. But if the courts rule that
the tax must also end for other commuters, who mostly live in New
Jersey and Connecticut, the cost to the city could reach $360
million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York City Council, the average commuter
earns $88,000 a year, while the average city resident earns nearly
$43,000.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, whose
proposed city budgets have been upset by the sudden tax cut, vowed
to go to court to challenge it.

BORCHARD EXCELLING AT STANFORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Those who saw what Joe Borchard did this spring
know the ``S'' on his baseball hat didn't necessarily stand for
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   He hit home runs as a baseball player. He threw for touchdowns
as a football player. For three weeks, Borchard participated in
spring-football practice while also starting in left field for the
Cardinal baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   There have been many two-sport standouts at Stanford _ John
Elway is one excellent example _ but none in recent memory played
football and baseball so well over a short stretch better than
Borchard, who was a multisport standout at Camarillo High.
</P>
<P>
   During spring football, Borchard batted .475 (19 for 40) with
two homers and 14 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot realize how special that is,'' said Bill Diedrick,
Stanford's offensive coordinator. ``One Friday he runs a two-minute
drill and scores a touchdown. I give him a high-five as he's
running off and I told him, `Now go out and get a couple hits.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Borchard probably did. He is hitting .393 with nine homers and
50 RBI for the fifth-ranked Cardinal, who won the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard doesn't compare himself to Elway, who had the physical
ability to play in the major leagues. He's not Stanford's No. 1
quarterback _ Todd Husak is the returning starter _ but even
Borchard would have to admit he is one of the premier two-sport
college athletes in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He won't say it, though. His extreme humility might be his only
flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I do anything any different than anyone else,''
Borchard said. ``Sure I play football and baseball and most people
don't play two sports. It's just a matter of budgeting my time.''
</P>
<P>
   Borchard doesn't want to sound cocky. That doesn't surprise
Diedrick, who said Borchard played so well in football practice
last August he almost became the Cardinal's starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, he has the ability to play both sports at the
next level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard's two-sport career at Stanford can be defined by two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, he came off the bench late in the final minute
against North Carolina and scrambled for 41 yards to set up Kevin
Miller's 20-yard game-winning field goal.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, Borchard had a career baseball day against USC _
five hits and seven RBI. Even though Stanford lost 17-15, Cardinal
baseball coach Mark Marquess definitely remembers the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lost an eight-run lead and he comes back the very next
inning and hits a three-run homer,'' Marquess said. ``It was truly
amazing, considering the importance of the game and the timing.''
</P>
<P>
   Time is on Borchard's side. There are 12 hours of daylight,
right?
</P>
<P>
   When he was pulling double duty in April, Borchard's weekday
schedule went as follows: From 9 a.m. to noon he was in class (he
is a history major). He grabbed lunch, then went to baseball
practice for an hour before leaving for 2 o'clock football
meetings. Football practice started at 4 p.m. and ended in the
early evening.
</P>
<P>
   On baseball game days, he left football practice early.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Borchard's) makeup is great,'' Marquess said. ``He plays hard
all the time. You can't work him hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably wouldn't know what to do if he had some free
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year at Camarillo, Borchard carried the Scorpions
to the Southern Section Division III football championship. The
year before, Camarillo had won one game. The year after the
championship season, the Scorpions won one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Borchard) is a tough competitor who really wants to win,''
Marquess said. ``Players around him play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Borchard was a member of the Daily News' All-Star baseball and
football teams as a senior. He was a prized baseball prospect who
wanted a $400,000 signing bonus if he was drafted _ which he was,
by the Baltimore Orioles in the 20th round.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had power from both sides of the plate,'' said Dennis
Lieberthal, a scout for the Detroit Tigers who is based in Ventura
County. ``I knew he would hit. The only question was where he was
going to play. In high school, he wasn't a fast runner. He had an
average arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Borchard has improved defensively. Marquess said
Borchard's arm is a ``cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Borchard is concentrating on leading Stanford to the
College World Series. He said he feels as though he just arrived in
Palo Alto; he really can't believe he'll be a junior next year (he
redshirted his freshman year in football and will only be a
sophomore).
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, Borchard might be forced to choose baseball
over football. His career arc indicates he might be a possible
first or second-round draft choice in the major-league draft.
</P>
<P>
   Which way will you go, Joe?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the big question,'' he said. ``It's too early to tell
you. I have a definite role on the baseball team. With football,
I'll get time here and I'll get time there.I guess you could say
I'll talk to the (baseball) scouts and see what they
say.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

LOUIMA JURY HEARS OFFICER DESCRIBE BLOODY GLOVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A police officer testified Monday that a fellow
officer charged with torturing Abner Louima had borrowed a pair of
gloves from him, and that the gloves were returned with blood on
them. Investigators later identified that blood as Louima's.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Mark Schofield, also testified that he later heard
the defendant, Officer Justin Volpe, tell two other officers, ``I
broke a man down.'' But a defense lawyer got Schofield to
acknowledge that he did not know whether Volpe's remark concerned
Louima.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield said under questioning in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn that he had not heard what Volpe, or the officers he had
been speaking with, said before that remark and that he had not
heard the other officers respond.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came at the trial of Volpe and three other
officers charged with brutalizing Louima, a 32-year-old Haitian
immigrant, after his arrest in a street melee outside a Brooklyn
nightclub in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield said that just before he lent the gloves to Volpe at
the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn, Volpe was carrying a
``stick-like object'' toward the restroom area of the station
house, where prosecutors say Volpe tortured Louima with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield said that there may already have been blood on the
black leather gloves when he lent them to Volpe, either from
injuries that Schofield sustained in the street melee or from a
second man he had helped arrest near the disturbance. But he said
that there was more blood on them when Volpe returned them, and
that Volpe said as he handed them back, ``Thanks, sorry about the
gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution contends that the additional blood came from
Louima when Volpe, wearing the gloves, beat Louima in the restroom
and then shoved a stick into his rectum and his mouth, inflicting
major internal injuries, while a second officer, Charles Schwarz,
held Louima down.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe's lawyer, Marvyn Kornberg, has conceded that DNA testing
has shown that Louima's blood was on the gloves, but he argued in
his opening argument two weeks ago that the blood could have come
from facial injuries Louima suffered during the arrest outside the
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg got Schofield to acknowledge that it was not unusual
for a police officer to put on gloves when dealing with bleeding
prisoners, as a precaution against infection with the AIDS virus or
other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   He also got Schofield to acknowledge that the ``stick-like
object'' he had seen in Volpe's hands could have been a nightstick.
The prosecution says the stick Volpe used against Louima was part
of a broken broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg also highlighted Schofield's testimony that Volpe
dissuaded him from discarding the gloves. Instead, Schofield said,
Volpe told him to just ``rinse them off,'' which Schofield did.
Kornberg appeared to be suggesting that Volpe would not have
dissuaded him from discarding the gloves if he had done something
wrong with them.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Schwarz are among four officers being tried on charges
of violating Louima's civil rights. In addition to being charged
with torturing Louima in the station house bathroom, Schwarz and
Volpe are accused of joining the two other defendants, Thomas
Bruder and Thomas Wiese, in beating Louima in a police car before
he arrived at the station house. Prosecutors from the U.S.
attorney's office in Brooklyn say the officers mistakenly thought
Louima had punched Volpe during the street melee.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth defendant, Sgt. Michael Bellomo, is charged with trying
to cover up the beating in the police car. All the defendants
insist the charges are untrue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schofield testified that a week after Louima was injured, he
decided to tell a Police Department investigator about lending
Volpe the gloves. In the hours before he spoke to the investigator,
he said, he had two telephone conversations with Bellomo that, he
suggested, left him with the impression that the sergeant did not
want him to provide investigators with the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a bad feeling I had,'' he said, adding that the sergeant
``basically told me he didn't want to see anyone go to jail'' or
``anyone get into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo's lawyer, John Patten, has said that his client did not
take part in a cover-up attempt, but that he had told investigators
that Schofield had ``pertinent information'' about the case.

TV SPORTS: WALTON TALKS HIMSELF INTO POST-SEASON FORM
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Walton was so jazzed for a Knicks-Indiana game last month
on NBC that he held a basketball for the entire telecast. ``I
caressed it all game,'' he said Monday from Indianapolis. ``I could
never hold onto it enough.''
</P>
<P>
   A taut matchup always sends Walton further into the bosom of
basketball. Maybe that's why during the Knicks' 78-77 victory over
Miami on Sunday, Walton did not chastise anyone with his trademark
put-down, ``Oh, that's terrible!''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out players' shortcomings, but not once was anything
or anyone ``terrible,'' or one tier of judgment below, ``awful.''
Walton has toned down his harsher views lately, but not from a
sudden attack of charity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting better games,'' he said. ``In a 1-point game,
things aren't so terrible. Maybe they're ill advised. Maybe they're
awful. But I save `terrible' for game-losing plays.''
</P>
<P>
   High in the ether of his excitement, Walton creates a
provocative and self-deprecating type of analysis that combines
bluntness, loopiness and the inexplicable. Sometimes, even Walton
admits, his brain and mouth conspire against each other, and he
isn't always certain what will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   As a public service, here is The Walton English-to-English
Dictionary, featuring scraps of Sunday's analysis with translations
provided Monday:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It's not how many shots you make, it's how many shots you
take,'' Walton said, after he noted that Patrick Ewing was shooting
seven for 14.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``It's better to go five for 21 than four for
five.'' Further explanation, please: ``That's the concept I grew up
under. It's what John Wooden taught us, that you know you're
playing well by how many shots you've taken.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``As Alonzo Mourning prepares for the biggest game of his
career, it's important to recognize just how far he has come in his
Tom Wolfe novel-like life,'' he said about the Miami center during
the pre-game show.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``Alonzo's life just goes in so many directions and
keeps falling back to the center.'' As it happens to all Masters of
the Universe.
</P>
<P>
   - ``He puts his body on the line. He has the scars to prove it.
Now he's got a little bit of ice cream on the foul line,'' he said,
as Terry Porter prepared to sink the free throws that put Miami
ahead, 77-74.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``You've been out in the desert all day, bloodied,
scarred and scratched, and someone puts a delicious bowl of ice
cream in front of you. It's the easy part at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I don't know if Jimi Hendrix and Woodstock is what Latrell
Sprewell is about,'' the devoted Deadhead and child of the 60s
said.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The comment requires having seen Sprewell's new
commercial for And 1, which shows his hair being cornrowed as
Hendrix's electric version of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' plays in
the background. The formerly pony-tailed Trail Blazer said:
``Latrell's not worthy of Jimi. I didn't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   But you had to like the teamwork of Walton, Steve Jones and Tom
Hammond. Three-in-the-booth groupings are often messy and
pointless, but this trio makes it work because Walton and Jones,
former Portland teammates, offer very different analyses and
comfortably insult each other. Hammond is a straight man, who
orchestrates the conflict and commentary deftly. When placed on
separate games, Jones and Walton are rarely as good as they are in
tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Walton has also been summoned for extra playoff duty, analyzing
playoff games on TNT and TBS with Marv Albert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I turn on the TV, I see you,'' Hammond said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your worst nightmare,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   MARCIANO REPRISE
</P>
<P>
   As documented here recently, Showtime's ``Rocky Marciano'' film,
which was shown Saturday night, was riddled with errors, like a
contrived meeting between Marciano and Joe Louis in a psychiatric
hospital. Marciano died in a plane crash eight months before Louis
entered the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We admit that didn't happen,'' said Rob Cowan, the film's
producer. ``There were certain elements of license you need to take
to tell a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowan said the decision was made to alter Marciano's life by
creating a surreal, fake epiphany with Louis rather than dwell on
the facts of his final day. The movie Marciano couldn't die; he
needed a ``turn in his character literally hours before he died,''
Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Louis scene was fabricated to parallel Marciano's
emotional scene with Louis after he knocked him out in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it wrong to show that the man he hero-worshiped was
hospitalized and in a tragic situation, and that he may have gone
to visit him?'' Cowan asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is, unless the film had been labeled a work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The film used a montage to portray Marciano's amateur career as
one of goofy incompetence. A cheap shot. But Cowan changed the
truth of Marciano's first amateur bout, in which he was
disqualified for kicking his opponent in the groin. ``Did we want
to see a cheap shot at that point?'' Cowan said.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, only if it's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the real facts of the life of man, you don't need to
say, as Cowan did: ``There are a lot of accuracies in the film. But
I think the Marciano family has been pushing too hard on the
discrepancies.''
</P>
<P>
   What a concept _ lobbying for accuracy.

ON THE YANKEES: TRYING TO MAKE A FIRST-PLACE TEAM BETTER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner was host of a staff meeting after
the Yankees' game on Sunday, and as always, he wanted answers, he
wanted input, he wanted accountability, and he probably wanted to
yell at somebody. The Yankees are 21-15, good enough to win the
American League East, but they have been playing far less
effectively than anyone expected, including the players themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The most telling development of last week was the mysterious
players meeting, called after back-to-back losses to the Anaheim
Angels: either the on-field leaders of this team _ Joe Girardi is
at the fore _ see serious internal problems developing or they
overreacted, and for the Yankees' fans, neither possibility can be
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   This is a good team that can be great again, but adjustments
need to be made as they begin a three-game series Tuesday night in
Boston, with David Cone pitching against Pedro Martinez of the Red
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   THE ROSTER: Identify 25 productive and useful players for the 25
spots on the roster. The situation with the third-string catcher
Mike Figga is an embarrassment _ he is the only player who has been
on a major league roster all season who has not played in a game _
and there is a strong sense in many corners of the Yankees'
clubhouse that front-office stubbornness is hurting the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have two catchers capable of working full time,
Girardi and Jorge Posada, and there is no need for Figga.
Steinbrenner likes Figga and doesn't want to lose him, but Figga is
28, hardly a young prospect, and given his recent hibernation in
the bullpen, his skills have probably eroded. And there is a fair
chance no one would claim him on waivers, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have far greater need for an extra outfielder with
some speed (Tony Tarasco, perhaps?), someone who can pinch-run. But
if Steinbrenner continues to cling to Figga, then Don Zimmer, the
interim manager, should use him at the end of one-sided games, as
he uses Clay Bellinger and Luis Sojo; when Figga is on the team, he
should be part of the team. To operate in any other way only gnaws
at the fabric of the team.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander Tony Fossas has pitched in five games, allowing
seven of the 10 batters he has faced to reach base. The Yankees
must figure out if that is enough evidence to determine whether the
41-year-old Fossas is not good enough; if so, then get somebody
else. Dan Naulty pitched two and a third innings on Friday and two
innings on Saturday against Chicago _ a risk for someone with a
history of injury trouble _ in part because Zimmer doesn't trust
Fossas with multiple innings. The Yankees should add a pitcher they
trust.
</P>
<P>
   THE CLUBHOUSE: Re-acquire Tim Raines from Oakland. The Yankees
have missed Manager Joe Torre's steady presence, and in a similar
way, they have badly missed Raines' high-pitched cackle. Raines has
fun and manages to makes others smile even on bad days, and he
provided the Yankees with a sense of humor in recent years; last
week's slump revealed the intense Yankees as a sometimes humorless
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez, Chuck Knoblauch and others rage
inwardly, and the player considered Raines' heir as class cut-up _
24-year-old Derek Jeter _ is too young to tease and joke and force
others to take themselves a little less seriously. Raines is a
part-timer for the Athletics, with 55 plate appearances in 26
games, making a modest salary of $600,000. He is a good role
player, too, someone who could pinch-hit for Girardi or Sojo or
fill in for Shane Spencer in left field. Go get him.
</P>
<P>
   THE LINEUP: Switch Jeter and O'Neill in the batting order. Jeter
clearly is the Yankees' best hitter now, leading them in average
(.362) and extra-base hits (22), and he is mature enough to handle
the move from the No. 2 spot to No. 3 _ which will be his in a few
years, anyway. But O'Neill could be the major benefactor of this
change, because it might scare managers from always using
left-handers against O'Neill in the late innings, and he is hitting
just .139 over all against lefties, compared with .319 against
right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   On 17 occasions in the Yankees' first 36 games, opposing
managers have called on left-handed relievers to face O'Neill in
the late innings, and almost without exception they have also
allowed the reliever to pitch to the two batters who follow
O'Neill, Bernie Williams and Tino Martinez _ the logic being that
Williams, a switch-hitter, is about equal as a left-handed or
right-handed batter and that Martinez is left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Placing Jeter between O'Neill and Williams would force opposing
managers to make an extra decision, and often use another pitcher.
Sure, they could throw the lefty against O'Neill, but would they
risk leaving him in against Jeter, the Yankees' best right-handed
batter, and then Williams? Some managers would use the lefty
against O'Neill, then bring in a right-hander to pitch to Jeter and
Williams and then go back to a lefty against Martinez and the
switch-hitter Chili Davis. Since most teams aren't stocked with
three left-handed relievers, a manager would be forced to choose
between exhausting his supply of lefties or permitting an
unfavorable matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of Spencer, too, has given the Yankees a long
string of right-handed batters, from Spencer at No. 7 to Jeter at
No. 2; flip-flopping O'Neill and Jeter would break up that
grouping. Speed is not really an issue, either: O'Neill runs OK and
would not clog the bases, and Jeter could steal bases hitting ahead
of Williams, who hits more ground balls than anybody else on the
team.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULLPEN: Stick Ramiro Mendoza in the bullpen and leave him
there. Mendoza is a terrific pitcher who would have more value to
the Yankees being available every day than once every five days, as
a starter. The next time a starter gets hurt and must miss a turn,
then call up somebody from Class AAA to step into the rotation and
let Mendoza blossom in the bullpen. The bullpen has been erratic,
but there is potential for greatness. Jason Grimsley is among the
game's most dominant middle relievers right now, with his power
sinker. Opponents are batting .114 against him in his nine May
appearances, though whether he can maintain his success remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza can be great in relief, Jeff Nelson will most likely
come back healthy this week, Mike Stanton's one start seems to have
stabilized his control, and there is always Mariano Rivera, who has
converted 10 of 11 save chances.

POLITICAL STARS FAIL TO SAVE FERRARO BENEFIT
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everything was set: A room at the Yale Club was
reserved for Wednesday evening, a formal invitation was issued by
New York's two U.S. senators, and, best of all, there was the
promise of an appearance by President Clinton. It was all in the
service of helping Geraldine Ferraro raise money to pay back the
debt from her unsuccessful Senate campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night, Ms. Ferraro scrapped the $1,000-a-head
fund-raiser after determining that fewer than 100 people had agreed
to show up, a quarter of what she had hoped for, president or no
president.
</P>
<P>
   Word that the ``Salute to Geraldine Ferraro'' had been canceled
came in the form of a revised schedule issued by the White House
last night for Clinton's trip to New York on Wednesday, which had
him returning to the White House five hours earlier than had been
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fantasies of originally there being 400 people,''
Patricia Everet, the event coordinator hired by Ms. Ferraro to
organize the fund-raiser, said Monday night. ``As we got more
realistic about it, we had hoped for maybe 150 to 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just ain't happening, as they say,'' she said with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The debt was from Ms. Ferraro's campaign for Senate last year.
Although she entered the race on a burst of publicity, she went on
to lose the Democratic primary to Charles Schumer, who went on to
defeat the Republican incumbent, Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro, who was the Democratic Party's 1984 candidate for
vice president, was not available for comment Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proved to be one of the most successful fund-raisers
the Democratic Party has ever had, and New York has proved to be
one of his favorite places to gather money. But Ms. Everet and
other Democrats said that a number of forces had served to derail
this particular event, notwithstanding the star power she had
enlisted _ Clinton, Schumer, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Rep.
Nita M. Lowey of Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, they noted, it is often difficult to persuade
people to contribute money to a campaign that has already failed.
And that particularly holds true when the politician is not
expected to run for public office again. After losing to Schumer,
Ms. Ferraro announced that her years in politics were over.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Everet also said that many of Ms. Ferraro's regular
supporters had already contributed the maximum amount of money
allowed to her campaign. And Democrats in New York have long
complained that donors in the state have become exhausted by
Clinton's frequent visits to raise money in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the purposes for Clinton's trip to New York is to
attend a fund-raising luncheon for the Democratic National
Committee. The other is to attend the dedication of the
Pennsylvania Station redevelopment project.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Ferraro's disclosure statement filed with the
Federal Election Commission, her total debt from the 1998 campaign
was nearly $1 million, including $400,000 she had lent the campaign
herself and does not have to repay.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, she is required to repay the debt owed to
lenders other than herself; otherwise, it would be considered a
contribution far in excess of campaign limits. As a matter of
practice, though, such debts often linger for years, especially for
a candidate who has left politics.

HAWKS' MUTOMBO IS UP FOR THE KNICKS' CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the Knicks-Heat matchup was prime-time drama, the
Knicks-Hawks is akin to MacNeil and Lehrer reuniting. New York and
Atlanta have not played against each other in the post-season since
1971, and their current rivalry is based on a litany of
grind-it-out, halfcourt games that cause viewers to channel-surf
for Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup between Patrick Ewing, the old warrior, and Dikembe
Mutombo, the shot-blocking prodigy, when New York and Atlanta begin
their Eastern Conference semifinal series Tuesday night may seem
anticlimactic after Ewing and New York vanquished Alonzo Mourning
and Miami in the first round, a pulsating series that went down to
the last second on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Mutombo's legacy of getting knocked out before the
conference finals could change the perception going into the
series.
</P>
<P>
   During some off-seasons, Ewing has given Mourning grief about
emotionally draining playoff losses. In others, Mourning has
returned the favor. Either way, there was always a healthy dose of
trash-talk exchanged between the former Georgetown centers.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever they came back to their old campus each summer for
friendship and basketball, Mutombo could not help feeling a little
left out.
</P>
<P>
   His Atlanta Hawks were good, but as the Eastern Conference
playoffs wore on each season, the 7-foot-2-inch Congo native with
the booming baritone voice would always find himself in a designer
suit at courtside watching his fellow former Hoyas play.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he decided that this was not acceptable. ``Patrick and
I can have dinner before the game,'' Mutombo said Monday. ``We can
have an orange juice after the game. But when we come to the court,
our friendship will be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This is something special to play against someone
you know half your life and grow up with in the game. I love to see
it happen. He might be a lucky guy. He played Mourning and me in
the same year. I got to be the one that finishes him. I know that
he finished Mourning. Now I got to finish him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aging, defensive-minded and recuperating from a grueling
first-round series, Mutombo and the Hawks have much in common with
the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo will be 33 in June. The Hawks' other two marquee players
_ point guard Mookie Blaylock and shooting guard Steve Smith _ are
33 and 30, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Along with their other two starters, Ty Corbin, 36, and Grant
Long, 33, they all played more than 40 minutes in the Game 5
victory against the Detroit Pistons on Sunday. But Lenny Wilkens,
the winningest coach in National Basketball Association history, is
playing down the notion that his team may be too tired and too sore
to make this a long series.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's bench, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Anthony
Johnson, a reserve point guard, played only 10 minutes Sunday.
Allan Henderson, the team's usual sixth man, is not expected to
play after being struck in the eye in the last Sunday of the
regular season. Though Wilkens did not completely rule his
availability out, Henderson is suffering from double vision.
</P>
<P>
   After LaPhonso Ellis underwent surgery for a hernia in March,
the reserves Corbin and Long essentially became starters. Forward
Chris Crawford is expected to play despite rehabilitating a
separated right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Hawks have their positives. They gave up the fewest
points of any team in the league, and a key against the Knicks may
be their ability to not give up open shots.
</P>
<P>
   As clutch offensively as he can be, Smith is also a versatile
defender. He guarded Joe Dumars, Jerry Stackhouse and Grant Hill at
various times in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock came into the last 10 games of the season shooting only
37 percent and has clearly had one of his least-productive seasons.
But in the last 10 games, he made 40 percent of his 3-pointers and
began to move the ball around the perimeter again.
</P>
<P>
   And Mutombo is finally starting to develop an offensive game,
using drop-step moves to get closer to the basket in order to use
his jump hook. He now bends down into the post like a weight lifter
about to engage in a set of squats. He is determined not to feel
sorry for a proud but pained Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot of respect for him; that's my brother,''
Mutombo said. ``But when I'm on the floor, I do what I can to win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Game 5, Mutombo predicted that the Hawks would beat the
Pistons. At the price of getting ribbed by his off-court friends
and on-court rivals this summer, the center went out on a limb
again Monday. After all, he figures Ewing can only have bragging
rights for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will guarantee we will win the series, but it's going to be
a tough series,'' Mutombo said. ``I'm getting to the middle of my
career when I want to win something.''

 &HT;    Cesar Chavez Day approved in House
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Beginning next year, Texas will commemorate
Cesar Chavez's birthday with an optional state holiday, making the
legendary labor and civil rights leader the first Hispanic to be
honored with a Texas holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Monday followed the Senate in approving a bill
designating March 31 as ``Cesar Chavez Day.'' Gov. George W. Bush
has described the measure as a fitting tribute to Chavez, who died
in 1993, and has said he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norma Chavez, the El Paso Democrat who sponsored the bill
in the House, wiped away tears after her colleagues approved the
measure without debate. Chavez is not related to the late labor
leader but said the measure was ``spiritual and personal'' for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's environment, when we're looking for leaders who
promote nonviolent actions in a community that is filled with hate
and violence, we need young leaders to emulate someone like Cesar
Chavez, who found a different way to demonstrate his frustration,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday will be optional, meaning that state offices will
remain open but state employees can choose to take the day off with
pay in exchange for working on another state holiday, such as San
Jacinto Day, Confederate Heroes Day, or Emancipation Day. Rosh
Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Good Friday are the other optional state
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, when Chavez took the helm of the United Farm Workers
union, most Americans saw the burgeoning civil rights movement as a
black and white issue. Chavez, the son of migrant farm workers,
helped changed that.
</P>
<P>
   An advocate of nonviolence, Chavez galvanized public support on
behalf of farm workers, many of them illegal immigrants who endured
miserable work conditions. By the time he died at age 66, he was
also viewed as a leader of Hispanics living in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez began his most famous campaign in 1968, when he urged
Americans not to buy table grapes produced in California's San
Joaquin Valley until growers agreed to union contracts. The boycott
was a huge success: One poll found that 17 million Americans had
stopped buying grapes, and in 1970 growers agreed to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chavez said she hopes the optional state holiday will
eventually evolve into a full state holiday and then a national
one. California and Arizona have enacted legislation similar to
Texas' and similar bills are pending in New Mexico and the U.S.
Congress.

 &HT;    Radical effort to save endangered species pleases some, peeves
others
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Efforts to save Florida's endangered
plants and animals are taking two steps forward and, some
environmental groups say, two steps back.
</P>
<P>
   This morning in Boca Raton, U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt will sign a long-awaited federal plan aimed at rescuing 68
endangered and threatened species from extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists call it a sweeping attempt to restore wildlife and
habitat across 26,000 square miles in South and Central Florida,
from the crocodile and manatee to plants such as Small's milkpea
and the deltoid spurge. The plan, the largest of its kind ever
attempted, departs from the usual, piecemeal approach of helping
species one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   However, publicly available versions of the plan have drawn
criticism from some environmentalists, who said it lacks tough
rules and specific actions. Many of those details will await the
plan's next stage, said Jay Slack, a field supervisor for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   On a similar front, the state Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission last week adopted rules that supporters say will lead to
creation of restoration blueprints for imperiled species.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules also require the state _ for the first time _ to
consider economic costs before declaring a species endangered or
threatened. Before then, the species can be considered only a
``candidate.'' That guarantees it protection from intentional harm
but might not safeguard its habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is going backwards,'' said Brian Scherf of the
Florida Biodiversity Project.
</P>
<P>
   Game Commissioner Julie Morris disagreed. ``I think it's a
strong, positive step,'' she said of the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups said they need to know more about the federal plan
and the state rules. For South Florida, the fate of many of the
species will really depend on yet another effort: a $7.8 billion
federal plan for restoring the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sweeping federal plan ``is inherently incapable itself
in causing the changes necessary to recover most of these
species,'' said Charles Lee of the Florida Audubon Society. ``The
only way we're going to get to that is to put the Everglades in
some semblance of working order.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Estenoz, an Everglades activist for the World Wildlife
Fund, said she's still waiting for the final version of the federal
plan. ``As a concept, we're very supportive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan drew more scathing criticism from the Miccosukee Indian
tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can have all the plans in the world, but they'll just be
autopsy reports if they don't take the actions needed to help the
species survive,'' tribal consultant Joette Lorion said.
</P>
<P>
   Slack said the agency took public comments into account while
creating the plan's 2,200-page final version, which it intends to
distribute sometime this summer. The wildlife service has no
estimated price tag for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   By design, he said, the plan leaves it to scientists, landowners
and other groups to work out many details of how to help specific
species. ``We want to have all the stakeholders at the table,'' he
said.

BARAK OUSTS NETANYAHU IN A LANDSLIDE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Handing a landslide victory to Labor party candidate
Ehud Barak and his message of ``unity, change and hope,'' Israeli
voters Monday dramatically swept from office Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and rejected a campaign focused on fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this moment on, we are all together now, we are one
nation,'' Barak said at a packed rally of cheering supporters early
Tuesday. ``I intend to be the prime minister of everybody. Whatever
disagreements we have, we are brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Channel One Television gave the decorated former army
chief 58.5 percent of the votes to 41.5 percent for the Likud
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 17 percent margin of victory, based on exit polls,
was viewed as a historic mandate for Barak's left-of-center
coalition brought together under the banner of ``One Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Final results are not expected until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Within a half hour of the exit polls, Netanyahu conceded defeat
and said he was also stepping down as Likud leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tempest of the election is passing, now we have to quiet
it down. We have to also unify,'' Netanyahu told stunned and silent
Likud supporters at the party's Tel Aviv headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will lead Israel into the final phase of the peace process
with Palestinians. Monday &UR;  &LR; night, even as Katyusha rockets rained
down on northern Israel, Barak vowed to to pull Israeli troops out
of Lebanon within one year. Still, most voters focused their
concerns in this election not on security issues, but on deep
divisions within Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, voters focused on Israel's economy and a profound
rift between the religious minority and secular majority. Barak
also faces challenges in the ethnic politics that pit the
Sephardim, or Jewish immigrants from North Africa and Arab states,
against the Ashkenazim, the established European elite.
</P>
<P>
   With a turnout of nearly 80 percent of the country's 4.2 million
voters, Israelis cast ballots for what ended up as a two-way race
for prime minister after three candidates from smaller parties
dropped out in the final days. Voters also cast ballots for a new
120-member Knesset, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Barak's vow to unify the country, voting showed a
further fragmentation of the Knesset, and will pose an immediate
challenge to Barak's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the intensifying divisions along the religious-secular
lines, the strictly observant Orthodox Shas Party emerged stronger
than ever, picking up an estimated four seats in the parliament and
holding its position as the third largest party. An adamantly
secular party that was not represented in the current Knesset won
an estimated six seats.
</P>
<P>
   Yaron Ezrahi, of the Israel Democracy Institute and a political
analyst, said, ``This is a surprising and decisive edge for Barak,
which in Israeli electoral terms has to be seen as a landslide.''
</P>
<P>
   For 22 years, Israel's largest parties _ Labor and Likud _ have
traded leadership but always by only a few percent of the vote in
the parliament, a trend which continued even when Israel changed
from a parliamentary system to direct elections for prime minister
in 1996. The result has been an intense and often vitriolic
political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Barak pointedly did not attack Netanyahu despite the incumbent's
attempts to draw him into a combative political campaign. The
Israeli voters seemed Monday to express their approval of that
approach.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and European capitals, often frustrated by
Netanyahu's hard line in the peace process, swiftly welcomed
Barak's victory and his goal of breaking the deadlocked peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who had given Netanyahu several diplomatic
snubs, said, ``I look forward to working closely with Ehud Barak
and his new government as they strive to reach that goal with their
Palestinian and Arab partners.''
</P>
<P>
   After a meteoric rise to power, Netanyahu, 49, known by
supporters and detractors alike as ``Bibi,'' won an upset victory
over Labor's Shimon Peres in 1996. But Netanyahu held a razor-thin
margin of 61-59 in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was accused by critics of being held hostage by the
Orthodox and nationalist extremists within his coalition who
threatened to take down his government. The bloc of Russian
immigrant voters, led by Natan Sharansky, was particularly put off
by the Orthodox control of the Interior Ministry, which oversees
immigration. Russian immigrants turned against Netanyahu in
significant numbers on the religious issue.
</P>
<P>
   In January, some of Netanyahu's fractious former partners
finally took down the government and forced him to call early
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Reuven Hazan, a Hebrew University political science professor,
said, Netanyahu ``promised too much to too many, and ended up
delivering too little to all of them. That's why they brought him
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu also suffered a wave of defections through his tenure
from some of the most popular leaders within his coalition. Two of
them, his former military chief of staff, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, and
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, broke off to form a Center
Party. On the eve of the election, that party made a stunning and
decisive move by pulling out of the race and shifting its support
to Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, seeing the polls shifting against him in the final
weeks of the election, resorted to a campaign that emphasized
security concerns. He resurrected the images of bus bombings that
won him a narrow election in 1996. He made a dangerous and
desperate attempt to put the future of Jerusalem at the center of
debate by threatening to use force to shut down PLO offices in
Jerusalem. As the city faced an explosion of violence if the
offices were shut down, Israel's High Court ruled against
Netanyahu, and even his own supporters criticized the move as
politically motivated. Netanyahu also pointed a finger of blame at
Israel's academic elite and the left leaning media, saying they had
conspired to remove him from office. At a rally, he led a chant of
``They're afraid. They're afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Ezrahi said:``For Netanyahu this is more than
a political defeat. Bibi was coldly evicted from his office by the
Israeli people who reacted against his way of appealing to the
negative feelings of fear and anxiety and resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ezrahi added, ``It simply does not work in Israel. I think this
will put an end to the bad blood we've seen for so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Lord, a columnist for the popular daily newspaper Yediot
Ahronot and a supporter of Netanyahu, said the key to Netanyahu's
defeat was his alignment with the ultra-Orthodox parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis vote according to the current threat,'' Lord said.
``In 1996, it was terror. Tuesday, it was the threat of
theocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi became identified with Shas, and Shas posed a big theat
to the Israeli middle class. Many right-wing, secular voters
prefered somebody like Barak instead of a combination leading to
theocracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lord added that Netanyahu's achievements were considerable.
``Despite what they say, he had the materials of a great statesmen,
not a politician. He destroyed the political machine around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing before his supporters, Netanyahu said that his
hard-line policies on security had ``almost put a stop to
terrorism.'' He said he felt he had ``built the foundation for the
future of the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he would also resign from the Likud leadership, Netanyahu
added, ``I believe that the time has now come to be with my family,
with my wife and my children, and to see where my path will take
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's path to power has been meticulously crafted in the image
of his mentor and former military commander, the slain Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin, a hawk turned dove, was the
architect of the historic 1993 peace agreement. Barak expressed
reservations about Rabin's peace plan when it was formed, but still
used his close association with Rabin to help his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Barak stood at the podium, flanked by
his family and Rabin's widow, Leah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that if Yitzhak is looking down on us from heaven, then
he is proud of us, just as we are proud of him,'' Barak said. ``He
knows we, together, will fulfill his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   While he spoke some 15,000 supporters were amassing at Rabin
Square in Tel Aviv, the plaza where Rabin was shot Nov. 4, 1995, by
a Jewish religious extremist opposed to his plan. A memorial to
Rabin usually decorated with flowers and candles was swarmed with
young people wearing T-shirts plastered with Barak stickers.
Supporters danced and cheered as loudspeakers blared peace songs.
</P>
<P>
   Huge posters of a young Rabin loomed like icons over the crowd.
A banner read, ``Hope is returning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here twice in my life, when Rabin was assassinated and
the second time is now,'' said Yuval Amon, 50. ``This is a new
chance for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Lallo, 50, said, ``When Rabin was killed everything went
backwards, now we can make peace with ourselves and the Arabs. . .
. Barak will do it, but we may have to push him. He won't have a
choice but to move ahead. The light is turned back on.''

 &HT;    Jones' psychic hotline slow to catch on
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Perhaps David Felger should have consulted
his psychics before signing on Paula Jones as spokeswoman for his
Boca Raton-based dial-a-destiny hotline.
</P>
<P>
   The woman made famous for accusing President Clinton of luring
her to an Arkansas hotel suite in 1991 isn't attracting many
callers who want a fortune-teller's take on their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a horse race, we'd be off to a slow start,'' said
Felger, president of the Zodiac Group Inc., the company that runs
the Paula Jones Celebrity Psychic Network.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who this year settled her sexual harassment lawsuit
against President Clinton for $850,000, signed a contract in
February giving her a 90-day trial as a spokeswoman for the
hotline. If the calls start coming _ at $3.49 a minute _ Jones, 33,
could extend her contract for five years, said Felger, who refused
to say how much Jones is being paid.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Carpenter-McMillan, Jones' former spokeswoman, told the
New York Daily News: ``I am so, so opposed to her doing this. It's
really damaging, but hey, that's her choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gordon, who identified himself as a celebrity promoter
working with Jones in New York, said Monday the contract could be
worth as much as $350,000 for Jones, who is living with her two
sons in Arkansas. Gordon said he works on commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Paula has a big career ahead of her,'' Gordon said.
``She sings really well. We're looking at a country album.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon five years ago predicted similar country-western success
for his then-wife LaToya Jackson. The two divorced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Felger said he has advertised Jones' number in Cosmopolitan, the
Globe, the National Enquirer and True Romance . But even with a
boost from Time magazine, which ran a picture of the ad complete
with phone numbers this week, business is off to a slow start.

   ``But we're cautiously optimistic,'' Felger said. ``Like any
product looking for a celebrity endorsement you're looking for
someone who is high profile, someone who has identity with the
people you're trying to market to. But like anything in mass
marketing, it's trial and error.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Jones mystique brings in callers, Felger predicted there
could be television spots in her future.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: Will Jones become a successful psychic
diva?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Hildegard, a ``psychic'' on the network
who said she'd have to talk with Jones herself. ``I work by
voice.''

 &HT;    Bomb at prom broke up more than a dance
 &HT;    By Sonja Isger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Marvelous Washington's Palm Beach Lakes
classmates are ``walking around like zombies,'' unsure how to
comprehend the nail-studded pipe bomb that scuttled their prom
Saturday night, unsure whether they want to reschedule the dance
they'd been waiting for most of their high school years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, principals and police at five other high schools
scrambled Monday to ensure their proms wouldn't meet a similar
fate.
</P>
<P>
   School Police Chief Jim Kelly said he will review prom security
plans for Spanish River, Boca Raton, Wellington, Glades Central and
Royal Palm Beach high schools and decide how to beef them up by
midweek. That is likely to mean more police and adults at the
dances and sweeps through the buildings with bomb-sniffing dogs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to anticipate every angle we can,'' Kelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   The prom ended Saturday when a Sheraton Hotel security guard
spotted a pipe bomb in a white paper bag in a planter near the
student dance.
</P>
<P>
   School police are interviewing students, and a $2,500 reward is
offered for information leading to an arrest. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agents say they aren't certain students were
the target _ it could have been meant for hotel guests or
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb was described as a simple, potentially lethal
instrument made from parts virtually anyone could buy. The ATF sent
it to Atlanta to confirm that it was made to blow up and to check
for fingerprints, said spokesman Dale Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that it sat in a hallway planter outside the prom
ballroom very long, said Jim Bolin, the Sheraton's general manager.
He said the area is cleaned daily, security guards check the area
often and people who take care of the plants make weekly rounds.
</P>
<P>
   In case the bomb was meant for students, bomb-sniffing dogs
scoured the school before students returned to class Monday
morning, Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, students such as senior Heather Whitmore and her friends
say they are uneasy. ``We were talking about how we don't feel safe
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Students, parents and administrators have been jittery ever
since two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher in Colorado
last month. Several Palm Beach County schools have since been
evacuated after bomb threats. But the Sheraton incident was the
first time a real bomb has been found. With five more proms and
graduation coming up, the incident fueled the tension.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said security traditionally is tighter for graduation and
this year will be no different. The yearly graduation events have
long been a target of bomb threats by disaffected students.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, most students were more concerned about the proms.
</P>
<P>
   Marvelous Washington, who is president of the senior class at
Palm Beach Lakes High, still is stunned that her prom ended three
songs after it began. Monday, she asked student leaders if they
were interested in trying again. The responses were mixed, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore isn't sure she wants to return to the Sheraton, she
said. And then there's the matter of cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saved since the beginning of last year _ five bucks here,
$10 there,'' said Whitmore, who scraped together $400. ``A lot of
people couldn't afford it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Principal Nate Collins spent the morning negotiating another
night with the Sheraton Hotel in West Palm Beach. The junior class
invested $7,000 on the event. Tickets went for $50. Collins had not
worked out a date by Monday afternoon. Representatives from the
senior class said they favored a compromise _ perhaps a semi-formal
affair that wouldn't take such a toll on their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb hasn't curbed many students' determination to enjoy the
final bash of the year, most of which are scheduled for this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our prom is this Saturday and I'm crossing my fingers,'' said
Shaz Asghar, a senior at Royal Palm Beach High and president of the
countywide student council. ``It was the major talk around school
today, but plans are as usual. We feel no one at school would do
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Spanish River students said the incident barely warranted
mention in their Boca Raton halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is a concern,'' said senior Coleman Rawls,
who plans to attend Spanish River's $165-per-couple event at the
Boca Raton Resort and Club. ``We're totally different schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Spanish River senior Wesley Vaux, ``This is Boca. We can't
have bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent Peter Victoria believes Boca Raton High will keep his
daughter safe. ``They'll take the extra measures. But then, what
else are you going to do? You can't lock (the students) up. I mean,
she's 18 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Boca Raton High Principal Diana Harris already evacuated her
campus once because of a bomb threat. She doesn't want to see her
students' prom spoiled the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be held hostage by these events, but you can't
disregard them either.''

RECORD TOSS PLACES TEXAS-ARLINGTON SHOT PUTTER AMONG NATION'S
ELITE
</HEADLINE>
 CONFERENCE TRACK-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Her coach knew it was coming weeks ago.
Marsha French didn't even realize it when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take the Texas-Arlington junior long to figure out
that her best shot put of the year, a Southland Conference-record
54 feet, 111/4 inches, not only won her the conference title but
moved her into the No. 3 spot in the nation in her event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a terrible throw,'' French said. ``They told
me afterward my release was good, but my form was off and I was way
off balance. But, whatever gets it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday at Homer Bryce Stadium, the shot went farther than all
but two collegiate shot putters have put it this year. French,
whose previous best was 53-93/4, passed Leslie Vidmar of Kent
(54-83/4) on the national list but trails national leader Seilala
Sua of UCLA (56-4) and Cheree Hicks of Syracuse, who moved into
second with a toss of 56-21/2 last weekend at a meet in Chapel
Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   And with the NCAA Outdoor Championships on the horizon, more
distance might be left in French, who has also tentatively
qualified for the USA Track and Field national championships June
24-26 in Eugene, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can throw farther still,'' Texas-Arlington field events
coach Wayne Cunnings said. ``I've seen her get out more explosively
than she did on that throw. With her size and strength and speed,
it's definitely possible. Tuesday, not everything was perfect and
she still threw almost 55 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got a little more left in her for nationals. When she
gets everything right, she's going to go 57 feet. We train so
she'll throw her best at the end of the year, and here she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunnings said he knew French was due for a big throw because she
consistently has thrown 50-52 feet in practice over the past two
weeks. French, on the other hand, wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned with practice results,'' said French, who
sat out last season before transferring from Northeast Louisiana.
``It's always what you do at meets, and I hadn't done much lately.
I still feel like I'm behind because of that year off. I should be
throwing 58 or 59 feet by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Her performance Monday was more than good enough for the
Mavericks, who blew out to the expected lead in the team race,
leading second-place McNeese State 42-33 after five events. In
addition to French's victory, the Mavericks scored points with
Ashley Dorsey's third-place finish in the shot put, Monika Rolle's
second in the long jump and a 3-5 finish in the heptathlon by
Theresa Soderlund and Stephanie Willis.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-Arlington men had their problems in the field events,
scoring fewer points than expected. Matt Swain finished seventh in
the shot put, and Brandon Berger fought through hamstring injuries
to compile 6,200 points in the decathlon, but he could not crack
the top eight places. Berger also failed to make the finals in the
javelin.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Horn began to turn the tide in the long jump, reaching
24-21/2 to take third behind Marcel Williams of Stephen F. Austin,
who upset national leader Kenta Bell of Northwestern State with a
leap of 25-71/2. Horn also ran the fastest qualifying time in the
100 meters at 10.62.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-Arlington stood eighth after four events with 10 points,
25 behind first-place Stephen F. Austin and Northwestern State. The
Mavericks expect to get most of their points in Tuesday's running
finals, with two runners each qualified in the 400 _ including top
qualifier Patrick James with an SLC-best 46.85 _ the 1,500 and the
110 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The meet was suspended midway through last night's running
preliminaries. Qualifying heats for the 800 meters, 400 hurdles and
200 meters as well as finals in the women's 3,000 and the men's
3,000 steeplechase are scheduled for Tuesday morning.

IT'LL BE FRANK VS. FRANK AT WCC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A month ago, the Franks _ Sanchez at Pepperdine and Cruz at
Loyola Marymount _ both shrugged off a possible meeting in the West
Coast Conference baseball championship series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither team may make it,'' said Cruz, the head coach at LMU,
and Sanchez agreed.
</P>
<P>
   They were both wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine, ranked No. 12 and the winner of the WCC's Coast
Division, plays at West Division-winner LMU this weekend with the
winner of the best-two-of-three series earning an automatic bid to
the NCAA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The opening game is Friday at 3 p.m. Game two is Saturday at
noon, and if necessary, a third game will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great tribute to both teams to be playing for
the conference championship,'' Sanchez said. ``It's well-deserved
by both programs.''
</P>
<P>
   LMU (31-25, 18-12) clinched the West Division Sunday with a 12-3
win over Santa Clara. The Lions, who swept the Waves at home in
April to earn home-field advantage for this series, needed to win
two out of their last three games to win the division. LMU, unlike
the Waves, most likely won't receive an at-large berth if they lose
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Twelfth-ranked Pepperdine (42-12, 21-9) clinched the Coast
Division two weeks ago. Sanchez said he doesn't think the Waves
lost any momentum because they clinched so early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how you get there,'' he said, ``but that you
get there. Like (the) Super Bowl. . . Does (clinching early) help
or hurt you?''
</P>
<P>
   The first game should feature two standout sophomore pitchers.
Pepperdine's Jay Adams, a right-hander who is 9-1, became the staff
ace by midseason. LMU right-hander Billy Traber (8-5) leads the WCC
in strikeouts. Traber beat Santa Clara Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   __ Powerful statement: Even if UCLA (30-29) doesn't get an
at-large bid to the playoffs, Bill Scott's season is worth a second
look.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, a sophomore left fielder from Alemany High, led the
Bruins in batting average (.372) home runs (25) and RBI (79). His
home run total was the seventh-best in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to have a better season next year,'' said Scott,
who will play in the prospect-heavy Cape Cod League this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Scott wears No. 44 _ the same number worn by sluggers Hank
Aaron, Reggie Jackson and Willie McCovey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been 16 at Alemany,'' Scott said. ``That number was
already taken . . . and I said `Not too many people have 44.' To
wear 44 you have to have a little power. I'm going to stick with it
as long as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wright stuff: Two years after making what he called the best
decision in his life, UC Santa Barbara outfielder Brad Wright
almost hit .400.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a senior who played at both Crespi and Agoura high
schools, was batting .390 entering the Gauchos' loss at CSUN last
week. He ended at .377 with two homers and 36 RBI. He transferred
from Cal to UCSB after his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches did some things that were questionable (with my
playing time),'' Wright said. ``I didn't see myself getting a fair
shot there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Team first: Don't accuse Loyola Marymount's Matt Riordan of
thinking about personal achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan, a junior from Westlake High, was a triple shy of the
cycle entering his final at-bat last week against Cal State
Northridge. He hit a drive to the gap in right-center field, but
instead of charging to third to get the cycle, Riordan stopped at
second base for his second double of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He went 5 for 6 with five RBI in the Lions' 15-7 win.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rebirth for Anteaters: UC Irvine dropped baseball in 1992,
but it appears the program is coming back after students voted to
raise their fees $33 to support the athletic department. The sport
is expected to be reinstated for the 2001-02 school year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Showing his stuff: UCLA freshman right-hander Josh Karp, who
turned down a reported $2 million offer to sign with the Atlanta
Braves after last year's draft, was 7-3 with a 4.26 ERA this
season. Opponents batted .258 against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Karp) has tremendous presence,'' UCLA head coach Gary Adams
said. ``There are a lot of guys with a better arm than Josh Karp.
It's all about how you compete.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the horn: &UR; !off &LR;  Cal State Los Angeles senior Steve
Brown, a pitcher-infielder from Birmingham High, closed his college
career with a no-hitter against Cal State Stanislaus on April 30.
CSLA freshman third baseman Jay Caligiuri (Camarillo) batted .309
and was a California Collegiate Athletic Association honorable
mention selection. . . . USC knocked out Washington All-American
Jeff Heaverlo after five innings Sunday. Heaverlo, a projected
first-round draft pick in June, was charged with 12 runs, all
earned, on 13 hits. . . . Cal Poly SLO freshman Bryan Gant,
Chatsworth's starting left fielder last year, led the Broncos in
batting average (.374) this season. Gant, who batted leadoff for
most of the year, was 11 for 11 in stolen base attempts. . . . UCSB
shortstop Jeff Bannon, a sophomore from Camarillo High, batted .286
with 14 homers and 46 RBI this season. . . . Nevada sophomore
pitcher Matt Rainer (Royal) went 10-3 in the regular season to help
the Wolf Pack finish second in the Big West Conference and clinch a
likely at-large playoff berth. Rainer's twin brother Michael
pitches for CSUN.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis overwhelmingly elected Ehud Barak, the
Labor Party leader, as prime minister on Monday, rejecting the
tumultuous leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, whose galvanizing
character has dominated Israel for three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a complete reshuffling of the political deck, Israelis also
remade their parliament: The right wing withered as the center grew
with four new parties, changing the balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barak can now assemble a large block of secular parties,
he has the option to form a government without any ultra-Orthodox
representation. The ultra-Orthodox appear to have lost their
exclusive role as a swing vote between left and right to the
Russian immigrants and other centrists.
</P>
<P>
   By early Tuesday, with 70 percent of the vote counted, Barak was
leading with 55.7 percent of the vote, to Netanyahu's 44.8 percent.
It was the second time that Israel had elected a prime minister
directly. Barak now has 45 days in which to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   A highly decorated former general, Barak, 57, is a dovish hawk
in the image of his mentor, Yitzhak Rabin, and the vote is a
resounding call for a revival of the languishing
Israeli-Palestinian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yitzhak is looking down on us from where he may, he knows
that we together will fulfill his legacy,'' Barak said in his
victory speech. ``We need to strengthen our country's security by
moving forward to peace agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also sounded a call for unity. ``It is my intention to be
everyone's prime minister,'' he said. ``All of Israel is part of
each of us, and we extend a courageous hand to all, to secular and
religious, to those of Ashkenazi and of Sephardic background, to
those who immigrated from the former Soviet Union and from
Ethiopia, to the Arabs, the Bedouins and the Circassians.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 35 minutes of the first television exit polls, before
Barak made any public comment, Netanyahu not only conceded defeat,
but stepped down as the leader of the conservative Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian officials gloated over
the political demise of a leader whom they considered hostile and
intransigent. Israeli Radio reported open celebrations in the
office of Paesltinian leader Yasser Arafat, who called to
congratulate Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netanyahu fell into the trash bin of history,'' Fraih Abu
Meddien, the Palestinian justice minister said in an interview in
Gaza. ``He will be gone forever and good riddance. He's a racist
and no other Israeli leader will ever be as bad as he was. The
Palestinian people were patient for three years through his
arrogance. We helped bring him down. We are the ones who made this
statue fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight in Tel Aviv, a huge celebration erupted
in Yitzhak Rabin Square, the site of the late prime minister's
assassination. With mixed emotions, tens of thousands of mostly
young Israelis both cheered Barak's victory and lit candles in
honor of Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabin, we have won!'' they shouted repeatedly into the balmy
evening air, crying and hugging each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tel Aviv Hilton Hotel, a few miles away, Netanyahu, a
fixture in Israeli politics for 15 years, strode off the political
stage quickly, cleanly, and with cordial congratulations to his
opponent. Flanked by his wife, Sarah, and by a grim Ariel Sharon,
his foreign minister, Netanyahu, with a serene look on his face,
addressed weeping supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation decided and we respect that decision,'' Netanyahu
said, stunning his audience, which is unaccustomed to the sight of
their prime minister conceding anything. ``That is the way it has
to be in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's Likud Party, traditionally one of the two major
parties of Israel, suffered from his collapse at the polls.
Netanyau's Likud coalition held 32 seats in 1996, and the party was
down to about 20 with slightly fewer than half the votes counted.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the defectors left for Shas, the ultra-Orthodox
Sephardic party. In a stunning gain, Shas seemed to have garnered
six new seats in the new parliament, giving it about 17, making it
the third largest party after Likud and Labor, election analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger representation does not mean more power. ``Shas is
in for four lean years now,'' Shahar Ilan, a religion reporter for
the newspaper Haaretz said Monday, ``whether it is a barely wanted
coalition partner or whether it remains outside.''
</P>
<P>
   While Shas had endorsed Netanyahu, it has swung between left and
right governments before as a supporter of the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   But in these elections and probably in the new parliament,
Russian immigrants, who seem to have split their ballots between
the two candidates, represented the swing vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resisted all efforts to take sides,'' Natan Sharansky,
leader of the Russians' Yisrael Baaliyah Party, said in an
interview. ``We were the party of the new immigrants, but now we
can be considered simply as the one real moderate force, like a
bridge between secular and nonsecular, left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Look, I'm sorry for Bibi, we're old friends.'' He
said the defeat of Netanyahu was ``mainly personal, not
ideological.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of Netanyahu's defeat was not merely a rejection of
him, but of the right wing's perceived obstructionist agenda on the
peace effort. Most Israelis not only endorse the peace effort, but
accept that a Palestinian state is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the prime minister's office,
President Clinton sent Netanyahu a message: ``I appreciate the hard
work you did. You're a strong man with a strong historical
awareness and we all believe you will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Also according to the statement, Netanyahu responded, ``Thank
you very much but I'm taking a long vacation.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis were driving through the streets beeping their
horns, or popping the corks on champagne bottle. ``As soon as Bibi
said he was resigning, the champagne came out as did the
pistachios, cake and popcorn,'' said Lisa Feinmesser, 51, an
administrative assistant in Jerusalem. ``We're so sick of the
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking drawn and defeated, Gila Gamliel, a 24-year-old Likudnik
who lost her bid for parliament, said, ``Despite the great
accomplishments of the government, everyone was against us and
against the prime minister out of personal hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   A kibbutz-born Israeli who spent 35 years in the army and
retired as chief of staff, Barak is brainy and complex. He has
confidence in his own judgments, which are based, like those of any
serious military strategist, as much on input as intuition. Friends
say he is his own best counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He has conducted his campaign like a military exercise. Building
on a network of army buddies, he revitalized the Labor Party's
aging infrastructure with a far more professional campaign on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also relied on layers of American consultants, including
two top American pollsters, who field-tested every question raised
by Barak about the mood of the Israeli public and the sectors
within it.
</P>
<P>
   He personally sought to commandeer a remake of the Labor Party,
which is traditionally both leftist and elitist in a peculiarly
Israeli combination, into a party of the center. He ran at the head
of the One Israel coalition, forged with Meimad, a moderate
Orthodox group, and the Sephardic Gesher Party of David Levy, the
Moroccan-born former foreign minister of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   As a moderate at the helm of the left, he sees himself following
the lead of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's political advertising has stressed his military
background, which includes a string of derring-do missions that are
an integral part of Israeli legend. His campaign has repeatedly
broadcast images of him liberating a Sabena airplane from
Palestinian terrorists, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, he has said he would move quickly to kick start
the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, to plan the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, and to reopen
negotiations with Syria over Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Before the elections, many Israelis said they considered Barak
and Netanyahu to be cut from the same cloth, as Ashkenai members of
the elite who both served in the same elite military unit and both
studied in the United States. Israelis said they were confused
about what differentiated the candidates' stand on peace, since
both said they supported a tough peace with security.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men hold very different views about Israel's
relative position in the Mideast, which fundamentally shape
different approaches to peacemaking. Netanyahu believed Israel to
be in a constant state of threat from its Arab neighbors,
approached them with suspicion and refused to make concessions
until concessions were given.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, on the other hand, sees Israel as the strongest country
in a tough neighborhood, negotiating from a vantage point of
greater military might, higher economic standing and a sounder,
more democratic political system.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks peace agreements must be reached before conditions are
perfect, and that relationships should be sown to encourage
cooperation on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give a new momentum to peace agreements,'' he said
in an interview in April. ``I'm not going to compromise any of our
vital interest. I will definitely fight against terror, I did it
all my life. But I learned during many years, decades of fighting
that the right way to bring about personal security to Israelis and
overall security to Israel is through peace agreement with our
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Four and a quarter million Israelis voted, almost all the adults
in the country. Voter turn-out is always high here. Statistics say
it is 80 percent, but, given that about 10 percent of the
population lives abroad and there are no absentee ballots, the
figure is closer to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Israelis have been arriving from abroad to vote,
too.

WHITE HOUSE PLEASED WITH RESULTS OF ISRAELI ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add 10 grafs, beginning: Last month, Clinton ...)  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration greeted the results of
the Israeli election on Monday with public decorum, congratulating
the winner, Ehud Barak, but with private satisfaction that Benjamin
Netanyahu had lost.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's relations with Netanyahu started off poorly
and deteriorated to the point where Clinton snubbed the Israeli
leader during a visit by him here two years ago. Their personal
differences were barely papered over during tortuous negotiations
last October that ended in a modest pact brokered by Clinton
between Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when exit polls showed Barak likely to win by a large
margin, a senior administration official noted approvingly that
Israeli commentators were calling the results a ``blowout,'' the
Israeli term for a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the last Israeli election, when Clinton embraced
Shimon Peres as the best hope for peace, exulted in early polling
that predicted his victory and then was disappointed and
embarrassed to find he had backed a loser, the administration
remained circumspect about this race.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton looked on as three of his own best campaign
advisers, led by James Carville, moved to Israel and helped Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton telephoned both Netanyahu and Barak late Monday
afternoon. In a statement afterward, Clinton said he reaffirmed to
Barak that he would ``work energetically for a just, lasting and
comprehensive peace that strengthens Israel's security.'' Vice
President Al Gore called Barak early Monday evening from a hotel
room in Boston and later called Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   In the fairly grim landscape of Clinton's foreign policy
problems at the moment, Barak's victory came as good news.
</P>
<P>
   He is perceived by administration officials as a military figure
of stature who will be more conducive than Netanyahu to dealing
with the final phase of talks with the Palestinians, the critical
negotiations that will help define Israel's future.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have also said that Barak, with his
military background, is different in outlook than the former Labor
Party leader, Shimon Peres. Barak, they have said, will be
steadfast in ensuring that Israel's security is protected as the
peace process moves forward.
</P>
<P>
   It was too early to tell how soon the process, originally set
out in accords made in Oslo in 1993 and 1995 and then last October
at Wye, Md., would resume, a senior administration official said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Clinton tried to edge the process along by sending a
letter to Arafat warning him against unilaterally declaring a
Palestinian state but going further than before toward endorsing an
eventual Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   In that letter, Clinton said the United States was prepared to
convene a new set of peace talks within six months after the
Israeli elections. With Barak the winner, those talks _ to address
critical outstanding questions like the status of Jerusalem,
security relations between Israel and the Palestinian entity, the
future of refugees and regional water rights _ are now likely to be
convened sooner than six months, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Netanyahu government spells the end of some of
the most acid moments in personal relations between Israeli and
American leaders. Clinton and Netanyahu did not get along, and
neither did Netanyahu and the secretary of state, Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   During her first visit to Israel as secretary of state in
September 1997, Albright said in a speech in Jerusalem that a
``time out'' was needed on new Jewish settlements. At a private
dinner afterward at his home, Netanyahu angrily criticized her
comments as one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   On her departure the next day, Albright said she would not
return ``to tread water'' on progress toward peace, and she made
clear that she did not believe that Netanyahu was serious about
carrying out the Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
   From December 1997 to February 1998, Albright held three rounds
of talks, separately, with Netanyahu and Arafat, trying to restart
the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   During that period and in later months, when the groundwork was
laid for the summit meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat last
October, the administration complained that Netanyahu was a
difficult negotiating partner for a simple reason. When Labor was
in power, administration officials said, Washington's approach was
often to take ideas offered by the Israelis and sell them to
Arafat. But with Netanyahu, there was nothing to work with or to
sell, they said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the Wye River talks, enough common ground had
been found for steps to promote fulfillment of the agreement on
limited Palestinian self-rule signed more than three years before.
But the steps that Netanyahu and Arafat agreed to in the ``land for
security'' talks were put on hold by the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's victory essentially makes the role of United States as
mediator easier. Once he forms a government, administration
officials are expected to start immediately laying the groundwork
for resumed peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   They will be dealing with a government backed by a broad
spectrum of opinion that opinion polls indicate accepts the
inevitability of a limited Palestinian quasi-state in most of the
West Bank and Gaza.

A MACHO LITERARY UPDATE FROM A BIG-GAME HEALER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JOYCE WADLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You think you're traveling too much for work?
Consider the life of Dr. William B. Karesh, a wildlife
veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   January, shlepping his usual 220 pounds of medical equipment, it
was down to a Kaa-Iya National Park in Bolivia to advise about
animal handling techniques, then to Patagonia to inspect seals and
sea lions. March, it was the Central African Republic, to help
develop preventive health care for gorillas. Then the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, to anesthetize the 600-pound antelopes
called Bongos (right, Bongos in the Congo) and put on radio
collars.
</P>
<P>
   There are also those unscheduled trips, as when Karesh was in
Congo last fall and got word of trouble in Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a big die-off'' _ this is zoological lingo for many
animals dying off _ Karesh says. Gazelles. ``Probably tens of
thousands of carcasses at 30 below zero. We get up, the sun is low,
they're out there frosted with snow.''
</P>
<P>
   A pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like powdered sugar. Everything was frozen. With the wind
chill, it was 80 degrees below.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not. I love to exaggerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearied, ladies, of those New York fellows who can brag only
about bagging an account? You might be interested in Karesh, 44,
who has been chased by elephants, bitten by penguins, nibbled by
leeches, and who, given his rather melancholic reports of love in
the wild, might be interested in you.
</P>
<P>
   An internationally recognized expert on wildlife conservation
and disease, Karesh, whom everyone calls Billy, heads the Field
Veterinary Program of the Wildife Conservation Society, which, in
addition to managing New York City's zoos, supports 300 research
projects worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of his home base at the Bronx Zoo (his actual home
is an apartment on City Island, furnished with a 15-year-old couch
and a chair he got when his mother moved _ you get the picture?),
he travels the world. When he's in New York, you might find him
outside his office at the zoo, shooting empty darts at targets on
the wall of the Wildlife Conservation Building, darts being used to
anesthetize animals or do medical biopsies.
</P>
<P>
   Karesh has also written a book, ``Appointment at the End of The
World,'' (Warner Books), which will be published next month.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance it looks to be that increasingly rare literary
species, the manly memoir. The dedication lists half a dozen
women's names, including Chloe no accent ``somewhere out there in
Africa, who recently reminded me of what a wonderful world we live
in.'' There are many photos of Karesh, biceps bulging, in
sleeveless khaki vests. And an opening that could figure in a
Hemingway contest:
</P>
<P>
   ``Loaded with a heavy backpack, I'm holding a rifle in my right
hand as I inch forward on the hard, dry ground. Forty yards ahead
is a herd of elephants, each animal weighing a few tons or more. A
startled, shiny brown seven-foot-long cobra . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Additional reading reveals a modest and generous voice.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the book, Karesh seems uneasy about the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It was his editor who demanded he personalize his own work,
Karesh said at a publishing party at the St. Regis Hotel last week,
and who also did a search with the computer, ``replacing we, we, we
with I, I, I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a computer,'' the editor said proudly, at the sidelines.
``It was me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a bench outside his office, having a slice of pizza,
Karesh reiterates.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do this work alone, he said as his colleagues,
strolling by and seeing a reporter, give him the too-casual glance
that a lion passing another's kill might convey. Karesh broods. His
colleagues are going to hate him, he says. That editor. She said he
had to be a character.
</P>
<P>
   The bulging bicep pictures?
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave her 300 photos,'' Karesh says, ``Those are the ones she
chose. They gave me a lot of money, I figured I had to do what they
told me.''
</P>
<P>
   The macho consideration:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get a big rush being close to an elephant, but I don't
get closer than I need to be. I swear what feels the best is
helping people help animals.''
</P>
<P>
   The macho consideration, continued:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just the doofus that does this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He always has, you might say. As a child in Charleston, S.C.,
(mother was an artist, father owned clothing stores) William Karesh
rescued orphaned birds and squirrels so regularly that The
Charleston Evening Post wrote an article about him. He got his
veterinary degree at the University of Georgia. Ten years ago he
was hired to start the Field Veterinary Program. He loves the life,
except for the aforementioned problems with romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can meet a woman, be deeply in love with them, then we have
to physically part ways because of the work,'' Karesh says. ``A
month or two later, I hear she's fallen in love with somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the ladies, what of Chloe, ``somewhere in Africa''?
</P>
<P>
   She's an elephant. Karesh and a Wildlife Conservation Society
team found her in the Central African Republic, anesthetized her
and attached a radio collar.
</P>
<P>
   She ended up 100 miles away in her search for food, causing a
logging company to limit cutting in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the emotional part of being way out in the jungle and
being able to touch her and work with her and have us help her help
her species just really touched me.''

PUBLIC LIVES: THE DUKE'S CREW AND DR. CREW TOO 
BACKSTREET BOYS MEET PET FOOD GUY 
A LITTLE `RAGTIME' IN THE CHAPEL 

</HEADLINE>

THE DUKE'S CREW AND DR. CREW TOO 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never mind the trumpet. Wynton Marsalis was singing
and playing the piano. His cousin, Maurice Shelton, a chef from New
Orleans, was cooking Louisiana-style gumbo, red beans and rice.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis' apartment on the Upper West Side was crowded. The
musician and actor Don Cheadle was there. So was the Lincoln Center
Jazz Orchestra, which had just played at Alice Tully Hall, the last
stop on a 36-city tour in celebration of the Duke Ellington
centennial.
</P>
<P>
   So was Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, whose father was a
clarinetist and played occasional gigs with Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a big supporter of our kids,'' Dr. Crew said of
Marsalis, ``and he's been a moral support to me, practically from
the day I got here.''
</P>
<P>
   BACKSTREET BOYS MEET PET FOOD GUY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If only someone had made some introductions first.
Leonard N. Stern, meet the Backstreet Boys. Boys, meet Stern, chief
executive of a pet food and publishing conglomerate that also has
substantial real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Stern wondered why all the fuss. There he was,
waiting for the lights to go down at the premiere of ``Star Wars:
Episode One _ The Phantom Menace'' on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``First thing, a big, big security guard comes over and says,
`Move out of your seats,''' Stern said. ``I looked at the guy like
he's crazy. I said, `I'm not going anyplace.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then these perfectly nice guys sit down,'' he said. ``They
were wearing what I thought was funny-looking clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then fans clamoring for autographs swarmed around them. The
autograph they were clamoring for was not Stern's. ``The girls
would look and put their hands on their mouths and do what in my
day they did for Frank Sinatra or Elvis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Stern struck up a conversation. ``I said, `What do you
do for a living?' My wife gave me a good kick. She knew. I was
sitting next to a big blond guy. He wasn't upset at all.''
 &QL; 
A LITTLE `RAGTIME' IN THE CHAPEL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alton Fitzgerald White played two matinees on Sunday.
The first _ 22 miles from Broadway, where he stars as the pianist
Coalhouse Walker Jr. in the musical ``Ragtime'' _ was his debut at
the Brookville Reformed Church on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   How did he get from Broadway to Brookville? Last year, White
attended a friend's wedding at the church, liked the vibes and
struck up a friendship with the pastor, the Rev. Allan B. Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't singing to a standing-room-only crowd on Sunday
morning. There were only about 100 worshipers on hand. Many of the
seats at the front of the 267-year-old chapel were empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the theater, the orchestra seats are the more expensive
ones,'' Ramirez said. ``Here you can have orchestra seats and you
don't have to pay a high price.''
</P>
<P>
   First White stood in the aisle and sang ``Make Them Hear You''
from ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can sing, but God gives you the quality of your
voice,'' he said. ``He gave me a beautiful voice and I fell in love
with the applause.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he delivered one of the soul-searching poems he composes
between scenes in his dressing room at the Ford Center for the
Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The church debut, he said, was a good warm-up for his afternoon
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is about hope and faith and courage and justice,'' he
said. ``The show is like a sermon. It really is.''

PRESSURE ON WHITMAN MOUNTS FOR NEW CURBS ON ABORTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Connecticut, New York)   (dal) 
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Hoping that the political pressure of a Senate
race will cause Gov. Christie Whitman to yield on the issue,
Assembly Republicans have begun their most promising effort yet in
a decade-old fight to require parental notification before an
abortion can be performed on a minor.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly's Judiciary Committee has scheduled hearings on
Thursday for the legislation, and even some Democrats concede in
private that the proposal has enough support not only to sail
through the committee but to win approval in the full Assembly by a
veto-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has yet to take a position on the parental notification
legislation, but since becoming governor, she has developed a
national reputation as a moderate Republican and she favors
abortion rights. And in 1997, she incurred the wrath of many
conservatives when she vetoed a measure banning a form of late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The notification bill is sponsored by Assemblyman John E. Rooney
and Assemblywoman Marion Crecco, with a dozen cosponsors, and, most
important, has the solid backing of the speaker, Jack Collins. In
the State Senate, which is also under Republican control, the
legislation is being sponsored by Sen. Gerald Cardinale and Sen.
Anthony R. Bucco and has at least a half-dozen cosponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require doctors to notify a parent or guardian
before performing or inducing an abortion on an unmarried girl
under 18. Doctors would be required to notify a parent either
personally or by certified mail, and an abortion could not be
legally performed until at least 48 hours after the parent has been
notified. The girl would be allowed to petition a Superior Court
judge for a waiver of the notification if she is a victim of abuse,
cruelty or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who performs an abortion in violation of the law would be
subject to fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 and could be sued by
the minor's parent.
</P>
<P>
   At least 29 states, including neighboring Pennsylvania, require
some form of parental notification or counseling before a minor can
receive an abortion. And there have been repeated attempts in most
of the other states to pass similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, there have been various attempts to pass a
parental notification bill in New York, and none of them have come
close to succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, a girl under 16 cannot obtain an abortion
without receiving counseling from a physician, nurse, physician's
assistant or a qualified counselor who must explain the alternative
choices for managing the pregnancy, including adoption and
abortion. The counselor must also discuss the possibility of
involving the girl's parents in the decision, but notification of
the parents is not required.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have consistently shown that most New Jersey residents
back the right of a woman to have a legal abortion. But in an
attempt to establish a beachhead in the fight over the issue,
anti-abortion forces have tried since 1989, without success, to get
a parental notification bill through the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   There are circumstances that make the looming fight markedly
different than the previous ones over the issue. It will be the
first time that the proposed legislation has reached a committee
for a hearing, a sign that supporters believe that they may finally
have the votes to muscle the bill onto the Assembly floor, where it
would have a good chance of passing with the help of Collins.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the more recent fights over abortion, most notably
the raucous debate in 1997 over the late-term procedure that
opponents call partial birth abortion, abortion rights supporters
have counted on a powerful group of political allies, starting with
Mrs. Whitman, to stave off any serious encroachments.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, abortion opponents have changed their strategy,
toned down the oratory and are counting on some fortuitous timing
to help clear the path. They believe that Mrs. Whitman, who came
under blistering attack from conservatives when she vetoed the
late-term abortion bill in June 1997, may be hard pressed to risk
rekindling that anger as she prepares to seek the Republican
nomination for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parental notification is a moderate position, and if the
governor is smart, she will sign this bill,'' said Marie Tasy,
director of public and legislative affairs for New Jersey Right to
Life. ``I think a majority of people in New Jersey, including some
who are pro-choice, support the idea of parental notification. It
is only a minority of abortion extremists that oppose this type of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Senate has a much more significant core of moderate
Republicans than the Assembly, but its leader, Donald T.
DiFrancesco, shares some of the same political pressures as Mrs.
Whitman. As president of the Senate, DiFrancesco is next in line in
succession for governor (New Jersey has no lieutenant governor),
and he would complete the final year of Mrs. Whitman's second term
if she was elected to the Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco, a moderate who supports abortion rights, has
already said that he will seek the governorship on his own in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that DiFrancesco will take a stance on the issue
until after the Assembly acts. And although the legislation has a
base of support among some Senate Republicans, the outcome in that
chamber is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   Leading one of the most strident lobbying efforts on behalf of
the notification bill is New Jersey Right to Life. Founded in 1972
and claiming a membership of 125,000 households, it is the oldest
and largest anti-abortion organization in the state.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Senate's failure to pass a hate-crimes law
named after dragging-death victim James Byrd Jr. was a slap in the
face to his family, nephew Darrell Verrett said Monday in a
telephone interview with The Austin American-Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed and angry, members of Byrd's family have scheduled
a news conference today in Jasper and have pledged to return to
Austin as often as necessary to get a stronger hate-crimes law
approved in Texas. But they don't plan to directly blame Gov.
George W. Bush for the bill's failure even though the governor took
strong criticism for not publicly injecting himself into the
emotional debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him personally if he would use his influence to help
pass the bill,'' Verrett said of the governor. ``He told me, `No.'
We just have to accept that and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Saturday he did offer suggestions for compromise
before the proposal ran out of time for Senate consideration
Friday. Earlier, the governor had said only that he would consider
the bill if it cleared the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal named after Byrd, a black man dragged to his death
in Jasper last year, would have made it more serious to commit
crimes against people because of bias against specific
characteristics, including gender, race and sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family, mainly my grandparents, want to express their
disappointment at how the hate-crimes legislation was handled,''
Verrett said. ``We're more angry now. Even though Texas is the site
of the most terrible hate crime recently, it still doesn't see fit
to have stronger hate-crimes legislation. It's like a slap in the
face for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' current hate-crimes law makes it more serious to commit
crimes against people based on bias. Supporters of the proposed
Byrd Act say the law is too vague and needs strengthening and
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Verrett said although the family doesn't plan to point fingers
or assign blame for the bill's fate, he believes the proposal would
have fared better if Bush weren't expected to begin running for
president after the legislative session. The inclusion of sexual
orientation as one of the protected groups could have presented
problems for Bush in the Republican presidential primary, but Bush
said that was never his problem with the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Verrett said the bill would have helped his family to reach
closure on his uncle's brutal death. Because the men accused of
Byrd's slaying face the death penalty _ one already has been
convicted and sentenced to death _ the Byrd Act would not have
applied. Verrett said it might have prevented future hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want any family going through what we have,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, sponsored the proposal and
has helped the family organize today's news conference, which will
include Stella Byrd, James Byrd's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said she's given the family no advice or direction on
what to say, adding that family members are shocked that the bill
did not pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shock caused them to want to say something about
it,'' Thompson said. ``They recognize that the persons that are
accused of causing the demise of their uncle are going on trial and
they are going to get some justice. But I think they looked at this
bill as a deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have helped,'' Verrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Verrett also said that Byrd family members will return to Austin
for the next legislative session and for as many sessions as
necessary to get stronger hate-crimes legislation passed.Juan B.

ON BASEBALL: PITCHING (YES, PITCHING) HAS RED SOX BATTLING YANKS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost by way of introduction, Jose Offerman would begin spring
training interviews by saying, ``I'm not Mo Vaughn.'' It was not a
line from a comedy routine like the one that gave the Broadway play
``I'm Not Rappaport'' its title. The newest member of the Boston
Red Sox was simply explaining that no matter how much the team paid
him, he was not going to hit home runs and drive in runs the way
Vaughn did.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman has contributed significantly to the Red Sox offense,
but he was right. He hasn't been Mo. No one in Boston has. The Red
Sox don't have a hitter in the top 10 in batting average, on-base
percentage, slugging percentage, home runs, runs batted in, runs
scored or total bases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Red Sox, for six weeks at least, have fooled a lot of
purported experts, and they've done it on the part of the Dan
Duquette plan that few people bothered to notice. It's called
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Remember pitching? Some readers may not be old enough to
remember when teams had pitching. Very few do now. The Red Sox
happen to be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good pitching staff, you should be able to
contend,'' Duquette, the Red Sox general manager, said. ``You look
on that scoreboard every night and see teams scoring more than 10
runs. The strength of our club is the pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fenway Park Tuesday night the Yankees will see the strength
of the Red Sox strength. They will face Pedro Martinez, who is as
good and as overpowering a pitcher as baseball has today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for Pedro Martinez,'' Duquette said. ``He's just
been brilliant every game out.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 7-1 record, a 1.81 earned run average and 91 strikeouts
(30 in his last two starts), Martinez is the class of the American
League. Not only does he lead the league in victories and
strikeouts and is second in ERA (behind David Cone, whom he opposes
Tuesday night), but he also leads in fewest walks per nine innings
(1.7) and has the third-lowest opponents' batting average (.202).
</P>
<P>
   If that's not daunting enough for a team to anticipate, Martinez
has an impressive new playmate who will start the second game of
the three-game series with the Yankees. He is Juan Pena, 22 years
old next month, and a native of the Dominican Republic, like
Martinez, though by way of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox promoted Pena from the minor leagues after Bret
Saberhagen, who himself had been pitching well (2-1, 1.75), went on
the disabled list with a strained muscle in his right shoulder. In
two starts, the right-handed rookie has allowed one run and struck
out 15 in 13 innings for a 2-0 record and 0.69 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave the ball club a lift by giving us those quality
innings in his first two starts,'' Duquette said by telephone from
Boston yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the offense Offerman and Nomar Garciaparra and some
others have provided, and the Red Sox are in a position few
expected them to be at any time this season. It's a good enough
start to make a man feel vindicated. Does Duquette?
</P>
<P>
   ``From what?'' he responded. ``I didn't do anything to be
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   During the winter no general manager was more maligned than
Duquette. No team suffered greater abuse than the Red Sox. ``We
couldn't figure that out,'' he said. ``We did have a decent year
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won the wild-card spot in the playoffs last season
even though they finished 22 games behind the Yankees. They beat
Cleveland in the first game of their series, then led in each
subsequent game but lost the next three. Then they botched the
Vaughn re-signing and lost him to the California Angels, and the
criticism cascaded.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Sunday morning dawned, they were tied for the first
place with the Yankees, whom they play three times both this week
and next. And they could easily be ahead of the Yankees had Tom
Gordon, their exceptional closer with saves in 47 consecutive
opportunities, not strained his elbow. He is back, but his
substitutes squandered 8 saves in 16 chances.
</P>
<P>
   What does this all mean? Are the Red Sox a pretender or
legitimately a contender? Can their pitching _ it could get even
better after the All-Star Game break when Ramon Martinez, Pedro's
older brother, completes his recovery from shoulder surgery and
joins the rotation _ carry them through the next four and a half
months?
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, has
talked recently about 1978 more than he ever has since that
disaster of a season for the Red Sox, whom he managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Boston,'' Zimmer declared the other day, looking
forward to this trip. He also told about renting Bucky Dent's house
in Wyckoff, NJ, in 1983 when he joined the Yankees as a coach. The
house, he said, perhaps exaggerating, had shaggy white carpet and a
picture in every room of Dent hitting the playoff-game home run
that killed him and the Red Sox in '78.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw Dent, Zimmer related, ``I told him I took the
pictures and put them face down and I spit tobacco juice on the
shag carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Zimmer feels so liberated from that nightmarish season,
is he in for another psychic jolt? Could this be the year the Red
Sox get their revenge for 1978, knocking off the Yankees when they
thought they were invincible masters of the baseball world?
</P>
<P>
   What a devilish thought to muse upon as the Red Sox and the
Yankees play each other this week and next. &QL;

   MILWAUKEE _ At halftime of the United States' 5-0 exhibition
victory over the Netherlands on Thursday, Michelle Akers approached
Coach Tony DiCicco and said, ``I have to come out.'' Nothing more
was said, and DiCicco immediately found a replacement. Akers had a
familiar flushed, hollow look of exhaustion. After so many years
together on the soccer field, DiCicco can read her face as if it
were an X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Akers broke the first ground for women's soccer in America. She
scored the first goal for the national team, produced both American
goals in the victorious final of the inaugural Women's World Cup in
1991 and earned the first contract for a shoe endorsement. She is
chasing her teammate Mia Hamm to become the leading scorer in the
history of the game, male or female. But her success has come at a
great cost in injury and illness, and in recent years she has
seemingly spent as much time in the emergency room as the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   Her knees are latticed with the scars of so many operations that
she has lost count _ 10, 11, 12, she can't remember. She still has
the remnants of a black eye and numbness in her cheek and mouth
after breaking three bones below her left eye in a head-on
collision with another player in February. And since 1991 she has
struggled with chronic fatigue syndrome, which leaves her with
debilitating migraines, low blood pressure, memory loss, dizziness,
bouts of vomiting and an overwhelming feeling of lassitude.
</P>
<P>
   While her teammates celebrated at a University of Georgia
sorority house upon winning the 1996 Olympic gold medal, Akers'
only liquid refreshment came intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel empty, and I can't recover no matter what I eat or
drink, or how much I rest,'' Akers said recently, describing her
symptoms as she slumped on a couch in the lobby of the Milwaukee
Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, she is struggling to find a measure of durability for the
1999 Women's World Cup, which begins on June 19. Somehow, Akers
finds a way to keep going, and even when she is running on fumes,
her game is marked by fierce determination. In the heat of the
Atlanta Olympics, she managed to play the full 90 minutes in four
of five games, and she sent the United States' semifinal match into
overtime with a penalty kick against Norway. Whatever she can give
during the World Cup, DiCicco said, he will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michelle is the first player that created universal acceptance
of the women's game,'' DiCicco said. ``People like Pele and Franz
Beckenbauer, they saw her play and realized that women could play
the game as skillfully and tactically proficient as men could. The
way she heads passes. Her shot is incredibly hard with long-range
accuracy. She can put a player onto the ball with 40-yard passes,
right- and left-footed, and score a goal from 25 or 30 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates call her Mufasa, after the ``Lion King''
character, because of her mane of brown curls, and they tease her
about her forgetfulness. But they also know that she planted the
seeds for what has become a bountiful harvest of women's soccer.
The game is popular enough now that Hamm does commercials with
Michael Jordan and has her own signature Barbie doll. The Americans
dream of selling out the 93,000-seat Rose Bowl for the World Cup
final on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``She taught us what it's like to be professional,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   The national team's co-captain, Julie Foudy, added, ``She leaves
her heart and soul on the field, along with a few teeth and bone
chips.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers joined the women's national team upon its founding in
1985. Financing for the team seemed to come from the proceeds of a
parking meter. There were no salaries, only $10-a-day meal money,
$15 for top players. While training for their first road trip, to
Italy, Akers said, the American women were housed not in a plush
hotel but in a college dormitory along with the participants in a
high school cheerleading camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We woke up to cheerleaders yelling their heads off,'' Akers
said.
</P>
<P>
   She scored the team's first official goal on that trip, and six
years later she pounded home 10 goals in 6 games of the 1991 World
Cup, including two in the 2-1 victory over Norway in the final.
Before the tournament, she split one of her knees open by falling
on a sprinkler during training. The wound required 35 stitches and
left her knee seamed like a baseball. A doctor warned Akers that
the wound might split open upon hard contact, but she played anyway
and scored more goals than anyone else. She is one of only four
women who have scored at least 100 career goals, with 102. The
others are Mia Hamm and Elisabetta Vignotto, with 107 each, and
Carolina Morace, with 105. Vignotto and Morace, both Italian, are
retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style of living is to jump in wholeheartedly and leave it
all hanging out,'' Akers said. ``I'm either going to crash big time
or I'm going to celebrate big time.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the low-post pummeling at forward, the 5-foot-10-inch,
150-pound Akers has moved to the defensive midfield, where she can
still control a game with her calm presence, her ability to spray
passes to her teammates and her resolve to control air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the World Cup is not her talent, but her
stamina. Akers said she had tried antidepressants and birth-control
pills in an attempt to stimulate her blood pressure, but she
reacted adversely to both. Other medication that might help her is
banned as performance-enhancing.
</P>
<P>
   She is trying to maintain her health through diet and rest. She
carries water to remain hydrated and she avoids dairy products, to
which she is allergic. Although she paved the way for endorsements
for her teammates, Akers is the only star on the team currently
without a shoe contract, refusing to expend excessive energy on
public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' Akers said. ``This is
day by day. I can only do the best I can to conserve energy and
prepare for the World Cup. If it's not there on the day I need it,
it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``I'm hanging tough. I'll get the job done.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Consistency is something Bobby Jones has strived for
since he put together an All-Star first half of the 1997 season.
But after a strong start this year, Jones has been struggling, and
on Monday night at Shea Stadium he had a second straight dismal
outing.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching on an extra day's rest because of elbow tenderness,
Jones allowed 7 runs and 11 hits in five and two-thirds innings in
a 7-6 loss to the struggling Milwaukee Brewers. In his previous
start, Jones yielded a career-high eight runs in Colorado in five
and a third innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did make things interesting during the late going in a
game that had the dawdling pace of an American League evening,
taking 3 hours 51 minutes, by scoring three times in the eighth.
Roger Cedeno had two stolen bases in the inning, and John Olerud
drove in two runs with a line-drive double off the right-field
fence. But Bob Wickman struck out Robin Ventura on a full-count
sinker to strand runners at first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman also struck out Jermaine Allensworth looking on an 0-2
pitch with runners on first and third to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Jones (3-2) has had three strong outings followed
by three adequate outings, followed by two outings he would love to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   Over his first three starts this season, Jones allowed 3 earned
runs in 21 innings, and he was 3-0. His next three starts were all
no-decisions in which he allowed 11 earned runs in 18 innings.
</P>
<P>
   And after his last two starts _ both losses _ have pushed his
earned run average to 5.22, there is reason to wonder which is the
real Bobby Jones?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Jones yielded two runs in the first inning, but
Mike Piazza evened the score with his fifth homer of the season, a
two-run shot to left off the Milwaukee left-hander Scott Karl (5-1)
in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers scored twice more in the third on four hits,
including a tie-breaking double from the former Met Jeromy Burnitz.
The Mets pulled within a run on Olerud's run-scoring single in the
fifth, but Milwaukee scored three more runs in the top of the sixth
to take a 7-3 lead and chase Jones.
