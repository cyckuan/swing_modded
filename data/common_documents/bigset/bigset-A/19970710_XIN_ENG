<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges Search for Peace in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
pledged today to continue the search for peace in Northern Ireland
despite violence there over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to give up on Northern Ireland. I am going to
carry on searching for a solution and I believe if there were true
good will on all sides and a little bit of give and take and
understanding a solution could be found," Blair said in a speech
to parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent violence in Northern Ireland had been
appalling and appealed to the two rival ethnic groups--the
Protestants and Roman Catholics-- to do everything they could to
keep the drive for peace on course.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, fresh from the NATO summit in Madrid, also
backed Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam for her attempts to
avert conflict, saying she had negotiated in good faith and
praising her for her "courage and determination."
</P>
<P>
Mowlam has been bitterly criticized by the nationalist
community for allowing a Protestant Orange Order parade go ahead
on Sunday through a predominantly Roman Catholic area of
Portadown, which led to several-day serious riot unseen for years.
</P>
<P>
Criticism of Mowlam has been intensified by the publication of
a leaked document which appeared to show the decision to allow the
Portadown march through had been taken well before negotiations
between the two sides. Mowlam has ordered an investigation into
the leak.
</P>
<P>
The government has dismissed the reports, saying the document
was merely an initial review of options.
</P>
<P>
But this has failed to stem the criticism of Mowlam, who
condemned the riots today and told parliament that progress
towards peace could only be made through "accommodation and
negotiation."

<HEADLINE> Asia, Europe Urged to Enhance Better Working Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Asia and Europe will benefit
tremendously if they could enhance a better coordination and
synergy in their working relationship, said a leading organizer of
the Asia-Europe Business Conference being held here.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made in the chairman's statement today issued
at the first Asia-Europe Business Conference.
</P>
<P>
Aburizal Bakrie, chairman of the conference and chairman of the
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the conference
which began on Tuesday has achieved a "significant step forward to
our future direction".
</P>
<P>
He said as the 20th century is closing to an end, Europe with
its economic wealth, science and technological knowledge will
continue to function strategically in the 21st century. But Asia,
with its continued dynamism and enthusiasm, will also have an
important role.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that the 21st century is a new challenging era
in the world business development. Whether we call it
globalization, regionalization, the borderless world, the new
world order or a universal economy, we know for sure that we have
to prepare much better than what we have done in the past," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 participants from 25 Asian and European countries
have exchanged views on development of small and medium size
enterprises, the importance of improving trade and investment
facilitation and infrastructure and looking ahead on the future
direction of Asia-Europe business relationship, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is a follow-up activity of the decision of the
First Informal Asian-European Leaders Meeting (ASEM I ) in
Bangkok, Thailand, in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen at the conference, which will end tomorrow,
will hold one to one meeting at the last day of the meeting,
Bakrie said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Must Take Correct Attitude To History: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) -- China's People's Daily Thursday
carries a signed article titled "A Correct Attitude Toward History
is the Political Basis for Sino-Japanese Friendship."
</P>
<P>
The full text of the article by Gu Ping is as follows:
</P>
<P>
A lot of thoughts are coming up in my mind on the occasion of
commemorating the 60th anniversary of the July 7 Incident, or the
Marco Polo Bridge Incident, in suburban Beijing in 1937.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are close neighbors separated by only a strip
of water, and the two countries' friendly exchanges could be
traced back to more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But earlier in this century, Japan took a militarist course of
aggression and expansion, therefore inflicted severe sufferings to
the people of China and some other Asian nations, as well as the
Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
As a Chinese saying goes: "Past experience, if not forgotten,
is a guide for the future." This painful part of history should be
forever in our memory.
</P>
<P>
A correct attitude toward the history of Japan's militarist
aggression always serves as the political basis for Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government acknowledged in the Sino-Japanese Joint
Statement of 1972 that "the Japanese side is keenly aware of
Japan's responsibility for causing enormous damage in the past to
the Chinese people through war and deeply reproaches itself."
</P>
<P>
It was with this basic understanding by the Japanese side about
its past that the Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations were
normalized at the time. In the 25 years thereafter, Japanese
leaders in general have shown a gradual progress toward a better
understanding on this point.
</P>
<P>
On August 15, 1995, then Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama made a statement on behalf of his government, deeply
reproaching and sincerely apologizing for the tremendous loss and
pains that Japan's colonial rules and aggressions caused to the
peoples of Asian nations. The move had a positive bearing on
pushing forward the smooth development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, it is obvious that there has always been an
adverse current in Japan against the healthy growth of the
country's relations with China.
</P>
<P>
One major sign pointing to the existence of such a
countercurrent is Japanese right-wing forces' consistent advocacy
of the reactionary view of history trying to whitewash the
country's wars of aggression.
</P>
<P>
It's astonishing to find that in a Japanese publication
compiled to review the so-called Great East Asia War, a lengthy
part is devoted to promoting the reactionary view of history and
reversing the verdict of history.
</P>
<P>
In its discussions about Japan's aggression against China, the
same publication undisguisedly mispresents the Japanese-instigated
September 18 Incident of 1931 in China as a "war of defense" on
Japan's part, the July 7 Incident of 1937 as the result of a
"conspiracy" on China's part, and Japan's Twenty-one Demands
imposed on China's Northern Warlords government early in this
century as a Japanese effort to "consolidate Japan's vested
interest."
</P>
<P>
In one word, the publication seems to be trying to wipe out all
historic facts about the Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, Japan pursued a basic state policy of
expansionism after the Meiji Restoration. In the 1930s, by
instigating the September 18 Incident and the July 7 Incident,
Japan launched a full-scale war of aggression against China.
</P>
<P>
There is mass of irrefutable evidence for the countless crimes
and atrocities the Japanese army committed during the 1931-45 war
of aggression against China. And these crimes and atrocities
always get people's hackles up.

<HEADLINE> Japan Must Take Correct Attitude To History: People's Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, some frantic militarist trumpeters in nowadays Japan
are trying to justify the crimes and atrocities by saying that
"for its lack of land and resources, sometimes Japan needs to ask
other countries for the rights and interests required for its own
survival." What a logic of bandits!
</P>
<P>
The absurd statement sounds so similar to what the Japanese
militarists said when they launched aggression wars many years
ago. It seems that these people are still living in the militarist
fanaticism in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
These same people have also been fiercely attacking the
Japanese politicians who uphold an objective view of history. They
are angry with people of integrity in the circles of education and
press in Japan. They whine that Japan is suffering from "national
self-maltreatment" and "historic self-maltreatment."
</P>
<P>
They turn blind eyes to all testimonies, material evidences and
hills of records in China, Japan and other places worldwide about
Japan's war crimes and atrocities.
</P>
<P>
They ignore the desire cherished by both the Japanese and
Chinese peoples to pass a friendship from generation to
generation, and fabricate arguments and quibbles to whitewash
Japan's wars of aggression.
</P>
<P>
They have even called for changing the status quo and
re-establish what they say is a "correct" view of history so as to
restore "national self-confidence" and "national spirit."
</P>
<P>
We must point out that Japanese militarists back many years ago
also advocated the so-called "national spirit" when they launched
aggression wars. It was this "national spirit" that caused severe
sufferings to Asian peoples, including the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Today, these people are picking up again the "national spirit."
Where on earth are they going to lead Japan to? What international
image are they going to help make for Japan?
</P>
<P>
Their words and deeds will only remind Japan's neighboring
countries to keep greater vigilance against Japan and hurt Japan's
own future development.
</P>
<P>
Sensible statesmen and people of insight in Japan should not
keep their eyes closed and let their country be led astray by
these people.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this century, Japan has tried on two
diametrically opposite development paths which brought it two
kinds of totally different outcomes. By comparing the two, it is
not difficult to conclude that Japan's fundamental interests lie
in sticking to the road of peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
What is good and bad is quite obvious and historic lessons are
still fresh. But some arrogant people in Japan have lost
themselves and attempted to revive the dream of a militarist
Japan. So it is necessary for us to warn them that they have to
respect history and learn from it, or they will be punished by it.
</P>
<P>
As an old Chinese saying goes, it takes courage to acknowledge
one's own shame. It means to Japan that it should have the courage
to face up to history and deeply repoach for its past mistakes,
and continue on the road of peaceful development to win the trust
of other Asian countries and become a decent member of the world
community.
</P>
<P>
History is a mirror and how to look into it reflects the state
of a nation's spirit and political attitude. In the history of
mankind, it is not rare that a nation misguides itself and falls
into a trap. What is important is that the nation should have the
courage and wisdom to get itself out from the trap. A correct view
of history often serves as a turning point for a nation to make
progress back on the road of development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people hope that Japan will choose the road of
peaceful development and carry the Sino-Japanese friendship from
generation to generation. And a start point of the road is to have
a correct attitude toward history.

<HEADLINE> Joint Communique Results in Mixed Reactions in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Madrid joint communique issued
Tuesday by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis sparked mixed reactions in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The six-point communique includes the mutual respect of each
other's sovereignty, of international law and treaties.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also pledged to solve their disputes
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government hailed the document.
</P>
<P>
Simitis described the joint communique as "a document of
principles which will govern Greek-Turkish ties."
</P>
<P>
Acting government spokesman Nikos Athanasakis said today that
the joint communique was "a particularly positive development"
which could open up "a new era" in Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the Communist Party today expressed concern about the
document, saying that it was not aimed at resolving differences
between the two countries, but at extending "U.S. influence" in
the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition of the Left and Progress said in a statement that
the joint communique could serve as "a step towards the
normalization of Greek-Turkish ties."
</P>
<P>
The coalition called for an immediate meeting of political
party leaders in order to be briefed in detail on the course of
Athens' ties with Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Social Movement sees the joint communique
"overturning the substance of the existing legal situation in the
Aegean" and being "a prelude to the partitioning and joint
sovereignty" of the sea.

<HEADLINE> Militiamen Sent to Improve N. Mogadishu's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 9 (Xinhua) -- North Mogadishu authorities have
handed over 300 militiamen to the dormant Islamic court to
improve the worsening security situation in the northern part of
the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony at the former traffic police headquarters on
Tuesday, acting chairman of Ali Mahdi's faction Ali Ugas Abdulle
said the militiamen together with their technical wagons will be
at the disposal of the Islamic court chaired by religious leader
Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud (Sheikh Ali Dhere).
</P>
<P>
Ali Ugas said all armored cars and armed militiamen are
prohibited from moving along the streets of North Mogadishu
except those serving the Islamic court with legal documents.
</P>
<P>
However, the effectiveness of the militiamen is yet to be seen
in the streets despite people's eagerness for peace.
</P>
<P>
Ali Ugas said this contingent will be reinforced by more
troops to restore and rule of law and order in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
On the day when the court resumed its function yesterday, four
BAH352SPC131S09PCQL00:3200:321105
people were killed and several others wounded when a gunman
opened fire at random on a civilian bus in North Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to a witness, the killer was one of the gunmen who
controlled an illegal check point extorting money from the
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The witness said the killer himself was shot dead on the spot
by a guard of the bus who returned fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, faction leader of south Mogadishu Hussein Mohamed
Aidid today appointed a 14-member committee for the emergence
situation.
</P>
<P>
According to a decree which was broadcast on a radio which
backs Hussein Aidid, the 14 members will be headed by Aidid
himself and will be responsible for the restoration of peace in
Somalia. Hussoin Aidid is currently on a tour of Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Reshuffle Passes Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 9 (Xinhua) -- After several delays and tense
inner bickering within the coalition, the Israeli cabinet
reshuffle presented by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu passed
the Knesset (Parliament) today.
</P>
<P>
In a vote of 52-46, the Knesset approved the new line-up of
cabinet, in which former Justice Minister Yaacov Neeman was
appointed the new finance minister and Likud's Knesset faction
HAB249HAB258i0709QU00:3200:320114
head Michael Eitan the new science minister.
</P>
<P>
Neeman, who does not belong to any political party, replaced
Dan Meridor who resigned last month due to his rift with
Netanyahu. Eitan replaced Benny Begin who resigned in January to
protest the signing of Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Israeli
troop redeployment in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Likud lawmaker Silvan Shalom was appointed deputy
defense minister and he will take over the science portfolio from
Eitan after one year in rotation.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone within the coalition was pleased with the new
appointments, which have been achieved after so much inner
bickering and bargains conducted among the coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education, Culture and Arts Zevulun Hammer of the
National Religious Party, Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani of the Third Way Party, and Labor and Social Affairs
Minister Eli Ishai of Shas Party were absent from today's vote on
the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu expressed confidence after the vote, saying that the
new cabinet would be stronger and more stable, while
acknowledging it would still face more difficulties and challenges
ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I think the government was measurably strengthened today with
these excellent people, each in his own field," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he also believed that the new cabinet would help push
forward the peace process and achieve the goals of economic and
social revolutions, such as ensuring a secure peace and realizing
the liberalization of economy.
</P>
<P>
Neeman was appointed only after Netanyahu's failing in his
attempt to transfer the hardline National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon to the finance portfolio. Sharon conditioned the
transfer on his inclusion into the powerful inner cabinet, which
comprises of Netanyahu, Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Fearing that Sharon could jeopardize the peace process if
granted greater say in the decision-making process, both Levy and
Mordechai opposed Sharon's inclusion into the inner
cabinet. Netanyahu later dropped Sharon and decided to abolish the
inner cabinet, or kitchen cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Asked what role would Sharon play in future peace process,
Netanyahu said he valued Sharon's advices and would consult with
him on important decisions. There are already worries that Sharon
might take revenge in future on Netanyahu for dumping him in the
reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Eitan's entry into the cabinet was a welcome sign for the
well-wishers for the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace
process. Eitan, a dove in the rightist Likud, was known for
drawing a joint document with Labor lawmaker Yossi Beilin on the
final Israeli-Palestinian settlement that would grant high
autonomy to the Palestinians.
S05063HAB258I0709QU00:3200:330120
</P>
<P>
Eitan said after the Knesset vote that he would do his best to
help establish a national unity government in order to achieve
the final settlement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that Israeli people and Israeli nation will be
better represented and will be able to achieve better achievement
in the negotiations if there is a unity government," Eitan
said.

ISLAMABAD, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The UN Secretary General's
representative on Afghanistan, Nobert Holl, will leave here
tomorrow for Afghanistan to meet leaders of the anti-Taliban
alliance, the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Holl's visit to Mazar-e-Sharif, a major city in northern

the Afghan warring groups to the negotiating table, according to
the APP.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Afghanistan, Holl will discuss matters
relating to the set-up of a political commission with leaders of
the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The proposed commission will take care of the ceasefire,
exchange of prisoners and the outlines for a broad-based

</P>
<P>
The first step to be taken indeed was a ceasefire because the
bloodshed had to end, Holl was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The main and final target is the setting up of a broad-based
government in Afghanistan," he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Former Political Detainee Allowed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
relaxed its restriction order on Chia Thye Poh, a former political
detainee who had been detained by the government from 1966 to
1989, and granted him an international passport, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that this meant Chia could now travel out of
Singapore without a previously required written permission from
the Internal Security Department (ISD) under the Home Affairs
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that Chia, 56, has been offered a one
year scholarship to study in Germany and he plans to leave at the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
With restriction relaxed, he would no longer need permission
from the ISD to take up a new job or change his address. But other
rules under the Restriction Order still apply and he still needs
approval from the ISD Director to speak in public.
</P>
<P>
He is also not allowed to associate with other former political
detainees. Chia was arrested under the Internal Security Act more
than 30 years ago for his alleged links with the Communist Party
of Malaya, which he had been denying, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he was released and allowed to live and work in the
Sentosa Island. Later he was allowed to live with his parents in
their home on the main island of Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official Denies Peso Devaluation Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Trade and Industry
Secretary Cesar Bautista today denied a report by Singapore Strait
Times that a peso devaluation agenda is in the offing in today's
meeting of the Monetary Board.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, Bautista stated that he personally does
not favor devaluation because a market-led mechanism is definitely
a more realistic mechanism to determine value of the currency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Monetary Board, a body under the Central
Bank, merely focuses on the caucus on global competitiveness held
on July 4 wherein foreign exchange rate was one of the concerns
identified by businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Bautista explained that the foreign exchange policy
is an area under the sole jurisdiction of the Monetary Board, an
independent body.
</P>
<P>
He stated that he will merely transmit the paper of the
businessmen to the governor of the Monetary Board for information.
</P>
<P>
The governor usually dialogues with representatives of the
private sector to explain and give a clearer picture of the
specific policies which may be of concern to them.
</P>
<P>
Also today, President Fidel Ramos criticized the Singaporean
paper for "a media disinformation campaign of some kind" to
undermine the peso.
</P>
<P>
"It was observed that this is the second time in a row that
newspaper twisted statements of high-ranking Philippine officials
on the same subject, the first of which was Finance Secretary
Bobby de Ocampo," Ramos told his weekly press conference.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Strait Times quoted De Ocampo as saying the peso
may drop in a couple of weeks. The report, which was also
vehemently denied by De Ocampo, triggered a fresh wave of
speculative attacks on the peso Monday and forced the Philippine
Central Bank to raise its borrowing rates sharply.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said there could be a deliberate attempt by "outside
forces" to undermine the value of the peso as indicated by the
recent chain of events that led to the jittering of the country's
currency.
</P>
<P>
But he ruled out the devaluation of the peso, saying that the
macroeconomic parameters, policies and condition of the country
remain "sound".

<HEADLINE> Health of Russian School Children Deteriorating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia's school children are in
worse shapes in the 1990s as only 10 percent of them now appear to
be in good physical conditions, a Russian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of primary and secondary school students have
chronic diseases, said Yekaterina Lakhova, who presides over a
presidential committee on women, family and population affairs.
</P>
<P>
Findings from a latest survey also suggest that the rest of the
country's school children may have other health problems, Lakhova
was quoted as saying by an Interfax news agency report.
</P>
<P>
Students aged between 15 to 17 are in the worst shape, as their
incidences of blood diseases and endocrine diseases have shot up
by 260 percent and 220 percent respectively since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The official also expressed worries that the incidences of
contagious diseases are increasing in schools.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, she said, the number of school children
suffering from tuberculosis was up 1.7 times, and the cases of
adolescents who contracted syphilis soared 49 times.

<HEADLINE> Rampant Fee Collection Must Be Stopped: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- All kinds of rampant fee
collection must be stopped to protect the legal interests of the
country's enterprises, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo told a national
telephone conference today.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), noted that the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council have always attached great
importance to the issue of stamping out reckless levying of fees
or fines on enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Both the number of departments involved and the sums of money
collected are growing, Wu said, stressing that this has not only
increased the burdens on enterprises, eroded their profits, caused
the loss of state-owned assets and affected the enterprises'
performance, but also seriously undermined the relations between
the Party and the government and the people.
</P>
<P>
The problem must be solved immediately, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The work will be headed by the State Economic and Trade
Commission and participated in by the State Planning Commission,
the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Supervision and the
Auditing Administration, according to Wu.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's GDP Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
of Nepal in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending on July 14 is lower
compared with the last fiscal year, a latest survey said.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly due to the decline in the growth rate of
agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, the Economic Survey for
Fiscal Year 1996-97 said.
</P>
<P>
Among the nine sectors contributing to the growth of GDP, all
the major sectors except manufacturing, electricity, gas and water
experienced slower growth this year, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the GDP of the current fiscal year grew only
4.9 percent as against 6.1 percent for the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
This rate is lower than the average growth rate of South Asian
countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
However, as a result of liberal and open economic policy
adopted by the government in recent years, the industrial sector
has seen increase both in domestic and foreign investment in the
passing fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The survey said a total of 356 joint ventures have been
approved by April 1997, with a foreign investment of some 10
billion rupees (about 180 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Hungary Should Pay More for Entering NATO: Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen today asked Hungary to spend more on defense for
entering the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Hungary's defense budget, now 1.2 percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP), should rise to 2.1 or 2.2 percent, Cohen told a
press conference on the second day of his three-day stay here.
</P>
<P>
In the coming 13 years, 27 to 35 billion U.S. dollars is needed
for the NATO expansion to include East European nations, with
Hungary as one of the first new members, the U.S. defense chief
said.
</P>
<P>
The cost incurred, he said, should be split into three equal
parts and shared by the United States, the 16-nation Western
military alliance's other members and the would-be new members.
</P>
<P>
He promised, at the presence of his Hungarian counterpart
Keleti Gyorgy, that the United States would help with the
personnel and language training of the Hungarian military.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Keleti said the Hungarian military could gear up
to the NATO standard in eight or 10 years, and the priority is to
consolidate the air force's combat and defense capabilities.

<HEADLINE> HK Small Enterprises Face Challenges, Chances: TDC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized
enterprises, which form the backbone of Hong Kong's economy, face
a new era of both unprecedented competitive challenges and strong
opportunities for growth, a trade official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC), stressed the need for local small and medium-sized
enterprises to equip themselves to face the tough competition
ahead and to step up efforts to penetrate into new market fronts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar marking the opening of the TDC's annual
Market Day Exhibition at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center Extension, he pointed out: "Changing times have created new
competitive challenges for local small and medium-sized
enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Many small and medium-sized enterprises have not yet made the
adjustment to operating in a high cost economy, and they have not
identified past inefficiencies or incorporated cost saving
information and managerial systems, Fung said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, these enterprises have successfully
diversified their production processes by expanding out of Hong
Kong. But with ever-changing consumer trends, and demands from the
marketplace for faster product deliver, they face a big
challenge, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Fung said that the small and medium-sized enterprises
are also "in a good position as a new era of opportunity opens,"
referring to Hong Kong's return to China and the establishment of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is now in the best economic shape to advance herself
as a Special Administrative Region, moving towards a more
affluent and market-oriented regional economy and is set to
penetrate into bigger overseas markets," the TDC chairman noted.

SHANGHAI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rain hit this, China's
largest city today, leaving some 70 houses flooded and large areas
of suburban farmland inundated.
</P>
<P>
The rain started in the Shanghai area this morning, and the
highest rainfall reached 118 mm, according to the Shanghai
Anti-Flood Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
All officials and workers in charge of anti-flood work have
been mobilized to drain off the accumulated water in the city, a

Meanwhile, local people and troops stationed in neighboring
province of Zhejiang have also been mobilized in the fight against
severe floods that have washed away dykes, houses and sections of
railways in Xiaoshan, Zhuji and Quzhou cities.
</P>
<P>
Floods caused by heavy rain in the past four days inundated
stretches of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line and stranded more

<HEADLINE> Renault Belgian Workers to Vote on Layoff Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian employees of the
French automaker Renault will vote directly on its layoff plan on
July 17, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
There seemed no other alternative left after company
negotiators and trade unions failed Wednesday to reach an
agreement on the planned closure of the Vilvoorde plant in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
During an all-night meeting with union representatives that
ended Wednesday morning, Renault said that it would preserve 600
jobs and offered severance pay packages ranging from 150,000 to
two million Belgian francs (4,130 to 55,140 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The offer will be reportedly more than the workers would get if
the plant was declared bankrupt. The management of the plant was
threatening to close the factory if the workers did not agree,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached a framework accord last Thursday, but
details remain to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
"We are dealing with unacceptable blackmail by management,
which has threatened to place the plant in receivership if its
proposal is not accepted," a trade union spokesman was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Renault, which initially wanted to save only 400 jobs at the
Belgian plant, offered to help save 600 at the meeting with the
Belgian unions.
</P>
<P>
Renault is planning to close the plant before the end of this
year but to continue to use the site for subcontracting work and
for maintenance work on used cars.
</P>
<P>
The company, over the objection of the Belgian government,
decided to close the plant and shift production to Spain and
France to save money.
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that the closure would save at least 800
million French francs (some 135 million dollars) a year and help
the company break even this year.
</P>
<P>
If workers reject Renault's offer and the company decides to
let its Belgian unit be declared bankrupt, employees will be
entitled to about one-third as much compensation as the company is
currently offering.
</P>
<P>
Shares of Renault rose 2.40 French francs to close at 146.10 as
investors in Paris favored shares of companies involved in
restructuring operations.
</P>
<P>
Renault also plans to cut about 3,000 jobs in France this year
out of a worldwide work force of 141,000.

<HEADLINE> Britain Raises Interest Rates to Curb Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain raised official interest
rates to 6.75 percent from 6.50 percent today in a bid to curb
consumer spending and cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
This is the second rate rise since the Bank of England was
given the power to set interest rates two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The move followed data showing the inflation rate overshot the
government's 2.5 percent target in June to stand at 2.7 percent.
The first budget announced last week by the new Labor government
was seen as being not sufficiently tough to rein in consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said the strength of the pound, up over 20 percent
against major currencies since last August, complicated the rate
decision but the recent run of strong economic data in the end
forced its hand.
</P>
<P>
"The upward revision of estimated output growth in the fourth
quarter of 1996 and recent development in monetary growth and
retail sales indicated that a further tightening of monetary
policy was necessary," the Bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The government immediately backed the rate rise. In a statement
released after the Bank's announcement, Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown said it was important that inflation be
brought under control.

<HEADLINE> Aspiration of ASEAN 10 Still on: Indonesian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said here today the aspiration of an ASEAN 10 is still
on despite the decision by the ASEAN foreign ministers to postpone
Cambodia's entry into the regional grouping indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The aspiration to have all 10 countries in Southeast Asia in
the grouping remained as it could bring more benefit to the
region, he said at the end of the one-day ASEAN foreign ministers'
special meeting here.
</P>
<P>
"We continue with the aspiration of ASEAN 10 but at this moment
we think that the wisest thing to do is to accept two countries
only in July," he was quoted by the Malaysian national news agency
Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that because of the aspiration, the ASEAN foreign
ministers meeting today hoped that rival parties in Cambodia could
resolve their differences in a peaceful manner as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN foreign minister decided on May 31 that Cambodia, Myanmar
and Laos will be invited to join the present seven-member grouping
on July 24.
</P>
<P>
On ASEAN's initiative to help Cambodia solve the crisis, Alatas
said ASEAN stood ready to contribute to a peaceful solution to
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Today's ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting agreed to send a
special delegation to seek an audience with Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk and to see the two rival prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The delegation would comprise Ali Alatas, Philippine Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon and Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister ASEAN Standing Committee Chairman
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said, "We wish to continue seeking the
possibility of making contribution to the peaceful resolution to
the situation in Cambodia."

<HEADLINE> First Jordanian Plane in 7 Years Lands in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The first Jordanian aircraft
landed at Kuwaiti International Airport this morning and then
returned back to Jordan after a seven-year break of direct flights
between the two countries since the Gulf crisis in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti airport officials said that the 102-seat Royal
Jordanian company Airbus A-320 touched down at 11:45 local
time (08:45 GMT) with 40 passengers on board and left fully
packed an hour later.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Kuwait resumed direct air flights Wednesday, with
the first Kuwaiti commercial plane of Kuwait Airways Corporation
(KAC) landing at Amman's Queen Alia International Airport, the
first flight since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait froze its links with Jordan, including direct flights by
the flag carriers, after accusing Amman of siding with Iraq
during Iraqi occupation of Kuwait between August 1990 and February
1991.
</P>
<P>
Last month, KAC and Royal Jordanian company struck an accord to
resume two-way semi-weekly direct flights within the framework of
relations normalization process started last year between the two
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, KAC started its semi-weekly flights to Amman, on
every Wednesday and Friday, while the Royal Jordanian company from
today resumes the semi-weekly flights, on every Monday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has not restored its full diplomatic relations with
Jordan, with only a Charge D'Affaires in Amman.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Decades-Old Coffee Program Fails: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The coffee development
program in Ethiopia over the past 40 years has failed to boost
productivity and quality, the Ethiopian News Agency today quoted
a research paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper was presented at a workshop here under the theme
Strategy and the Execution of the Extension Program of the Coffee
and Tea Industry. It said despite the possibility to produce 20
quintals of coffee per hectare, only four or five quintals is
produced.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the coffee program's unsatisfactory
result is due to the failure to take into consideration the
social and cultural values of the farmers, as well as the
participation of the consumers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the paper said, quantity, technology, sales and
supply of coffee were pre-determined by higher authorities
instead of the farmers themselves.
</P>
<P>
The study recommended that the coffee development extension
program expected to be implemented in the future must take into
account the natural environment, social and cultural values,
problems and interests of the farmers, as well as the
participation of the producers.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is a major coffee producer and exporter in Africa. It
earned close to 300 million U.S. Dollars from export of 128,000
tons of coffee in the just ended 1996/97 fiscal year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Rabindra
Nath Sharma said here today that higher and sustainable economic
growth, poverty alleviation and rural development will be the
government's top priorities in the coming fiscal year beginning on
July 15.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the budget draft for the fiscal year 1997-98 at the
joint session of the bicameral parliament, Sharma said the budget
focuses primarily on projects that will directly contribute to the
upliftment of the poor, control public consumption expenditure,
and create a conducive atmosphere to encourage the private sector
to mobilize its skills and resources for the economic development
of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will give emphasis on agricultural
development by providing impetus to rural development, the
Agricultural Perspective Plan will be implemented with the
emphasis on commercialization of agricultural sector in order to
support the acceleration of the overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the liberal, open and market oriented economic
policy will be gradually broadened and strengthened for
sustainable higher growth rate in non-agricultural sector, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 45 percent of the people of the country live below
poverty line, Sharma stressed that sectoral and targeted programs
will be executed in a more coordinated, integrated and effective
manner so as to reduce poverty on a long term basis.
</P>
<P>
To this end, a high level Poverty Alleviation Commission will
be set up in the coming fiscal year to conduct poverty alleviation
campaign with the streamlining of development strategies, programs
and targets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Agricultural Perspective Plan, a package program of
fertilizer, irrigation, technology, road, electricity and market
will be carried out, he said, adding by successfully implementing
the plan, it is expected that the population living below poverty
line will be brought down to 12.5 percent by the end of the Ninth
Five Year Plan period (1997-2002).
</P>
<P>
The government has also taken human resource development as an
integral part of poverty alleviation and decided to invest

and rural safe drinking water, Sharma said.

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes to Tackle Delayed Commercial Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- All efforts should be made to
establish a climate in Europe where payments in commercial
transactions are made on time, an EU (European Union) official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Christos Papoutsis, EU commissioner for enterprise policy, said
Thursday that such problems should be tackled as a matter of
urgency.
</P>
<P>
"Minimum requirements should be incorporated into national
legislation, for example, concerning the statutory right of
creditors to interest on late payments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, Thursday
adopted a communication on late payments in commercial
transactions on the initiative of Papoutsis.
</P>
<P>
The EC notes that increasingly long payment periods can have
serious consequences for all European firms, particularly small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by undermining their cash
flows, profitability and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The competitive position of SMEs as suppliers to large firms
can be distorted by deliberately long payment delays, the EC
maintains.
</P>
<P>
The payments situation is also hindering the development of
intra-EU trade and the smooth functioning of the internal market,
according to the communication.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Japanese Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng told a
group of Japanese businessmen here today that the competition in
the China market is fierce, and only those with advanced
technology and reasonable prices can get the upper hand in the
competition.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a meeting with Hiroshi Watanabe, chairman of
the Sanwa Bank Ltd of Japan, and his party here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed the visitors on China's economic situation and the
prospects for the country's central and western areas. Many
Japanese enterprises are actively exploring the possibilities of
cooperating with China's inland provinces and municipalities, Li
said, adding that this is far-sighted.
</P>
<P>
He adviced the entrepreneurs from Japan to decide their
cooperation projects according to the different advantages and
priorities of those provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country, but its development is rapid and
there are rapidly changes in the structure of its industries, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes overseas businessmen to cooperate in
skill-intensive industries, Li said. He hoped that Japanese
enterprises would notice these changes in the China market and
provide advanced technologies in collaboration with their Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that the Sanwa Bank is one of the biggest
corporations in Japan, and its business has extended to many
Chinese areas and enterprises. He said he hoped that Sanwa and its
subsidiaries would play an active role in securing healthy and
stable Sino-Japanese ties and in promoting mutually-beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Watanabe told Li that the mission of his delegation in China is
to become better acquainted with the new developments in China's
economy so as to expand Japan's economic and technological
cooperation with China. The Sanwa Bank will implement well its
current joint projects with China and gradually strengthen its
cooperation with China's inland provinces, he said.

<HEADLINE> Manila Extends Truce in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military today
extended its unilateral truce in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines, for four more days until next Tuesday to give a
chance for the resumption of peace talks with Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
Acedera, the Armed Force's chief of staff, said the extension
of the ceasefire was aimed at giving Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao Governor Nur Misuari enough time to persuade the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The original ceasefire, ordered by President Fidel Ramos, will
expire at 6 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
Misuari was earlier asked by Ramos to mediate between the
government and the MILF. The MILF suspended the peace talks late
last month after its second biggest camp in Cotabato province was
seized by the military.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Acedera dismissed the MILF's accusations that the
military is organizing a paramilitary force, the Christian
Liberation Movement, to fight the MILF. Acedera said the military
is too busy to do this.
</P>
<P>
Also today, MILF Vice Chairman Murad said the MILF laid down
four conditions for reopening the peace talks during its first
meeting Wednesday with Misuari in its biggest headquarters, Camp
Abubakar, in Maguindanao province, western Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The four conditions include the pull-out of military troops in
"MILF-controlled areas", the cessation of military operations
against the MILF and the return of evacuees to their original
places.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been raging between the MILF and government troops
during the past several weeks in central and western Mindanao,
killing over 150 people and displacing more than 70,000 residents.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Raises Anew Borrowing Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank today
hiked its overnight borrowing rate to a four-year high of 32
percent from 30 percent in a bid to ward off speculative attacks
on the country's currency peso.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth time for the central bank to raise its key
interest rate to counter speculations against the peso since the
start of this month.
</P>
<P>
The country's currency has been under speculative attacks since
the start of July amid the rumors that the Philippine government
may devalue the peso after the floatation of the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
Speculations intensified in the foreign exchange market this
week after a Singapore-based newspaper quoted two high-ranking
financial officials as saying the Philippine is considering to
depreciate the peso. The reports were all bluntly denied.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the central bank was forced to raise the overnight
borrowing rate to 30 percent from 24 percent Monday. The overnight
borrowing rate stood at 15 percent on July 2.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the central bank was forced to dip into its
foreign reserves to meet a rising demand for dollars in the
currency market.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate remained stable at 26.40 pesos to one dollar
in today's currency market.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the central bank said raising the interest rate is
the best way to protect the peso since higher interest rate will
increase the cost of speculations.
</P>
<P>
But analysts here said continued high interest rate will affect
corporations and the property sector and then hurt the local stock
market which has already been tumbling since Monday.
</P>
<P>
The stock market today also plunged 78.05 points to close at
2,511.15, the lowest in two years, due to the new round of raise
in the borrowing rate.

ever, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 114,916 motor vehicles were sold in May, up from

April and a 20.5 percent jump compared with the same period of

Sales of new trucks reached a monthly record of 53,083 in May.
</P>

trucks, vans, coaches and buses.
</P>

In May, Canadian consumers also purchased 61,833 new passenger
cars, 1.4 percent more than in April. The Big Three automakers
accounted for 59.8 percent of sales, while the other manufacturers
captured 40.2 percent of the market.

<HEADLINE> Russian Former Justice Minister Denies Sauna Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian former justice minister
Valentin Kovalyov has denied his relation to the published
scandalous photographs which caused him to resign, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kovalyov said, however, he wants to find out who gave
journalist Larisa Kislinskaya information compromising his
reputation, but has no intention to sue her.
</P>
<P>
In a live broadcast on Radio Echo of Moscow, the former justice
minister said, "My personal life remains unchanged as everything
on those scandalous photos definitely had no relation to me. I
firmly reject the authenticity of the tape scenes and facts of my
private life."
</P>
<P>
But he was reminded of the fact that Vice-Premier and Interior
Minister Anatoly Kulikov had said that the videotape showing the
then justice minister in a sauna with naked women was authentic.
</P>
<P>
In response, he said, "the truth will be restored. The video is
not authentic, it is unverified, and looks like it is forged."
</P>
<P>
"I want to restore my good name and my reputation by all legal
means," Kovalyov said, but refused "for tactical consideration" to
disclose what steps he intended to take.
</P>
<P>
Referring to suing the journalist, he said that she had yet to
realize the role she acted in someone's play. "I have no hostile
feelings about her. If this scandalous story can help her
journalistic career, good luck," Kovalyov said.
</P>
<P>
The former minister alleged that the scandal was organized by
the forces dissatisfied with the reform of the judicial bodies
initiated by him.
</P>
<P>
Kovalyov said that he believed the source of information would
be eventually punished.
</P>
<P>
Following the scandal, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
appointed Sergei Stepashin on July 2 as new justice minister.

<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has
encouraged the retail sector to open more chain stores nationwide
to provide convenience for urban residents.
</P>
<P>
"More chain stores and supermarkets should be opened in
newly-built residential communities which are far from urban
shopping areas. And there should be a rich assortment of
affordable commodities," Li told a national conference on chain
store business, which closed here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the fledging service sector will become the
mainstream in the future development of China's retail sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the State Council, China's highest governing body, will
continuously support the development of chain stores.
</P>
<P>
"Chain stores should lower prices through establishing and
improving the management of distribution centers, while reducing
intermediary costs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Mergers of small retail companies will be encouraged because
big chain store companies can provide standard services and be
highly competitive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Trade plans to develop chain stores to
speed up reforms in the commercial sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 chain store companies have opened some 10,000

BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
expressed his thanks to Shoichi Hara, a noted Japanese rice expert
who has been teaching and spreading the technique of planting rice
with fewer seedlings in China for many years.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Hara here this afternoon, the premier said
Hara has made great efforts to popularize the highly productive
rice-planting technique in China, and has achieved notable
successes.
</P>
<P>
He said that agriculture is the foundation of China's national
economy, and developing agricultural science and technology is an
important and arduous task. China is ready to enhance cooperation
with foreign experts in this area, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hara told Li that, although he is 80 years old, he is willing
to dedicate the rest of his life to Sino-Japanese friendship, and
is ready to come to serve the farmers in China at any time they
need him.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese side has given him a lot of support over
the past 16 years, and this made it possible for the technique of
planting rice with fewer seedlings to spread widely in China.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Foreign Currency Deposits Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The foreign currency deposits in
the Philippine commercial banking system have reached a record
high of 16.8 billion US dollars during the first half of the year,
the Philippine Central Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a news release that this figure represented a
1 billion US dollars or a 6.35 percent jump from the end-May level
of 15.8 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The June 1997 level also registered a 5.1 billion US dollar
increase from a year-ago level of 11.7 billion dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although not officially counted as part of the country's gross
international reserves, it said, the deposits are considered as a
second layer of Philippine international reserves.
</P>
<P>
This is because that most of these accounts are held by local
exporters, companies with foreign exchange receipts, and families
of overseas Filipinos, the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Germany to See Trade Surplus of Over 100 Billion Marks, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany could expect a trade surplus
of more than 100 billion marks (57 billion U.S. dollar) in 1997,
with exports growing by six to seven percent and imports up four
to five percent, a leading industry group said today.
</P>
<P>
The depreciation of German mark against U.S. dollar, the
massive rationalization in the German industry and the limited
increases in labour costs are factors which are helping to bolster
Germany's exports, said the German Council of Trade and Industry
(DIHT), the umbrella organization of chambers of commerce.
</P>
<P>
But it also warned against overstating the export success,
saying that Germany would see further losses in its share on the
world market because the world trade as a whole is expecting an
even stronger growth of over eight percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the expected German export growth in 1997 still
lagged behind the long-term average, which was more than 7.5
percent in the 1980s, the DIHT said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Relocate Squatters to Improve Flood Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
decided to relocate thousands of squatters living in waterways in
Metro Manila as a major solution to improve flood control
capability.
</P>
<P>
At a government meeting on flood control, the Housing and Urban
Development Coordinating Council and the National Housing
Authority were committed to providing some 27,000 sites for Metro
Manila squatters.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Public Works and Highways has identified
around 23,000 squatter families living near waterways all over the
capital region.
</P>
<P>
Public Works Secretary Gregorio Vigilar said one of the major
problems identified for flooding in Metro Manila was the blocked
drainage system.
</P>
<P>
The clogging was attributed to garbage thrown by the squatters
living along the region's main waterways.
</P>
<P>
The government was committed to undertaking the relocation
within a one-year period.
</P>
<P>
In May, several days of torrential rains caused heavy flooding
in Metro Manila, killing at least 11 people in the capital area.
This deadly flooding prompted President Fidel Ramos to call the
flood meeting.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government to Sell Transmission Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 550 radio and television
transmitters around Australia were put up for sale today.
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston announced the
sale of the National Transmission Agency's network by open tender.
</P>
<P>
Alston said in a statement that the buyer would be required to
accept five-year transmission contracts with the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Special Broadcasting
Service, two national broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a requirement of the sale contract that national
coverage and existing service commitments to regional and rural
Australia be continued," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government would also ensure current social policy
obligations, including remote commercial television
re-transmission and emergency services, would be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Government sources refused to speculate on the likely sale
price, saying the value of the network would depend on the
opportunities seen by commercial operators.
</P>
<P>
However, one industry analyst said the federal government
could reap 225-300 million US dollars from the sale.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 19 in Japan Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a massive flash
flood and landslide triggered by torrential rains in Kagoshima
Prefecture, southwestern Japan, early today, has risen to 19 with
two people still missing and 13 injured, police said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the injured remain in critical condition, Kyodo News
Service reported.
</P>
<P>
The landslide occurred along the Harihara River in the city of
Izumi at around 00:50 a.m., overflowing a landslide-protection
barrier and burying 15 homes with 39 residents under mud and rocks.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic heavy rains, coupled with tons of tree-covered mud,
rocks measuring more than five meters in diameter, hampered rescue
operations by some 860 fire fighters, police officers and members
of the Self-Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Agency issued a waring of heavy rain and
flooding Wednesday night in northern parts of Kagoshima Prefecture
that include Izumi. Since Monday, the city has recorded 483
millimeters of rain as of 11:00 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The site of the landslide is home to some 80 families, and 50
residents took shelter at local public facilities.
</P>
<P>
This is the worst landslide to hit Kagoshima since September of
1993 when 20 people were killed in the town of Kimpo in a
landslide unleashed by a typhoon.
</P>
<P>
Muneyuki Mutgami, a local official, was quoted as saying that
the landslide was the biggest he has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
"I have engaged in work on disaster prevention for 30 years,
but I have not seen a landslide bigger than this." he said. "It's
an avalanche of a mountain hitting the village rather than a
landslide,"
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains also caused a landslide in the city of
Minamata in Kumamoto Prefecture next to Kagoshima Prefecture at
around 10:00 p.m., burying nine people under earth, all of whom were
rescued, police said.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Agency issued a warning of continued
torrential rains over an area ranging from the southeastern main
island of Kyushu to northern parts of the Kanto region
encompassing Tokyo and its neighboring prefectures up to Friday
morning.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Health Minister Advocates Sex Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran's top health official today
admitted a lack of sex knowledge among children and young people
and advocated sex education through parents but not at schools.
</P>
<P>
Addressing some 300 professionals and health experts on the
occasion of the World Population Day, Health Minister Alireza
Marandi said "many of the divorces, about half of them, take
place because of lack of familiarity with sexual issues."
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicated an increase of 8.86 percent in
divorce rate in the last Iranian calendar year (March 22, 1996-
March 21, 1997) compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In this period a total of 479,263 pairs got married while
37,817 cases of divorce were finalized in Iranian court, the
figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Marandi stated that his ministry had set up some 450
pre-wedding counseling centers to inform the would-be couples of
sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
However, he said "Parents are the best sources to teach sexual
issues to their children." The parents can get their training from
a Parent-Teacher Association.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the ceremony today, Marandi told Xinhua
that he is opposed to sex education in the Iranian schools
because, as he put it, "our society is not ready for it."
</P>
<P>
But he criticized the present state in Iran's traditional
society in which parents are reluctant to talk to their children
about sex.
</P>
<P>
"Teaching children about sex is absolutely important for the
good of the family and the nation. Teaching about sex is a way to
reduce population growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran's population growth has been phenomenal since the Islamic
revolution in 1979. The population doubled since then. The latest
census conducted in October 1996 showed Iran's population stood at
60,055,000 and the Interior Ministry even put it at 62 million at
present.
</P>
<P>
The government now encourages family planning in order to
check population growth. Condoms and contraceptive are sold
over-the-counter at pharmacies; state food subsidies only go
to the first three children of a family.
</P>
<P>
Posters around the capital of Tehran went even further by
saying "One is good, two is enough."
</P>
<P>
However, abortion is not an option in the Islamic country.
Illegitimate and surreptitious operations are offered at
exorbitant rates by physicians or even midwives, which might prove
fatal.
</P>
<P>
Iranian media often report arrests of individuals, mostly
women, for performing abortions.

<P>
BUCHAREST, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government passed
an urgent order on July 9 to amend the educational law so as to
allow minority nationalities to use their own languages in schools.
</P>
<P>
The existing law, passed in 1995, says that the Romanian
language is the only language to be used in school teaching.
</P>
<P>
However, it has met opposition from the minority party -- The
Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania, which has requested
amendments to the law to meet the demands of the minorities since
it became a ruling party in the November 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
Under the amended law, high and elementary schools of
minorities in Romania will use their national languages in
teaching, but the Romanian language will still remain a major
course.

<HEADLINE> TBL Sets Good Example of Divestiture in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Breweries Limited
(TBL) stands out as one of the most successful cases since the
government embarked on the program of divestiture of parastatal
organisations some four years ago, the Daily News repoted today.
</P>
<P>
TBL is a joint venture between the Tanzanian government and Indol, a
subsidiary of the world renowned beer producer, the South African
Breweries (SAB). Tanzania owns 40.5 percent shares in TBL, while
Indol has 45 percent, the rest are owned by a few financial investors.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the performance of TBL has significantly improved
-- production has trippled and its contribution to government's
revenue increased.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the TBL Board Chairman, Paul Bomani, as
saying that TBL was now dominating the domestic market, unlike
what was the case years ago, when shelves in shops and bars
prominently displayed foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
He said TBL was at present commanding 80 percent of the market
share, up from 30 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the government's support, TBL shareholders have
revealed a massive three-year expansion program, where up to 65
million US dollars is to be invested, the board chairman added.
</P>
<P>
According to Bomani, if all goes well, the additional
investment was likely to double the firm's annual production from
55 million liters at present to 110 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was now enjoying dividends and excise
duty income has gone up from 12 billion Tanzanian Shillings (TSH)
(about 19.3 million US dollars) a year in 1993 to 48 billion TSHs
(about 77.4 miilion US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
This implies that the state could earn up to 100 billion TSHs
(about 161 million US dollars) in excise duty income by the year
2000.

<HEADLINE> Small Scale Quarrying Cause Problems in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Small scale quarrying in Zambia is
causing serious environmental problems and should be urgently
addressed, a Zambian environment official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper today quoted Willie Kalunga, Inspector of
the Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ), as saying here on
Wednesday that the quarrying especially in the capital has become
a worrying environmental concern and that little seems to be done
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
He said quarries are usually left uncovered after excavation
leaving water to collect and eventually turning them into
breeding areas for differenct diseases while the ground water
used for drinking is also contaminated.
</P>
<P>
The stone crushers themselves are exposed to a lot of health
risks as they inhale many rock particles during their work, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said a standing committee comprising members from the ECZ,
the Ministry of Mines, the Lusaka City Council and the
Eenvironment Ministry has been set up to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said that an alternative to the quarrying has
been elusive for some time because most of the people involved in
the activity are poor and depend on it for their livelihood.

<HEADLINE> Rebels See Hope for Resuming Peace Talks With Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Muslim rebel group said today it
has seen hope for the resumption of peace negotiations with the
Philippine government with the mediation of a Muslim leader in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Mura, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF), said the group also saw hope for the normalization of the
peace and order condition in central Mindanao after talks
Wednesday with Governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM) Nur Misuari.
</P>
<P>
Murad, who is in charge of MILF military affairs, disclosed
that MILF leaders met Misuari in its biggest camp, Camp Abubakar
in Barira municipality in Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Misuari was earlier asked by President Fidel Ramos to help
bring back rebel negotiators to the negotiating table. The MILF
suspended the peace talks late last month after its second biggest
camp in Cotabato province was seized by the military.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting with Misuari as "brotherly," Murad said
Misuari's mediation was welcomed by the MILF leadership.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Misuari and the MILF leadership laid down a
number of proposals to facilitate the resumption of the
negotiations, according to Murad.
</P>
<P>
Murad said the MILF reiterated its conditions for reopening the
peace talks, which include the pull-out of military troops in
"MILF-controlled areas", the cessation of military operations
against the MILF and the return of evacuees to their original
places.
</P>
<P>
Murad stressed that the MILF's position on the pull-out of
government troops and the cessation of military operations is
non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
He said Misuari promised to bring their proposals to the
attention of Ramos and to convince the military to stop launching
offensive operations against the MILF.
</P>
<P>
But Murad refused to reveal the details regarding the proposals
made by Misuari, saying the MILF's Central Committee has not yet
discussed the matter.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, who is also chairman of the former rebel group, the
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), was elected the ARMM
governor after the MNLF forged a peace deal with Manila last
September.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the MNLF, refused to be
included in the MNLF-government peace accord and began its own
peace talks with the government this January.

glaucoma, onchocerciasis (commonly known as river blindness),
trachoma, corneal blindness from measles and malnutrition.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Investors seeking refuge from
gold's recent share market rout moved into banking and insurance
stocks today, prompting a late rally which saw the Australian
share market finish only moderately down.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trade, the all ordinaries index was down 1.7
points at 2,694.4 staging a sharp turnaround after the release of
June jobs data which sparked renewed hopes of a possible easing of
official interest rates.
</P>
<P>
A Sydney-based broker said the market firmed after the release
of Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing total employment
rose 11,900 to 8.3927 million in June.
</P>
<P>
"That definitely turned things around today, however, I think a
cut in interest rates is still a possibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index closed 14.5 points down at 1,430.1,
while the all industrials index finished 12.1 points higher at
4,318.8.
</P>
<P>
The bank index rose 82.3 points to 5,049.5 with ANZ Bank
jumping 29 cents to close at 10.10 Australian dollars, Westpac
Bank was up 15 cents and Commonwealth piled on 23 cents to end the

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar closes Weaker After Job Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian money markets
interpreted today's labor force data as adding to the case for an
official rate cut, and drove the local currency down.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 74.33 US cents, down from its
74.42 US cents finish yesterday, after bottoming at 74.10 shortly
after the release of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)
June labor data.
</P>
<P>
The ABS data released this morning showed that in June total
employment rose 11,900 compared with an average market forecast of
a 30,000 increase.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate was 8.5 percent, down from 8.8 percent
previously.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Bank's foreign exchange manager Wayne Raven said,
expectation of an interest rate cut had moved from "if" to "when"
and that local unit's outlook showed a bias which was "very much
on the downside".
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia last cut its official cash rate
to 5.5 percent on May 23, which brought it in line with the
equivalent official rate in the United States.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rate, the Australian dollar closed at 83.74 from
83.94 against the yen and at 1.3113 from 1.3092 against the mark.

<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Although the final communique of the NATO Madrid summit did
not mention when or whether France would return to the military
integrated structure of the military alliance, it is clear that the
United States is pushing France to make a decision before the end of
the year, because all the key posts of NATO in Europe, which France
expects to take, will have been taken by other countries by then.
</P>
<P>
-- On the fifth day of fighting between Cambodia's royalist
forces supporting First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and those
supporting Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, Cambodia was plunged a
little more into chaos on Wednesday. Thousands of foreigners, most
of them from Southeast Asian countries, were waiting for evacuation
on the Pochentong internatinal airport of Phnom Penh, where a
commando from Thailand was deployed to secure the evacuations.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French experts estimate that public deficit of France will
stand at 3.5 to 4 percent of its GDP by the end of the year, if
the government does not sell its 37.5 billion franc (6.3 billion
U.S. dollar) stocks of the France Telecom telecommunication
corporation.
</P>
<P>
-- The French Minister of National Education, Research and
Technology, Claude Allegre, said that he plans to develop an
education industry in France, and suggested that all universities
make obligatory one hour of philosophy teaching for first-year
college students.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Collection of World Constitutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 translators and
jurists have just published a collection of world constitutions,
expected to fill in gaps in the field of legal science.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the research office under the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
the 2,200-page book with more than 4.68 million Chinese
characters, published by Qingdao Press, includes constitutions
currently in effect of most of the countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
The book also includes constitutional documents of many
countries in contemporary and modern times, and gives a brief
account of the constitution-making history of every country.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to depend upon, and give full play to, our
constitution in order to develop the socialist democracy and to
build a sound legal system," Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the
NPC Standing Committee today told a meeting on the publication of
the Collection of World Constitutions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that theoretical research should be made of the
constitutions, and the book provides precious first-hand material
for the research.
</P>
<P>
According to jurists, the book reflects the new changes in
constitutions, and in the political and economic systems of many
countries. It also uses new data in the field, which will benefit
a comparative study on constitutions, they said.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that China has made references to foreign
experience when formulating its constitution: In 1954, legislators
studied the constitutions of the former Soviet Union, Romania,
Poland and France when drafting the first constitution for new
China. And 28 years later when the constitution was revised, they
made a comparative study on constitutions of more than 30
countries.
</P>
<P>
China's new Constitution was promulgated and put into force in
1982.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The investment environment in
this largest economic and financial center of China has improved
significantly over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Official records show that investors from 73 countries and
regions have invested tens of billion of US dollars in Shanghai,
and over 200 international financial institutions and up to 1,000
multinationals have had a presence here.
</P>
<P>
Investors from the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
the European Union, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan agree
that Shanghai enjoys apparent advantages in terms of the overall
investment environment, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
They say that Shanghai's social and economic environment and
its rapid economic growth are most attractive to them.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the Shanghai economy has been growing at a rate of
more than 13 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Improvement in the legal system and a profusion of talented
human resources also make Shanghai appealing to overseas
investors, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that currently more than 11,500 Shanghai
residents are working at overseas-funded enterprises.

</P>
<P>
As the head of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) Committee of Four on Sierra Leone, Ikimi is expected to seek
support from the UN Security Council for ECOWAS's initiative to restore
the legitimate government of outsted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi's trip was ordered by ECOWAS Chairman, Nigerian Head

believed to be based in the airport, through which outsted president
Kabbah has in the few days called on the Koromah government to step down.
</P>
<P>
The trading of heavy gun fire at the airport caused casualties on
both sides and sent thousands of residents nearby on fleeing,
according to reports reaching here.

<HEADLINE> Science Helping China's Cotton Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's 4.5-million-ha of cotton
fields are doing better than last year, with the blossoming stage
coming five days earlier in major cotton producing areas, a good
sign for this year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of Agriculture Bai Zhijian told a recent meeting
on cotton production in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, that plastic sheeting was applied to nearly 60
percent of this year's cotton acreage, and transplanted seedlings
were used for 40 percent of the total growing area.
</P>
<P>
Hybrid-seed areas accounted for more than 90 percent of the
land planted, which is a further guarantee of a good harvest, Bai
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China began a nationwide campaign to promote cotton
production through science and technology, and managed to raise
its per-ha average yield from 7,860 kg to 8,895 kg.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, which is China's largest cotton producer, harvested
more than 900,000 tons of cotton last year, with a per-ha average
output of 11,760 kg, the highest in the nation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Takes Measures to Protect Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Since Thailand announced its
adoption of a managed float policy on the baht on July 3, the
Philippine monetary authorities have been taking measures to fend
the peso off spillover negative effects from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The baht's devaluation sparked turmoil in Asian financial
market. Some market analysts predicted that the Philippine peso
would be the next target for speculators, citing the many things
the two countries' economies have in common.
</P>
<P>
On July 3, volume turnover at the Philippine Dealing System
(PDS), the country's electronic currencies exchanges, hit an
all-time high of 1.049 billion U.S. dollars, almost five times as
high as the market's average daily volume for the past six months.
</P>
<P>
It was a clear sign that the peso was under speculative
attacks, analysts said. The same attacks, which came out of fears
that the peso may devalue, also sent the country's stock market
tumbling again.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Central Bank quickly responded to the attacks.
While heavily selling dollars to absorb excess pesos, it
immediately raised the closely watched overnight borrowing rate
from 15 to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
A hike in the overnight rate made it more expensive for banks
to hold onto dollars as the same amount of funds, when converted
into the peso, would earn much more in the overnight facility of
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank's timely intervention succeeded. It curbed a sharp
depreciation of the peso, sending the dollar-peso exchange rate
back to normal at one dollar to 26.37 pesos.
</P>
<P>
During the past 12 months, the peso has been fluctuating within
a very narrow band range of about 0.5 to 1 percent, averaging one
dollar to 26.4 pesos.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippine financial market has become very
sensitive to any speculation after much turmoil due to some bad
news from the outside, especially from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, a Singapore newspaper quoted Philippine finance
chief Roberto de Ocampo as saying Manila favored a slight
devaluation of the peso, putting the currency once again under
heavy attack.
</P>
<P>
The volume of foreign exchange traded at the PDS quickly rose
to 633 million Monday morning. To show its determination to defend
the peso, the central bank again raised the overnight rate to a
two-year high of 30 percent from 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time in a week that the bank increased the
overnight rate. Earlier this year, the rate stood at only 7.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The last time the rate hit 30 percent was in 1995 at the height
of the Mexican currency crisis. Because of the bank's swift
intervention, the country's entire banking system and the peso
remained steady.
</P>
<P>
The bank's action once again proved successful on Monday. But
meanwhile, a controversy erupted between businessmen and the
government about the country's foreign exchange policy.
</P>
<P>
The central bank and the Philippine government have been
favoring a stable exchange rate and even a slight appreciation of
the peso. They insist that the current dollar-peso exchange rate
is determined by market forces.
</P>
<P>
Exporters and economists, however, said the peso is overvalued
and undermined the competitiveness of Filipino products in the
global markets. They recommended a 2- to 6-percent devaluation of
the peso against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they said the current exchange rate is not
market-determined since the government has been letting the peso
traded at a very narrow band through frequent intervention.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos has expressed interest in reviewing the
foreign exchange policy, but said "not at this time." He wants the
baht, whose movement continues to feed speculative attacks on the
peso, to stabilize first.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ramos is wary that there might be a massive devaluation of
the peso when it (review of the foreign exchange policy) is done
at this time," sources close to the president said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Philippines has successfully kept the foreign
exchange rate stable, but that does not mean that the peso has
been safe. Since Monday, the Manila Stock Exchange index has been
nose-diving on rising fears that the peso may devalue.
</P>
<P>
The index fell by 4 percent to a two-year low of 2589.2 points
on Wednesday. And today, the decline continued as the local bourse
plummeted 78 points more to another record low.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said that if the trend continues, the peso
would face mounting pressure and force the central bank to take
more measures to avoid the breakdown of the peso.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bourse Falls to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Composite Index
(Phisix) fell to a new low today despite the government's vow to
use all means to stabilize the country's foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The 30-stock Phisix, the main index of the Philippine Stock
Exchange, plunged by 78.05 points or 3.01 percent to close at
2,511.15, the lowest since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Phisix fell 109.46 points, the biggest
one-day loss since April, after investors opted to sell their
shares for fears that the Philippine Central Bank may devalue the
country's currency peso.
</P>
<P>
The country's currency market has been volatile this week
because of rumors about a devaluation of the peso after Thailand's
currency was floated last week.
</P>
<P>
Traders said investors remained worried over the prospect of
the peso although the central bank Wednesday ruled out the
possibility of depreciating the peso and pledged to take all means
to protect it.
</P>
<P>
At today's trading session, the total market volume shrank to
5.53 billion shares from Wednesday's 6.56 billion. Total value
turnover was 2.67 billion pesos (101.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
All sub-indices ended on the downside except the oil sector
which rose 0.06 points to finish at 5.48. The
commercial-industrial and mining sectors continued to register
biggest drops after closing at 3,428.53 (-93.95) and 3,618.52
(-61.9) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The broader All Shares Index also recorded a substantial
21.83-point decline to close at 823.42. Losers continued to
outnumber gainers 105 to 25, with 50 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Achieve 6-Percent GDP Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's economy has already
shown that it has the potential to achieve a gross domestic
product (GDP) growth rate of 6 percent by the end of 1997,
compared with a 3.8-percent growth in 1996, according to the Bank
of Ceylon.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Economic Research Division, in a latest report on
"Trends and Prospects 1997," predicted a 3.5-percent growth in
agriculture, forestry and fishery on the basis of a rebound in the
paddy sector from the slump experienced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector is forecast to grow by nearly 10
percent in 1997 compared with 8.9 percent in 1996 while the
construction sector is projected to increase by 5.5 percent as
against 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the latest Colombo Consumer Price Index for
May 1997 as saying that compared with May last year, this year has
recorded a continuing moderate inflation rate, which declined from
16.8 percent in December 1996 to 7.8 percent in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government estimated average annual inflation for 1997 at
around 9 percent, saying it is determined to continue with its
anti-inflation policies.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report, with possible increases in
the prices of utilities such as electricity and telecommunication,
the possible introduction of value-added tax and the depreciation
of the rupee, inflation will average 10 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Amnesty For Sri Lanka Army Deserters Declared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An amnesty has been declared by
Sri Lankan Army Authorities for army deserters with effect from
today until midnight July 21, 1997, a military spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, the spokesman said Sri Lankan
Army Authorities made this decision consequent to a number of
requests by the parents of deserters and some deserters
themselves.
</P>
<P>
There are over 10,000 army deserters in the country, according
to the spokesman. The army authorities have granted amnesty three
times for army deserters since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The first amnesty was granted on June 1, 1995 and expired on
July  4, 1995. During that period 2,880 men returned. The second
was from November 24 to December 15, 1995. During the third phase
from June 10 to July 31 last year, 4,200 deserters had reported

<HEADLINE> Closure of Lusaka Brewery Plant Ordered for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka City Council (LCC) has
ordered the closure of the Makeni Brewery Plant in the capital for
polluting environment.
</P>
<P>
"The plant is emitting smoke within the residential area and
this is a nuisance," LCC Public Relations Manager Daniel M'soka
was quoted today by Times of Zambia as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plant has no sanitary accommodation, its employees have
not been certified fit to handle food and it operates without a
manufacturer's licence, according to the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The council has informed the Environmental Council of
Zambia (ECZ) about the illegal activities of the brewery plant
and the order was communicated to the director of the plant on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have served them with an enforcement notice and if they do
not close their premises within the 28 days limit, demolition
squad will move in," M'soka added.
</P>
<P>
The council has turned down the plea by the director of the
brewery to remove it from the residential area to light
industrial area.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure order was prompted by Environment Minister
William Harrington, who asked the LCC on Tuesday to probe into
the brewery plant after residents complained to him over the foul
smell from the plant.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Iran to Deal Severely with Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister Ali
Mohammad Besharati has said that his country will deal severely
with foreign offenders, the Iranian news agency (IRNA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The official IRNA report quoted the Interior Minister as saying
Wednesday that foreign refugees breaking the (Iranian) law "will
be severely dealt with in accordance with agreements reached with
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)."
</P>
<P>
Besharati made the statement in response to the case in which
an Afghan man was accused of killing 11 Iranian women in a stolen
car.
</P>
<P>
The criminal, identified as Abdullah Abdurrahman, 28, was
arrested last week on charges of the murdering 11 Iranian women.
</P>
<P>
Posing himself as a night-time cab driver, he would drive his
female passengers outside the city to the dark wilderness west of
Tehran and beat or stab them to death and then took their
valuables and set their corpses on fire.
</P>
<P>
The case has aroused wide public attention in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The English daily Iran News said, in its editorial published
today, that "such criminals and their crimes become
earth-shattering when the laxness of a country's law enforcement
becomes an evident and integral part of the daily violation of the
national code."
</P>
<P>
The daily called on the parliament to make a thorough
investigation about the slackness of the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Prosecutor General Morteza Moqtadayee vowed that the
Afghan criminal will be punished to the fullest extent of the
law, i.e. execution or death by hanging, the capital punishment
of the Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister admitted that it is the ministry's duty
to insure discipline and security at the borders, combat
smugglers and drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
But the minister did not specify what kind of measures Iran
will take to deal with foreign refugees, who constitute one of
the major sources for the increasing crimes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that in the country there are 1.28 million Afghans,
490,000 Iraqis and some refugees from other states.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The South African government has
agreed in principle to help war-ravaged Rwanda to rebuild its country
and economy, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
The assurance of assistance was extended by South African
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to his Rwandan counterpart Paul
Kagame, who is currently in the country for an official visit,
following their talks on Wednesday in Pretoria, said the source.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government had asked for help in the military, the
police, health, education, trade and industry and the energy sectors,
according to Mbeki's spokesman Thami Ntenteni.
</P>
<P>
Ntenteni said, however, the details of the Rwandan request still
have to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
He also said an agreement had been reached that South African
delegations would be sent to Rwanda to determine the needs of the
Rwandans before working out the kind of assistance to be offered.
</P>

"South Africa recognises the fact that Rwanda needs this assistance
and is sympathetic to the positions of the Rwandans. We are going to
assist to the best of our ability," added Ntenteni.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda experienced a devastating civil war in 1994, which resulted
in the deaths of about one million people. enditem

<HEADLINE> No Clean Water for One Third of S. Africans: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Twelve million people,
nearly one third of the population in South Africa, have no
access to clear water and 21 million are without sewerage
services, according to a survey by the Department of Water
Affairs and Forestry.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Sowetan quoted spokesman of the department
Thuso Ramaema as reporting that the government did not have
enough resources to deliver sustainable water services to all
communities and had to rely on the private sector to "get the job
done quickly".
</P>
<P>
Ramaema denied accusations by the South African Municipal Workers
Union that the government was privatizing water and sewerage services.
</P>
<P>
"Government money is being used to pay for the water
infrastructure and on completion of construction and training of
local people to maintain and operate the pumps, the infrastructure
will be passed on to local governemnt," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa lacks water resouces. Ever since it took power in
1994, the Government of National Unity led by President Nelson
Mandela has been making great effort to solve the water problem.
</P>
<P>
For now, the South African government has allocated 50 million
Rand (11.36 million U.S. dollars) for nationwide water project
construction. Constructions of water projects in 693 areas across
the country are due to be completed before the year 2000,
government sources said early this year. enditem

<HEADLINE> US reassured Egypt of No Change in Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration has
reassured Egypt that it has no plan to cut off its annual 2.1
billion U.S. dollars aid to Egypt in the coming fiscal year, The
Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reassurances from the U.S. side came during the
Egyptian-U.S. Partnership Subcommittee meetings which were held
in Washington this week and attended by Egyptian Minister of
Trade and Supplies Ahmed Goweili and Minister of Finance Mohi
Eddin el-Gharib.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee recommended in
mid-June to end allocations to Egypt as a punishment to its
"harsh approach" to the Mideast peace-making.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it upheld maintaining Israel's 3 billion dollars
grant and creating a 250-million-dollar fund for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Goweili said that the U.S. would offer Egypt technical
assistance in the areas of information technology, finance
services and communications to benefit from opportunities offered
by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic assistance to Egypt amounted to 21 billion
dollars between 1975 and 1996. At first, the aid took the forms
of repayable loans and unrepayable grants. But since 1982, most
of the aid was made in grants.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the U.S. called on Egypt to increase the
economic growth rates from the current 5 percent to 7 percent in
the coming years through booming up investment by offering
incentives and facilities and reducing custom duties.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also discussed necessary measures to set up
a joint free trade zone and increase Egyptian export of
ready-made clothes and textiles to the U.S. markets as well as
means to protect U.S. intellectual property rights.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Drafts New Labor Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has drafted a new labor
law in a bid to boost benefits for employees in the country's
private sector where more than 80 percent of the workers are
expatriates.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported today that the law, to be submitted to the
Cabinet and then to the Kuwaiti National Assembly for approval,
will come into force before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The labor law, drafted by Kuwaiti Ministry of Social Affairs
and Labor, calls for increasing public holidays, sick leave and
work injury benefits for employees.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, annual leave for employees in the first five
years will be increased from the existing 14 days to 21 days, and
from 21 days to 30 days in the subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
It will allow the setting up of special recruitment agencies to
provide the needed employees to businessmen from inside and
outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to eradicate the rampant visa smuggling in Kuwait,
the law bans employers from hiring expatriates without permission
from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor.
</P>
<P>
It also forbids businessmen from employing laborers from
outside Kuwait and failing to provide them with jobs. Violators
will face a jail term up to three years and a fine of 16,500
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The law also bans teenagers before the age of 15 from working
in the private sector and allows those above 15 to work after
obtaining a special permission from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait currently has more than 1 million foreign laborers and
the government has been striving to increase the percentage of
local laborers in the private sector as well as in the state-owned
economic sectors.

heroin that are produced in Afghanistan and Pakistan, to Turkey
and eventually Europe.

Iranian authorities concerned said earlier that some 191 tonnes
of narcotics were confiscated from drug dealers over the previous
Iranian calendar year ending March 21, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Private Entrepreneurs Helping The Needy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Chinese
private entrepreneurs are joining the effort to help needy people
escape the bonds of poverty.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 private entrepreneurs in Shanxi province in north
China have spent almost 100 million yuan on 45 aid-the-poor
projects that helped 9,500 rural laborers find jobs and provided
training for 12,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs themselves had benefited from the reform and
opening-up policy, which encouraged people to make money, or, as a
popular saying goes, "To be rich is glorious".
</P>
<P>
Li Anming, the chairman of the Antai International Enterprise
(Group) Co. Ltd. in Jiexiu city in Shanxi Province, is one
example, having donated 13 million yuan to help people in poor
areas and to provide welfare funds.
</P>
<P>
"We are voluntarily throwing ourselves into the anti-poverty
work, as a way of paying back what we have got from the good
policy," Li explained.
</P>
<P>
Liang Wenhai, chairman of the Shanxi Huanhai Industrial
Co. Ltd., followed in Li's tracks, and is expected to spend 30
million yuan on helping raise the standard of living in Hongdu
Village in Zuoquan county, where villagers' per capita income was
only 290 yuan, and on opening businesses in a poor county in
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Chinese have become prosperous since the late
1970s, but there are still 58 million poor people in rural parts
of China, which is still fighting a nationwide poverty relief
campaign.

of 80 points, up from 78.7 points.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.3 million copies of the inquiry were handed out and
nearly 27,000 of them were returned, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Passengers are most satisfied with the service of
stewardesses, who got 92 points," Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the best airports and airlines are
China Eastern Airlines, Xiamen Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines,
Xiamen's Gaoqi Airport, and Liangjiang Airport in Guilin.

<HEADLINE> National Workshop on Promotion of Rural Microfinance Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Easing and eliminating poverty is
a major task in China's development plan and is an ongoing basic
policy of the Chinese government, a senior Chinese official said
at today's opening ceremony of the First National
Consultation/Workshop on the Promotion of Rural Microfinance in
China.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the gathering in Beijing, Yang Rudai,
vice-chairman of Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference National Committee, said that it is a strategic goal of
the Chinese government to solve the food and clothing issue of the
poor people in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the reform and opening-up drive in the late
1970s, the Chinese government has carried out its large-scale
poverty alleviation and development campaign in an organized
manner, and taken a series of special policies and targeted
measures. For example, specialized agencies for poverty relief
have been set up and input into the project has increased.
</P>
<P>
These steps have produced remarkable results, as the number of
poor people without food and clothing has dropped from 250 million
in 1978 to 58 million in 1996, and the proportion of the Chinese
poor population in the world total has decreased from one fourth
to one twentieth, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
Poverty alleviation through credit is an effective way of
speeding up poverty reduction and development, Yang noted, saying
that as a policy bank of the Chinese government, the Agricultural
Development Bank of China (ADBC) has effectively practiced the
work of poverty alleviation through credit and made a significant
contribution to the job of wiping out poverty in China's rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
To improve its results in the area, Yang pointed out that China
needs to strengthen international exchanges and cooperation and
expand its opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Yang noted that he hopes the international participants and
experts attending the meeting will freely exchange views and find
an approach to the worldwide problem.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, jointly sponsored by ADBC and the Asia
Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association (APRACA) and the
German Agency for Technical Cooperation, is designed to brainstorm
possibilities for worldwide poverty alleviation through rural
credit.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun and State Councillor Chen
Junsheng each sent congratulatory letters to the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Germany, India, Indonesia, China and other
countries, and representatives of some foreign countries in
Beijing participated in the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yuanliang, president of ADBC, Mohd Rosli Abdul Aziz, former
chairman of APRACA and president of the Agricultural Bank of
Malaysia attended the opening ceremony and made speeches.

<P>
HARBIN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province can give credit to advanced technology for the rapid
development of animal husbandry programs.
</P>
<P>
The Heilongjiang Livestock Research Institute, the sole body of
its kind for comprehensive research on livestock in the province,

which has earned about 40 billion yuan in economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the institute has achieved 146 recognized
scientific and technological findings, 14 of which are up to State
level. Scientific personnel in the institute have helped breed
seven new strains of livestock and had remarkable success in the
development of fodder compound and improved strains.
</P>
<P>
So far, the provincial animal husbandry has generated 14.5 billion
yuan in output value a year, accounting for a third of the local
agricultural total. The province now has nearly one million milk
cows in stock, leading the country in the output of milk and
dairy products. The per capita egg consumption in the province

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
on Wednesday urged Zimbabwean companies to take the lead in
investment in their own country instead of relying solely on
foreign investment for a meaningful transformation of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
''It would be unreasonable for us to suppose that we can rely
on foreign investment for the large scale transformations that we
are determined to achieve under the second phase of our economic
reform program,'' Mugabe said when he addressed the conference of
the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries in the town of Victoria
Falls.
</P>
<P>
The president urged local companies to be more energetic and
resourceful and take advantage of investment and export
opportunities in the region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"We must redouble our efforts to penetrate markets around the
world including the Far East and North America to assure our
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the government and the private sector is
vital for the future of the nation, Mugabe said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A fossil of the skull and neck
bones of a two-horned rhinoceros has been unearthed in Xiaoyi in
north China's Shanxi Province, proving that the enormous creature
inhabited the area in ancient times.
</P>

Experts said the fossil belongs to a rhinoceros which lived in
the area more than two million years ago. Fossil of the two-horned
rhinoceros have seldom been found in the country.

Scientists and workers, organized by the city authorities,
removed 20,000 sq meters of earth and stones before they dug
the rhino fossil and those of other animals out of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
"We still expect to find the fossil remains for the rest of the
rhino's body in other parts of the mountain, that have not yet
been excavated," said Zhu Jingyi, an archeologist and director of
the city's museum.

<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- China's first auto leasing chain
was established in Beijing today, another new development in the
chain-store business, following the opening of first chain store
for automobile sales in May.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Shijitong Auto Club was set up by the country's major
auto makers and will set up franchises in Shanghai, Tianjin,
Chongqing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Shenzhen, and 29 other major
cities. Anyone with a driver's license who is a member of an auto
club in any of these cities can rent a car at a rate below the
market price, said Guo Jiyuan, president of the club.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that his long-term goal is to set up auto-leasing
clubs in all cities which have airports. There are 101 airports of
different sizes in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Fengwu, an official from the China Industrial and
Commercial Administration, expressed optimism about the prospect
of the auto-leasing club, saying that it marks the beginning of
China's catching up to western countries, where they "take auto
leasing companies for granted."
</P>
<P>
The official said that China had more than 700 other
chain-store businesses with over 10,000 outlets by the end of last
year.

LUSAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian leather products company in
Lusaka, Bimzi, has penetrated the southern African markets by selling
its products in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Zambia Daily Mail today quoted the company's
Sales Executive Belina Tembo as saying that her company is saving the
country foreign exchange through export of leather products to
Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana and Malawi.
</P>
<P>
She, however, declined to disclose the volume of exports to those
countries, but said that the goods include leather jackets, handbags,
footballs, wallets, belts and leather folders. The company is
working towards the production of foodware as soon as feasibility
studies are completed.
</P>
<P>
Bimzi has been in operation since 1979. It uses about 90 percent
of local raw materials with the exception of zippers and buckles
which are imported.
</P>
<P>
Belina Tembo said that competition, which is growing under the
liberalization policy, is helping the company to improve quality and
meet international standards. With a workforce of less than 100
people and already producing quality leather products, Bimzi is
set to meet the challenges of the competitive world trade. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- In addition to fetching good prices
on the domestic market, China's garment industry has resumed its
export surge, helping check a downward plunge in foreign sales.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter this year the garment output of
enterprises at or above the county level saw a 9.29 percent rise
nationwide from the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
A survey of national key garment undertakings shows that the
businesses earning comparatively bigger profits are mostly
involved in the production of shirts, suits, children's
collections, and eiderdown outer wear. The profit margins of these
products are 13.5 percent, 13.4 percent, 9.3 percent and 3.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The country handled nearly 5.9 billion US dollars-worth of
exports of clothing and accessories during the first quarter of
this year, up 41 percent over the same period of 1996. The exports
included an increasing volume of high value-added products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thanks to price rises on the domestic market, the
garment industry recorded approximately 86 billion yuan in
domestic retail sales during the first quarter of this year,
accounting for 13 percent of the total retail sales of domestic
consumer goods.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Palestinian Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath met in Tel Aviv late on Wednesday night
in an effort to solve major overdue issues.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers, with U.S. and Egyptian officials looking on,
agreed to expedite operations of the Palestinian International
Airport at Dahaniya in the Gaza Strip, according to a report of
the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour meeting took place at the residence of Egyptian
ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny. U.S. ambassador Martin Indyk was
also present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also reached an understanding that talks on the
Gaza sea port and "safe passage" between the Gaza Strip and West
Bank will resume next week. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy is
expected to form a team for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told Sha'ath that the Palestinians may start
introducing electronic equipments the airport needs, but the
airport will not open until security arrangements are finalized.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli Defense Ministry statement was quoted as saying that
the meeting was efficient and proceeded in a good atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The three issues in question were supposed to have been solved,
together with Israeli troops withdrawal from Hebron, in accordance
with the Oslo peace accord signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the rightwing Likud government has delayed it under the
pretext of security concerns. Talks over the issues came to a stop
after Israel began construction of Har Homa settlement in East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has declared that
political talks will resume on the condition that Israel suspends
Har Homa building and stops expansion of the settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israel replied that it wants to continue the peace process,
but rejected the idea on Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
The Mordechai-Sha'ath meeting was believed to be part of the
U.S.-Egyptian effort to restart the talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The economic powerhouse of Jiangsu
Province in east China is making an effort to develop its nine
agriculture development zones into a showcase of export-oriented
agriculture for the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the province has spent 640 million
yuan on building infrastructure facilities in the 21.2-sq-km
zones, which are located mainly in farming resource-rich areas,
such as Changzhou, Nantong, Xuzhou, and Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May this year, the agriculture development zones
had approved the establishment of 298 enterprises, including 75
overseas-backed enterprises with a total investment of 88 million
US dollars. These enterprises have produced 41 million US dollars
worth of exports, said Xu Jianmin, an official at the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
The Jiangsu Haisheng Group in the Nantong Agriculture
Development Zone co-funded an aquatic products company with a bank
from the Netherlands. The company involved an investment of nearly
30 million US dollars, and is competing profitably in the world
market.

<HEADLINE> Southeast China Province Boosting Aquaculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's coastal province
of Fujian has set itself the goal of 3.65 million tons of aquatic
products annually by the turn of the century, with more than 39.5
billion yuan in output value in aquaculture.
</P>
<P>
It already led the country with per capita consumption of
nearly 86 kg of aquatic products in 1996, four times the national
average, and ranked third in the country, after Guangdong and
Shandong provinces, in production, with 2.84 million tons of
aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
The province is rich in marine resources and in fact
administers a greater sea area than land. Its aquaculture
contributes more than four-fifths of the output value of local
marine fisheries. Along its 3,300-km coastline there are 125 bays,
and more than 1,200 islands and islets. It has 125,000 sq km of
fishing areas, 190,000 ha. of seaside areas, and more than 410,000
ha. of shallow water areas.
</P>
<P>
Fujian had 90,000 ha. for marine culture in 1996, nearly 70,000
ha. of which was for shellfish and seaweed farming. Output of
shellfish and seaweed is expected to rise to 797,000 tons this
year from 719,000 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 the province is expected to earn one billion
US dollars from exports of aquatic products, a big leap from the
650 million US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Also by then, nearly half of the province's marine production,
or 670,000 tons, will come from deep sea fishing, while processed
aquatic products will account for two-fifths of the local total
seafood products.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province
witnessed a rapid growth in the production of grain, rape, meat
and aquatic products in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The province's summer grain yield totaled nearly 9.2 billion
kg, up four percent over last year's figure. The yield of rape
reached 1.3 billion kg, an increase of about 10 percentage points
over last year, its second-biggest harvest ever.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the overall output of meat in the first
half of the year could reach 1.25 million tons, of which pork is
estimated at 870,000 tons. The total yield of poultry and eggs may
reach 550,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The province's aquatic production has also seen a rapid
increase, and the output is expected to exceed 520,000 tons, up
34.4 percent over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Officials attribute this success to the province's stable
agricultural policies and increased investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Anhui spent more than 82.5 million yuan (about 10.3 million US
dollars) on agriculture in the first five months of this year, up
47 percent over the same period of last year. Banks have also
extended more agricultural loans this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Qingyuan, a poverty-stricken
area in north Guangdong, China's wealthiest province, is one step
closer toward its long-cherished dream of becoming rich.
</P>
<P>
A massive migration program that started three years ago has
put 130,000 people, or 85 percent of the poorest people in the
region, to work on new tillable land that enable them to earn a
living.
</P>
<P>
They formerly lived in mountainous, sandy areas which are not
suitable for farming. Now working on the 8,000-plus hectares of
wasteland contracted from the local government, each of them can
earn an average 1,180 yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
So far the government has provided 137 million yuan for the
program. Most of the money was used to build new houses, the rest
went to building schools and training centers to provide children
with proper education and young people with technical training.
</P>
<P>
With the help of agro-technicians, the migrants have learned to
grow high-yielding rice, fruit trees and vegetables on the new
land.
</P>
<P>
Like the rest of the country, Guangdong has pledged to
eradicate poverty by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> India Public Leaders Facing Corruption Urged to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral has asked those in public life who face corruption
charges to resign forthwith on moral grounds, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
This is so far the clearest signal from the prime minister that
Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav should step down after the
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) charged him in a major
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
Yadav, former president of the ruling Janata Dal, was accused
of being involved in a fodder scandal in which huge sums of state
funds for purchasing fodder were embezzled.
</P>
<P>
Defying public opinion urging him to quit the post of Bihar
chief minister, Yadav floated a new party on Saturday, plunging
the two-month-old Gujral government into serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
Janata Dal, which used to be the biggest constituent of the
13-party United Front, lost its dominance in the ruling front
after the split.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Gujral, who is also from Janata Dal, has been
under great pressure that he should force the resignation of Yadav
as chief minister of Bihar, the second largest state in India.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a rally in India's Uttar Pradesh Wednesday, Gujral
said those holding public offices must subject themselves to the
test of probity and when people in public offices face charges of
corruption, they are left with no alternative but to give up their
office.
</P>
<P>
However he did not name any names.

SHANGHAI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Over the next three years,
Shanghai will build three major projects to help harness the Taihu
Lake, one of China's five largest lakes, according to Xia Keqiang,
deputy mayor of the municipality.
</P>
<P>
A leading group in charge of the construction has been
established for the three projects, which were decided this May at
a fourth meeting of the State Council on harnessing the Huaihe
River and the Taihu Lake. Cost is estimated at 1.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Construction will involve embankments, water-diversion
facilities for a 23.5-km-long river course, dredging and expansion
of a 5.1-km river course, and flood control facilities on the
upper reaches of the Huangpu.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work for construction is to be finished this year
and actual construction work will begin soon.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, an important part of the Taihu Lake Valley, has often
suffered from flood damage there. An effort has been made to
prevent major flood damage since 1991, when a severe flood hit the
Taihu Lake Basin.

<HEADLINE> Suspension of Seven Ordinances Necessary: HK Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- It's necessary and reasonable to
suspend operation of seven ordinances which were hastily enacted
at the last session of the Legislative Council under British Hong
Kong authorities, commentaries published by Hong Kong newspapers
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Legislative Provisions (Suspension of Operation) Bill,
tabled by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
Government, passed the first and second readings on Wednesday at a
full sitting of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
That the last Legislative Council adopted a batch of ordinances
only several days before the establishment of the HKSAR
represented an attitude which was far from responsible for the
Hong Kong people, a commentary carried by Hong Kong Commercial
Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Five of the ordinances are labor-related, but they didn't go
through any consultation or receive any examination by the Labor
Advisory Board, the commentary said. If kept effective in the
HKSAR, they will have an adverse impact on the society and will be
detrimental to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR Government took a prudent approach toward the
ordinances by proposing suspension of their operation, said the
commentary, adding the proposal embodied respect for and
safeguarding of Hong Kong's legal system.
</P>
<P>
The last Legislative Council made hasty legislation during its
last days only to force the HKSAR Government into accepting these
pieces of legislation. The HKSAR Government, however, is entitled
to reexamining the ordinances adopted by the last Legislative
Council, the commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao's commentary said, the last Legislative Council, by
adopting many labor-related ordinances shortly before July 1, was
not striving for the rights and interests of employees as it had
said, instead it was challenging the PLC and creating troubles for
the HKSAR Government.
</P>
<P>
Correct handling of the relationship between employers and
employees is quite important to Hong Kong, the commentary said.
However, the five ordinances adopted by the last Legislative
Council had an adverse effect on the labor relations, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is an international business hub with many countries
investing here. Therefore, creating a favorable investment
environment will enhance their confidence and play a vital role in
maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the commentary
noted.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang attended Wednesday's PLC
sitting. At a media session at the Legislative Council Building,
Tsang said, the five ordinances "might affect Hong Kong's
competitiveness and I believe this is certainly a very bad
development in the early days of the SAR."

BELGRADE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milosevic said today that
cooperation was the best way to resolve the political conflict
vexing the Republic of Srpska in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
His views were shared by Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of
Bosnia's multi-ethnic collective presidency, who held talks with
the president here today.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders believed cooperation between the parties concerned
could lead the country out of the political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also stressed the importance of thoroughly
implementing the Dayton agreement, adding that curbing various
criminal crimes and the grey economy was the government's top
priority after the war.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said both parties in the present conflict should make
some concessions and try to seek the common ground they should
share, according to the constitution and the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
President of the Republic of Srpska Biljana Plavsic and
hardliners led by Krajisnik have been locked in a crisis for more
than a week following Plavsic's accusations that Krajisnik and
Radovan Karazdic were involved in large-scale corruption.

DHAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
AMS Kibria has vowed to speed up the financial reform and
dramatically improve the trouble-hit banking sector in the current
fiscal year, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
"We have made every effort in every sector in order to speed up
reforms, but actual progress is quite limited. A lot of things
have to be done," he said in his concluding remarks at a workshop
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
jointly organized the final workshop on the bank's support for
institutional development of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The minister said qualitative changes could be attainable in
government activities through continuous endeavor.
</P>
<P>
"We are conscious about all the shortcomings and very much
sincere to overcome those," he said criticizing the mentality of
hiding problems and guarding data. "Nothing should be kept
secret," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's stock market in the 1996-97 fiscal year
experienced a heavy blow by the biggest-ever stock manipulation
scandal while the banking sector was being strapped by huge amount
of defaulted loans.
</P>
<P>
The minister hoped that the ongoing ADB-sponsored reform
program would bring positive result within a few months in the
market.

MANILA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Passenger car sales dropped 16.7
percent in the Philippines in June as total units sold decreased
to 6,566 from 7,884 posted in the same month of last year, a
local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decline in passenger car sales last month is the biggest
year-on-year drop recorded for this year, the Manila Chronicle
said, citing a report from the Chamber of Automotive and
Manufacturers of the Philippines Inc.
</P>
<P>
Passenger car sales for the first half of the year also
recorded a 7.8-percent drop from the year-ago level, with a total
of 43,879 units sold during the period.
</P>
<P>
The chamber's report attributed the unfavorable growth in car
sales to the technical correction of the market as a result of
accelerated selling last year and the reduction in the volumes of
applications.
</P>
<P>
After the strong performance displayed last year, car sales
have been on a decline since the start of the year partially due
to the slow processing and selective approval by banks and
financing institutions in car loan applications.
</P>
<P>
For this year, the government estimated the total passenger car
sales at 102,000 units, or 15 percent higher than the 88,648 units
sold in 1996.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai House Committee on
Religious Affairs considers a television advertisement in the
United States as offensive to Buddhists and has decided to draw
the attention of the U.S. Congress to it.
</P>
<P>
A TV commercial by an American sports shoe company features
young monks who are asked to join in a basketball game and it
turns out the whole group wear the company's shoes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Religious Affairs Department of the Thai
government asked the Thai ambassador to the United States to
approach the shoe manufacturer to stop using the advertisement but
to no avail.
</P>
<P>
Similar ads have appeared in several magazines.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the first time American manufacturers have
offended Buddhism with such commercial ads," Committee Chairman
Den Tohmeena said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will see to it that the manufacturer suspends the ads, and
we will explain to Americans how much Thai Buddhists respect their
religion and how they find such advertisements offensive," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Den also urged Buddhists in Thailand and foreign countries to
join the protest.

COLOMBO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels have
vandalized the radar and other equipment of the North Korean Break
Bulk Carrier "Moran Bong," which they had hijacked earlier,
according to local press reports today.
</P>

The vessel, hired by Sri Lanka to transport goods to the Jaffna
Peninsula, was on its way to Colombo from Point Pedro Tuesday when
heavily armed Sea Tigers hijacked it at Millaitivu.

According to reports, the rebels had also drawn out the fuel
from the vessel which is lying about a mile off the coast of
Millaitivu and they are believed to have booby-trapped the vessel
to prevent any naval action.
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier the rebels, who claim a section of the sea
in the area to be under its command, set fire to an Indonesian
passenger ship and abducted its crew. Two Indonesian crew members
were later released.

<HEADLINE> Protecting Giant Panda's Habitats (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 8 (Xinhua) -- The most effective way to protect
the endangered giant panda is to protect their natural habitats,
an official from the Giant Panda Protection Office of China'a
Forestry Ministry told Xinhua in an exclusive interview today.
</P>
<P>
He said that a series of Forestry Ministry and government
department efforts had reduced the threat from the people to the
giant panda's habitat, but because of a lack of funds the
situation is still not as good as it should be.
</P>
<P>
The official made a tour of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces,
where most of the giant pandas live, and explained that the weak
eco-system in their habitats is now the main threat to the
protection work.
</P>
<P>
"About 1,000 giant pandas in the world are now being separated
into small groups by human activities and highways, and there are
only three to five giant pandas in some of the smallest groups,"
he said, noting that this will lead to serious problems with
inbreeding and species degeneration.
</P>
<P>
He explained that an unstable food supply is another serious
ecological problem for this endangered species, and "What is
worse, bamboo, which is the staple food of the giant panda, have
been dying in large tracts for a period of time."
</P>
<P>
In the '70s and '80s, two serious problems with bamboo caused
the whole nation to get involved in a large-scale
save-the-giant-panda drive.
</P>
<P>
From 1983 to 1996, as many as 183 giant pandas suffering from
illness or malnutrition were found in the wild and saved, and a
large number, after recovering, were released to their natural
habitats.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, since 1992, when the "China Giant Panda and
Habitat Protection Project" was started by the Ministry of
Forestry, 11 natural reserves have been established, bringing the
number of natural reserves for the giant panda to 25.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Forestry Ministry has allocated 64 million
yuan (nearly 8 million US dollars) for the giant panda protection
project, and that, "Our goal is to continue to establish natural
reserves for the giant panda so that their natural habitats can be
put under state protection."

<P>
Over the next several years, there will be three new natural
reserves and 17 "green passage ways" linking various natural
reserves established to better protect the giant panda.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Ministry of Forestry also say that, since
1992, when China increased protection of the giant panda, a number
of timber mills have been shut down and people relocated to reduce
the harmful effects of humans on this endangered species that has
the top state protection.
</P>
<P>
The sources say that, since 1992, forestry departments, which
have a great deal of the responsibility for wildlife protection in
China, have made a greater effort to improve local people's lives
to reduce the pressure 0on the environment.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda protection staff have also turned to science to
look for solutions to breeding and food supply problems of this
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, there have been special funds for research on how
to retard flowering of bamboo to protect its growth. And the
"China Research Center for Giant Panda Protection" in the Wolong
National Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan province, has
produced 16 giant pandas through artificial reproduction over the
past five years, 12 of which survived.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most famous rare species,
and there are only about a thousand estimated to be in existence,
in 32 counties in western China's Shaanxi, Sichuan and Gansu
provinces.

<HEADLINE> Australian Defense Department Calls For More Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian defense department
has called for real increases in defense spending beyond the year
2000 to carry out plans to buy advanced weapons and military
facilities, the national newspaper the Australian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department cites a 270 million U.S. dollar annual shortfall
for three vital planned purchases -- Airborne Early Warning and
Control aircraft, helicopters for the Australian and New Zealand
Army Corps frigates and new offshore patrol vessels, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The department has told a parliamentary committee that "no
funding provision has yet been made for them."
 The paper said the defense department's proposal is certain to be
seen as self-serving, but added that a fierce debate over the
government's spending priorities was expected following budget
cuts that have also reduced the share of outlays for health,
education and social security.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Standing Committee of Foreign Affairs, Defense and
Trade committee is due to start hearing within the next month and
will report well before the next election.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Ian McLachlan, a close friend of Prime
Minister John Howard, has signaled he intends to fight for
increased funding.
</P>
<P>
The report said the defense department will back the bid for
"modest" real increases in the 7.8 billion U.S. dollar defense
budget by revealing details of an internal study showing the cost
of buying weapons systems is increasing by at least 4 percent a
year more than the rate of inflation.

TEGUCIGALPA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran government has
formally requested Mexico to eliminate its tariffs on meat imports.
</P>
<P>
Honduras's Economy and Livestock Ministry presented the request
since the farmers in the country believe they are receiving
prejudicial treatment with the current rate of 25 percent imposed
by Mexico.
</P>

The Honduran proposal is to have the tariff on the beef it
sells to Mexico eliminated completely within the framework of the
bilateral negotiations over free trade.

Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, which make up the Group of
three (CA-3), have been negotiating a free trade agreement with

In the last four years, a kilogram of meat has dropped from 1.3
U.S. dollars to 75 cents in the U.S. market which is the principal
market for this Honduran product. That is why Honduras is turning
to the Mexican market as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
Meat and sugar, both items which Mexico has in excess, are
among the products that would be considered in the CA-3
negotiations with that country.

<HEADLINE> Australia Agrees To Pay UN Official Salary Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia has agreed reluctantly
to pay an annual salary of 208,339 US dollars for two years to its
former U.N. Ambassador Richard Butler, who now heads the special
UN commission in charge of ridding Iraq of weapons of mass
destruction, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer is understood to have ordered
the salary payment following direct pressure from US Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Britain's High Commissioner to
Australia Roger Carrick, the Australian Financial Review reported.
</P>
<P>
Downer and his department were angry over the payment, but felt
they had no choice but to agree when told that the Swedish
government had already paid the salary of Butler's Swedish
predecessor Rolf Ekeus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain warned Australia that the future
effectiveness of the U.N. commission could be put in doubt if the
issue of its chief's salary was re-opened in the U.N. Security
Council. They were concerned Russia would oppose the U.N. paying
the salary and that pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
would be weakened.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the foreign minister is understood to have
complained bitterly that Australia was not warned it would be
expected to pay the salary at the time the U.N. asked him to
release Butler to take up the appointment as head of the U.N.
commission.
</P>
<P>
Bulter retired from his post as Australia's U.N. ambassador to
head the commission following Australia's defeat last year in the
U.N. election for a seat on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Butler is believed to have advised Australia's Department of
Foreign Affairs in May that he was retiring and The department
assumed he would be off its payroll when he became head of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Australia had protested strenuously when advised that Australia
would be expected to pay his salary following the Swedish
precedent, arguing that the U.N. should pay the salary to preserve
the independence of his office.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, Albright telephoned Downer and said Australia
should be honored that Butler had been appointed to the
prestigious post and should meet his salary costs, the newspaper
quoted its unidentified sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Carrick, Britain's top diplomat to Australia, called on Downer
to voice Anglo-American concerns about the possibility of Russian
resistance if the question was taken back to the security council.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic's Foreign Exchange Reserves Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic's foreign
exchange reserves dropped to 14.47 billion U.S. dollars by the end
of May, a dip of three billion dollars since the end of 1996,
according to a spokesman for the Finance Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman attributed the reduction of foreign reserves to
the slow growth of the economy, an unbalanced state budget, heavy
deficit, unfavorable foreign trade and a weak currency.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of increasing foreign exchange reserves, the
country has taken steps to increase financial revenues and save on
expenditure, while seeking international loans.
</P>
<P>
On June 20, the country got low-interest loans totaling two
billion U.S. dollars from 24 international financial
organizations, with a year to repay.

<HEADLINE> Latin America's Foreign Debt Grows: SELA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The foreign debt of Latin American
and the Caribbean countries has increased by 873 percent over the
past 21 years and has become the most serious financial problem of
the region, says the Latin American Economic System (SELA).
</P>
<P>
The debt climbed from 69.93 billion U.S. dollars in 1975 to
603.43 billion dollars in 1996, said SELA in a report, presented
today before nearly 100 parliamentarians of the region. They were
attending a seminar in Caracas on the advances in integration and
on international economics.
</P>
<P>
The SELA pointed out that debtor countries could now improve
their negotiated conditions by exerting pressure against
multilateral forums such as the Club of Paris, or through the
strategy of repurchasing its foreign debt at market prices.
</P>
<P>
The organization believed that the changes in attitude of
developed countries and multilateral organizations, and the
increase in international liquidity, would create a "new situation
with respect to the foreign debt that would permit new proposals
of the issue."

<HEADLINE> State Maps Out Ethnic Health Care by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The central government is beefing
up its efforts to provide better health care for the more than 90
million ethnic people by 2000, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are urged to give priority to ethnic health
work and give support in policy-making and budget arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Ministry of Health suggested the ethnic
population has experienced great improvements in health in the
past with life expectancy prolonged from less than 30 in 1949 to
more than 65 years now.
</P>
<P>
More than 77 percent of the villages in ethnic areas have built
clinics. The incidence of infectious diseases, which used to be a
major threat to ethnic people, has been reduced to the national
average.
</P>
<P>
Many ethnic medical workers have been sent to developed
provinces for professional training.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the Ministry of Health and some provincial
governments have assigned 19 groups of health professionals from
hospitals in major cities to support health development in Tibet
and donated 6.3 million yuan (759,000 US dollars) worth of medical
instruments to Tibetan medical institutes.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the shortage of input and lack of high-quality
professionals remain major challenges for health development in
ethnic-inhabited areas, a Ministry of Health official said.
</P>
<P>
Many of these districts are economically backward, and cannot
afford to build medical institutions and improve facilities. It
also affects staff training and implementing disease control
projects, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Due to impacts from the environment and improper living
customs, the control of infectious and endemic diseases as well as
congenital ailments is an arduous task in ethnic areas.
</P>
<P>
Because the number of elderly people is increasing, the regions
also face challenges from non-infectious chronic ailments such as
tumors and diabetes, said the Ministry of Health.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Price Hike to Affect Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The coffer price hike
could cause a drop in consumption, said Mario Conti, director
general of the multinational food company Nestle.
</P>
<P>
"Several sources have calculated that consumption volumes in
North America could drop 10 percent this year compared with 1996,"
Colombian newspaper "La Republica" quoted Conti as reporting
today.
</P>
<P>
The Nestle executive has arrived in Colombia to take part in
the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the National Federation
of Coffee Growers.
</P>
<P>
According to Conti, the rise in coffee prices is due to
market speculations.
</P>
<P>
The director predicts that consumption in Europe will drop
less than in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Tyson's License Is Stripped, Fined 3 Million U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson was banned from the
rings when his boxing license was revoked and was fined three
million U.S. dollars Wednesday for biting a chunk out of Evander
Holyfield's right ear during their June 28 WBA heavyweight title
fight.
</P>
<P>
Tyson can apply for reinstatement in one year, but officials
with the Nevada State Athletic Commission in Las Vegas said
there's no guarantee he could get his license back.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the commission changes its mind, this would be a
permanent revocation," the commission's legal adviser Donald
Haight said.
</P>
<P>
All other states are required by a new federal law to honor the
Nevada decision. And since Tyson is still on probation for his
1992 rape conviction, he might not get permission to leave the
country to fight overseas.
</P>
<P>
But Tyson's corner was optimistic about his chances of
returning to the ring.
</P>
<P>
"When everything's cooled down and the world is thinking about
other things, I feel very, very confident you'll see Mike Tyson
fighting again within a year," said Oscar Goodman, the boxer's
chief lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Tyson apologized on television last week and asked to be
allowed to fight again someday, but he did not show up at
Wednesday's hearing before the commission, leaving his lawyer to
plead his case.
</P>
<P>
The commission could have suspended Tyson for up to five years,
but state prosecutors argued for a stronger punishment. A
suspension would have allowed boxing regulators to fine Tyson a
maximum of 250,000 U.S. dollars.

<P>
XI'AN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, an ancient city in northwest
China, has become a little quieter since early this month when local
authorities prohibited drivers from blaring their car horns in
downtown Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The number of motor vehicles in Xi'an has soared in recent
years, causing severe traffic jams, which has prompted more and more
drivers to lay on the horn, local urban traffic authorities say.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the local environmental protection department
show that the traffic noise pollution has far exceeded that of
coal, smoke, and dust.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Vegetables Fill HK Dishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong's vegetable suppliers
have consolidated their foothold in Hong Kong, thanks to the
efforts of the Guangdong Import and Export Commodity Inspection
Bureau (GDCIB), today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The province exports about 250,000 tons of vegetables to Hong
Kong annually, accounting for about 80 percent of China's total
and making up around 80 percent of Hong Kong's market needs.
</P>
<P>
GDCIB vice-president Zhan Siming said apart from the climate,
which is beneficial to vegetable growing, and Guangdong's
favorable geographical location, the measures taken by GDCIB to
ensure safety, hygiene and the punctual delivery of vegetables
also contribute significantly to exports.
</P>
<P>
Zhan said to guarantee the safety and hygiene of the
vegetables, GDCIB has laid down several regulations, including the
Provincial Hygiene Quality Examination and Inspection
Administration Temporary Regulations for Fresh Vegetables Exported
to Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Such regulations provide clear and concise guidelines for the
labelling system, the responsibilities borne by vegetable growers
and collectors, and even the dosages of pesticide.
</P>
<P>
And GDCIB has offered 11 terms' worth of courses for more than
300 vegetable growing and collection supervisors to make sure that
inspection covers every detail of vegetable growing and
processing.
</P>
<P>
GDCIB has purchased advanced instruments and facilities worth
more than 50 million yuan to strengthen the quality inspection
work on vegetables sent to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Research has also been applied advanced facilities to vegetable
examination to speed up the delivery of vegetables destined for
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, GDCIB has been co-operating with its
counterpart in Hong Kong to crack down on illegal vegetable
exports to Hong Kong. GDCIB compares notes with its counterpart in
Hong Kong twice a year.
</P>
<P>
The measures GDCIB has taken have benefited both Hong Kong
residents and the province's vegetable growers, Zhan said, as Hong
Kong residents can feel free to enjoy the vegetables from
Guangdong and the province's vegetable growers can make handsome
profits.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Boosts Bicycle Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, has exported 713,000 bicycles so far this year,
an increase of about 27 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The bicycles are valued at 30.3 million US dollars, up 37
percent, according to local customs statistics.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city has exported bicycle spare parts worth
12.7 million US dollars, up 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bicycles have been a major hard currency earner in Shanghai's
light industry sector. The export markets are mainly in Asian and
African countries, including Japan and Indonesia. More than 60
percent of Shanghai's bicycles have been exported to Japan this
year.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the export rise to the high quality and low
prices of Shanghai's bicycles. In addition, more business
operations by Japanese and Taiwanese bicycle manufacturers has
also promoted exports.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sends 500 Troops to N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The British government is sending
500 more troops to Northern Ireland today to strengthen its forces
there in fighting a tide of nationalist violence which swept the
province since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The extra troops, which will arrive at the province within two
days, will help the local Royal Ulster Constabulary police "combat
terrorism and ensure law and order," local reports quoted an army
spokesman as saying. Over 18,000 British soldiers are already
serving in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
The continued violence was sparked off Sunday morning after
pro-British Protestants marched through a Catholic area in
Portadown in Northern Ireland with consent from the British
government.
</P>
<P>
The Protestants and anti-British Catholics remain intransigent
in a compromise over further parades scheduled for this weekend,
with tension remaining high in the province.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant Orange Order in Londonderry said it would not
change its plans for a march through the province's second city
Saturday despite objections from Catholics there.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's parade is the first by the Orange Order in
Londonderry for five years. Upwards of 10,000 Orangemen are
expected to take part.
</P>
<P>
July 12 marks the anniversary of a 1690 Protestant battle
victory over an invading Catholic king and is seen by Catholics as
an anachronistic display of triumphalism.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls on Cypriot Parties to Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today called on leaders of both Cypriot communities to enter
upon a process of negotiations, leading to incremental
construction of the juridical framework to forge a new partnership
between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the opening of the Cyprus talks at the
Troutbeck conference center in Dutchess County, New York, Annan
said that through negotiations, leaders of the Cypriot communities
would be able to promote an increasingly fruitful convergence of
views and positions.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the negotiation process is under way, you will find
that it is the most practical way of formulating texts that are
mutually acceptable, and for that reason effective and durable,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the process will be conducted under the auspices
of the United Nations will add another dimension. It will ensure
that the principles of the Charter will inspire all the good
offices efforts of the secretary-general; will guide your
deliberations; and underlie all the understandings that you will
reach," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reviewed that the search for a peaceful solution to the
Cyprus problem had dragged on for too long.
</P>
<P>
"For 33 years and fourth months, the United Nations has toiled,
so far in vain, to bring about an agreed settlement. There have
been dozens of Security Council resolutions. Four
secretaries-general have worked hard to implement the council's
mandate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP),
originally set up for a period of three months, was still in
existence. The work of the UNFICYP had been invaluable in reducing
tension and containing the conflict. It had not been cost-free:
168 UN peacekeepers had paid the supreme price for peace on Cyprus
in addition to the UNFICYP's current annual cost of 50 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Today, international backing for a solution to the Cyprus issue
was firmer than ever. The support of the Security Council had been
unequivocal. This meeting itself -- and the presence of special
envoys from so many countries -- was proof of the high priority
the international community attached to the search for a viable
and comprehensive solution, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us, therefore, press forward, in a positive spirit, in
search of our common goal, a viable and comprehensive solution to
the Cyprus problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
By reaching agreement, the Cypriot communities would not only
earn the respect and gratitude of the international community,
they would also earn its profound relief at the removal of a
potential flashpoint from international relations in the eastern
Mediterranean and, most important, provide a prosperous and
peaceful future for all Cypriots, he said in conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The first round of Cyprus talks has been attended by
representatives from Finland, Germany, China, Russia, France and
10 other countries and senior UN officials in addition to leaders
of the two Cypriot communities.

<HEADLINE> Youth Need Sex Education, Family Planning: UNFPA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Young people from throughout
the world articulated their need for accurate information on sex,
AIDS, family planning services, and their desire to marry and have
children later in life, according to the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
In a new publication, the UNFPA noted that young people also
wanted their parents' help in all this but they did not want to be
pressured or controlled by them. Instead, they were looking
forward for support and guidance as they made their transition to
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
The Youth Perspective, the UNFPA booklet, contains writings
from an essay contest sponsored by the Fund on the theme of
"promoting responsible reproductive behavior."
</P>
<P>
"In this booklet, young people speak from the heart and with
great passion," said Nafis Sadik, UNFPA executive director. "They
tell us they want sexual education and information on reproductive
health, preferably from their parents. They want this information
early and in a form appropriate to their psychological and
physical development. They want accurate information so they can
empower themselves to make choices and take responsibility for
those choices."
</P>
<P>
She said that many of the young writers indicated they wanted
to have family planning information and supplies that would allow
them to avoid early and unwanted pregnancy, and abortion, and to
protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
Sadik also said that one of the key themes of the booklet was
an abhorrence of sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The booklet contains essays, in part and whole, from a contest
organized in 1996 by the UNFPA to give voice to young people and
to assist the Fund in its work with adolescents, especially in the
areas of sex education and information. There were 17 winners of
the contest, aged 14 to 23, chosen by UNFPA judges from more than
500 entries from 107 countries.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government to Resume Talks with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar Hassan
al-Bashir announced today that his government will soon resume
peace talks with southern rebels in a bid to end the 14-year
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
However, there will be no face-to-face talks between Bashir
and John Garang, the leader of the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), Sudanese Deputy Ambassador Elsadig Osman
said. Garang also ruled out such a possibility here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sixth Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
summit ending earlier today has paved the way for the forthcoming
talks between the Islamist-backed Sudanese government and the
SPLA, Bashir said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day summit, Bashir turned about and accepted the
Declaration of Principles, which was drafted by IGAD leaders in
1994 but then had been rejected by Khartoum, as the basis of
talks to end the conflicts in the country.
</P>
<P>
His move was hailed by leaders of other IGAD member states
attending the summit -- Presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya,
Hassan Aptidon of Djibouti and Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea,
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Ugandan First Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya.
</P>
<P>
"The summit considered this development a major breakthrough
in the peace initiative," said the leaders in a joint communique.
</P>
<P>
"This will enable the parties to the conflict to freely
discuss and negotiate on all the points enshrined in the
declaration of principles," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Bashir and SPLA leader John Garang
mediated by IGAD nations broke down in 1994 when the Sudanese
government refused to sign the declaration of principles.
</P>
<P>
The declaration recognized religious factor as an important
role in Sudan's development, saying religion and the state are
separate, and endorsed self-determination for Sudan's Christian
south.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has fought in southern Sudan since 1983 for greater
autonomy of the Christian south from the Moslem north and now is
allied with armed opposition groups in northern Sudan with
battles continuing both in the north and in the south.
</P>
<P>
"In order to break the impasse, the talks must be resumed by
all parties in the conflict so that a lasting solution can be
found," Moi vowed in his opening speech on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD held two high-level meetings in 1994 on the crisis in
Sudan but the talks were deadlocked. Since then, all IGAD peace
initiative has stalled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders expressed satisfaction that "the
situation in northern Somalia was relatively stable and urged
cooperation among the factions in order to create a united and
peaceful Somalia," according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's chair is vacant at the seven-member IGAD summit as
usual because it has not had a central government since 1991 when
clan leaders joined hands to oust former leader Mohamed Siad
Barre and then sent the Horn of African country into war-torn
situation.
</P>
<P>
IGAD was set up in 1986 for enhancing cooperation on
anti-drought and economic development among the member countries.
Regional political affairs have been on its agenda since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The IGAD member states have "resolved to strengthen IGAD
through prompt payment of assessed contributions" and "redouble
their efforts in providing the necessary resources for
infrastructure development," said the communique.

<P>
CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt changed some of its
governorates a day after the cabinet has a limited shake-up, in a
drive to speed up the country's economic development, the Middle
East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a republican decree issued by President Hosni Mubarak today,
the governors reshuffle has introduced 10 new-comers, changed the
places of four others and kept 12 in their seats.
</P>
<P>
The new governors will take oaths before the president
Thursday, a day after 10 newly-appointed ministers were sworn in.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's limited cabinet reshuffle, which took place 18 months
after Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri took office on January 2nd,
1996, also introduced a new ministry of rural development.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 newly-appointed ministers, four of them were new
blood while the other six merely assumed new ministerial
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
The shake-up is aimed at giving a boost to the efficiency in
the government, according to el-Ganzouri who made the new
nominations Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"The present stage requires speed and decisiveness in
performance in various domains of production and services,"
Ganzouri told reporters after the swearing-in ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the shake-up, some ministries were split up to create new
ones like ministries of environment and higher education. The
philosophy behind the move is to enhance performance, according to
the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Most of the outgoing ministers are those in charge of public

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Cautions Workers Against Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today cautioned workers countrywide not to resort to strikes
without pursuing collective bargaining channels in their quest
for higher wages this year.
</P>
<P>
''Workers should not succumb to the sense of indiscipline.
Arguments should be presented well and not rush into strikes
because they have an adverse effect if they become the only
resort to failed negotiations,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers in the construction, clothing and textile
industries downed their tools Tuesday, demanding salary rise
which management failed to meet.
</P>
<P>
The strikes followed others staged by hotel and restaurant
workers countrywide which paralyzed tourism services for more
than three days.
</P>
<P>
Employees of the recently commercialized posts and
telecommunications corporation began a go-slow last Friday
demanding 40 percent salary increase, while thousands of
employees of the national railways of Zimbabwe downed their tools
demanding more than 50 percent rise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, threats of more strikes continue with bank workers
warning they could go into the streets Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''The strikes have a double effect,'' Mugabe said, adding,
''they affect the viability of the company, and, in the long
term, affects the prosperity of the workers.''

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Soldiers Trade Fire With Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A combined unit of the Sierra
Leone army and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) traded heavy
artillery fire today with Nigerian troops around the country's
international airport, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The assault which began at around 11.30 am sent thousands of
civilians in nearby villages fleeing to Port Loko town, about 30
miles away, local reporters on the scene said.
</P>
<P>
Military officials in Freetown said there were mild damages to
the airport itself and that up to about 10 Nigerian soldiers may
have been either wounded or killed.
</P>
<P>
They described their own casualties as light. But there has
not been any independent confirmation about the claim.
</P>
<P>
According to residents near the airport, a column of combined
Sierra Leone and RUF troops were on their way to the airport when
an argument ensued between them and Nigerian troops.
</P>
<P>
''The Nigerians were hostile and started trading insults and
then things got out of hand,'' a military official said.
</P>
<P>
''There was a near hand-to-hand fighting at one stage before
the two sides separated and took up heavy bombardment," the
official reported.
BBH209NBB168I09TSQL01:2001:211732
</P>
<P>
Two gun boats belonging to the Sierra Leone navy which were
patrolling the seafront, also took part in the battle.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment was heard in the capital across the Sierra
Leone River and it sent hundreds of civilians scurrying for
safety. Shops and markets were closed and a number of accidents
were reported as motorists raced for safety.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said they believed that the Sierra Leone
soldiers were out to scale down the presence of Nigerian soldiers
at the airport where they had formed a blockade against any
civilian flights arriving in the country for the past six weeks.

polio free while Ethiopia is among the remaining 26 percent.

ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Close to 300 Ethiopian
children are taken by adoption annually, the Ethiopian News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dinkalem Betru, head of the adoption service team of the

''All the children taken by adoption are below the age of 14
and are either orphans, abandoned or with parents suffering from
incurable diseases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Betru said her organization monitors the situation in which
the children have been taken out of the country by foreign
adoptive parents, adding that ''at the age of 18, the children
enjoy the right to decide to remain in the countries of their
adoption or return to their native country.''

<HEADLINE> German Insurer Warns Business Against Insider Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A leading German insurance company
today warned companies against the increasing danger of
embezzlement by their own staff, saying that it would cost them
HAB263HAB272i0709QU02:0202:020123
some 10 billion marks (5.7 billion U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hermes Kreditversicherung, which provides
insurance against fraud, Germany registered last year about
750,000 cases of embezzlement committed by a company's own staff
with losses totaling at 9.3 billion marks (5.3 billion dollars).
This year the figure might top 800,000 cases, it added.
</P>
<P>
The insurance company believes that the steady growth in such
crimes results from the rising indebtedness of German households,
a collapse in corporate values, as well as companies's structural
changes such as lean management and rationalization through more
use of computers.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the threat of punishment will not be enough,
instead the companies should take necessary precautions.

<HEADLINE> First Kuwaiti Plane in 7 Years Lands in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The first Kuwaiti commercial plane
landed here today after a break of seven years, following an
agreement signed between Jordan and Kuwait last month.
</P>
<P>
This was "another demonstration of the improved relationship
between the two countries," Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A320 flight of Kuwait Airways Corporation (KAC),
carrying 170 passengers, was welcomed at Jordanian Queen Alia
International Airport by Jordanian Civil Aviation Authority (JCAA)
staff members and Kuwaiti diplomats.
</P>
<P>
From today, KAC starts its regular semi-weekly flights, on every
Wednesday and Friday, from Kuwait to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Captain Jarsad Ziyad, JCAA director, told reporters that he
hoped the number of flights would increase. He described the first
flight as a "good start."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti diplomat Fizad Mohaisen told reporters that this would
contribute to enhancing ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Royal Jordanian (RJ) company will start the first
of its semi-weekly flights, on every Monday and Thursday, from
Amman to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The schedule was set last month when both sides agreed that
their national air carriers should resume flights following a
hiatus of seven years.
</P>
<P>
The two airlines suspended flights following 1990's Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has not restored full diplomatic ties with Jordan, which
has been seen as sympathizing with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Russia Repeats Opposition to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry today
once again reiterated its position against the NATO's eastwards
expansion, alleging the NATO enlargement is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a briefing here, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Tarasov criticized the NATO leaders, who is holding summit in
Madrid, for the decision to invite three East European countries
to the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision runs counter to the task of creating a
single security space in the Euro-Atlantic area."NATO expansion
will sooner create new problems than it will resolve existing
ones", Tarasov added.
</P>
<P>
All countries in the Euro-Atlantic area, the spokesman said,
should have equal security guarantees irrespective of their
membership in military and political alliances.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov noted Discussion of NATO enlargement has, and will
have, a negative impact on the general political situation in
Europe. He said "there is no doubt that what we need now is not
discussions about NATO candidates of the first or second wave, but
efforts aimed at strengthening stability and security in Europe."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed anxiety about the indirect mention
of the Baltic states in the Madrid Declaration in the context of
NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"For us this decision was and remains unacceptable," Tarasov
said, "however, we are ready to discuss a system of security
guarantees which Russia and other countries or international
organizations could give the Baltic states."

<P>
Meanwhile, he welcomed the fact that in their Declaration the
NATO member-states confirmed their intention to continue efforts
within the framework of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to work out a comprehensive security model
for Europe in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Russia also welcomes NATO's determination to comply with all

operations by Turkish security forces in southeastern Turkey
during the past four days.

<HEADLINE> MIR Space Station Suffers Ongoing Troubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The troubles suffered by Russia's
Mir space station make it much harder for a Russian space industry
already battered by market reforms to attract investments, Russian
Space agency deputy director Yuri Milov told a briefing here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Recent foreign investments have mostly gone toward construction
of the Alpha international space station anyway, Milov said.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, funding is not likely to fall sharply either, he
said and believed the project would materialize.
</P>
<P>
NASA responded with sympathy to the crash of a progress cargo
craft into a Mir station module June 25, depressurizing it and
attached to the damaged module, the space official said.
</P>
<P>
NASA professionals know that if one plane crashed, this does
not mean that all flights should stop, Milov said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the first fatal accident involving astronauts
occurred in the United States, but that did not bring an end to
the U.S. manned space program.
</P>
<P>
Milov said the situation on board Mir is improving and the
consequences of the crash will be dealt with shortly.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Calls on Afghan Parties to End Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
today called for an immediate end to the fighting in Afghanistan
after considering a report of the UN secretary general concerning
the situation there.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read out by the council president for July,
Peter Osvald of Sweden, the council called upon all Afghan parties
to return to the negotiating table immediately and to work
together towards the formation of a broad-based, fully
representative government that would protect the rights of all
Afghans and abide by Afghanistan's international obligation.
</P>
<P>
According to the report of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the
situation in Afghanistan remained volatile. The warring parties
Taliban and the opposition seemed bent on resolving their problems
through military means rather than through peaceful negotiations.
The conflict was increasingly being fueled by strong ethnic
feelings between the predominantly Pushtun Taliban on the one hand
and the Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks, who comprised the opposition
camp, on the other.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that all external interference in Afghanistan must
cease, the council called upon all states to end immediately the
supply of arms and ammunition to all parties to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, taking into account risks of regional
destabilization, expressed the belief that peace and stability in
Afghanistan could best be attained through intra-Afghan political
negotiations under UN auspices with the active and coordinated
assistance of all countries concerned. It urged the Afghan parties
and countries concerned to abide by the Security Council and
General Assembly resolutions on Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
As the continuation of the conflict in Afghanistan provides a
fertile ground for terrorism and illegal drug production and
trafficking, the council called upon the leaders of the Afghan
parties to halt such activities.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed deep concern at the continuing
discrimination against girls and women, other violations of human
rights and violations of international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
It called upon member states to respond generously to the 1997
UN Consolidated Appeal for Emergency Humanitarian Assistance for
Afghanistan and reaffirmed its full support for the UN efforts in
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> 1997 German Budget Foresees 71 Bln Marks in New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The German government is expecting a
new borrowing of 71.2 billion marks (40.9 billion U.S. dollars)
for its 1997 budget, 17.9 billion marks (10.3 billion dollars)
higher than foreseen at the end of last year, said media reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Under Bonn's revised budget for 1997, government expenditures
would increase by 18.7 billion marks (10.7 billion dollars) to
458.6 billion (263.6 billion dollars), the German news agency DPA
quoted government sources as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one third of the spendings, or 149.06 billion marks
(85.7 billion dollars), would be used to cover the increasing
social welfare costs for the country's large army of jobless
people which now stands at nearly 4.4 million, or a rate of 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
Under a separate draft budget for 1998, government expenditures
are expected to increase by 0.5 percent to 461 billion marks
(264.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of an improvement on the job market, the labor
and social affairs spendings would be reduced by 1.3 percent from
the level of 1997, to 147.06 billion marks (84.5 billion dollars),
but would still remain the largest budget item.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to cuts across the board elsewhere, the 1998
defense budget, the second largest item, would increase by 0.8
percent to 46.67 billion marks (26.8 billion dollars) when
compared with 1997. Among them 850 million marks (488.5 million
dollars) would be earmarked to fund the Eurofighter jet to ensure
that the four-European-nation joint warplane project can go ahead.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Re-consider Arms Sale to Rwanda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 9 (Xinhua)-- South Africa will reconsider
its arms sales to Rwanda, which was suspended in November last
year, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that the government of Rwanda should have
the capacity to protect itself against attacks," Mbeki told
reporters after meeting his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbeki, some refugees returning to Rwanda were
from the old militia in that country. "They come back with their
guns and resume some of the military conflict."
</P>
<P>
This was affecting the work of aid organizations and
non-government bodies helping to resettle refugees. The matter
had also been raised by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa suspended its arms sale to Rwanda in November
last year, pending the return of the stability to the central
African region. The decision was taken after indications showed
that the Rwandan armed forces made cross-border incursions into
former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
South Africa said at that time that the suspension would be
reviewed once cross-border violations by Rwanda ceased and a
clear understanding emerged that its armed forces were using
weapons for self-defense only.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Kagame's visit, Mbeki said South Africa and
Rwanda would sign a memorandum of understanding on general
cooperation during Kagame's visit.
</P>
<P>
Technical task teams would then examine ways in which South
Africa could aid reconstruction in Rwanda. The private sector
would also be involved, Mbeki said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Funds Water Projects in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Construction of two multi-million
U.S. Dollars water supply projects financed by the World Bank is
in full swing in northern Nigeria, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The first multi-stage water supply project in Kaduna State is
expected to be completed in July next year, while that in Katsina
State is projected to be finished in mid 1999.
</P>
<P>
A report by a World Bank visiting group said today that the
two projects which started in 1993 are financed entirely by the
bank's credit scheme of about 101 million U.S. Dollars, with
local funding largely from the state governments.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Kaduna project, involving both
urban and rural water supply schemes at a cost of about 53
million Dollars, will provide additional 31,000 cubic meters of
potable water daily when completed.
</P>
<P>
The Katsina project, also involving urban and rural water
supply systems, will cost some 59 million Dollars and is targeted
at an additional potable water supply of 58,500 cubic meters a
day.
</P>
<P>
Local communities, the beneficiaries of the projects, will be
mobilized to contribute a small proportion of the capital costs
and be responsible for operating and maintaining the schemes, it
said.

<HEADLINE> US to Evacuate Part of Embassy Staff in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said
today the Clinton administration is ordering 41 diplomats and
their dependents out of Cambodia because of the uncertain security
situation there.
</P>
<P>
The staff at the embassy in Phnom Penh would be reduced to 20
after the other 41 leave the country, but it would keep the
mission open, spokesman Nicholas Burns told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Although the Pentagon had made contingency plans for a possible
military evacuation, it was hoped the diplomats and their
dependents could leave by civilian transport now that flights were
being restored at the Phnom Penh airport, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Americans in the country, estimated at 1,000 to
1,300, were urged to leave Cambodia over the next few days, even
though "the situation in Phnom Penh is quieter than it has been at
any time over the last four or five days." There still was
sporadic shooting in the capital and in other places.
</P>
<P>
Burns disclosed that Cambodia's First Prime Minister Prince
Norodom Ranariddh was on his way to the United States from France
for meetings with U.N. officials in New York and would probably
meet Friday with Acting Secretary of State Thomas Pickering, who
is standing in while Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is in
Madrid attending a NATO summit.
</P>
<P>
They might discuss whether to suspend a 42 million U.S. aid
program for Cambodia, given the political situation in the
Southeast Asian country.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Leaders Start Talks Near New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash met today for the first
time in nearly three years to search for ways for a peaceful
solution to the long-standing Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, expected to last five days, took place at a rural
resort called Troutbeck, some 90 miles north of New York.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials hope that the isolated setting will encourage
the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to search
for an end to the 23-year division of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"The search for a peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem has
dragged on for too long," said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
who presided over the opening session of the talks.
</P>
<P>
"This is a place where I'm sure cool minds and clear heads will
prevail," the U.N. chief added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since troops from Turkey
took over the north of the island in 1974 in reaction to a coup in
Nicosia backed by the junta then ruling Greece.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
Mediterranean island nation as a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation.
</P>
<P>
No agreements are expected from this fresh round of
U.N-sponsored talks of the leaders of the Greek and Cypriot
communities. Instead, U.N. officials hope that the two sides will
agree to meet again next month. U.N. officials hold out little
hope for major developments until the Greek Cypriots hold their
presidential elections next February.
</P>
<P>
Clerdies told reporters that he came to talk with Denktash
"with the intention of negotiating seriously."
</P>
<P>
"If the other side is prepared to do that, then I will become
an optimist," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader also stressed his good intention for
talks. But he said that the Turkish Cypriots will be looking for
signs that the Greek Cypriots, who make up 80 percent of the
island's population, are willing to accept Turks as equals in a
"bizonal" state.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Between Warring Factions Postponed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman from the mayor of
Congolese capital Brazzaville said the peace talks between the
Congolese president Pascal Lissouba's troops and the militia
loyal to former president Sassou Nguesso was postponed, sources
monitored said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to mayor Bernard Kolelas's spokesman, the
postponement was blamed on the dispute about who should sign a
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the two warring sides planned to be
held today was proposed by the mediation committee led by Bernard
Kolelas, the mayor of Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Brazzaville began last month. Mediation
efforts had been made soon after the conflict erupted but no
success yet.
</P>
<P>
Reports say an African peace keeping force directed by Senegal
is being set up. The first contingent of some 500 men is expected
in Brazzaville soon.

ADDIS ABABA, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-Governmental
Authority for Development (IGAD) today said it is committed to
seeking peaceful solutions to the crises of Somalia and Sudan at
the end of a two-day summit meeting in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges 120 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
flirted with the 8,000 mark, but plunged this afternoon on doubts
about guaranteed corporate profit forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Dow lost 119.88 points to 7,842.43.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the NYSE volume amounting to
589.08 million shares, much more than 525.65 million on the
Tuesday session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list was down 11.14 at 907.61.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index was down 5.46 at 473.03. The American
Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.09 at 631.02.
</P>
<P>
Bucking the trend, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index
was up 1.77 at 1,486.87, riding to a new record high.
</P>
<P>
After an opening rally that took the Dow above 7,990, the Dow
dropped as much as 167.38 in the final hour of trading. The drop
more than erased the previous day's record-setting 100-point gain.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the decline to program trading, investors
reaping profits from Tuesday's surge and fear that the previous
session's jump was unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
With no major economic data scheduled for this week until
Friday's reading on wholesale prices, the market is closely
watching earnings reports for signs of the pace of growth in the
just-ended second quarter.
