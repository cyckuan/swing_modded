<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- There is no joy in Israel over a decision by
Reform Jewish rabbis in the United States to approve homosexual
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is unhappy, even gays.
</P>
<P>
   The March 29 decision by the Central Conference of American
Rabbis will make life in Israel harder for the tiny Reform movement
on all fronts, religious leaders here. Conservative and Orthodox
Jews reject the decision and local Reform leaders are uncomfortable
with it.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the U.S. body supports Reform rabbis who choose
to sanctify one-gender relationships, and also supports those who
choose not to. It might lead to a break with the Conservatives,
allies of Reform Jews in the struggle for recognition and
legitimacy in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Though they elected not to follow the American ruling, Reform
leaders in Israel worry that it will put them out of step with
Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox rabbis say it reinforces what they believed all along --
that Reform Judaism is not authentic Jewish practice.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Gafni, an ultra-Orthodox lawmaker, said the decision of
the Reform rabbis in the United States is additional proof that
they have abandoned Judaism. ''This is a crazy gang, a gang of
clowns whose behavior is simply disgusting. They act totally
against the Torah, like animals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists say that by turning down the option of sanctifying
same-sex unions, Reform rabbis in Israel have pushed homosexuals
even further away from organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   Under Israeli law, marriage is under the control of the
religious establishment, and that means Orthodox. There is no civil
marriage here.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yehoram Mazor of the local Reform rabbinical rule-making
body said the U.S. resolution is irrelevant to the Israeli
experience and would affect few. The gay community here, he said,
is not interested in religion.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activist Amit Kama, whose doctoral thesis addresses the
mindset of Israeli gays, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think about getting married by a rabbi because it's
not a feasible option,'' he said -- just as a person with no money
would not make plans to buy an expensive car.
</P>
<P>
   For Orthodox Jews, who accept the Bible literally, there is no
gray area. Leviticus 18:22 states: ''Thou shalt not lie with
mankind as with womankind: it is abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   While homosexuals themselves are not condemned, active
single-sex relationships have no place in the Jewish religion, said
Orthodox Rabbi Avraham Ravitz, a religious hard-liner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's say a man has the tendency to steal,'' he said. ''Is he
a thief? No. He's a thief only if he steals.'' Homosexuals should
learn to control their urges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Rabbi Levi Weiman-Kelman explained that Reform Judaism
sees the Bible as ''the constantly being revealed word of God for
each generation.'' Reform Judaism disregards biblical precepts that
don't fit modern society.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform movement claims about 10,000 members in 24
congregations in Israel. There are 50 Conservative synagogues with
about 7,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, there are thousands of Orthodox synagogues, and
about 20 percent of Israel's more than 5 million Jews identify
themselves as Orthodox. The rest call themselves traditional or
non-observant.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, Reform and Conservative Jews outnumber the
Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   Weiman-Kelman, whose Jerusalem synagogue has been a target of
Orthodox demonstrations in the past, does not believe the ruling
will affect relations, because they couldn't get any worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who already reject our point of view, it doesn't make
them reject it more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The approval of same-sex unions could lead to a split with the
Reform movement's natural allies -- the more traditional
Conservative movement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. rabbis' decision came as the two movements were engaged
in a joint campaign offering alternative wedding ceremonies to
heterosexual Israelis who reject the Orthodox rabbinate, even
though their weddings are not officially recognized.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of joint radio commercials promoting alternate
heterosexual weddings, the gay union decision presents a problem.
''Now, we will have to reconsider,'' said Rabbi Ehud Bandel, head
of the Conservative movement in Israel, noting Conservatives'
interpretation of Jewish religious law is similar to that of the
Orthodox on homosexual unions.
</P>
<P>
   Israel needs alternative heterosexual weddings, said Doniel
Hartman, an Orthodox rabbi with moderate views. He estimated that
40 percent of Israeli couples reject the Orthodox rabbinate and
leave the country to tie the knot, many taking a short hop to
nearby Cyprus. Hartman supports Reform and Conservative weddings
and single-gender ceremonies, to provide a Jewish identity to many
who feel rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists like Uzi Even watch this sparring with disdain.
Even said he and others appeared before the local Reform rabbis and
asked them to go along with the U.S. resolution, but were turned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Weiman-Kelman said his congregation welcomes homosexuals as
''full and active participants.'' He said he has thought hard about
what he would do if a gay couple asked him to perform a wedding
ceremony. He doesn't have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have to choose between my responsibility to my
congregants and my responsibility to my colleagues,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Leo's White House Chat Spurs Flap  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As President Clinton rose to speak and the
theme song for the movie ''Titanic'' boomed over speakers, radio
and television journalists attending their annual banquet Thursday
night knew immediately that ABC News was about to be roasted.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and ABC have been feuding publicly since last
week when ''Titanic'' star Leonardo DiCaprio met with Clinton for
an upcoming Earth Day special.
</P>
<P>
   Was the sit-down interview a spur-of-the-moment thing -- as the
network insists -- or did it result from lengthy negotiations, as
the White House contends? And just what role was DiCaprio
performing for ABC News last Friday when he interviewed Clinton --
journalist or viewer-drawing celeb?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton joked that ABC has been waffling. The network doesn't
know if DiCaprio did an ''interview, a walk-thru or a drive-by,''
he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't you newspeople ever learn?'' Clinton asked the more than
2,300 people at the Radio &AMP; Television Correspondents' Association
dinner. ''It isn't the mistake that kills you. It's the cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of complaints from its own journalists, who think
professional reporters should be interviewing the president, ABC
still isn't saying if the footage will ever be broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's legitimate to use someone like DiCaprio, who is
sincerely interested in this issue (the environment), in an
appropriate manner on a news special,'' ABC spokeswoman Eileen
Murphy said. ''We aren't allowing what is going on in the press to
influence how we produce this program.''
</P>
<P>
   But the footage, part of a special scheduled for on or about
April 22, will be judged on its merits, she said, and it is
possible that little or none of it will be used.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally when (Clinton) does an interview, it's used,'' said
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, who urged ABC News
Washington bureau chief Robin Sproul on Wednesday to put a stop to
network claims that the interview was granted unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in two weeks that ABC News has gotten
static.
</P>
<P>
   After Diane Sawyer's interview with Elian Gonzalez aired on
''Good Morning America'' last week, the network was criticized for
questioning on camera the 6-year-old Cuban boy. Apparently shifting
gears in response, the network began referring to the encounter as
''a supervised visit.''
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to differentiate ''interview'' from ''visit'' fell
by the wayside this week while ABC and the White House discussed
the finer points of ''sit-down'' and ''walk-through.''
</P>
<P>
   All week, ABC has insisted that DiCaprio's assigned role was to
take a walking tour with Clinton to spotlight environmental changes
made to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''And, yes, as part of that, we were going to ask the president
questions,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the last minute Friday, she said, the walk-through was
canceled in lieu of the impromptu sit-down interview.
</P>
<P>
   ABC staffers were outraged that the network gave the plum
assignment to a movie actor. It didn't, said ABC News boss David
Westin in a staff e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is that stupid'' as to send DiCaprio to conduct a
presidential interview for ABC News, he declared.
</P>
<P>
   But DiCaprio spokesman Ken Sunshine said the actor arrived at
the White House expecting to interview Clinton ''walking or
sitting'' and came prepared with cards bearing questions.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked during Thursday's press briefing to characterize
the session, the White House's Lockhart expressed his certainty
that ''it was an interview. If there is another term ... for that,
I'm not aware of it.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves Stomach 'Pacemaker'  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jennifer Sivils was a healthy mother of three
when suddenly she got a mysterious stomach disorder that literally
was starving her to death. She simply could not hold down any food
and her weight dropped from 157 pounds to 98.
</P>
<P>
   Severe gastroparesis left her stomach unable to churn properly
to move food down the digestive tract. Intravenous nutrition kept
her alive. But then she got an experimental pacemaker-like device
that zapped her stomach with little electric shocks. She since has
regained 22 pounds and can eat certain foods again.
</P>
<P>
   Swayed by cases like Sivils', the Food and Drug Administration
has approved the sale of Medtronic Corp.'s Enterra implant for up
to 4,000 Americans a year who suffer severe cases of this baffling
stomach disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Enterra is not a cure. But in a small study many implant
recipients dramatically improved, said Dan Schultz, FDA's director
of abdominal devices.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100,000 people may suffer some degree of gastroparesis.
Diabetes causes many cases, but about a third have no known cause.
</P>
<P>
   In mild cases, the stomach just takes longer to digest food.
Eating smaller portions of easy-to-digest food and certain stomach
medications helps many patients. But people with severe cases
cannot eat, sometimes even drink, because of continual nausea,
vomiting and pain. The sickest survive with feeding tubes inserted
into the intestine or total intravenous nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind Enterra: The shocks stimulate nerves lining
the stomach that control how it digests food, said University of
Kansas gastroenterology chief Dr. Richard McCallum, who helped test
the device.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same rationale behind other neurostimulators that ease
tremors by zapping a brain nerve, and ease incontinence by zapping
a nerve that controls the bladder.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterra theory is not proved, Schultz said. Enterra has been
studied on so few people -- 33 -- that the FDA wonders if a placebo
effect from simply having surgery could explain some of the
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The 33 patients, who all failed gastroparesis medications, on
average vomited 48 times a week before the implant. After surgery,
vomiting episodes averaged 23 times a week when Enterra was turned
on and 29 times a week when it was turned off. While patients felt
better regardless, those similar numbers puzzled scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Then the stimulator was turned on again for good, and some
patients steadily improved. A year later, vomiting averaged 10
times a week. Some patients can eat fairly normally with little
nausea while others had less benefit -- ''a tremendous amount of
variability,'' Schultz cautions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the effect seemed important enough that FDA approved
Enterra on March 31 under a special rule allowing ''humanitarian''
treatments for rare, lifethreatening disorders to sell without
extensive clinical trials. Medtronic disclosed the approval
Thursday, saying the device is immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Enterra is a battery-powered generator implanted in the abdomen
with an electrode snaked up to the stomach muscle. It emits
low-voltage shocks about once every six seconds. It is a $26,000
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Enterra to market was a battle -- an initial study was
not promising and a skeptical Medtronic wanted to pull the plug,
McCallum said.
</P>
<P>
   But desperate patients begged to try Enterra. The FDA offered
the special ''humanitarian'' review, and McCallum said Medtronic
allowed him and University of Tennessee gastroenterologist Dr.
Thomas Abell to complete the study.
</P>
<P>
   Abell implanted Sivils' device last August. About a month later,
she started noticing gradual improvement.
</P>
<P>
   She is not cured -- she still gets IV nutrition three days a
week. But she eats vegetables and soups without vomiting for the
first time in two years and can play with her children again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad to think you could starve to death here in the United
States because of a disease,'' said Sivils, 35, of Arkadelphia,
Ark. ''I'm so grateful'' for the device.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears OK of $1.83T Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is on the edge of blessing a $1.83
trillion budget for next year that will move lawmakers a step
closer to a campaign season full of battles with President Clinton
over spending and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was expected to approve the Republican-written
package today, after voting on perhaps dozens of amendments. Since
the House approved a similar plan two weeks ago, the GOP goal was
for Congress to pass a compromise measure by next Friday, in time
for lawmakers' spring recess.
</P>
<P>
   Even before senators completed the plan, the two sides were
attacking each others' fiscal visions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has submitted a political budget,'' Senate
Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Thursday of
Clinton's fiscal 2001 spending plan, which calls for more spending
and smaller tax cuts than Republicans want.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said Clinton's proposed increase in domestic spending
for 2001 was made ''either to embarrass us or make us spend
precisely what he wants, which is way too much.'' He wants about
$320 billion, or about 14 percent over this year's total and $30
billion more than Republicans say they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the proposed GOP tax cut of at least $150 billion
over the next five years would consume virtually the entire budget
surplus, not counting Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats even introduced the $483 billion tax cut likely GOP
presidential standard-bearer George W. Bush has proposed for 2002
through 2006 and dared Republicans to vote for it. It was rejected
99-0, with Republicans wary that it could drain Social Security
surpluses both parties want to leave alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who forced the voice on Bush's tax
plan, taunted Republicans, saying they should obey ''that noted
political philosopher, Tammy Wynette, who said, 'Stand by your
man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton proposed, the GOP budget would trim the $3.6
trillion publicly held national debt by about $1 trillion over the
next five years, a reduction that most economists say should help
the economy by helping to keep interest rates low. Most of the debt
reduction would come from Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would also boost spending for education, biomedical
research and other programs. But such details are really decided in
later bills. The budget, which does not require Clinton's
signature, only sets overall tax and spending targets for the year.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote, senators agreed Thursday to add another $4
billion to next year's defense budget for a total of $311 billion,
or 7 percent above this year and $5 billion more than Clinton's
proposal. The added money would come from next year's projected
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, by Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, would compensate for a $4 billion Pentagon boost the
House approved in a separate emergency spending bills that Senate
GOP leaders have decided to scuttle.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Durbin's vote on Bush, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
introduced language Thursday that was aimed at Vice President Al
Gore, the likely Democratic presidential candidate. It was approved
99-0.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's language stated opposition to a $3 per gallon gasoline
tax increase -- which Gramm said would be a way to eliminate
internal combustion engines. Gore proposed moving away from the
engines in his book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' but proposed no such
tax boost.

<HEADLINE> WHO Alerts Need for Safe Blood  </HEADLINE>
By GEIR MOULSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The World Health Organization said today that more
than half of the world's countries fail to perform full tests on
donated blood, increasing the risk of spreading AIDS and other
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Five to 10 percent of people with the AIDS virus are estimated
to be infected via blood transfusions, said Yasuhiro Suzuki,
director of WHO's health technologies division.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reliable and safe blood supply is still out of reach for
untold millions of people around the world,'' WHO Director-General
Gro Harlem Brundtland said in a statement released today, marking
World Health Day.
</P>
<P>
   She blamed a ''lack of commitment and support on the part of
many governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Annually, more than 13 million units (pints) of blood -- almost
one-fifth of the world's annual consumption -- not tested for all
infections that could be transmitted by transfusions, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to AIDS, many other diseases -- such as hepatitis B
and C, malaria and syphilis -- also can be transmitted through
transfusions, Suzuki noted.
</P>
<P>
   Only 43 percent of the WHO's 191 member states test blood for
the three viruses, Suzuki said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of the developing world is not complying'' with
WHO guidelines on blood donations, which stipulate that they should
be made voluntarily and without payment by healthy donors, Suzuki
said.
</P>
<P>
   In developed countries, 98 percent of the blood supply comes
from such safe donors, he added. Most blood in developing countries
is provided by relatives or by paid donors.
</P>
<P>
   WHO concedes that blood testing is expensive, costing between
$40 and $50 per unit. It also is not always reliable, particularly
if carried out by inadequately trained staff or with inadequate
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki said that WHO hopes to help offset that. ''We are
planning in the five years to come to install, or to assist member
states to install, a national blood safety program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the campaign backed by the international Red
Cross has adopted the slogan ''Safe blood starts with me.''
</P>
<P>
   It encourages people giving blood to be honest with health
workers in describing any diseases they have had so as to ensure
that their blood does not endanger the health of recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Noel, WHO's coordinator of blood transfusion safety, said
WHO could bulk-buy testing kits for developing countries, but needs
to look beyond that to training staff and building up programs.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, unsafe transfusion and injection practices are
estimated to account for 8 to 16 million hepatitis B infections,
2.3 to 4.7 million hepatitis C and 80,000-160,000 HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
   WHO said little progress has been made globally over the last
quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ''Transmissible diseases are not the only issue,'' said Noel.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries which lack an organized transfusion system,
donated blood is simply unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Some 75 million units of blood are given worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   More than half that amount -- 44.9 million units of blood each
year -- is given in the richest third of the world's countries. The
poorest third account for just 1.3 million units.

<HEADLINE> Justice Not Seeking Tripp Charges  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon and another
Defense Department employee didn't intend to break the law when
they released information from Linda Tripp's personnel file, the
Justice Department said in declining to prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
   The department's decision disclosed Thursday prompted complaints
from Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., that the Clinton administration is
engaging in a ''cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in 1998, Bacon and
Clifford Bernath were involved in informing The New Yorker magazine
that Tripp stated on a security clearance form she never had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tripp was arrested for grand larceny as a teen-ager, a
charge later reduced to loitering in an incident Tripp's lawyers
called a youthful prank. Lawyers for Tripp, whose secret tape
recordings of Lewinsky launched the probe that resulted in
President Clinton's impeachment, was part of a pattern by the
president's supporters to attack his political enemies. Tripp is
suing the Clinton administration for releasing the information.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney said the criminal
division's public integrity section concluded there was
insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bacon
and Bernath had the required willful intent and knowledge to
violate the Privacy Act.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon's lawyer, Bill Murphy, suggested the Pentagon information
about Tripp was properly disclosed to a reporter under the Freedom
of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   ''In short, FOIA trumps the Privacy Act'' in this instance, said
Murphy. Bacon has said that he regretted answering a reporter's
question about Tripp and not checking with Pentagon lawyers before
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe, the Republican senator, said no one is being held
accountable for a violation of Tripp's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does it say to citizens who want to serve in government
that their most private confidential personnel file can be leaked
to the press in clear violation of the law, the perpetrators can be
caught, and yet nothing is done?'' Inhofe asked.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said the IG's
tentative findings in the matter have been provided to Bacon and
Bernath, and they have 14 days to provide comment before the report
is made final. The report goes to Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a federal judge found Clinton engaged in a criminal
violation of the Privacy Act when he released letters from
presidential accuser Kathleen Willey. The president's supporters
said the warmly worded letters, released during the Lewinsky
scandal, undermined Willey's contention that Clinton had made an
unwanted sexual advance against her. The White House is appealing
that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kohn, a lawyer for Tripp, said, ''It's hypocrisy to
prosecute Linda Tripp and at the same time decline prosecution of
Pentagon employees who violate the rights of a federal witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is being prosecuted in Maryland on charges of violating
the state's wiretap law because of her taping of Lewinsky's
conversations.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears OK of $1.83TR Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is on the edge of blessing a $1.83
trillion budget for next year that will move lawmakers a step
closer to a campaign season full of battles with President Clinton
over spending and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was expected to approve the Republican-written
package today, after voting on perhaps dozens of amendments. They
began the day facing what the Senate Budget Committee chairman,
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said were 111 amendments -- two-thirds
from Republicans -- but leaders were hoping many would be resolved
without time-consuming roll calls.
</P>
<P>
   Since the House approved a similar budget two weeks ago, the GOP
goal was for Congress to pass a compromise measure by April 14, in
time for lawmakers' spring recess. Yet even before the Senate
completed its plan, the two parties were attacking each others'
fiscal visions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has submitted a political budget,'' Domenici
said Thursday of Clinton's fiscal 2001 spending plan, which calls
for more spending and smaller tax cuts than Republicans want.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said Clinton's proposed increase in domestic spending
for 2001 was made ''either to embarrass us or make us spend
precisely what he wants, which is way too much.'' He wants about
$320 billion, or about 14 percent over this year's total and $30
billion more than Republicans say they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the proposed GOP tax cut of at least $150 billion
over the next five years would consume virtually the entire budget
surplus, not counting Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats even introduced the $483 billion tax cut likely GOP
presidential standard-bearer George W. Bush has proposed for 2002
through 2006 and dared Republicans to vote for it. It was rejected
99-0, with Republicans wary that it could drain Social Security
surpluses both parties want to leave alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who forced the voice on Bush's tax
plan, taunted Republicans, saying they should obey ''that noted
political philosopher, Tammy Wynette, who said, 'Stand by your
man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton proposed, the GOP budget would trim the $3.6
trillion publicly held national debt by about $1 trillion over the
next five years, a reduction that most economists say should help
the economy by helping to keep interest rates low. Most of the debt
reduction would come from Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would also boost spending for education, biomedical
research and other programs. But such details are really decided in
later bills. The budget, which does not require Clinton's
signature, only sets overall tax and spending targets for the year.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote, senators agreed Thursday to add another $4
billion to next year's defense budget for a total of $311 billion,
or 7 percent above this year and $5 billion more than Clinton's
proposal. The added money would come from next year's projected
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, by Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, would compensate for a $4 billion Pentagon boost the
House approved in a separate emergency spending bills that Senate
GOP leaders have decided to scuttle.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Durbin's vote on Bush, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
introduced language Thursday that was aimed at Vice President Al
Gore, the likely Democratic presidential candidate. It was approved
99-0.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's language stated opposition to a $3 per gallon gasoline
tax increase -- which Gramm said would be a way to eliminate
internal combustion engines. Gore proposed moving away from the
engines in his book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' but proposed no such
tax boost.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 67.41; Dow Down 3.64  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as a
stronger-than-expected government employment report hurt blue chips
and more bargain-hunting lifted the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 3.64 at 11,110.63. The Nasdaq composite
index was up 67.41 at 4,334.97.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 5.35 at 1,506.69.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported today that the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent in March, above the 4
percent that some economists had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   The government also reported that 416,000 jobs were added to
business payrolls in March, the largest gain since February 1996.
But government analysts said a number of special factors, including
the hiring of Census workers, led to a big gain in job growth.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose 0.4 percent to $13.60 in March, in line with analyst
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Today's job report raised expectations that the Federal Reserve
would boost interest rates next month, the sixth time since last
June that the Fed will have moved to slow the economy and keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan again cautioned
that the continuing tight labor market will force businesses to
offer higher and higher wages to woo workers, which could cause
inflation to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   While blue-chip shares were under pressure today, technology
stocks had another strong session as investors bought shares of
companies that saw their market valuations crushed in the steep
selloff Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm rose 1| at 140}, Intel gained 2 7/16 to 132\ and
America Online rose 1 1/16 to 66 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 127.65 million
shares, behind Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.42 to 538.92.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.19 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.16 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
0.17 percent.

</P>
<P>
   ''This market continues to be driven by the continued enthusiasm
of technology investors,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market
strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   That helped offset some weakness that came from a confusing
government jobs report, which investors struggled to digest.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the Labor Department reported that the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent in March, above the 4
percent that some economists had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose 0.4 percent to $13.60 in March, also in line with analyst
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But the government also reported that a surprisingly strong
416,000 jobs were added to business payrolls in March, the largest
gain since February 1996. Government analysts said a number of
special factors led to big gain in job growth, including the hiring
of census workers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's job report raised expectations that the Federal Reserve
would boost interest rates next month, the sixth time since last
June that the Fed will have moved to slow the economy and keep
inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan again cautioned
that the continuing tight labor market will force businesses to
offer higher and higher wages to woo workers, which could cause
inflation to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recognize that the unemployment rate did not drop, but the
job increase was a big number and I don't doubt at all that the Fed
will go ahead with another rate hike,'' Skrainka said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to next week, many investors were watching their
moves before the crush of the corporate earnings season.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 284.01 million
shares, down from 345.11 million shares on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Earnings Test Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of Americans 65 through
69 will no longer lose Social Security benefits because they keep
working.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be a happy day for Americans of all ages today
because a very good thing has been done for the future,'' President
Clinton said as he signed a bill eliminating the Social Security
earnings test.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the earnings cap ''made some sense in the Great
Depression when the nation was desperate to find jobs for young
workers with families and the unemployment rate in our nation was
25 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Conditions today could hardly be more different,'' Clinton
said. ''The economy is booming, the unemployment rate (is) at its
lowest point in 30 years, companies desperately need more workers.
Older Americans have the skills and the experience that businesses
need.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was approved without dissent by an election-year
Congress. ''For too many years, America's working seniors have been
getting penalized,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert said. ''Starting
today they will get the paycheck they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   In signing the bill, Clinton also unveiled an Internet service
offered by the Social Security Administration for younger Americans
who want to get an online estimate of future retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our new Internet service ... will accomplish step one of
retirement planning, helping workers to understand the amount of
Social Security benefits they can expect in retirement,'' said
Social Security Administrator Kenneth S. Apfel.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed legislation repealing Social Security's earnings
limit last month, without a dissenting vote. It was hailed by
Republicans and Democrats alike as long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty is left over from an era of high unemployment when
policy-makers wanted to encourage older Americans to retire and
make room for younger workers. It has reduced Social Security
payments by $1 for every $3 a beneficiary between the ages of 65
and 69 earned in wages over a certain amount -- $17,000 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Now, employers facing a tight labor market are clamoring for
more workers and there are many jobs in retail and services that
are a perfect fit for people over age 65.
</P>
<P>
   The repeal is retroactive to Jan. 1 and directly affects 800,000
Social Security recipients who are working this year and another
100,000 who haven't sought benefits because they have jobs. With
the earnings test eliminated, each of these people could receive an
additional $6,700 in Social Security this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the repeal is retroactive, about 415,000 working seniors
or dependents will get refunds for the money already deducted this
year from their Social Security checks -- a total of $1.4 billion or
an average of $3,500 per person.
</P>
<P>
   Apfel has said those checks should be sent by early May and
monthly benefits adjusted by June.
</P>
<P>
   For younger Americans interested in planning for retirement,
Social Security's new Internet service offers three increasingly
detailed levels of benefit estimates, each requiring the user to
type in more information about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest, ''quick calculator,'' asks only for a person's age
and current-year earnings. The most sophisticated requires the user
to download software onto a home computer and allows him or her to
try out various retirement scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The new online retirement calculators will not tap into private
records that Social Security keeps about individuals' work and
earnings histories. They rely solely on information provided by
online users.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration met with privacy concerns
raised by Congress and in 1997 dismantled a service giving people
the opportunity to check their Social Security records online.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this year, the agency is providing that information --
including official earnings records and benefit estimates based on
them -- to all Americans over age 25 the old-fashioned way: in
annual mailings, via the post office.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears OK of GOP Budget Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate is on the edge of blessing a $1.83
trillion budget for next year that will move lawmakers a step
closer to a campaign season full of battles with President Clinton
over spending and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was expected to approve the Republican-written
package today, after voting on perhaps dozens of amendments. They
began the day facing what the Senate Budget Committee chairman,
Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said were 111 amendments -- two-thirds
from Republicans -- but leaders were hoping many would be resolved
without time-consuming roll calls.
</P>
<P>
   Since the House approved a similar budget two weeks ago, the GOP
goal was for Congress to pass a compromise measure by April 14, in
time for lawmakers' spring recess. Yet even before the Senate
completed its plan, the two parties were attacking each others'
fiscal visions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has submitted a political budget,'' Domenici
said Thursday of Clinton's fiscal 2001 spending plan, which calls
for more spending and smaller tax cuts than Republicans want.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said Clinton's proposed increase in domestic spending
for 2001 was made ''either to embarrass us or make us spend
precisely what he wants, which is way too much.'' He wants about
$320 billion, or about 14 percent over this year's total and $30
billion more than Republicans say they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the proposed GOP tax cut of at least $150 billion
over the next five years would consume virtually the entire budget
surplus, not counting Social Security money.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats even introduced the $483 billion tax cut likely GOP
presidential standard-bearer George W. Bush has proposed for 2002
through 2006 and dared Republicans to vote for it. It was rejected
99-0, with Republicans wary that it could drain Social Security
surpluses both parties want to leave alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who forced the voice on Bush's tax
plan, taunted Republicans, saying they should obey ''that noted
political philosopher, Tammy Wynette, who said, 'Stand by your
man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton proposed, the GOP budget would trim the $3.6
trillion publicly held national debt by about $1 trillion over the
next five years, a reduction that most economists say should help
the economy by helping to keep interest rates low. Most of the debt
reduction would come from Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would also boost spending for education, biomedical
research and other programs. But such details are really decided in
later bills. The budget, which does not require Clinton's
signature, only sets overall tax and spending targets for the year.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote, senators agreed Thursday to add another $4
billion to next year's defense budget for a total of $311 billion,
or 7 percent above this year and $5 billion more than Clinton's
proposal. The added money would come from next year's projected
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, by Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, would compensate for a $4 billion Pentagon boost the
House approved in a separate emergency spending bills that Senate
GOP leaders have decided to scuttle.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Durbin's vote on Bush, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
introduced language Thursday that was aimed at Vice President Al
Gore, the likely Democratic presidential candidate. It was approved
99-0.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's language stated opposition to a $3 per gallon gasoline
tax increase -- which Gramm said would be a way to eliminate
internal combustion engines. Gore proposed moving away from the
engines in his book, ''Earth in the Balance,'' but proposed no such
tax boost.

<HEADLINE> Lithgow Brings Don Quixote to TNT  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Don Quixote had Sancho Panza. John Lithgow,
even luckier, had buddies like actor Bob Hoskins and megaproducer
Robert Halmi Sr. join his quest to bring Cervantes' classic tale to
television.
</P>
<P>
   The result is ''Don Quixote,'' a beguiling, 2{-hour TNT movie (8
p.m. EDT Sunday) which Lithgow co-produced and in which he plays
the fabled Spanish dreamer. Hoskins co-stars as his sidekick, and
Isabella Rossellini and Vanessa Williams are featured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my idea,'' said Lithgow, whose weekly job is portraying
an addled alien on NBC's ''3rd Rock From the Sun'' sitcom. ''I'd
proposed it to Bob (Halmi); we're old friends. Within two days it
was all set up at TNT, and a year later we were shooting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting acclaimed British actor Hoskins on board was equally
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ''I called him and said, 'Here's the deal, Bob. You play Sancho
Panza. I'll be Don Quixote. We'll do it in Spain.' He said yes
immediately,'' Lithgow recalled. ''Then it took agents months to
thrash it out. But I knew it would happen because Bob said it
would.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lithgow, the role itself seemed as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a tall, middle-aged character actor, there's Don Quixote,
King Lear -- and maybe Ichabod Crane,'' said Lithgow, laughing.
''These are the great tall, skinny character parts, and Don Quixote
is the best of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor, dressed for an interview in an elegantly tailored
business suit, appears more dapper than gangly in person. The only
evidence of his daft ''3rd Rock'' persona is the chortle that
occasionally escapes his lips.
</P>
<P>
   He's downright giddy over ''Don Quixote.'' The project's
impressive circle of collaborators included John Mortimer
(screenwriter and author of the Rumpole courtroom novels) and
director Peter Yates (''Breaking Away,'' ''The Dresser'').
</P>
<P>
   ''And I get credit for being executive producer of this,''
Lithgow said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel de Cervantes' enduring novel, published in Spain in two
volumes in 1605 and 1615, tells of a country gentleman's fervid
imagination and the misadventures he encounters in the name of
chivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow, who devoted months to reading the nearly 1,000-page
work, said he was surprised by its ''vastness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I had some actual accounting, but it must include 200
adventures, and our movie is about 25 of them, a tiny fraction of
the book,'' he said. ''I became the great storyteller around the
crew, telling, sort of wistfully, all these wonderful tales we
couldn't squeeze into the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The script that Mortimer culled out is ''very tenderhearted,
much more than the book,'' Lithgow said, and focuses on the
affection between the don and the servant who becomes enamored of
Quixote's ''fantastical ways.''
</P>
<P>
   There is literal fantasy in the movie, courtesy of special
effects sequences that bring Don Quixote's delusions to life.
Producer Halmi has gotten tagged with effects overkill in other
recent projects such as ''The 10th Kingdom'' miniseries, but more
restraint is shown here.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very intentional that they just be little grace
notes,'' said Lithgow. ''We didn't want it overwhelmed by
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow had a brush with a Quixote movie that never came
together. So did Yates, who was set to direct another version about
20 years ago that also faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was to star Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole, with O'Toole
playing Sancho, which I thought was rather the wrong way around,''
Yates said. (O'Toole ended up as Quixote in a 1972 film that
co-starred James Coco as Panza.)
</P>
<P>
   Pairing the 6-foot-4 Lithgow as Quixote and the 5-foot-6 Hoskins
as his loyal follower was more logical, the director said.
</P>
<P>
   He also feels that Don Quixote's character has been subject to
misrepresentation. The don is not necessarily insane when he tilts
at windmills he mistakes for giants, Yates says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it mad to want to leave the place you're in if you feel
it's small and can be frustrating and to want to live in another
place? He admired the time when there was chivalry and knights,''
said Yates. ''He wants adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Quixote's quests, mad or not, struck a chord with Lithgow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The exploits of Don Quixote are a metaphor for an actor's
career. Every role you play is another fantastic adventure,'' he
said. ''I hope I'm not quite as deluded as Don Quixote, but I do
have that same crazed thirst for adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly not me as a person,'' he added. ''Which is probably
why I pour all my adventure into acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the musical ''Man of La Mancha'' should brace
themselves: There are no tunes in ''Don Quixote.'' Lithgow can sing
(he's recorded songs for children and performed at Carnegie Hall)
but doesn't in this drama.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to drive a stake through the heart of 'Man of La
Mancha' and remind people this was a great novel 400 years ago,''
the actor said firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, says Yates, the stage musical is ''not really 'Don
Quixote.' It's about Cervantes and what mood he was in while
writing 'Don Quixote.'''

<HEADLINE> Gulf Vet Study Finds Brain Damage  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- A small-scale study of Gulf War veterans who
complained of dizziness shows some of them appear to have brain
damage similar to that found in victims of the 1995 Tokyo subway
nerve-gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center study of 43
people said the veterans' reactions on audiological tests were
consistent with patients who have disfunction deep in the inner ear
and brain stem.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Roland, who led the study, called the findings
''subjective evidence'' of brain stem damage that could point to a
link between the Gulf War veterans' attacks of dizziness and
exposure to toxic nerve agents.
</P>
<P>
   Though this study did not produce actual photographic or
chemical evidence of brain damage, researchers at UT Southwestern
announced last year they had taken brain scans of the same Gulf War
veterans that show brain damage possibly caused by toxic chemical
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects in the most recent study underwent a battery of tests --
designed to measure deep-seated brain responses -- that analyzed
their eye movements and body sway to determine how often and why
they felt dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   ''These tests have shown evidence of dysfunction in the deepest
structure of the brain where the body controls balance,'' said one
of the study's authors, Dr. Robert Haley, chief of epidemiology at
UT Southwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Haley said the brain damage was the same type of problem seen in
victims of the 1995 sarin gas attack on a Tokyo subway. Some
Japanese studies have shown subtle brain damage in some of those
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of the Texas study were 23 members of a Naval
Mobile Construction Battalion, known as Seabees, who complained of
dizziness and other symptoms, and 20 other military veterans who
were not ill. Researchers were not told which subjects had reported
feeling sick.
</P>
<P>
   Among the veterans who said they felt sick, 16 reported they
often felt dizzy and overcome by vertigo. All but one of the 16 had
abnormal test results indicating symptoms of brain stem damage were
present, Haley said.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon statement issued Thursday in response to the study
called the findings important but inconclusive. The Pentagon
acknowledged that research had proven some Tokyo sarin attack
victims suffered subtle brain damage, but said human and animal
studies have yet to link Gulf War service with this level of
neurological damage.
</P>
<P>
   This latest study appeared in the March issue of the journal
Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Along with fatigue, memory loss and joint pain, loss of balance
is among the unexplained symptoms of some Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research sponsored by the Pentagon has suggested the
symptoms, including dizziness, were caused by psychological factors
such as stress and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our tests showed this dizziness is not caused by psychological
factors, but more likely by physiological problems,'' Roland said.
''In other words, these people are not faking it and they aren't
stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lloyd Minor of Johns Hopkins University, who was not
involved in the study, said it was important in identifying that
something was wrong with the inner ear and deep brain systems that
control balance in the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   But he said more research is needed to draw a direct link
between possible chemical exposure and the subtle brain damage
found in the research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we need to know why do they perform differently on these
(balance) tests?'' Minor said. ''Do they perform differently
because of some other factor, like impaired concentration, or was
it really exposure?''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today, led by another rally in
technology shares as investors snapped up stocks at bargain prices
after this week's sharp selloff.
</P>

<P>
   On one hand, the Labor Department reported the nation's
unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent in March, above the 4
percent that some economists had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose 0.4 percent to $13.60 in March, also in line with analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But the government also reported that a surprisingly strong
416,000 jobs were added to business payrolls in March, the largest
gain since February 1996. Government analysts said a number of
special factors led to big gain in job growth, including the hiring
of census workers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's job report confirmed expectations that the Federal
Reserve would boost interest rates next month in its ongoing effort
to slow the economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
   The market held its gains after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
defended the central bank's five interest rate increases over the
past 10 months in a speech in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be careful to keep inflationary pressures
contained,'' Greenspan said in remarks to the National Technology
Forum. ''The evidence that inflation inhibits economic growth and
job creation is too credible to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to next week, many investors were watching their
moves before the crush of the corporate earnings season. Earnings
are generally expected to be quite strong, but in a nervous market,
investors are leery of even the slightest disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 589.96 million
shares, down from 691.48 million shares on Thursday. On the Nasdaq,
advancers were ahead by an 8-to-5 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.65 to 539.15.

<HEADLINE> Head of Kennedy Center To Step Down  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence J. Wilker, president of the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts since 1991, will leave at the end of
the year for a job to bring more entertainment to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the perfect time for me to begin a new, exciting and
challenging chapter of my life,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Wilker, 56, will join Lou Reda, a leading producer of programs
for the History Channel and Arts and Entertainment, in a private
venture to deliver what the Kennedy Center called ''quality
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilker's time at the Kennedy Center has been marked by the
introduction of daily free performances in the building where the
price of opera seats runs into three digits. The Millennium Stage
presents a one-hour program, often devoted to popular music, at the
end of the long lobby called the Grand Foyer -- a popular tourist
sight dominated by a sculpture of President Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium Stage has contributed to doubling performances at
the center from 1,680 to more than 3,300 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wilker, national tours of Kennedy Center productions have
been set up to reach 37 states, 80 cities and more than 400,000
children each year.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which also puts on concerts, plays, musicals and
films, is in the midst of a $170 million renovation program.
President Clinton appeared at the reopening of a refurbished
Concert Hall to lead the National Symphony Orchestra in a
performance of John Philip Sousa's ''The Stars and Stripes
Forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Basic improvements are being made to the center's Opera House,
which may become the permanent home of the Washington Opera after a
multimillion dollar plan fell through last year that would have
remade the closed Woodward and Lothrop Department Store into an
independent opera house closer to the center of the capital.

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Police are investigating a complaint
that Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., pushed and injured a woman at
the Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The woman accused Kennedy of grabbing her arms and pushing her
as he tried to pass a security checkpoint on March 26, Officer
Guillermo Campos said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman filed a battery complaint, stating she had been
injured, Campos said. The complaint was not released and Campos
would not identify her or release further details.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's chief of staff, Tony Marcella, denied the woman's
allegations. Marcella confirmed that Kennedy was at the airport on
March 26 but would not comment further.
</P>

   Kennedy, 32, is head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, the party's chief fund-raising arm in the House.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 178; Dow Down 2.79  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index ended a rocky week
with its biggest point gain ever today as investors snapped up
stocks with strong prospects for earnings growth. Blue-chip stocks
turned lower due to weakness in financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq rose 178.69
points to close at 4,446.25. The Dow Jones industrial average
slipped 2.79 to close at 11,111.48.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mostly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 15.01 to 1,516.35.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,537 up, 1,427 down and 491
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 888.39 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.
999.37 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 8.74 to 541.24.	   The
technology rally rounded out a week of intense volatility on
Wall Street. The Nasdaq, which plunged 349 points Monday and as
much as 574 points Tuesday before marching back, ended the week
down just 126.58, a loss of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 189.56 points, or 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks had another strong session today as investors
bought shares of companies whose prices were crushed in the steep
selloff Monday and Tuesday. Qualcomm rose and JDS Uniphase were
among the gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's technology components were also higher. Intel and
Hewlett Packard rose.
</P>

   ''This market continues to be driven by the continued enthusiasm

gauge of inflation pressures, rose 0.4 percent to $13.60 in March,
also in line with analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was fairly benign, and may have given people some reason
to get back into the market,'' said Dan Goldfarb, sector manager at
mutual fund company David L. Babson.
</P>
<P>
   But the government also reported that a surprisingly strong
416,000 jobs were added to business payrolls in March, the largest
gain since February 1996. Government analysts said a number of
special factors led to big gain in job growth, including the hiring
of census workers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's job report raised expectations that the Federal Reserve
would boost interest rates next month in its ongoing effort to slow
the economy and keep inflation under control. Financial stocks,
which are highly sensitive to rising interest rates, slipped. J.P.
Morgan fell, accounting for most of the Dow's losses.
</P>
<P>
   The broad market held its gains after Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan defended the central bank's five interest rate increases
over the past 10 months in a speech in St. Louis.

   Tommy Hilfiger provided the latest example of that skittishness
today. Shares plunged to a five-year low, after the fashion house
warned earnings will be on the low end of analysts' expectations
because of continued sluggish sales.

<HEADLINE> Post Office Reacts to Rolling Trucks  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Letter carriers around New England are
being forced to walk more of their routes and make fewer stops
because of repeated accidents in which parked mail trucks rolled
away.
</P>
<P>
   By May, mail carriers will also be issued blocks that they will
have to put under their wheels every time they get out of their
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of carriers were not following the procedures and we
were getting rollaways and runaways,'' said Christine Dugas, a
Postal Service spokeswoman in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Under longstanding postal regulations, when mail carriers get
out of their trucks to deliver letters, they must turn off the
ignition, put the vehicle in park, turn the wheels toward the curb
and put on the parking brake.
</P>
<P>
   But New England has seen an increase in incidents in which
trucks rolled away or drove off.
</P>
<P>
   The southeastern New England district, which includes Rhode
Island and southeastern Massachusetts, has had seven incidents in
the past 18 months, Dugas said. No one was injured, but that was up
from three incidents the year before and none at all in the
preceding four years, she said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, over the past year, the Postal Service in New
England has been reducing the number of stops, on the theory that
the fewer times a vehicle has to be parked, the less likely it is
that the carrier will violate procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not had a fatality,'' Dugas said, ''but we don't want
to take that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Letter carriers will also have to walk longer sections of their
routes.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service distinguishes between rollaways and runaways.
Runaways are when the mail carrier leaves the truck running and it
drives off. Rollaways happen when the carrier turns off the
ignition but forgets to put the parking brake on.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent incident, Dugas said, a tree stopped a rolling
truck before it plowed into a room where children were playing.
Another truck hit the side of a house.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've even had a situation where the carrier will lean out of
the truck to put a letter in the box, fall out of the vehicle
because they weren't wearing their seat belt, and have their
vehicle run away,'' Dugas said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington, Bob Anderson,
said the decision to change routes is left up to local districts,
and he did not know of others across the country that are taking
similar action.
</P>
<P>
   However, safety posters picturing a desperate letter carrier
chasing a postal truck hurtling in reverse toward a child playing
on a lawn have been distributed to every post office across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Don Dahlstrom, a letter carrier for 27 years, said the vast
majority of postal workers follow the rules and probably don't need
the chocks, the blocks that will go under the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do the paying, they do the saying. But it's sad that it
has to get as far as this,'' he said. He said he has never had a
truck roll away on him.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline for violating the parking procedures can range from a
reprimand letter to suspension. Punishment for having a vehicle
actually run away varies depending on the carrier's disciplinary
record.
</P>
<P>
   A carrier whose vehicle ran away in Providence in 1998 was
transferred to a job that did not require her to drive. Recently, a
South Dartmouth, Mass., letter carrier was given a seven-day
suspension for driving when he was supposed to be walking and
leaving the keys in his ignition. He has filed a grievance.
</P>
<P>
   Dugas said other carriers have complained that the policy is a
physical hardship for them, and their cases are being examined.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gajdowski, a 28-year carrier with a route in Providence's
jewelry district, said he keeps his keys on a chain attached to his
belt, keeping him tethered to the vehicle until the keys are out of
the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best way,'' Gajdowski said. ''Unless this truck is
in park, you can't get out of the truck because they won't come
out.''

<HEADLINE> Rail Board Sticks to Merger Freeze  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal rail regulators on Friday rejected
requests to lift their recent moratorium on new railroad mergers,
saying the freeze is necessary to give them time to craft new rules
to deal with a rapidly consolidating industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Board rebuffed bids by Texas-based
Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Canadian National Railway to lift
the 15-month moratorium, which the regulators enacted just three
weeks ago. The two railroads argued that regulators lack authority
to refuse to accept new merger filings and should stay their
decision pending court review.
</P>
<P>
   BNSF and CN are seeking to merge in a $6 billion deal. The
transportation board's freeze was put in place just as the two
railroads were poised to file for merger approval.
</P>
<P>
   The board's refusal to stay its decision had been widely
anticipated, but the complaining parties were required to exhaust
their administrative options. Now, they will press their case in
federal court in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not surprised but we're disappointed in today's decision
by the (transportation board),'' said BNSF spokesman Richard
Russack. ''We hope that the U.S. Court of Appeals will respond
positively and promptly to our recent filings.''
</P>
<P>
   BNSF last week filed a motion for a stay of the board's decision
and an expedited court review. CN will head to court early next
week with similar filings, said CN spokesman Jack Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will leave us no other option but to go to court,'' Burke
said of the board's latest action. ''And we'll do that
expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   The board, in its ruling Friday, defended its earlier decision
to impose a 15-month moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because our current regulations are inadequate to address what
will likely turn out to be the final round of North American rail
restructuring, we must adopt new rules before any major
transactions can be considered,'' the regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   Lifting the moratorium would ''force consideration'' of the
BNSF-CN merger before new merger rules can be developed, the board
said. ''We find that such a backwards process is not required by
law and would contravene the public interest,'' the board said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to freeze new mergers followed a four-day hearing
into the future of the railroad industry -- at a time when only six
major railroads are left in the United States and Canada. That
session was called after rail mergers in the 1990s, most notably
the 1996 marriage of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, led to
widespread service disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   BNSF and CN contend they should not be penalized for previous
mergers' failings.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of the Senate Budget Plan  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Highlights of the Republicans' fiscal 2001 budget
that passed
the Senate on Friday, and how it compares with the House-approved
plan and President Clinton's proposal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   --OVERALL: The Senate budget would spend $1.83 trillion next
year, raise $2 trillion in taxes and produce an overall surplus of
about $170 billion, which would be the largest ever. About $166
billion of the surplus would come from Social Security surpluses,
the rest from other programs. The House's and Clinton's budgets are
similar, though Clinton's would produce an estimated $190 billion
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   --DEBT REDUCTION: The Senate, House and Clinton would all assign
the nearly $1 trillion in expected Social Security surpluses over
the next five years to debt reduction. Each would also use part of
the non-Social Security surplus to reduce the debt, with Clinton's
$90 billion being the most.
</P>
<P>
   --TAX CUTS: The Senate would cut taxes by at least $147 billion
over the next five years, and perhaps $40 billion more if the
Congressional Budget Office boosts its surplus estimates this
summer. The House called for at least $150 billion in tax cuts but
left the door open for as much as $240 billion. Clinton proposed
$99 billion in cuts, plus $96 billion in tax increases on
cigarettes and some businesses.
</P>
<P>
   --MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY: Clinton has proposed creating
voluntary prescription drug benefits for all Medicare recipients,
with a net $31 billion cost over five years. GOP leaders say they
favor a plan that omits higher-income people, but have yet to
provide specifics. The House and Senate budgets would set aside up
to $40 billion for the costs, but do not require any action. And
none of the plans propose tax increases or benefit reductions that
many analysts say will be needed to prepare Medicare and Social
Security for the impending retirement of the baby boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   --OTHER SPENDING: The Senate would provide $311 billion for
defense next year, $4 billion more than the House and $5 billion
above Clinton. For domestic programs, the Senate and House would
provide about $290 billion, roughly $30 billion less than the
president wants.

<HEADLINE> Power Co. Pulls Out of Fuel Program  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Virginia Power Co. has decided to pull out
of a government program to burn plutonium-derived fuel in two of
its nuclear power reactors, the utility said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision raises questions about whether the government will
be able to dispose of as much as two tons of plutonium a year by
burning it as a mixed oxide fuel in civilian power reactors as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regret the decision by Virginia power to leave the
consortium,'' the Energy Department said in a statement. But the
department said another utility, Duke Power, ''remains committed to
this important nonproliferation initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   A department source, who declined to be named, said there are
various options available including finding a new utility to
replace Virginia Power or increasing the number of Duke Power
reactors in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department continues to rely on the irradiation of MOX
fuel to eliminate surplus U.S. weapons plutonium,'' said the DOE
statement. The plan calls for disposing of 33 metric tons of
plutonium as MOX fuel by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The government a year ago awarded a $130 million contract to a
consortium comprised of the French nuclear fuel manufacturer,
Cogema, Virginia Power and Duke Power, for the burning of the MOX
fuel in the six reactors, beginning in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Power will use two reactors at its McGuire plant south of
Charlotte, N.C., and two reactors at its Catawba plant near Rock
Hill, S.C. Virginia Power had planned to use its two North Anna
reactors near Mineral Va.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Novelle, a spokesman for the utility, said the decision to
no longer participate in the government program was made as
''purely a business decision'' in light of the corporations recent
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Virginia Power's parent company, Dominion Resources,
merged with Consolidated Natural Gas of Pittsburgh. ''Our strategic
focus as a company was to grow our generation assets in the Midwest
and Northeast sections of the United States. And this (MOX) project
does not fit into our business plan,'' said Novelle.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear nonproliferation watchdog groups, that oppose the
burning of plutonium-based fuel in civilian reactors, said Virginia
Power's decision may jeopardize the Energy Department's plans to
dispose of all the plutonium it plans. That, in turn, could cause
problems with an agreement with Russia on plutonium disposal, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would think this would make it difficult to safely implement
the plan,'' said Tom Clements of the Nuclear Control Institute, a
nonproliferation advocacy group that had criticized the use of
plutonium-based fuel in civilian reactors.
</P>
<P>
   A $1.3 billion processing plant and other facilities, to be run
by Cogema, for converting plutonium to MOX fuel has yet to be
built, but is planned for the Savannah River weapons complex in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The plutonium to be converted to MOX is among the plutonium left
over from the weapons program. About nine tons of less pure
plutonium, not suitable for conversion, is to be encased in glass
logs and buried.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Control Institute has maintained the use of MOX fuel
in civilian reactors increases the safety risk and improperly links
the military and civilian nuclear programs.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Soars 178.89; Dow Falls 2.79  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index ended a rocky week
with its biggest point gain ever Friday as investors snapped up
technology stocks with strong prospects for earnings growth.
Blue-chip stocks turned lower due to weakness in financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose 178.89 to 4,446.45, topping its previous record
point gain, 168.21, set Feb. 22. The Dow Jones industrial average
slipped 2.79 to close at 11,111.48. Broader stock indicators were
mostly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The technology rally rounded out a week of intense volatility on
Wall Street. The Nasdaq, which plunged 349 points Monday and as
much as 574 points Tuesday before recovering, ended the week down
just 126.38, a loss of 2.8 percent. The Dow, meanwhile, rose
189.56, or 1.7 percent over the week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's calm session, when the New York Stock Exchange recorded
its lowest regular-session volume of the year to date, helped
investors wipe away some memories of Tuesday's chaotic session. The
short-lived shakeout inflicted the most damage on the Nasdaq as
investors questioned prices on many of the technology stocks they
had bid dramatically higher on the promise of future earnings
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the selloff drove technology stocks to more
affordable levels, prompting some investors to look for bargains.
But investors, still wary of the volatile sector, confined much of
their buying to stocks that have proven track records and earnings.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case Friday, when investors sought out shares of
companies that are already earning money and growing quickly.
Qualcomm rose 13[ to 152\ and JDS Uniphase gained 10] to 121~.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's technology components were also higher. Intel rose 7
to 136 13/16 and Hewlett Packard rose 5~ to 154.
</P>
<P>
   ''This market continues to be driven by the continued enthusiasm
of technology investors,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief market
strategist at Edward Jones of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   That helped offset some weakness that came from a mixed
government jobs report.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported the nation's unemployment rate
held steady at 4.1 percent in March, above the 4 percent some
economists had been expecting. And average hourly earnings, a key
gauge of inflation pressures, rose 0.4 percent to $13.60 in March,
also in line with analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was fairly benign, and may have given people some reason
to get back into the market,'' said Dan Goldfarb, sector manager at
mutual fund company David L. Babson &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But the government also reported a surprisingly strong 416,000
jobs were added to business payrolls in March, the largest gain
since February 1996. Government analysts said a number of special
factors led to big gain in job growth, including the hiring of
census workers.
</P>
<P>
   The job report raised expectations that the Federal Reserve
would boost interest rates next month in its ongoing effort to slow
the economy and keep inflation under control. Financial stocks,
which are highly sensitive to rising interest rates, slipped. J.P.
Morgan fell 4} to 129~, accounting for most of the Dow's losses.
</P>
<P>
   The broad market held its gains after Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan defended the central bank's five interest rate increases
over the past 10 months in a speech in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be careful to keep inflationary pressures
contained,'' Greenspan said in remarks to the National Technology
Forum. ''The evidence that inflation inhibits economic growth and
job creation is too credible to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to next week, many investors were watching their
moves before the crush of the corporate earnings season. Earnings
are generally expected to be quite strong, but in a nervous market,
investors fear even the slightest disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Hilfiger provided the latest example of that skittishness.
Shares plunged 4 7/16 to 9], hitting a five-year low, after the
fashion house warned earnings will be on the low end of analysts'
expectations because of continued sluggish sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 15.01 to 1,516.35 on Friday, and
the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 10.49 to 542.99.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, advancers led by a
5-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.10 billion shares, compared with
1.23 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.1 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 1.0 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
1.8 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Family Planning Funds  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Congress debating a new budget, President
Clinton used Friday's World Health Day observance to push lawmakers
for increased U.S. financing of family planning work abroad -- and
to stop restricting how the money is used.
</P>
<P>
   In his fiscal 2001 budget plan, Clinton proposed a $169 million
increase in USAID's international family planning aid package and
$25 million to support the United Nations Population Fund, which
operates in 150 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said 600,000 women die each year from complications
related to pregnancy and childbirth. He wants Congress to raise
family planning assistance to 1995 levels, and he wants the money
to come without a restriction dubbed the ''global gag rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Using U.S. funds to perform abortions abroad has been prohibited
since 1973. Last year, Congress imposed a restriction on giving
money to non-governmental organizations that use money from other
sources to advocate for or provide abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those congressionally sponsored restrictions impose a
destructive double standard,'' Clinton said. ''When would we ever
accept rules telling Americans at home not even to discuss women's
health and women's choices?
</P>
<P>
   ''And how, in the name of democracy and freedom, can we impose
those rules on others which would be illegal here in the United
States?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined at the World Health Day event by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Dr. Enyantu Ifenne, a pediatrician
from Nigeria, who said it is commonplace in her country for
12-year-old girls to marry and begin families.
</P>
<P>
   She politely said the ''gag rule'' was ''very un-American.''
Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., was more blunt. ''Gag rules are
enough to make you gag,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., who led a fight in the House against
the rule, urged citizens to call their congressmen and say: ''I
wouldn't let you gag me, and I will not let you gag anyone anywhere
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all his Republican colleagues agree. Rep. Chris Smith,
R-N.J., released a statement after the event, saying the president
is criticizing the very legislation he signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the president were really committed to family planning -- as
opposed to abortion -- he would enthusiastically embrace the
pro-life policy, which is now, with his signature, the law of the
land,'' Smith said. ''This policy establishes a bright line of
demarcation between those groups that support genuine family
planning and those that refuse to divest themselves from the grisly
business of abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Reps. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y.; Christopher Shays,
R-Conn.; Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; and James Greenwood, R-Pa.,
introduced a bill to repeal the gag rule provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a misunderstanding,'' said Majeed Khan, a visiting
professor at the University of Wisconsin who attended the event in
the East Room of the White House. ''Where there's good family
planning, the abortion rate declines.''

<HEADLINE> Man Accused in Harrison Attack Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, England (AP) -- The man accused of stabbing George
Harrison and wounding the ex-Beatle's wife, was ordered back to a
psychiatric unit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Abram, 33, of Liverpool, spoke only to confirm his
identity and that he understood the charges during a brief court
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court ordered Abram detained at the Scott Clinic outside
Liverpool in northern England, a medium security unit where he has
been under observation.
</P>
<P>
   Abram is charged with the attempted murder in an attack on
Harrison, 56, and his wife Olivia, 51, at their home in
Henley-on-Thames, west of London, on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   George Harrison reportedly fought off his attacker and received
slash injuries and a one-inch stab wound that collapsed his right
lung.
</P>
<P>
   His wife was scratched and bruised in the attack, which
rekindled memories of the murder of fellow Beatle John Lennon. In
1980, Lennon was shot to death in New York City by a deranged fan.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrates ordered another hearing on May 12.

<HEADLINE> Painting Pulled From Capitol Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
By TIM TALLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A painting of a pope with an eye patch has
been replaced in a State Capitol exhibit after a conservative state
lawmaker called it anti-Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The oil painting by O. Gail Poole was scheduled to be part of an
exhibit of works by Oklahoma artists, said Betty Price, executive
director of the Oklahoma Arts Council, which sponsored the exhibit.
The exhibit opened Thursday night with another Poole work in place.
</P>
<P>
   Republican State Rep. Tim Pope complained about the painting
Tuesday as council workers were hanging it and dozens of other
works, Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stopped and looked at one that had the pope with the eye
patch. I stopped and asked what it meant,'' Pope said. ''Knowing
the arts council and their liberal agenda, it looks like the
blinded pope.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that it was very anti-Christian,'' he said. ''Art is
what you see in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope said he questioned arts council workers about the meaning
of the painting but did not ask that it be pulled.
</P>
<P>
   The pope in the painting does not appear to resemble John Paul
II, the current Catholic leader, or any of his predecessors. It
depicts a man dressed in the ceremonial robes of the pope, with a
staff in one hand. The right side of the face is obscured in
darkness and the eye covered with a patch.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, one in a five-work series called ''Popepourri,''
was not intended to be a religious statement, the artist said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people like that, they can find devils in anything,''
Poole said. ''It's just a shame that people can't just look at a
piece of art and enjoy it. It's kind of silly.''

<HEADLINE> Census Dir. Chides Senate Amendment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats accused Republicans in the Senate of
sneaking in an amendment to a budget resolution passed Friday that
urged Americans not be prosecuted for leaving certain questions on
their census form blank.
</P>
<P>
   Census director Kenneth Prewitt said the amendment introduced by
Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., would undermine the quality of information
being collected on census forms.
</P>
<P>
   The nonbinding ''sense-of-the-Senate'' amendment, which was
accepted without objections, said it assumed that no American will
be prosecuted, fined or in ''anyway harassed'' by the federal
government for not answering questions that referred to a
''person's race, national origin, living conditions, personal
habits or mental and/or physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, several congressional Republicans criticized the
53-question long form as being too intrusive, pointing out one
question which asked what kind of plumbing a house had. A question
asking for a person's race is found on both the long and the
eight-question short form.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said people who do not fill out their form could be
fined at least $100, but that fine has been issued only once in the
last 40 years. ''Census 2000 is not designed by law as a
pick-and-choose exercise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people should not fear the census; we should fear
an incomplete or inaccurate count due to lack of participation,''
said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who later added wording to the
amendment that urged everyone to fill out and send back their
census forms.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Republicans recently said they are suggesting
to constituents worried about intrusive census questions to leave
them unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks of Past Presidents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton reflected on his
predecessors and their families Friday at a White House screening
of public television's ''The American President.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hopes the 10-part series that premieres Sunday
will ''give people a feel of the mixture of the personalities and
the character'' of the presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton frequently looked up from his prepared remarks to talk
about past presidents and their families and life in the White
House, from Franklin Pierce to Abigail Adams to Rutherford B.
Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spend a lot of time reading the histories of previous
experiences in the White House and the biographies of some of my
lesser-known predecessors,'' he told an audience of about 150
people, most of them involved in putting together the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many great people have called this house home,'' he said.
''All of them so far have been white males of European decent. I'm
absolutely convinced that in the not so distant future, there will
be a woman president and a person of color who will occupy the
White House and the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the same prediction Thursday in a speech to a group of
corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
   After viewing segments on Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy,
Clinton thanked those involved with the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have reminded us that for all their achievements and all
their failures, they're also people,'' Clinton said.
