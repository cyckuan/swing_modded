   HASTINGS, Neb. (AP) -- The headstones outnumber the monks at the
Crosier Monastery, a sign of why the order is vacating its home of
68 years.
</P>
<P>
   A bustling office park will replace the whispery silence of the
Roman Catholic monastery's 16 wooded acres in this south-central
Nebraska city of 23,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of grieving,'' said the Rev. Jim Moeglein, 57,
who led the monastery for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 priests and brothers, who range in age from 51 to 86,
will move to other Crosier communities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many religious orders in the United States, the
Crosiers, or the Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross, are
faced with fewer members, and little prospect of young people
joining their community.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of priests in the United States, including
monks, has dropped 20 percent since 1965, from 58,132 to 46,600,
according to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. The
church blames that drop on materialism in society and a reluctance
to make permanent commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vocations to religious life are not there, or if they are
there, people cannot hear the call,'' said the Rev. Charles Kunkel,
who leads the Hastings monastery.
</P>
<P>
   As the monks prepare to leave, they are hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're moving, saying goodbye,'' Kunkel said, ''but it is no
longer a funeral. It is giving birth to something new.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crosiers expect the new owner of their property to respect
its religious heritage. An anchor of the office park will be a
Catholic doctor who wants to incorporate mental health counselors
and spiritual healing into his general practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Crosier order, built around the theology of the cross,
ministers to local needs.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1211 in Belgium, the order numbered 750 in 1960, but
today has just 482 priests and brothers in the United States,
Italy, Indonesia, Belgium, the Congo, the Netherlands, Germany and
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The Crosiers established a seminary in Hastings in 1932 but
moved it in stages to Indiana by 1955. The order started a retreat
center at the monastery in 1973, which operated until this year.
Gradually, the property has become a retirement home for older
Crosiers.
</P>
<P>
   But the 241-room, 111-year-old main building has only one
elevator, which is designed to carry freight. Few of its 63
bedrooms have private baths and the building needs major repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The order's aging population needs more accessible facilities,
but the Crosiers could not afford the cost of renovation. They sold
the chapel, building and property for $1 and their moving costs.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen headstones next to the monastery's main building mark
the graves of priests and brothers who served the community, many
of whom died in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll miss this sense of walking among old friends,'' said Barb
Byers, 53, of Omaha, who attended or led retreats at the monastery
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ''I credit my time in the monastery for strengthening
my marriage, helping me to be a better parent.''
</P>
<P>
   The silence is palpable pulling off the street onto the
monastery's grounds, shaded by orderly rows of ash, poplar, oak,
maple and birch trees. A vegetable garden and a small hut used as a
one-person, primitive retreat house grace the property.
</P>
<P>
   Brother Joe DeLouw, 86, planted those trees, cut the grass and
brought two jugs of water and a loaf of bread to the hut one night
each month to be alone with God.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is extra penance to be here,'' the Crosier brother said as
he glanced about the wooden room that holds an oil lamp, wood
stove, desk and cushions on the floor for a bed.
</P>
<P>
   DeLouw came to Hastings in 1982 and is the monastery's oldest
resident. He is taking the move in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm convinced the right decision was made here,'' he said. ''I
was afraid the place would be demolished. I think it's God's
providence that we can continue in spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Crosiers will be moved by Oct. 1 to centers in Anoka,
Shoreview and Onamia, Minn.; Riverview, Mich.; Phoenix or New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Hastings property, which has been in Catholic hands since it
was built by the Visitation Sisters in 1889, was purchased in June
by local developer Tom Lauvetz.
</P>
<P>
   Lauvetz plans to anchor his $2.5 million renovation with a
medical clinic operated by Dr. Michael Skoch, who will provide free
health care for the poor and mental health services. An advertising
agency plans to lease space, and other businesses have expressed
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lauvetz, who is Presbyterian, said he is willing to go out of
his way to respect the Crosier order's hopes for the property.
</P>
<P>
   The chapel will remain open and Masses will be offered, though
it could be converted to nondenominational use.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds will be maintained, including 12 stations of the
cross set up in the trees to commemorate Jesus Christ's death by
crucifixion. Lauvetz will fence and maintain the cemetery and he
will incorporate artifacts left by the Crosiers in decorating the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm definitely ahead if the Crosier connection works with my
tenants,'' Lauvetz said. ''Anything good for their business is good
for my business.''

<HEADLINE> Saunders Breaks Arm Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tony Saunders' comeback from a
broken left arm was derailed Thursday night when the arm snapped
again while he was pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a medical standpoint, him getting to pitch again would
not be optimistic,'' Tampa Bay Devil Rays spokesman Rick Vaughn
said. ''His chances would not be optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, 26, originally broke his left humerus -- the bone from
shoulder to elbow -- while throwing a 3-2 pitch on May 26, 1999, in
a game against the Texas Rangers at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, making his fifth rehabilitation start and third for
Tampa Bay's Class-A affiliate in St. Petersburg, crumpled to the
ground with a similar injury after throwing a wild pitch in the
third inning against Clearwater on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He was in obvious pain and his screams could be heard throughout
the stadium as teammates and trainers rushed to the mound to help
him.
</P>
<P>
   ''To progress where he's progressed, he's a very courageous
young man,'' Vaughn said. ''He said he didn't want to leave
anything on the table. He didn't want to walk away from this
without giving everything he could and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders was taken to Bayfront Medical Center where team
orthopedist Dr. Koco Eaton set the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors said that his spirits were very good,'' Vaughn
said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury came on his 33rd pitch. He had allowed one run and
three hits before the injury on the first at-bat of the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders started his rehabilitation assignment pitching two
games for Charleston in the South Atlantic League, going 0-0 with a
1.80 ERA in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   He had no record and a 3.86 ERA in his first two games with St.
Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the signs were very encouraging,'' Vaughn said. ''We hoped
as he hoped that he would join the major league club.''
</P>
<P>
   Saunders was 3-3 with a 6.43 ERA in 1999 and came within four
outs of pitching the first no-hitter in Devil Rays' history on
April 22. He is 13-24 with a 4.56 ERA in three major league
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Three other pitchers since 1989 -- left-handers Dave Dravecky,
Tom Browning and John Smiley -- have had similar injuries, but never
fully recovered.

<HEADLINE> Source: Brackens, Jags Close To Deal  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Defensive end Tony Brackens is close
to signing a six-year contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the negotiations who requested anonymity told
The Associated Press the deal between the AFC Central champions and
the Pro Bowl defensive end should be completed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Brackens saw his first preseason action Thursday night in the
Jaguars' 31-20 loss to Atlanta. He played 10 plays and made four
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   When he signs, it will close a contentious summer of bargaining,
during which Brackens stayed away from camp and, when he reported
earlier this month, threatened to leave again if a long-term deal
wasn't reached.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were no closer to a deal early in the week. But
negotiations in the past day have led to the framework for the
agreement, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past season, some top defensive ends have signed
contracts averaging about $7 million a year. Brackens was thought
to be seeking something a little less than that. The last known
offer the Jaguars made was worth an average of $6.1 million per
year with an $11 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars received assurances that they wouldn't have to pay
the entire signing bonus in case Brackens gets injured or doesn't
perform, while Brackens got more money.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he signed the one-year, $4.2 million contract he
was entitled to as Jacksonville's franchise player. But he had no
intention of playing for that, signing it only to get into camp and
keep negotiations from shutting down completely.

<HEADLINE> Rams 24, Cowboys 17  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Trent Green is getting a pretty good idea
of how cozy Kurt Warner had it leading the St. Louis Rams offense
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Green threw touchdown passes of 15 and 48 yards and safety Keith
Lyle returned a fumble 42 yards for another touchdown, leading the
Rams to a 24-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in the preseason
finale for both teams Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping stars healthy for the opener was more important than
tuning up for the regular season. St. Louis (2-2) kept Warner and
running back Marshall Faulk on the sidelines in pads, while Dallas
(0-5) let running back Emmitt Smith wear shorts as he capped a
preseason in which he never played.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys extended their preseason losing skid to 14 of 15.
This was Dallas' second winless preseason in the last three years
after two in its first 38.
</P>
<P>
   Green played the entire first half and was 9-of-12 for 171
yards. The players around him made him sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Bruce caught a pass on his back, then lateraled to Ricky
Proehl for a 50-yard gain. Chris Thomas had two steps on two
defenders when he caught a bomb, then walked into the end zone when
the beaten Cowboys collided and fell.
</P>
<P>
   Az-Zahir Hakim made Green's short TD pass look easy by speeding
past his defender on a perfect post pattern. And when a drive
stalled at the Dallas 6, Jeff Wilkins salvaged it by kicking a
24-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas opened the game with its first-string offensive line and
tight end David LaFleur together for the first time this preseason.
Their protection helped Troy Aikman go 6-of-7 for 71 yards in his
only two drives.
</P>
<P>
   But the results weren't that good as the Cowboys continued to
struggle deep in enemy territory.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's first series ended with an underthrown lob to Joey
Galloway that Dexter McCleon intercepted in the end zone. The
second one started on the St. Louis 34 and ended four plays later
with a 44-yard field goal by Tim Seder.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Stoerner drove the Cowboys to two touchdowns in 2&AMP;frac12;
quarters: an 8-yard pass to Wane McGarity and a 7-yard run by
Michael Wiley that was set up by a 26-yard reception by McGarity.
McGarity also had a 51-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
   James McKnight was another plus for Dallas, catching four passes
for 70 yards. He made some nice moves after one short catch,
turning it into a 36-yard gain. He also made a downfield block on a
long running play.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley was the culprit on Lyle's touchdown. After gaining 23
yards on four straight carries, he fumbled on the fifth and the
safety scooped it up and ran it back with only Stoerner chasing
him.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of the game was that neither team suffered any
serious injuries. The worst of it was a strained hamstring that
knocked out Dallas receiver Chris Brazzell in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Warner sat to protect him from getting injured and to rest a
sore right shoulder. He was on the field 90 minutes before kickoff,
lobbing the ball 12 and 20 yards for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the game, the Cowboys reached an injury settlement with
quarterback Paul Justin and claimed tight end Chris Fontenot off
waivers from Oakland. Dropping Justin saves Dallas saves $500,000
in salary cap money.

<HEADLINE> Patriots 29, Panthers 21  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- In an experimental role as a short-yardage
quarterback, Michael Bishop relieved Drew Bledsoe and ran for a
touchdown Thursday night to lead the New England Patriots to a
29-21 exhibition victory over the Carolina Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Otis Smith intercepted a pass to set up another
touchdown and added a sack -- just one day after he was signed by
the Patriots (3-2). The Panthers (0-4) also finished the 1997
preseason 0-4 before going 7-9 in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Dane Looker caught two touchdown passes -- one from
John Friesz and one from Tom Brady -- and may have vaulted from the
bottom of the depth chart on to the Patriots roster. But the
biggest surprise was the new wrinkle in the battle to be Bledsoe's
backup.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, who's more mobile than either Bledsoe or Friesz, was
supposed to be competing with Friesz to be the No. 2 quarterback.
But new coach Bill Belichick instead sent Bishop out to replace
Bledsoe on short-yardage situations.
</P>
<P>
   On third-and-inches from the Panthers 20 with four minutes left
in the first quarter, Bishop replaced Bledsoe and handed the ball
off to Tony Carter for 3 yards and a first down. Bledsoe came out
to lead the Patriots the rest of the way to the 1 before Bishop
came in and, after handing off once for no gain, ran it in on an
option for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After a Carolina penalty on the extra point attempt, the
Patriots opted to go for 2. First Bledsoe ran out with the offense,
but then he returned to the sideline and Bishop came out; he handed
off to Chris Floyd for no gain, and it was 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was 7-for-8 for 78 yards in all. Friesz was 6-for-12 for
68 yards, connecting with Looker after Smith's 35-yard interception
return brought the ball to the Panthers 5.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop didn't throw a pass but ran twice for 1 yard. Brady threw
for a touchdown, but he also fumbled when he was sacked by Haven
Fields early in the fourth quarter to set up a Carolina field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Beuerlein was 2-of-3 for 29 yards for the Panthers,
including a 13-yarder to Tshimanga Biakabutuka that gave Carolina a
7-0 lead with 7:39 left in the first quarter. Jeff Lewis was
7-of-12 for 69 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Dameyune Craig hit Casey Crawford on a 2-point conversion to
make it 29-21 after Morgan Kane's 2-yard touchdown with 2:56 left.
An onside kick attempt failed, and when Carolina got the ball back
they missed on two desperation passes.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Vinatieri kicked field goals from 33, 32 and 35 yards.
Carolina's Richie Cunningham missed two field goal attempts, from
32 and 47 yards, but connected from 36 and 34.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the plays where Bishop replaced him, Bledsoe played
two series in the first quarter. On New England's opening drive, he
fumbled a bad shotgun snap from Jason Anderson; the other center,
Damian Woody, was injured when his helmet was torn off in the first
quarter, further throwing the Patriots' snapping situation into
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   It was 7-6 after one quarter when Friesz came in and was
intercepted by Lester Towns on his first pass attempt. The Panthers
could only manage Cunningham's first missed field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the next drive, Friesz hit Shockmain Davis for 19 yards and
Chris Calloway for 22 to set up another field goal by Vinatieri
that gave New England a 9-7 lead. Anthony Johnson fumbled at his
own 14 on Carolina's first play to set up another field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers went one-and-out again when Smith intercepted Lewis
and ran the ball to the Carolina 5. Two plays later, Friesz hit
Looker to make it 19-7. Brady hit Looker on a 17-yard touchdown
pass with 4:26 left in the third to make it 26-7.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Head Calls For Pipeline Rules  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- The head of the nation's accident
investigation agency Thursday urged the oil and gas industry to
support stricter pipeline standards after touring the site of the
country's deadliest pipeline disaster in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very few of our citizens know in how close a proximity they
live, work, and in this case, play to these pipelines,'' said Jim
Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven people were killed and another was critically injured
Saturday when a pipeline exploded near their campsite along the
Pecos River south of Carlsbad. The blast sent a fireball 350 feet
into the sky and shot flames over the campers.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary investigation found corrosion in one section of
the El Paso Energy Co. pipeline, though no official cause for the
explosion has been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of the same pipeline run near schools, playgrounds and
other populated areas, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley Coyner, who oversees pipeline safety for the Department
of Transportation, described the more than 2 million miles of
pipeline in the United States as an aging infrastructure laid 40 to
50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We risk facing more of these tragedies unless we act,'' Coyner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has been pushing for stricter pipeline safety
regulations since 1985, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a proposal backed by the agency and now before Congress
would require internal inspection of pipelines, additional training
for company employees responsible for pipeline safety, automatic
shut-off valves that can quickly isolate pipeline ruptures, and the
use of tougher steel in the manufacture of new pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Overseeing the industry isn't easy, Hall said. He said the
pipeline safety agency, funded by fees assessed on the oil and gas
industry, is severely underfunded and has only 55 inspectors to
cover the 2 million miles of pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso Energy Co. spokesman John Somerhalder said the company
''will do what it takes to make sure this kind of incident doesn't
happen again.'' But he stopped short of endorsing the NTSB
recommendations. He said the company supports safety regulations
that are realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Somerhalder said that the budget for pipeline inspection and
technical support will more than double to $34 million next year
and that the industry has spent $4 million on a program to improve
pipeline inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a good-sized research program,'' Somerhalder said.

<HEADLINE> Continental plane spins after landing at Newark International Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A Continental Airlines jet spun around and
blew out four tires after its brakes locked upon landing at Newark
International Airport Thursday night, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported after Flight 4282 from Savannah, Ga.,
had the rough landing at 9:47 p.m., according to the Federal
Aviation Administration. The plane was a 50-seat Continental
Express Embraer jet used for regional flights, a Continental
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently the brakes locked and the aircraft made several
complete spins and came to a stop 4,000 feet down the runway from
where it touched down,'' FAA spokesman Jim Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 24 passengers and three crew members aboard,
according to Peters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pilot reported landing was normal but the brakes locked
and that's when the plane turned on the runway,'' Continental
spokeswoman Karla Villalon said
</P>
<P>
   ''It spun around. I'm not sure how many times,'' said Sgt.
William Korbul of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
police. ''It blew four tires and could not be moved. The runway is
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said the FAA was on the runway investigating the incident
Thursday night and would continue Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at the aircraft and we'll be investigating to
see what happened,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers and crew got off the plane by stairway and were
taken to a terminal by bus, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It certainly is an unusual incident for us,'' Villalon said.
''We are trying to investigate why it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second incident involving a Continental plane at the
Newark airport Thursday. Earlier in the day, a Continental jetliner
nearly landed on a closed runway.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 757 with 125 passengers and seven crew members came
within 10 feet of landing before the pilot, alerted by an air
traffic controller, pulled up and flew around to land on the
correct runway. The 6:15 a.m. incident is under investigation by
aviation regulators. No one on board was injured.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A Continental Airlines jet spun around and

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet Nigerian Leader  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- As he jets around the world, he's hailed
as the man who restored democracy to Africa's most populous
country. But back home, Nigeria's president struggles to reform a
nation thrown askew by corruption, factional fighting and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months after taking office as Nigeria's first elected
leader in more than a decade, President Olusegun Obasanjo has won
international admiration -- but a mixture of grudging respect and
distrust in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Can one man restore stability to Nigeria, which often teeters
near anarchy, after decades of military rule?
</P>
<P>
   So far, Obasanjo's achievements are modest: He has managed to
oust restive soldiers who took part in a string of previous
military dictatorships. He has also put human rights back on the
government agenda after years of state-sponsored repression.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's genteel, old-world manners and his friendships with
figures like former President Jimmy Carter and Nelson Mandela have
helped the 63-year-old leader transform Nigeria into an influential
African power.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to Nigeria this weekend highlights the
U.S. view that Nigeria's fledgling democracy is crucial to the
continent's future.
</P>
<P>
   Yet peace and prosperity remain elusive. Critics accuse Obasanjo
of worsening religious, ethnic and political tensions by being
indecisive. Fighting between Christians and Muslims over a proposal
by several northern states to implement Islamic law, or sharia, has
taken hundreds of lives since March.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to fight poverty in the oil-rich Niger Delta has stalled
as militant activists in impoverished communities launch attacks
against oil companies in a bid to win payment for land use or
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's opponents, who have threatened impeachment
proceedings unless he tackles corruption, have not accused the
president of stealing, but blame his underlings. Graft within the
government and the state-regulated oil sector -- a multibillion
dollar industry -- remains among the world's highest, diplomats and
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, two Senate presidents and the House speaker
have been forced out for either lying about their qualifications or
embezzling funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it comes to controlling the military and making friends
abroad, President Obasanjo gets a 10 out of 10. But corruption is
another matter. He utters all the right words but we don't see the
results,'' said Sen. Idriss Abubakar, chairman of a House of
Assembly committee overseeing state spending.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo is a contradictory figure. Although he gained an
international reputation as a democrat after becoming Nigeria's
first military leader to voluntarily hand over power in 1979, he
retains close ties with former junta alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo first came to power in 1976 after his predecessor in
the ruling junta was killed in a coup attempt. He stepped down
three years later to allow civilian elections.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Obasanjo has tried to reinvent himself as an elder
statesman, shedding military garb in favor of ethnic Yoruba robes
and a traditional cap.
</P>
<P>
   A Baptist, he is nevertheless supported by many Muslims and
distrusted by many Christians because of his background in the
army, long dominated by northern Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians like Louis Moses, an accountant from the southeastern
city of Calabar, believe that despite his faults, Obasanjo is the
only man who can unite the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We Nigerians don't always work as a team,'' Moses said. ''We
will scream and kick at Obasanjo from time to time but that doesn't
mean we don't support him as long as he can hold Nigeria
together.''

Cheney headed the oil services company for five years after formerly serving in
Congress and as secretary of defense; Bush also is a former oil company
executive. Cheney resigned his post last week. The $791,100 in energy
contributions during the last week of July were part of the $25.2 million in
soft money donations the RNC took in last month -- half as much as they raised

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Begins  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN PABLO TORO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Washington's new envoy to Colombia has
formally taken over her post, saying she wants speedy delivery of a
$1.3 billion U.S. aid package to fight the drug trade in this
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
   The aid, sought by President Andres Pastrana as part of his Plan
Colombia, is aimed primarily at stamping out cocaine and heroin
production and trafficking from this South American country. Among
other things, it will buy 60 combat helicopters for Colombian
troops and train two Colombian army battalions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in the interest of the United States to give support for
Plan Colombia as quickly and effectively as possible,'' Ambassador
Anne Patterson told reporters Thursday after presenting her
diplomatic credentials to Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   The aid is meant to help Colombian troops take control of
drug-growing areas so planes can destroy drug crops with aerial
spraying without being shot down by leftist rebels. It has raised
concerns in neighboring countries, however, about spillover
effects.
</P>
<P>
   One of Patterson's first tasks will be to ensure that President
Clinton has a successful visit to Colombia next Wednesday -- the
first visit by a U.S. president in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed a national security waiver this week exempting
the Colombian military from human rights standards set by Congress
as a condition of approval for the U.S. aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, who previously served as U.S. ambassador to El
Salvador, said she was convinced Pastrana's administration and the
Colombian military high command are committed to overcoming human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   She called ''a little exaggerated'' fears expressed by some
neighboring countries about the anti-drug offensive -- including
that it might send a flood of refugees across their borders and
that the spraying of drug crops will harm the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said the United States is aware of the concerns and
will do what it can to help the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about Plan Colombia, meanwhile, led to a spat between
the foreign ministers of Colombia and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   After Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel said in a
radio interview that violence in Colombia threatened neighboring
countries, his Colombian counterpart accused Rangel of
''stigmatizing'' Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It shows a lack of respect for Colombia,'' said Colombian
Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez de Soto.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials, meanwhile, said Thursday they fear Plan
Colombia may exacerbate its problems with an influx of refugees and
guerrilla battles on its border. Interior Minister Winston
Spadafora said he has requested aid from the United Nations to
prepare for spillover effects.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 Colombians have crossed into Panama over the past
four years, fleeing their homes to avoid violence linked to the
country's civil war, human rights officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, dozens of confrontations have erupted
between Panamanian police and armed Colombian groups in the area,
leaving numerous Panamanian police injured.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Brazil announced plans to beef up security
along its border with Colombia amid fears that defeated guerillas
might flee across the border and drug lords may try to transplant
cocaine-producing plantations into Brazil's Amazon jungle outback.

<HEADLINE> Russia Wary of Kosovo Elections  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia has warned that Kosovo's first
internationally supervised election could threaten regional
stability and undermine efforts to establish a real democratic and
multiethnic society.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and Britain welcomed the municipal
election Oct. 28 as an essential step to building democracy in the
province, just over a year after Yugoslav forces withdrew following
a 78-day NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At an open Security Council meeting, the split over Kosovo was
as evident as it was during last year's conflict, which followed a
Serb crackdown on the province's ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has close cultural and religious ties with the Serbs and
has been Yugoslavia's strongest supporter on the Security Council
along with China, while the United States and Britain strongly
supported the NATO bombing and the U.N. administration's efforts to
promote self-government in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov accused the U.N.
administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, of setting an election
date without consulting the council and of ignoring international
experts who expressed ''very serious doubts'' about holding
elections without the participation of ethnic Serb and ethnic
Turkish minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really do have very serious concerns that this idea to hold
the election at all costs on Oct. 28 could undermine all the
efforts to establish a real democracy and multiethnic society in
the region,'' Lavrov said.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council resolution that ended the bombing and set
up the U.N. administration of Kosovo in June 1999 reaffirms
Yugoslavia's sovereignty over the province. But Lavrov accused the
United Nations of undermining Belgrade's sovereignty and
''preparing the groundwork for Kosovo to separate from
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. deputy ambassador James Cunningham commended Kouchner and
said the election ''has our strong support.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Any delay in municipal elections will only benefit Belgrade's
desire to frustrate implementation'' of the Security Council
resolution, Cunningham said. And a delay will ''deny responsible,
self-government to all those in Kosovo, including the Serb
community there.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's deputy U.N. ambassador Stewart Eldon called the
election ''an essential step in building a democratic framework for
Kosovo, and key for the normalization of a shaken society.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Hedi Annabi told
the council that ''widespread intimidation from hard-line Serb
elements, including open threats to cut off pensions or inflict
physical injury, dissuaded the vast majority of Kosovo Serbs'' from
registering to vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Lavrov said intimidation by radical Serbs is probably ''the
least significant reason for non-registration by Serbs.'' The main
reason minorities didn't register is the lack of security, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have this constant feeling that their lives are
threatened. They don't have any freedom of movement, and they see
that extremist Albanian elements are carrying out their activities
against the minorities in Kosovo with impunity,'' Lavrov said.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Arrested in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- They bear a striking resemblance. But it
remains to be seen whether the detention of an Argentine in Mexico
is a laudable international law enforcement effort in the name of
human rights or simply a case of mistaken identity.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol and Mexico's federal police detained Ricardo Miguel
Cavallo during a stopover in Cancun on Thursday after a newspaper
reported that five former Argentine political prisoners identified
him as their torturer during their country's military dictatorship,
said the head of Interpol in Mexico, Juan Miguel Ponce. He said
officials want to question Cavallo about his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving on his flight, Cavallo, director of Mexico's
private National Registry of Motor Vehicles, had told several media
organizations that he was flying to Argentina to obtain evidence to
prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Under an Argentine amnesty law, military officials responsible
for human rights violations during the military dictatorship cannot
be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's daily Reforma newspaper reported Thursday that
Ricardo Miguel Cavallo was identified by five former political
prisoners in Argentina as being Miguel Angel Cavallo, listed as one
of the torturers at the infamous Navy Mechanical School during
Argentina's military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who issued the warrant that kept
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet under house arrest in
London for 16 months, has accused Miguel Angel Cavallo of torture,
falsification of documents, terrorism and car theft, according to
the Argentine human rights group Center for Social and Legal
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ponce said officials had no information on the alleged
Spanish investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, who is investigating human rights abuses under the
former military dictatorships of Chile and Argentina, has brought
charges against officials for the deaths of Spaniards in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   At least 9,000 Argentines vanished during Argentina's 7-year
military dictatorship, which ended in 1983. Human rights groups put
the figure closer to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
during Chile's 17-year dictatorship, which started when he ousted
elected Marxist President Salvador Allende in a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Reforma, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo denied that
he was the Argentine torturer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the newspaper published a 1971 photo of Miguel Angel
Cavallo and a current photo of Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, pointing out
their similar facial features.
</P>
<P>
   It also said Miguel Angel Cavallo often used the alias Ricardo,
and that both the torturer and the man who was arrested Thursday
had used the same identification number.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a result of a great international effort involving
many countries,'' said Adriana Calvo, a member of the Argentine
human rights group Association of the Former Detained and
Disappeared, whose members were among those who identified Ricardo
Miguel Cavallo as a former torturer. ''I can't describe my immense
joy, it's great news. There is one less killer walking free in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a retired army officer wanted for
questioning in the 1976 disappearance of a French woman during
Argentina's military dictatorship was detained in Italy. Jorge
Antonio Olivera is being held in Rome, while officials await word
on a possible French extradition request.

China injured 406 people and left 169,000 homeless, an official
newspaper said Friday.

   Eight of the injured were seriously hurt, it said. A woman in a
nearby county also was killed when she fell, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   It said the homeless have been resettled and have received a
first portion of aid. Authorities allotted $36,000 to fund relief
work, the newspaper said.

   He planned to raise $20,000 every day, for a total of $100,000 --
which is small change compared to what the major-party candidates
or even Gov. Gray Davis can collect in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Nader does not accept donations from corporations or political
action committees.
</P>
<P>
   The Field Poll released Thursday showed Nader supported by 4
percent of likely California voters, statistically unchanged from
the 7 percent he drew in a June survey.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore led GOP opponent George
W. Bush 50-37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In an evening speech to more than 1,000 supporters at
Sacramento's Crest theater, Nader issued blistering and at times
personal attacks on Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is Bush going around the country demanding better
education?'' Nader asked. ''He needs it more than anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the Texas governor ''a conglomerate corporation
running for president disguised as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He is owned lock, stock and barrel by corporations. He
couldn't stand up to corporate power. You know why? Because he is
corporate power,'' Nader said, drawing cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Nader dismissed Gore's pledge that he would fight for ordinary
citizens and said he has ignored the Democratic Party's progressive
wing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had broken a series of promises in nearly eight years as
vice president, including pledges to improve health care and the
environment, Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats say, 'Vote for us because we're not as bad as the
Republicans.' Isn't that an optimistic view of American politics?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said at a Capitol news conference that he intended to
appeal to those disinclined to vote and to former supporters of
vanquished presidential contenders Bill Bradley and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier polls have shown that Nader's supporters generally are
defecting from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Party spokesman Bob Mulholland attended Nader's
news conference, urging reporters to question Nader's integrity and
taunting his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a fraud,'' Mulholland said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said prosperous times and the ongoing economic boom make
third-party efforts such as his easier in some ways, but more
difficult in others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Good times give people an opportunity to discuss issues more
removed from their immediate condition,'' he said in an interview.
''On the other hand, it's not by coincidence that Gore keeps saying
things are good now, because there tends to be a complacency.''

<HEADLINE> UN Troop Contributors Seek Support  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The nine countries contributing troops to
the U.N. peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone want the international
community to support their mission and help promote a political
solution in the war-battered country, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the countries also stressed to senior U.N. officials
that their soldiers could not be expected to take part in ''a
peace-enforcement operation,'' which would be tantamount to going
to war against Sierra Leone's rebels, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front reignited Sierra
Leone's nine-year civil war in May by seizing about 500 U.N.
peacekeepers and keeping 233 others surrounded for 2&AMP;frac12; months,
embarrassing the United Nations and prompting a reassessment of the
U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution earlier
this month calling for an increase in the 13,000-member U.N.
peacekeeping force and spelling out ''priority tasks'' for its
success.
</P>
<P>
   Under this mandate, U.N. troops will concentrate on countering
the rebels ''by responding robustly to any hostile actions or
threats of ... force,'' and on helping the government extend its
authority by deploying at strategic locations.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with military officers from the
nine countries in New York on Wednesday to discuss strengthening
the U.N. mission before he releases a report recommending how it
should be restructured and how many more troops it should have.
</P>
<P>
   The officers -- from Bangladesh, Ghana, Guinea, India, Jordan,
Kenya, Nigeria, Russia and Zambia -- stressed the responsibility of
the international community to assist the mission through political
and material support, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's report is expected Friday, Eckhard said. In May, Annan
recommended increasing the force to 16,500 troops, but figures of
20,000 or more have been mentioned recently.
</P>
<P>
   The officers believe the goal should be a political solution,
achieved with help from West African leaders and the rest of the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The troop contributors also underscored the importance of the
commitment by Sierra Leone's government ''to do its utmost to
stabilize the situation in the country, as well as to maintain
political and military pressure on the RUF,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they noted that some of the priorities set by
the Security Council for the U.N. mission would demand ''a very
strong military peacekeeping presence,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Comets 59, Liberty 52  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS WASZAK Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cynthia Cooper, the two-time WNBA MVP who will
retire after the playoffs, came through down the stretch to put the
Houston Comets on the verge of a fourth consecutive championship.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper scored 20 points, including five in the last minute, as
the Comets held off the New York Liberty 59-52 in Game 1 of the
WNBA finals Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always have stepped it up for the playoffs,'' Cooper said.
''The regular season is great and fine, but the playoffs is where
you're supposed to bring your 'A' game. And that's what I'm
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, 37, shot just 7-for-23 but made some of the most
important baskets of her career late in the game. The Comets can
become the first professional sports team to win four consecutive
championships since the NHL's New York Islanders in 1980-83.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're fighting to make history,'' Cooper said. ''I'm on a
mission because we have made a lot of sacrifices throughout the
season, and deserve to fight for this fourth one. And I'm on a
mission because that's what a professional athlete does at this
time of the year -- elevate her game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson added 15 points and Sheryl Swoopes had 12 for
Houston, which stopped the Liberty's 13-game winning streak at
Madison Square Garden and sent the best-of-three series to the
Compaq Center, where the Comets have lost just once in 12
postseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 is Saturday at Houston, with Game 3, if necessary, there
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going down there to lose, I can tell you that,''
Liberty guard Becky Hammon said. ''We're going down there to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Tari Phillips of New York had 24 points on 10-for-19 shooting
and grabbed 15 rebounds in a game deemed by many Liberty players as
a must-win.
</P>
<P>
   After a sloppy first half in which both teams struggled to
score, Houston and New York turned it on in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets opened up a 52-42 lead on Swoopes' free throw with
7:40 remaining, but the Liberty went on a 6-0 run.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips made a layup at 7:21 to make it 52-44. Tamika Whitmore
made two foul shots at 4:36, and Phillips put back Vickie Johnson's
miss to make it 52-48 with 4:03 left.
</P>
<P>
   The teams went scoreless until 52.3 seconds remained, when
Teresa Weatherspoon made two free throws after getting fouled by
Swoopes, to make it 52-50.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper followed with a tough running layup with the shot clock
winding down and was fouled by Sue Wicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cynthia Cooper made one of the greatest shots you will ever
see,'' Houston coach Van Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who finished 7-of-23 from the field, made the foul shot
to give the Comets a 55-50 lead with 26.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's what you call a champion,'' Weatherspoon said. ''She
just steps up.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' layup with 20 seconds left made it 55-52, but Cooper
made two more free throws to make it 57-52 with 14.1 seconds left.
Janeth Arcain added a layup with 2.1 seconds left to seal it for
the three-time champions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came into this game they were going to make runs at us, and
we just had to overcome those,'' Swoopes said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took a 29-22 lead after a first half marked by both
teams' poor shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, who never led by more than seven points in the half,
shot just 30.6 percent (11-for-26) from the field. But the Liberty
could have been closer had they not shot just 26.9 percent
(7-for-26).
</P>
<P>
   The Comets outshot the Liberty for the game, 35.5 percent to
32.1.
</P>
<P>
   The teams are meeting in the finals for the second straight
year, and third time in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Houston beat New York in the WNBA's first championship game in
1997. The Liberty forced a deciding Game 3 in last year's finals
with a last-second, halfcourt shot by Weatherspoon before losing
the series the next night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went down there and won last year, so we know we can win
down there,'' New York coach Richie Adubato said. ''Any time you
can get a series to a final game, you never know what will
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Customs Stop S. African Swim Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PERTH, Australia (AP) -- A South African Olympic swimming coach
was stopped by Australian Customs officials while carrying 14
tablets containing an herbal form of ephedrine into Perth Airport,
officials confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The tablets were confiscated Wednesday and the coach was allowed
to continue with the team to Sydney to prepare for the Sept.
15-Oct. 1 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Customs confirmed that a passenger declared the
tablets containing a substance called Hydroxycut.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is widely available over the counter overseas,'' Customs
spokesman Leon Beddington told a news conference in Canberra.
''Based on the normal concentration of ephedrine in these tablets,
14 would contain about 0.01 grams of ephedrine.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier broadcast reports suggested that up to 500 tablets had
been seized.
</P>
<P>
   Beddington said for the purposes of Customs legislation, the
substance was not classified as a performance-enhancing drug. He
said the passenger had not breached Customs legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normal Customs procedures, practiced every day throughout
Australia, are that if a passenger is carrying a personal-use
quantity of such a substance and has a doctor's prescription, they
are allowed to keep them,'' Beddington said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they do not have a prescription the substance is seized and
no further action is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials declined to make an official report to the
Australian Sports Drug Agency, which is responsible for doping
tests in all sports within Australia.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 12, Braves 5  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jim Edmonds homered twice and Pat Hentgen pitched
six strong innings, leading the St. Louis Cardinals to a
rain-delayed, 12-5 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Thursday
night in a meeting of division leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled start was held up 2 hours, 23 minutes by a
spectacular thunderstorm. Fans huddled under the stands gasped as
streaks of lightning exploded all around Turner Field, causing the
power to flicker and briefly knocking out two banks of lights.
</P>
<P>
   When the game finally began, the Cardinals quickly took control
against Andy Ashby. Fernando Vina led off with a double, extending
his career-high hitting streak to 16 games, and Edmonds hit a
two-run drive into the left-center seats.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds flipped his bat away after connecting with the 2-0
fastball, while Ashby didn't even bother to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals put the game away with a three-run sixth and
Edmonds hit another homer, his 36th, to lead off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis maintained its 8&AMP;frac12;-game lead over Cincinnati in the NL
Central, while the Braves' margin in the East dropped to two games
over the idle New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez hit his 21st homer in the third. That was the only
major mistake by Hentgen (13-9), who surrendered seven hits before
getting the rest of the night off. He kept the ball in play,
striking out one and walking none.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Edgar Renteria led off with his 15th homer, tying
the St. Louis record for homers by a shortstop set by Solly Hemus
in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Renteria, who also had an RBI single in the fourth, homered
against Gabe Molina, who was making his Atlanta debut after being
called up from Triple-A Richmond on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford added a solo homer, his 19th, in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby (8-11) surrendered 10 hits and five earned runs in 5 1-3
innings. He also was thrown out at the plate in the fifth, but
third-base umpire Mike Fichter ruled a fan touched the ball as it
skimmed along the wall in the left-field corner to give Rafael
Furcal a ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being out of the inning, Hentgen had to pitch to
Andruw Jones with runners at second and third. Jones flew out to
center for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Matheny had a two-run single in the sixth, and things
really got ugly in St. Louis' four-run eighth. Renteria's homer was
the only hit of the inning, but the Cardinals took advantage of
three errors, a walk and a hit batter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals got sloppy, making two errors in the ninth, that
led to four unearned runs for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The announced attendance was 41,166, but many fans left
before the game even started and most of the others hung around for
only a few innings. By the final pitch, there were only a few
thousand still watching. ... Lopez left the game with a bruised
right forearm and underwent precautionary X-rays. He is day to day.

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator Rules in Wrestler's Favor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Hours after an arbitrator ruled
Keith Sieracki's victory in the Greco-Roman wrestling Olympic
trials should stand, a federal appeals court ordered that Matt
Lindland represent the United States in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Insanity, that's what's going on,'' Lindland told the Lincoln
(Neb.) Journal Star on Thursday night. ''I don't know what decision
is final.''
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki beat Lindland in the trials in Dallas in June, winning
the deciding third bout 2-1 in overtime on a referee's decision to
apparently claim the Olympic berth at 167&AMP;frac12; pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland, who had won his eight previous matches against
Sieracki, immediately filed a protest, claiming he had been
tripped.
</P>
<P>
   His argument was denied by USA Wrestling's protest committee, a
decision upheld by USA Wrestling's Greco-Roman Sport Committee
after a second protest.
</P>
<P>
   Lindland then filed for arbitration, was granted a rematch by
arbitrator Daniel T. Burns and defeated Sieracki 8-0 in Colorado
Springs on Aug. 14. Sieracki claimed he was at a disadvantage
because he had just returned from an international tournament in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki then filed his own arbitration and that was the ruling
issued Thursday in Denver by A. Bruce Campbell of the American
Arbitration Association.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to circumvent that arbitration proceeding, Lindland filed
an emergency petition Tuesday, asking the federal court in Chicago
to uphold the prior arbitration ruling that allowed him to wrestle
Sieracki again.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. District Court Judge Suzanne Conlin denied that
request, Lindland immediately appealed her ruling to the
seven-state U.S. Appellate Court in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell directed USA Wrestling to withdraw the nomination of
Lindland and designate Sieracki as the sole nominee to the team
roster at that weight class.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party split opens complex ballot access fight  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - A bitter split in the Reform Party has
left state election officials scrambling to decide whether Pat
Buchanan or John Hagelin will get a spot on the November ballot and
using widely varying approaches to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa officials, faced with competing claims for ballot space,
resorted to drawing lots from a specially purchased glass bowl.
Buchanan's name was pulled, but only after a raucous exchange
between the competing factions.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials in Montana did the same, pulling Hagelin's
name from a ballot box imported for the occasion. Meanwhile,
Buchanan's name was jerked from the ballot in California and party
leaders there ''continue to meet to resolve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a split that was supposed to have been resolved a couple of
weeks ago when the Reform Party held its convention and picked
former Republican Buchanan as its nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters labeled that selection as rigged and instead
nominated Hagelin, who previously has sought the presidency with
the Natural Law Party.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps claim to be the legitimate nominee, and that's
causing trouble for state election officials who are facing
deadlines for printing the November ballot. Most of those deadlines
are late August or early September, so time is pressing.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are putting both candidates on the ballot, some are
allowing neither and others are putting the two on the ballot in
different spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we consider that party over-nominated, so pending
any withdrawal by one of the nominees or a court order, neither set
of names will appear on the ballot,'' observed Larry Perosino, a
spokesman for Connecticut's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Given the passion between the two factions, court fights are
expected in a number of states.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa and Montana, election officials threw up their arms and
held a lottery, with Iowa Secretary of State Chet Culver drawing
Buchanan's name.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the drawing, Buchanan will be listed as the
Reform Party candidate and Hagelin will be on the ballot as
''nominated by petition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not taking anyone off the ballot,'' said Culver.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Secretary of State Mike Cooney pulled Hagelin's name
from a ballot box, giving him the Reform Party designation. Both
sides opposed the drawing and a lawsuit is expected.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, Kentucky, South Carolina and Michigan, officials
are pondering the issue, and considering asking the Federal
Election Commission for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get clarification who is the real candidate,''
said Michigan Board of Elections spokesman Chris Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply shrugged. ''There is no decision at this time as
to which candidate will appear on Wyoming's ballot,'' said Deputy
Secretary of State Pat Arp.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, Buchanan is considered the candidate, though
Hagelin could challenge that status. No challenge was filed by a
Thursday afternoon deadline, though a court battle could still
come.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, both will be listed as independents, and in
Minnesota the Reform Party is considered a minor party, though Gov.
Jesse Ventura was once a member.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no protection for the minor parties,'' said Secretary
of State Mary Kiffmeyer. ''This is a very unique circumstance.''
Both men will be listed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin started the year as the Natural Law Party candidate, and
West Virginia election officials say that's how he will be listed
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case in Ohio, too, where Buchanan also submitted
enough petition signatures to get on the ballot as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Buchanan backers had submitted petitions with more
than 30,000 signatures, double the number needed to be listed under
the Reform party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin was first to file in North Carolina, but the State Board
of Elections voted 3-1 Thursday to list Buchanan as the Reform
candidate, despite arguments by party stalwarts that he is not
their choice. State Reform officials had certified Hagelin as their
candidate last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, a supporter submitted Buchanan's name as the party's
nominee, and that's how he'll be listed.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii officials are seeking a legal opinion on handling filings
from a split party, but so far only Buchanan has filed petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls have shown Buchanan with just 1 percent or 2 percent
support nationally. Hagelin has less than that. Reform Party
founder Ross Perot won 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 election
and 8 percent in 1996. He declined to run this year.

<HEADLINE> Raiders 20, Seahawks 0  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- On the same day wide receiver Andre Rison
was charged in Missouri with passing bad checks, he made his
exhibition debut with the Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Rison, who signed with Oakland earlier in the week, caught two
passes for 49 yards as the Raiders beat the ineffective Seattle
Seahawks 20-0 in their preseason finale Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He made a dramatic catch early in the second quarter, snagging a
35-yard pass from Bobby Hoying, then dancing through a field of
defenders before being forced out of bounds. After the play he
pointed triumphantly to his new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Hoying hit Jeremy Brigham with a 10-yard scoring pass on the
same series. Hoying added a 2-yard scoring pass to Mondriel
Fulcher, and top draft pick Sebastian Janikowski had field goals of
43 and 33 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, who has boasted he can make a 65-yard field goal,
attempted a 62-yarder as time ran out in the first half, but it
fell far short.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren suggested earlier this week that
his team was tired from the preseason, and on Thursday night they
looked it -- unable to get within even field goal range.
</P>
<P>
   Rison was charged Thursday with four counts of passing bad
checks totaling $158,000, according to prosecutors in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The checks were written to a jewelry store between June 1998 and
December 1998, while Rison was with the Kansas City Chiefs. The
Chiefs waived Rison last week, and the Raiders signed him on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Rison could get five years in prison. Prosecutors
hope he will surrender when he arrives to Kansas next month to face
trial on unrelated theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders had no comment on the current charges before
Thursday night's game. Rison easily won the most applause from the
Oakland crowd when he was introduced with the other starters before
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders starter Rich Gannon played for nearly all of the first
quarter. But Hoying, who was sacked by Seattle's Michael Sinclair
on his first play, was responsible for most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski hit a 43-yard field goal to cap the Raiders' first
series of the game, for his sixth straight exhibition field goal.
But he missed a 42-yard attempt later in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Janikowski's 62-yard attempt, from the dirt on the
Oakland A's infield, with time running out in the first half. The
ball bounced in the end zone. The NFL record is 63 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Janikowski made several long field goals,
including a successful kick from about 67 yards.
</P>

Sierra Leone Troop Contributors Seek Support
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The nine countries contributing troops to the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone want the international community to support
their mission and help promote a political solution in the war-battered country,
a U.N. spokesman said. Most of the countries also stressed to senior U.N.
officials that their soldiers could not be expected to take part in ''a
peace-enforcement operation,'' which would be tantamount to going to war against
Sierra Leone's rebels, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday.

Transplants Show Promise for Lupus

<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- New research bolsters the hope that doctors might one day be
able to use bone marrow transplants to cure autoimmune diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus. A few people with autoimmune
diseases -- where the immune system goes awry and attacks the body -- already
have been injected with their own immature blood cells, called stem cells. The
results have been promising, with some remaining in remission, but researchers
have not tracked many people for very long.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Washington's new envoy to Colombia has formally
taken over her post, saying she wants speedy delivery of a $1.3 billion U.S. aid
package to fight the drug trade in this war-torn country. The aid, sought by
President Andres Pastrana as part of his Plan Colombia, is aimed primarily at
stamping out cocaine and heroin production and trafficking from this South
American country. Among other things, it will buy 60 combat helicopters for
Colombian troops and train two Colombian army battalions.

Russia Wary of Kosovo Elections

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Russia has warned that Kosovo's first internationally
supervised election could threaten regional stability and undermine efforts to
establish a real democratic and multiethnic society. But the United States and
Britain welcomed the municipal election Oct. 28 as an essential step to building
democracy in the province, just over a year after Yugoslav forces withdrew
following a 78-day NATO bombing campaign. At an open Security Council meeting,
the split over Kosovo was as evident as it was during last year's conflict,
which followed a Serb crackdown on the province's ethnic Albanian majority.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox drew praise from Al

neighborliness was mixed with reservations -- especially from Bush -- about
Fox's proposal to eventually open the U.S.-Mexican border. On a visit rife with
political overtones both north and south of the border, Fox spent an hour with
Gore strolling the grounds of the vice president's official residence, then went
to the White House for an Oval Office meeting with President Clinton. He will

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is investigating the safety of Firestone

Thursday its investigation includes all 47 million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness

''Very few of our citizens know in how close a proximity they live, work, and in

<HEADLINE> 'MNF' Needs To Iron Out Kinks  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Ohlmeyer is like an NFL coach who uses the preseason to
check out his personnel and work out kinks in the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   The producer of ABC's ''Monday Night Football'' acknowledges
there still is some work to be done before his show's regular
season kicks off Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of things that we want to work on,'' says
Ohlmeyer, who was at the show in the 1970s and returns this year
with a hand-picked cast. ''The first telecast, we were at about 40
percent, the second telecast at about 50. Now we're about 65
percent to where I want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the basic coverage of the game is really quite good.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the three preseason games reveals some positives and
negatives:
</P>
<P>
   -- Al ''Do You Believe in Miracles'' Michaels is still at the top
of his game as a play-by-play announcer, but the camaraderie --
giggling doesn't count -- with Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts is often
lacking. Michaels should refrain from trying to match Miller's wit,
and might want to excise ''baby'' from his vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   -- The show's overwhelming effort to be hipper than hip --
embodied most glaringly by Miller -- was apparent in the scoreboard
graphic Monday identifying the home team as ''Fins.'' Fans can only
hope they wouldn't try to squeeze ''Monsters of the Midway'' on
there if the Chicago Bears were playing.
</P>
<P>
   -- Miller, whose ''Dennis Miller Live'' gets a plug from Michaels
each broadcast, still doesn't seem to be sure when to chime in,
though his timing has improved with each outing and he certainly
can be riotously funny. He could stand to drop yells of ''Yeah!''
or ''That's my guy!'' on big plays. Miller also will lose a lot of
material now that the preseason is over, because much of his
football commentary has been about how players are fighting for
roster spots.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who knows what will happen when there's a meaningful game
that's tight in the fourth quarter? With about six minutes left in
Monday's game between Green Bay and Miami, Fouts was drowned out by
the clowning Miller and Michaels. ''Why would I break in with a
football note? I was just remarking to myself while I was watching
the game by myself over here,'' Fouts said, tongue-in-cheek to be
sure, but tellingly.
</P>
<P>
   -- There have been some technical problems, including Brett
Favre's name being spelled ''Brent'' in a graphic comparing his
statistics with Dan Marino's, and less-than-smooth transitions to
sideline reporters Melissa Stark and Eric Dickerson (who is out of
his element and uses the word ''now'' in every sentence). Those
things are to be expected in a three-hour live broadcast, Ohlmeyer
says: ''We have an entirely new team. Rarely do you see a telecast
that doesn't have some technical glitches in it.''
</P>
<P>
   What's really important for ABC is whether people tune in. The
show's preseason ratings were down 24 percent from last year, which
doesn't worry Ohlmeyer. He points out that two of the three games
started at 7 p.m. EDT instead of 8, and that NFL preseason ratings
are down for other networks, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I know is, for the first time in a long time I sense a
lot of people on Tuesday morning are talking about 'Monday Night
Football' and that hasn't been the case,'' Ohlmeyer says. ''And
they weren't talking about whether the score was 30-0 or 33-6.''

   TIGER'S HOOK: When CBS reporter Bill Macatee conducted the PGA
Championship award ceremony Sunday at the 18th green, he said,
''Thank you, Tiger Woods, thank you, Bob May, for giving us all a
day to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking for golf fans, but he could have been speaking
for the network.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' telecast drew the highest rating for the PGA's final round
in 29 years -- and the second-highest ever.
</P>
<P>
   The 8.8 national rating, with a 21 share, was 28 percent higher
than the 6.9/18 for Woods' 1999 victory. Only the 1971 PGA, won by
Jack Nicklaus, got a higher final-round rating -- ABC got a 12.1/32.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 38.5 million people watched all or part of CBS'
broadcast, the biggest turnout for a PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can watch Woods in another head-to-head contest Monday
from 8-11 p.m. EDT, when ABC airs ''Battle at Bighorn,'' a $1.5
million made-for-TV match-play event between Woods and Sergio
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could play each other in the Ryder Cup next year and
whoever wins this one will be one-up on the other guy. The loser
will deny it, but it carries over with you,'' said Curtis Strange,
who will share announcing duties with jack-of-all-sports Mike
Tirico.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia challenged Woods down the stretch at last year's PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always want to beat your opponent, and you want to beat
Tiger more,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' dominance ''brings people to the course, it makes the
purses go higher and it attracts more sponsors and that's what
keeps us playing golf,'' Garcia said. ''A lot of that is because of
Tiger.''

<HEADLINE> Trainer Makes Second Saratoga Start  </HEADLINE>
By ED SCHUYLER JR.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Trainer Richard Mandella thought
he had the best 2-year-old last year in Dixie Union, a colt who
finally seems ready to blossom as a 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   A victory in the Travers on Saturday at Saratoga would be Dixie
Union's second straight in Grade I stakes and make him a player in
the race for the 3-year-old championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought from day one he would do whatever we asked of
him,'' Mandella said Thursday after the colt was made the 5-2 early
favorite to beat eight other 3-year-olds in the 1&AMP;frac14;-mile Travers.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union was doing pretty much what was asked of his last
year when he scored four wins, three of them in graded stakes, and
finished second in another stakes before chipping a knee while
finishing fifth in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, won by Anees, the
2-year-old champion who no longer races.
</P>
<P>
   ''The surgery went well, and we thought it was possible to make
the Triple Crown,'' Mandella said. ''But the weather forced him to
miss some training at Santa Anita, so we scrapped our plans and
ended up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus has not raced since
finishing second in the Preakness, won by Red Bullet, who finished
third in the Dwyer in his only start since.
</P>
<P>
   Dixie Union, ridden by Alex Solis, opened his 3-year-old
campaign by winning an allowance race May 7 at Hollywood Park. He
then finished second in two stakes before winning the Haskell
Invitational on Aug. 6 at Monmouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brew, Ohio Derby winner and third in the Haskell, was
the 3-1 second choice. Third at 7-2 was Unshaded, second in the
Peter Pan at Belmont Park and third in the Belmont Stakes and in
the Jim Dandy on Aug. 5 at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Also entered Thursday for the $1 million Travers were Postponed,
Albert the Great, Commendable, Curule, Impeachment and Country
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Postponed, who followed his Peter Pan win with a seventh in the
Belmont and a fourth in the Jim Dandy, is trained by Scotty
Schulhofer, trainer of Lemon Drop Kid, winner of the 1999 Belmont
and Travers and this year's Whitney Handicap at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Albert The Great beat More Than Ready, Preakness winner Red
Bullet and Commendable in the four-horse Dwyer on July 9 at Belmont
Park, but ran seventh in the Jim Dandy. Besides the fourth in the
Dwyer, Commendable also finished eighth in the Haskell in two
starts since his Belmont victory.
</P>
<P>
   Curule, seventh in the Kentucky Derby and eased in the Belmont,
won an allowance race and was second in the Jim Dandy in his next
two starts. Impeachment finished third in both the Derby and
Preakness, then was fifth in the Belmont and sixth in Haskell.
Country Coast was third and second in two allowance races in his
last two outings.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment's trainer, Todd Pletcher, also will saddle More Than
Ready, fourth in the Kentucky Derby, and Left Bank, in the
seven-furlong Jim Bishop. More Than Ready will carry high weight of
124 pounds in the Grade I stakes, with a purse of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Each Travers starter will carry 126 pounds in the Grade I
stakes, which will be televised on ESPN from 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.
EDT. Post time is 5:12 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The field in post-position order is Country Coast, Marlon St.
Julien; Curule, Mike Smith; Commendable, Pat Day; Milwaukee Brew,
Jerry Bailey; Postponed, Edgar Prado; Unshaded, Shane Seller; Dixie
Union, Solis; Impeachment, Richard Migliore; and Albert the Great,
Jorge Chavez.

<HEADLINE> Bellaire, Maracaibo in LLWS Finals  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- The downside to winning the U.S. title
for Bellaire, Texas, is that it won't have Ross Haggard available
to pitch in Saturday's Little League World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bellaire manager Terry McConn is concerned. He said
he's got three other capable pitchers ready to go against
Maracaibo, Venezuela, in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   None of them, however, have been as good as Haggard.
</P>
<P>
   The lanky Little Leaguer capped an exceptional series
performance with a 13-strikeout, four-hit outing in Bellaire's 8-0
win over Davenport, Iowa, in Thursday night's U.S. final.
</P>
<P>
   Haggard finished with two shutout wins, a save, 27 strikeouts
and five hits allowed in 16 2-3 innings at Williamsport. He also
pitched a no-hitter a week earlier in the South Region championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine another week (like this),'' Haggard said. ''To
be in the World Series and to have my best pitching, that's
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what sparked him, he said, ''I think it's because I wanted
to show everyone on TV that I was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Now everyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his teammates are no slouches either, considering
Bellaire had never before advanced past the district round.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they'll take their balanced hitting attack and deep
pitching staff against an upstart Maracaibo team that knocked off
favored Tokyo 5-4 in the international final earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the opponent, it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   As McConn said: ''It's just been a blur. I'm ready to play that
World Series game on Saturday and get back home and go to work and
think about some of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo's week has been just as exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sporadic offensive punch, and after barely reaching the
international final on the strength of a last-inning rally to beat
Toronto 5-4, Maracaibo is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   In a jubilant celebration in which Maracaibo manager Eduvino
Quevedo hugged every player on the field -- including Tokyo's.
</P>
<P>
   ''His main goal was to win a championship,'' said interpreter
Luis Sanchez, speaking for Quevedo. ''He came here and beat a very
great team, and he's very happy. He's happy with himself and happy
with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The two opponents took an unlikely path to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire had a pool of just 42 players to draw its team from.
</P>
<P>
   The Maracaibo players, meanwhile, come from a poor part of the
region, and arrived in Williamsport with just one bat. Four of
their players didn't have spikes when they began tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a team that has a bunch of fighters,'' Quevedo said.
''They're from a very poor neighborhood in Maracaibo and they don't
give up very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   They showed that against a highly regarded Tokyo team that went
3-0 in the preliminary round, including a 10-0 win against
Maracaibo, and outscored its opponents by a combined 28-8.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mavarez's three-run homer keyed a four-run second inning,
while Marcel Prado squelched Tokyo's offense, allowing five hits
and striking out nine as Maracaibo became the first Latin American
team to reach the final since Guadalupe, Mexico, won it all 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire, meanwhile, had little trouble beating Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Terrence McConn led the way with two homers, including a
three-run shot, and drove in four runs as Bellaire became the sixth
Texas team to reach the finals, and first since Spring in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended Davenport's heady run as the Iowans not only
ended a three-year Central Region losing streak, but became the
first Central team to reach the final since pool play was
introduced in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport manager Matt Kolar called it ''dynamite week.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a great time,'' Kolar said. ''Shoot, we were
playing in the final game against Bellaire, and you can't beat
that.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Leads NEC Invitational  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Maybe the thing about Jack Nicklaus that
motivates Tiger Woods the most is not what he won, but what he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't turn the switch on and off,'' Woods said. ''Jack was
probably the best at that. I always remember reading that quote. He
says, 'I've never turned the switch on and off. I've always had it
on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was on in the first round of the NEC Invitational on
Thursday, even if he felt a little off. Whatever the case, he had a
6-under 64 at Firestone Country Club and finished the first round
one stroke ahead of Jim Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   Just by watching Woods, one might have guessed he was struggling
to keep it around par. No one could mistake the desire, though, or
even suspect that Woods was suffering a letdown from winning the
PGA Championship just four days before in a draining playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''I drove it terrible on the back,'' he said. ''I was able to
keep it on the property, which is good. That's the extent of it. I
didn't hit the ball very well coming in, and consequently, I didn't
shoot the scores I wanted to shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   What a pity.
</P>
<P>
   All Woods did was go 7 under on the first 12 holes, flirt with
the course-record 61 -- or better -- and wind up with his lowest
first-round score of the year. All everyone else could do was
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get used to seeing Tiger's name up there every week,'' said
Darren Clarke, who beat Woods in the Match Play Championship final
in February and was among six players at 66. ''We're all going to
have to play very well again and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The NEC is for players from the Presidents Cup and U.S. Ryder
Cup team, plus the top 12 Europeans from the European tour money
list.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Westwood of England, Phil Mickelson and Justin Leonard were
also at 66, while Ernie Els and recent Presidents Cup pick Loren
Roberts were in a group at 67. Twenty-one of the 37 players in the
field broke par on a Firestone course with greens softened by
overnight rain.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of them will be chasing Tiger -- again.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has built his year around the majors, and no one can argue
with the results. He became the first player since Ben Hogan in
1953 to win three majors in one year when he rallied to catch Bob
May with birdies on the last two holes, then beat him in a
three-hole playoff at Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Winning can be emotionally exhausting. Winning a major,
especially one like the thriller at Valhalla, can really lead to a
letdown.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Furyk was somewhat surprised to see Woods'
name racing up the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I've had trouble after a win, coming back and playing
extremely, extremely well like that. And then to do after the year
he's had,'' Furyk said. ''But he's had a little more experience
after those wins. He knows how to handle it better than I do.
</P>
<P>
   ''It obviously hasn't bothered him.''
</P>
<P>
   What's left for Woods? More victories? More money?
</P>
<P>
   In one of the few occasions where a golfer actually sounds like
a football player -- or maybe even a construction worker -- Woods
showed why talent alone hasn't taken him to new heights in the
game. He works hard, and he cares about every shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of the week is to win,'' he said. ''When I'm not
playing is the time to rest. When I'm playing this week, it's time
to work, and I'm trying to get myself in position to win come
Sunday afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   He got off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he scowled at himself after his pitching wedge from 116
yards on the first hole wound up 20 feet behind the pin. All it
took was one hole for Woods to pick up where he left off. He hit a
6-iron from 206 yards out on the par-5 second hole within 9 inches
for a tap-in eagle.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the lead after five holes and never gave it back.
</P>
<P>
   The only lapse was when he got in trouble off the tee -- a par
save from the rough on No. 9, another save from a shot off a tree
root on the 13th, and then a couple of mistakes from which he
couldn't recover.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-5 16th, he put his wedge over the green into a
bunker, barely got out of the sand and had to make a 6-footer for
bogey. Then on the 18th, he went into the rough again, and his
second shot hit a tree, leading to another bogey.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Woods went straight to the range and spent 30 minutes
working out the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has already won seven times this year and $6.9 million on
the PGA Tour, breaking his earnings record from last year. At this
rate, he will shatter his record scoring average, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say we're playing for more money,'' said Stuart Appleby,
who had a 67. ''There is only one guy playing for more money. He
gets 18 percent of the prize. We get what's left.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Assists Africa From Distance  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- A month before Bill Clinton entered the
White House in 1993, U.S. Marines stormed ashore in Somalia seeking
to halt a devastating famine and cast the model for future
life-saving interventions in convulsed African states.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the twilight of his presidency, Clinton is making a
weekend journey to Nigeria, home to the latest version of U.S.
peacekeeping efforts in Africa. An advance party of 14 U.S.
soldiers from North Carolina's Fort Bragg touched down here
Wednesday to train Nigerian soldiers for duty in beleaguered Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Africa has endured more ruinous wars than any other region over
the past decade, yet the United States and other Western nations
have largely retreated from the continent. An overstretched United
Nations has struggled to patch together peacekeeping forces made up
mostly of African armies and soldiers from other poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an unspoken policy that the United States won't send
troops to Africa,'' said Salih Booker, head of the Africa Policy
Information Center in Washington. ''Africans are concerned that the
United States has abandoned peacekeeping roles that are supposed to
be a shared international responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   More U.S. military trainers are coming to Nigeria, but they are
not expected to top a few hundred, and there may be fewer. They
plan to work with several battalions of Nigerians at a base in
Ibadan, north of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has allocated $20 million to help train the
Nigerians, who have the most powerful army in West Africa and
extensive experience as peacekeepers -- and combatants -- in Sierra
Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Nigerians also have a reputation for ruthlessness;
human rights groups have accused them of frequent abuses. The U.S.
trainers plan to stress human rights, according to Major Ed Loomis,
a U.S. military spokesman in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have helped prepare several African armies for
regional peacekeeping missions since 1996 in the belief that troops
already on the continent could respond rapidly and would have a
better understanding of local disputes.
</P>
<P>
   However, critics say the U.S. effort has been small scale and is
designed mostly to counter the view that America is ignoring
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and Congress have not ''been willing
to consider more than token funding for U.N. or regional
peacekeeping forces, and each has consistently ruled out U.S. troop
contributions,'' John Stremlau, a former U.S. State Department
official wrote recently in the journal Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeeping missions have traditionally involved soldiers
from a broad cross-section of nations. And the United Nations is
now juggling 14 such operations around the globe, a number that has
risen sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Sierra Leone, none of the 13,000 U.N. troops comes from
Western states. And in war-torn Congo, where the U.N. plans to send
in peacekeepers, neither the United States nor any country in
Europe has volunteered forces.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the current U.S. approach -- training and aid for
African armies, but no American troops -- say it is a prudent policy
in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Africa's wars do not threaten important U.S. interests, they
argue. Also, the African conflicts tend to be highly unstable
guerrilla wars, and U.N. peacekeepers become embroiled.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's detractors acknowledge he has devoted more
attention to Africa than his predecessors, including an 11-day,
six-nation tour in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the deaths of nearly 40 U.S. servicemen in Somalia in 1993,
including graphic footage of a dead U.S. soldier being dragged
through the streets, prompted a swift withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, American forces provided logistical support
following Rwanda's 1994 genocide, and helped deliver food to flood
victims in Mozambique earlier this year. But the Americans have
steered clear of combat.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see a double standard, noting that Washington is willing
to offer troops for long-term peacekeeping missions in Bosnia,
Kosovo and Korea, but not Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria had withdrawn its troops from Sierra Leone, grumbling
about the heavy cost in both money and lives lost. But now the
country has sent more than 3,500 troops back and may send more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like to see a little more burden sharing,'' said
Omafume Onoge, head of the Center for Advanced Social Science in
Port Harcourt, Nigeria. ''Given the continent's weaknesses, the
international community needs to step in to help in African
crises.''
</P>
<P>
   A small number of well-trained Western troops can make a big
difference.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, the mere presence of fewer than 1,000 British
soldiers helped stem an advance by rebels who had taken 500 U.N.
peacekeepers hostage and were approaching the capital Freetown in
May. But then the British forces pulled out and sporadic clashes
between the rebels and the U.N. forces have resumed.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Still Questioned As V.P.  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having Joseph Lieberman as a running mate
could inoculate Al Gore against President Clinton's moral failings,
help attract suburban women concerned about moral values and appeal
to moderate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts regard the Democrat's choice as more of a
political gamble than Republican George W. Bush's pick of Dick
Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, a former defense secretary and Wyoming congressman,
offered reassurance that Bush would have sound advice on foreign
affairs, bolstered his support among conservatives and improved the
his standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's choice of Lieberman, a Connecticut senator and Orthodox
Jew who criticized Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, was
widely viewed as a bold stroke that apparently contributed to a
healthy bounce in the polls for the Democratic presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tactically it helped Gore, got him a lot of positive attention
right when he needed it,'' said John Green, a specialist in
religion and politics and director of the Bliss Institute at the
University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   Both picks have gotten similarly positive reactions in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's moral message has appeal for parents, especially
white suburban women whom Gore has struggled to win over this year.
He could energize Jewish voters and party activists in key states,
both in organizing and fund raising, and his centrist politics
could reassure moderates, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   But his appeal among moderates could fail to materialize,
meaning Gore might not be as free as he'd like to solidify the
Democratic left, Green said. People also may not be as open-minded
about Lieberman's religion as polls would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer agreed, saying the combination of
saturation media coverage and positive emphasis were ''main drivers
of the bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term effect in the fight for states and electoral
votes are harder to estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said Lieberman makes it harder for Gore to attack Bush
on matters such as investing Social Security funds in stocks and
school vouchers. Lieberman has retreated slightly from positions on
these issues that at times seemed closer to Bush than to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the question of whether subtle
anti-Semitism could drag down the Gore-Lieberman ticket. Too much,
in the opinion of veteran Chicago pollster Nick Panagakis, who
noted that Jewish candidates have won statewide elections in
numerous key states including California, and battleground states
in the Midwest and Northeast that Gore needs to win.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said voters should be more
concerned with ''the candidate's character and qualifications and
whose side that candidate is on.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken after Lieberman joined the ticket suggest only a
small number of voters admit to having reservations about a
presidential candidate's Jewish faith. More than nine of 10 say
they would vote for a Jew for president, compared to more than
eight in 10 who would vote for a woman and seven in 10 who would
vote for an evangelical Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The number who say they would vote for a Jewish presidential
candidate has risen considerably over the years, said Tom Smith,
director of the General Social Survey for the National Opinion
Research Center, noting it was about 60 percent half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League,
agreed that anti-Semitism is dropping. But such bias doesn't always
show up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's northern roots could be more of a challenge than his
religion for Democrats in the conservative South, said political
scientist Wayne Parent of Louisiana State University.
</P>
<P>
   Overall voter response to an Orthodox Jewish candidate in a
presidential race is untested.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether there is any residual anti-Semitism
that is not picked up by the polls,'' said Andrew Kohut, director
of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. ''My guess
is that it will be marginal -- but that's a guess.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Split Over Ballot  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A bitter split in the Reform Party has
left state election officials scrambling to decide whether Pat
Buchanan or John Hagelin will get a spot on the November ballot and
using widely varying approaches to figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa officials, faced with competing claims for ballot space,
resorted to drawing lots from a specially purchased glass bowl.
Buchanan's name was pulled, but only after a raucous exchange
between the competing factions.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials in Montana did the same, pulling Hagelin's
name from a ballot box imported for the occasion. Meanwhile,
Buchanan's name was jerked from the ballot in California and party
leaders there ''continue to meet to resolve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a split that was supposed to have been resolved a couple of
weeks ago when the Reform Party held its convention and picked
former Republican Buchanan as its nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters labeled that selection as rigged and instead
nominated Hagelin, who previously has sought the presidency with
the Natural Law Party.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps claim to be the legitimate nominee, and that's
causing trouble for state election officials who are facing
deadlines for printing the November ballot. Most of those deadlines
are late August or early September, so time is pressing.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are putting both candidates on the ballot, some are
allowing neither and others are putting the two on the ballot in
different spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we consider that party over-nominated, so pending
any withdrawal by one of the nominees or a court order, neither set
of names will appear on the ballot,'' observed Larry Perosino, a
spokesman for Connecticut's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Given the passion between the two factions, court fights are
expected in a number of states.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa and Montana, election officials threw up their arms and
held a lottery, with Iowa Secretary of State Chet Culver drawing
Buchanan's name.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the drawing, Buchanan will be listed as the
Reform Party candidate and Hagelin will be on the ballot as
''nominated by petition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not taking anyone off the ballot,'' said Culver.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Secretary of State Mike Cooney pulled Hagelin's name
from a ballot box, giving him the Reform Party designation. Both
sides opposed the drawing and a lawsuit is expected.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, Kentucky, South Carolina and Michigan, officials
are pondering the issue, and considering asking the Federal
Election Commission for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get clarification who is the real candidate,''
said Michigan Board of Elections spokesman Chris Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply shrugged. ''There is no decision at this time as
to which candidate will appear on Wyoming's ballot,'' said Deputy
Secretary of State Pat Arp.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, Buchanan is considered the candidate, though
Hagelin could challenge that status. No challenge was filed by a
Thursday afternoon deadline, though a court battle could still
come.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, both will be listed as independents, and in
Minnesota the Reform Party is considered a minor party, though Gov.
Jesse Ventura was once a member.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no protection for the minor parties,'' said Secretary
of State Mary Kiffmeyer. ''This is a very unique circumstance.''
Both men will be listed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin started the year as the Natural Law Party candidate, and
West Virginia election officials say that's how he will be listed
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case in Ohio, too, where Buchanan also submitted
enough petition signatures to get on the ballot as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Buchanan backers had submitted petitions with more
than 30,000 signatures, double the number needed to be listed under
the Reform party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin was first to file in North Carolina, but the State Board
of Elections voted 3-1 Thursday to list Buchanan as the Reform
candidate, despite arguments by party stalwarts that he is not
their choice. State Reform officials had certified Hagelin as their
candidate last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, a supporter submitted Buchanan's name as the party's
nominee, and that's how he'll be listed.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii officials are seeking a legal opinion on handling filings
from a split party, but so far only Buchanan has filed petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls have shown Buchanan with just 1 percent or 2 percent
support nationally. Hagelin has less than that. Reform Party
founder Ross Perot won 19 percent of the vote in the 1992 election
and 8 percent in 1996. He declined to run this year.

<HEADLINE> RNC Set To Bombard Airwaves  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential ad war escalates next week,
with the Republican National Committee set to concentrate millions
of dollars in just nine states -- mostly in the Midwest but reaching
the nation's coasts, too.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican official Thursday said the party would spend
about $5 million on next week's TV commercials. Democrats, who
track the opposition's ad buying, pegged the figure closer to $7
million.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, that's on top of some $5 million that George W.
Bush's campaign will spend next week.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's Democratic campaign is also spending more than $5
million per week, meaning that with more than two months until the
election, TV viewers in key states could see 20 or 30 campaign ads
in a single week.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the summer, Democrats have outspent Republicans in
the ad war, as Gore tried to catch Bush, who was leading in the
polls. Over two months, the Democratic National Committee spent
some $30 million on pro-Gore, anti-Bush spots.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with Gore even or slightly ahead in national polls, the
DNC is holding its ads back, waiting to see what Republicans put on
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mere fact that the Republican National Committee feels the
need to spend that much money up front says something about how the
dynamics of the campaign have changed,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC ads are set to run in traditional battleground states
along the Great Lakes: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,
plus Arkansas, Delaware and Washington state. Strategists believe
these states will remain hard fought all the way to Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are also headed to Louisiana and Missouri, which the GOP
hopes to lock into Bush's column with an early, aggressive ad buy.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC was debating whether to air a positive spot or one
skewering Gore as a hypocrite, a senior Republican official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There's been an internal discussion for some time over whether
and when the GOP should go negative against Gore and how it should
be done.
</P>
<P>
   That debate was thrust into public view this week after
Republicans abruptly pulled an RNC ad off TV schedules, partly
because it used outdated footage to question Gore's truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The ad included excerpts from an interview in which Gore says he
doesn't think he or President Clinton had ever lied. But the ad
never mentioned that the interview was taped in 1994 and that the
questions concerned Gore calling Oliver North a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Without that context, viewers could have assumed Gore was being
asked about Clinton's statements concerning the president's affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the ad Thursday, Bush told reporters that he saw it
''a couple of days ago'' and didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think it was an appropriate ad. I thought they made
the right decision not to run it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is now on the air in 21 states, and a senior
strategist said he did not expect that list to change next week. In
addition to the nine RNC states, Bush has ads in Florida, Iowa,
Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Georgia, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign is airing a biographical spot through
Wednesday in 17 states. They overlap the Republican targets, except
for Georgia, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Nevada, where there
are no Gore ads.

<HEADLINE> Money Smuggling Enforcement Upped  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bicycle tires, cereal boxes, stereo speakers
and cars are among the places where U.S. Customs officials found
$11.4 million in cash that people tried to smuggle out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The result of a six-week nationwide effort called ''Operation
Powerplay,'' the confiscated cash was part of a crackdown on money
laundering, Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation led to 194 arrests, including people wanted for
armed robbery and drug possession and has given Customs leads to
open 173 investigations.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the cash seized was destined for Mexico,
Israel, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Jamaica,
Customs said.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Powerplay was ''an integral part of our anti-money
laundering strategy,'' Kelly said Thursday. ''We know that
bulk-cash shipments are still the way most drug money leaves the
country,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most money laundering involves illicit profits from drug
trafficking, prostitution or other criminal activities, which are
moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts to make them
appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, criminal groups generate huge sums of cash from
illegal activities but they face difficulty depositing large
amounts into U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, criminals often smuggle cash to foreign locations
where it can be more easily deposited into banks. Then it can be
instantly wired anywhere, Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no limit on the amount of money that a person can
legally transport when entering or leaving the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But federal law requires amounts of more than $10,000 (in cash
or in such things as travelers checks, cashiers checks and
securities that can be easily converted to cash) must be reported
to Customs. Those who don't, can have their currency confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1999, Customs has seized $284 million in
unreported currency that people attempted to smuggled out of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   To detect hidden currency, Customs officers used a variety of
methods, including routine searches, X-ray machines to scan large
pieces of cargo and containers, and specially trained dogs to sniff
out cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''We learned that there is a significant flow of cash going out
of the country through a variety of means,'' Kelly said. ''It was
an intensified effort to examine what is going out of the country.
Our primary focus was on drug-related bulk cash.''
</P>
<P>
   During the operation, Customs officers -- aided by state and
local law enforcement -- stepped up outbound detection efforts
between July 10 and Aug. 19 at airports, seaports, land borders,
mail facilities and courier hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some seizures resulting from the operation:
</P>
<P>
   --$528,908 from packages at FedEx's express courier hub in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   --$231,340 concealed in bicycle tires at Miami International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   --$21,592 concealed within a Honey Nut Cheerios cereal box
located in trunk of a vehicle searched at Hidalgo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   --$504,712 concealed in a secret compartment under the rear seat
of a 1994 Isuzu Trooper.
</P>
<P>
   --$65,221, some hidden on an airline passenger at JFK Airport; 46
pellets (each containing seven $100 bills) was swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   --$83,546 concealed in a stereo speaker of an airline passenger
at Miami International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Parties Continue Quest For Funds  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Democratic and Republican parties are
assembling huge campaign war chests to spend this fall on
advertising and other assistance for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee, which raised $50 million in
unregulated soft money during the first six months of 2000, raised
another $25 million in July and then set a convention fund-raising
record by pulling in $10.1 million at its Philadelphia gala in
early August.
</P>
<P>
   While trailing the RNC, the Democratic National Committee is
putting up some impressive numbers of its own.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Vice President Al Gore helped raise $1.25 million
at two small dinners -- a week after a Barbra Streisand-headlined
concert brought in $5.1 million. Another concert, featuring Jimmy
Buffett, Bette Midler and Crosby, Stills and Nash, is scheduled for
Radio City Music Hall next month. The Democrats are focusing their
efforts on raising smaller donations that fall under federal
limits, meaning that all of the money can be used to directly aid
their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The money the parties raise is in addition to the $67.6 million
in federal funds each of their presidential nominees have received
and the millions of dollars that their congressional candidates are
raking in.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Thursday first spoke to 50 Indian-Americans who had paid
$5,000 apiece and dined on salad and sea bass. Then he joined his
running mate, Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman, for a kosher
dinner with 20 friends and supporters of the lawmaker. Each of the
guests had agreed to raise $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate your help and I appreciate what you said you were
going to do,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Lieberman introduced her husband, who responded with a
kiss. It drew laughs from the audience that recalled Gore's smooch
with wife Tipper at the Democratic convention last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want you to think there is any kind of competition on
this ticket but I'm not going to stop until we reach seven seconds,
which is the current world record,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP fund-raising effort got a boost when Texas Gov. George
W. Bush named former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as his running
mate. Cheney had headed the oil services firm Halliburton Co. for
five years, and energy companies contributed almost $800,000 in
soft money to the Republican National Committee after his
selection, Federal Election Commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   RNC spokesman Bill Pascoe acknowledged that Cheney's selection
helped boost donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is a reflection of very broad and obviously deep
support for the ticket,'' Pascoe said. ''Once the announcement was
made, the floodgates opened.''
</P>
<P>
   While soft money is not subject to federal contribution limits
and cannot be used to directly aid federal candidates, both parties
use the funds to help pay for issue ads designed to help elect
their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the soft money contributions, the Republican National
Committee last month raised $12.4 million under federal
contribution limits. Since Jan. 1, 1999, the RNC has raised almost
$180 million.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Fox Meets Gore in US  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox says the
huge income gap between the United States and Mexico could be
erased through sound economic policies in 10 years, after which
restrictions on cross-border travel could end.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Fox said in an interview Thursday night on
PBS's ''The NewsHour,'' the United States would be within its
rights to keep undocumented aliens off U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   Fox plans to discuss the issue Friday afternoon with Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush in Dallas hours after Bush
delivers a speech on the subject in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The two obviously appear to be approaching the issue from
different perspectives. While Fox wants to open the border, Bush,
who is governor of Texas, says he believes curbs on the entry of
illegal aliens should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to do a better job of enforcing our border,'' Bush
said Thursday, adding that Fox has yet to fully explain his
position.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said in the interview he has no preference between Bush and
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea here is to build up a common future and I think we
can work that future with either one,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who takes office Dec. 1, ending the 71-year rule of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, has been traveling extensively
since winning the presidential election on July 2. He visited a
number of South American countries two weeks ago and came here
Tuesday night after a stop in Canada. He also plans a swing through
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's estimate that it would take just 10 years to eliminate the
income gap between the two nation's is much shorter than what
administration officials had been talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Feurth, national Security adviser to Gore, said the vice
president during a meeting with Fox felt that the Mexican leader's
open border policies could be ''very problematic'' for the United
States. But Feurth said Gore understood that Fox was thinking of a
25- to 30-year time frame, not 10 years, as Fox said Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   National Security adviser Sandy Berger echoed Gore's view in
comments to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's position, Berger said, ''is that as the wage levels in
Mexico rise to a level that is more comparable to the United States
over 20 years or 30 years, it may enable there to be a different
kind of economic integration than exists today.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the United States has an obligation to enforce laws
against illegal immigration, a stand that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright repeated to Fox during a luncheon Thursday.

<HEADLINE> 47 Injured in China Tornado  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A tornado triggered by Typhoon Bilis scythed
through villages in eastern China, wrecking homes and scattering
their contents, overturning cars and injuring 47 people, an
official newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In Fujian, the southeast China province where Bilis made
landfall Wednesday, authorities said early warnings and
preparations for the storm, including sending workers home,
stopping ferry services and ordering boats to port, prevented
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   But in neighboring Zhejiang province, a tornado triggered by
Bilis' approach cut through villages around the city of Yueqing on
Wednesday morning, damaging 612 buildings and destroying more than
50 homes, the Beijing Morning Post said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado overturned cars, dumped debris in a field and sucked
televisions, refrigerators and other belongings out of people's
homes, scattering them outside, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper said 16 people were seriously injured and 31 others
slightly hurt. The tornado caused an estimated $443,000 in damage,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Bilis killed 11 people in Taiwan before sweeping into China.
</P>
<P>
   While authorities in Fujian said there were no casualties, the
storm did wreck more than 1,100 houses in the province, uprooted
thousands of trees, flooded farmland, cut power lines and triggered
a landslide that severed a railway.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, two tornados in Vietnam killed a 5-year-old girl
and injured 77 other people, in the southern province of Tien
Giang, an official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The storms struck Wednesday night and Thursday morning, wrecking
387 houses and damaging 737 others, along with nearly 5,000 acres
of crops, said provincial official Pham Quoc Tri.
</P>
<P>
   The tornados also injured three people and destroyed 28 homes in
Kien Giang and Tra Vinh provinces.

<HEADLINE> Cops Stop Myanmar Leader From Travel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi,
attempting to travel outside the capital for the first time in two
years, was stopped by police on the city's outskirts and had not
returned home by Friday morning, sources close to her said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, along with members of her
National League for Democracy political party, crossed the Yangon
River by ferry and were stopped by police at suburban Dala, said
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who tried to take the ferry across the river to Dala
on Friday morning were told by a plainclothes security official not
to go. Normal commuters were allowed to cross.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi and her party reportedly were planning to travel to
Kungyangon, 30 miles south of Yangon, to work on reorganizing the
National League for Democracy's youth wing.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi opposes the military council which has ruled Myanmar,
also known as Burma, since crushing a pro-democracy uprising she
led in 1988. A year later she was placed under a house arrest,
which lasted until 1995. Since then the military has restricted Suu
Kyi's movements and has refused to enter a dialogue with her.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's group was scheduled to return to Yangon on Thursday
afternoon but had not arrived back by Friday morning, a family
member of the National League for Democracy's vice chairman, Tin
Oo, said in a telephone interview. Tin Oo and members of the youth
wing were with Suu Kyi when she was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   The family sources said the party was stranded in Tin Oo's car
after police aborted their travel plans. Suu Kyi's car and driver
remained parked on the Yangon side of the river at the ferry pier
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was Suu Kyi's first outside Yangon since several failed
attempts in 1998. She was stopped by police four times in July and
August that year as she tried to meet party members in outlying
areas.
</P>
<P>
   On two occasions in 1998, the people she wanted to meet were
brought to her at the place where her car was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   When her car was stopped that August on a trip to the Irrawaddy
Delta town of Pathein, she remained inside her vehicle for nearly
six days in protest. Police finally brought her back to Yangon in
what she described as ''being kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth occasion, Suu Kyi broke a 13-day standoff and
returned home voluntarily on her doctor's advice.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Release Wen Ho Lee on Bail  </HEADLINE>
By SUE MAJOR HOLMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A federal judge has agreed to free a
former Los Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear secrets,
saying the government's case ''no longer has the requisite clarity
and persuasive character necessary'' to keep Wen Ho Lee in jail
pending his trial.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge James Parker's ruling Thursday follows a
hearing last week in which Lee's lawyers cast doubt on the solidity
of the government's case and on the sensitivity of the nuclear
material involved.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous bail requests for Lee since his arrest Dec. 10 had
been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I conclude that there now is a combination of conditions that
will reasonably assure the appearance of Dr. Lee as required and
the safety of the community and the nation,'' said Parker, who had
denied the last bid for bail late in December.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, wasn't immediately released. The judge set a hearing
for Tuesday on the conditions of his release after eight months in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Under the judge's proposal, the Taiwanese-born scientist would
be required to remain at his White Rock home under surveillance at
most times, and all of his telephone calls and mail could be
inspected. He could leave only in the company of at least one of
his lawyers and would be required to report by telephone twice a
day to the federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The only other person who could live there would be his wife,
Sylvia Lee, but his children could come for visits prearranged with
authorities. She could leave the home only after notifying
authorities of where she was going and why and when she planned to
be back and law enforcement agents would be allowed to search her
both before and after her trip.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's bond would be secured by his property and that of friends
and relatives. Some 15 friends and relatives appeared before Parker
last week to offer their property to allow Lee to be freed on bail.
Their property, combined with Lee's, is worth about $2.2 million,
defense attorneys said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney's office and Justice Department said they were
reviewing Parker's order and would respond in court.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Hwang, managing attorney for the Asian Law Caucus, said:
''The conditions, while restrictive, are livable restrictions.''
Parker this week granted friend-of-the-court status to the caucus
and the American Civil Liberties Union to file briefs in support of
disclosing any evidence that Lee was singled out for prosecution
because of ethnic bias.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who was fired from Los Alamos National Laboratory last
year, is charged with 59 counts alleging he transferred restricted
data to unsecure computers and tape. Some of the tapes are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Parker heard three days of arguments last week about Lee's
release.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers argued that he was singled out because he is
Asian, and they got an FBI agent whose testimony was key to denying
the scientist bail to acknowledge that he had given inaccurate
testimony against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Chief prosecutor George Stamboulidis argued that Lee could help
someone build a bomb or help a country bolster its nuclear program
if he is released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ''The breadth of the potential harm is so great that ... even a
reduced risk is too great to take that gamble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, defense attorney Holscher told Parker there is no
evidence Lee ''has the political motivation, the financial
motivation or the destructive intent'' to do anything harmful with
the material he is accused of downloading.

<HEADLINE> Transit Worker Impersonator Caught  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Darius McCollum's handled an assortment of jobs
for the city's transit agency: toll taker, bus driver, subway
motorman, transit supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one problem -- McCollum doesn't work for New York
City Transit. Never has. Not for one minute, one hour, one day.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped him from becoming the transit agency's great
pretender, a career that began when he commandeered a subway train
at age 15. But after double-digit arrests stemming from his various
impersonations of transit workers, McCollum has reached a
crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Queens man is behind bars, awaiting trial on
various charges, including criminal impersonation. His parents are
desperate to help their obsessive son. And his lawyer is ready to
plead that McCollum is insane, unaccountable for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not insane,'' he said in a jailhouse interview with The
New York Times. ''I am just your average guy who doesn't mind
helping out.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities question his definition of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The latest allegation against McCollum: He pulled a subway
emergency brake during rush hour, then appeared -- in regulation
blue uniform -- as a transit supervisor coming to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the Feb. 21 incident in Manhattan, but
McCollum was arrested on numerous charges that included criminal
impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks earlier, he allegedly took a joy ride in another NYCT
vehicle. He's been arrested 17 times in 15 years, according to city
corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the transit system, McCollum's record is perfect. He
doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, doesn't gamble. He was engaged to be
married, but his love for the transit system trumped his nuptials --
the wedding was put off pending resolution of his case.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Tracey Bloodsaw, says McCollum needs psychiatric
aid. McCollum lives in a ''fake world'' where the repercussions of
his acts are never even considered, according to Bloodsaw.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, McCollum has gone repeatedly through the legal
system, doing five years total time but always returning to the
streets and the subways.
</P>
<P>
   His illegal transit debut came in 1981, when a 15-year-old
McCollum made headlines by taking the controls of a subway and
piloting it downtown to the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   He became a mini-celebrity, with the incident dismissed as a
teen-age prank. It was instead a harbinger of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, McCollum was arrested after he flashed a stolen badge
to sign out a NYCT truck and take it on a joy ride. Authorities
said he did this four straight nights before being busted by an
NYCT worker who recognized him from a previous incident.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he returned the truck the next morning at the end of
his shift. According to authorities, the worst damage caused by
McCollum was a flat on one tire.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns of Bowel Treatment Effects  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A popular new treatment for irritable bowel
syndrome could cause severe intestinal side effects -- some
requiring surgery -- that have already affected at least 19 women.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday it had
ordered Glaxo Wellcome Inc. to attach to every bottle of Lotronex a
plain-English pamphlet explaining the risk, and that women should
stop taking it at the earliest sign of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Women have reported either a potentially life-threatening
intestinal inflammation called ischemic colitis or severe
constipation, and the FDA has preliminary reports of another 14
cases since Lotronex hit the market six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some cases apparently were caused by doctors giving Lotronex to
women who shouldn't have taken it, sparking the FDA to order the
unprecedented straight-to-the-patient warning brochures called
''MedGuides.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA, shaken by a recent spate of drugs that had to be
banned, is hunting new ways to swiftly counter side effects of
newly approved prescription drugs. Lotronex will test whether the
MedGuides help.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer advocacy group, however, called the move
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do think this drug should come off the market, and will
file a petition to get it off,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the group
Public Citizen, who said he fears a woman eventually will die of
the side effects. ''The risks clearly outweigh the benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA counters that if patients learn the early signs of a
side effect, they can stop taking Lotronex before they have
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''This drug works in some people and it doesn't work in
others,'' said Dr. Victor Raczkowski, FDA's deputy chief of
gastrointestinal drugs. The new warning should ensure that ''the
patients most likely to benefit from the drug and least likely to
have serious side effects take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo also is mailing a warning to thousands of doctors this
week to help reduce the number of prescriptions physicians are
improperly writing for women who shouldn't use the drug, said vice
president James Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Lotronex is the first new therapy in decades for irritable bowel
syndrome, a mysterious disorder that affects up to 15 percent of
Americans, mostly women. IBS involves chronic or recurrent
abdominal pain, the sudden and urgent need to go to the bathroom
and either frequent diarrhea or constipation or both.
</P>
<P>
   Lotronex offers modest relief to women whose main IBS problem is
diarrhea. It doesn't work for men.
</P>
<P>
   About one of every 700 Lotronex users will develop ischemic
colitis, says the new MedGuide. Also, the drug can cause
constipation so severe that patients need hospitalization, even
surgery, to unblock their intestines. In the worst case, one
patient needed her colon removed.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's top warnings:
</P>
<P>
   --Do not ever take Lotronex if you are constipated most of the
time or ever have had severe constipation. If you have severe or
worsening constipation while taking Lotronex, stop using it
immediately and call your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   --Stop using Lotronex and call your doctor immediately if you
have new or worsening pain in the lower abdomen, bloody diarrhea or
blood in the stool. These are early symptoms of ischemic colitis.
</P>
<P>
   --Because Lotronex does not cure IBS or work for everyone, quit
using it if your symptoms do not improve within four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   --Do not take Lotronex if you have ever had ischemic colitis or
such other intestinal disorders as Crohn's disease, ulcerative
colitis or active diverticulitis.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Columbine Principal Remembers Gunmen  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- Eric Harris wasn't a problem student, so
Principal Frank DeAngelis never met him.
</P>
<P>
   But when he finally did, it was unforgettable: Harris was
blasting windows with a gun in a hallway of Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have flashbacks every time I walk down that corridor,''
DeAngelis on Thursday told a state commission studying the April
20, 1999, massacre. ''I thought I was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   In all 12 students and one teacher were killed when Harris and
Dylan Klebold opened fire. The teen-age gunmen later committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis told the Governor's Columbine Review Commission he had
met Klebold when the teen-ager was helping out with lighting for a
school play. The pair did well in class, participated in some
extracurricular activities and stayed out of trouble at school,
DeAngelis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids were not an attendance problem. They had good
grades, they integrated nicely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about ''red flags'' -- including essays and video
depicting violence -- that may have signaled the teens' intent,
DeAngelis said he had ''the utmost confidence'' that authorities
had no prior knowledge of a planned attack.
</P>
<P>
   DeAngelis gave a riveting account of the day's events, beginning
with an audiotape of the fire alarm, which rang for 4&AMP;frac12; hours during
the shootings and rescue.
</P>
<P>
   After being alerted about the attack, DeAngelis said he walked
into a hallway and headed toward the library, where he encountered
a student shooting at windows. He was wearing a white T-shirt and
black vest with a baseball cap turned backward. DeAngelis said he
later learned the gunman was Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The principal is one of several members of the Jefferson County
School District and law enforcement agencies who have been sued by
the families of slain and injured students.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' relatives allege authorities should have heeded
warning signs that the two students were going to take action and
that the rescue was mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff John Stone and members of SWAT teams involved in the
incident have refused to testify before the commission because of
the lawsuits.

<HEADLINE> Mont. Bitterroot Valley Fire Grows  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- High wind fanned wildfires in the
Bitterroot Valley on Thursday as crews braced for a weekend of
gusty wind and dry lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by 30- to 50-mph wind, a fire in Montana's Bitterroot
Valley jumped a road Thursday, and crews were trying to locate the
fire's leading edge. A day earlier, wind swept the blaze into new
territory and authorities issued a mandatory evacuation order for
about 20 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The fire ignited baled hay, but there was no confirmed loss of
homes.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was part of the 54,700-acre Skalkaho Complex, which is
among 25 major fires burning 591,851 acres in Montana. The fire
season in the state has been intense for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   Fires this year have burned 5.7 million acres across the
country, and the National Interagency Fire Center said 78 major
fires are burning on 1.4 million acres. The fire season already is
the worst in at least a half-century, and the outlook remained
bleak.
</P>
<P>
   The center said dry lightning storms were expected throughout
Idaho, Montana and Washington, increasing the chances of new fires.
For the weekend, the forest in western Montana is for winds up to
40 mph, plus lightning.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a lightning-sparked brush fire grew to 35,000
acres Thursday and threatened 50 rural homes outside the town of
Mabton. About 150 Yakima County residents were evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze had destroyed 10 outbuildings by Thursday night, said
Penelope Christopherson of the State Emergency Operations Center.
The fire was ignited Wednesday night in a remote area of the Yakama
Indian Reservation and spread by high wind. All but about 3,000
acres of the charred land was on the reservation, Christopherson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wind and temperature shifts cloaked Helena, Mont., in heavy
smoke Thursday. A harried dispatcher at the Helena fire dispatch
center interrupted a reporter's question: ''It's just smoke,
honey,'' she said. ''We're all gonna have to live with it. There's
no big blowup.''
</P>
<P>
   Morning temperatures have cooled across the Northwest and there
are other signs that fall is drawing near, but the NIFC said the
end of summer does not signal an end to the fires.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just don't see a real end in sight,'' said E.Lynn Burkett,
spokeswoman for the interagency center in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time of year, what usually happens is we get monsoon
weather in the Southern states and it moves north,'' bringing rain,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't happening.
</P>
<P>
   Given Montana's extraordinary dryness and the high risk more
fires will ignite, Gov. Marc Racicot this week doubled the amount
of public land closed to recreation and other uses. An area roughly
the size of Maine now has been declared off-limits, effective
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With the closed areas too vast to patrol and post with signs,
and with the land agencies' personnel already spread thin for fire
work, the managers are hoping for voluntary compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some barricades up, and we have some postings at
Forest Service facilities,'' said Ed Nesselroad, Forest Service
spokesman at the agency's regional headquarters in Missoula.
''We're relying on the cooperative spirit of the public to make it
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service manages most of the closed public land.
Closure orders also cover an undetermined amount of private land.
</P>
<P>
   At Glacier National Park, officials tried to get out word that
it, at least, remains open. Tourism is down, apparently because of
the fires, spokeswoman Amy Vanderbilt said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in northwestern Montana, concern about new fires was
enough to make Big Mountain resort near Whitefish cancel its season
finale rock concert. The resort said the 2,000 fans expected for a
performance by Blue Oyster Cult could present a potential fire
danger.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Rebel Leader Denounces Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Treason charges against coup leader George
Speight should be dropped because a deal with Fiji's military
promised him immunity from prosecution, his lawyers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At a brief hearing, defense lawyers asked Chief Magistrate
Sailesi Temo to throw out treason charges against Speight, who
faces a sentence of death if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Speight, a failed businessman, led an armed group into Fiji's
Parliament on May 19, taking dozens of lawmakers hostage. He
claimed to be acting on behalf of indigenous Fijians and demanded
they be given political supremacy over the ethnic Indian community,
which makes up 44 percent of Fiji's 814,000 population.
</P>
<P>
   The two-month standoff ended when Speight agreed to release the
last of his hostages. The military, which imposed martial law after
the coup, scrapped the constitution, agreed to depose prime
minister Mahendra Chaudhry's government and installed a new
government stacked with nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the military promised Speight and his key
supporters immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But Speight was arrested July 26 amid a military crackdown that
also netted more than 350 coup supporters. While most supporters
were charged with unlawful assembly and released, Speight and his
key advisers were charged with treason and other serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue the charges are valid because Speight breached
the deal when he failed to surrender all weapons used in the coup,
and because the deal was struck under duress.
</P>
<P>
   Temo said Friday he would consider submissions from both sides
before deciding whether to throw out the treason charge. He
remanded Speight and his advisers to the prison island where they
are being held. The next hearing was scheduled for Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The government said Friday that the Great Council of Chiefs --
the supreme body representing indigenous Fijians -- would select
three members for a commission to rewrite the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Two other members of the commission would be ethnic Indians, one
would represent Fiji's other ethnic communities and the other, a
lawyer, would be chairman, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, the first ethnic Indian to lead Fiji, has been on an
international tour to generate pressure on the new government to
restore democracy. Australia has also urged officials in the acting
government to hold elections soon.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, a former banking executive who
was named to head the interim government, has rejected calls for
the restoration of the multiracial constitution. He has promised to
call elections within three years, after the constitution is
rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Fiji, a nation of 320 islands, lies about 2,250 miles northeast
of Sydney, Australia.

<HEADLINE> Olympian Vin Baker Stuck in Seattle  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- U.S. Olympic basketball players spent their
first day as a team gathering gear and gossiping. No one had his
ear to his cell phone as often as Vin Baker, who learned that his
proposed trade to New York is officially dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a difficult four or five days, and it's a situation
where we have to look at how everything shook out and see what will
be best for me,'' said Baker, who came close to going to New York
in a four-team trade involving Patrick Ewing, Glen Rice, Christian
Laettner and others.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics general manager Wally Walker said the megadeal involving
Seattle, New York, the Los Angeles Lakers and Detroit was beyond
salvaging.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks general manager Scott Layden said he would continue to
search for a deal amicable to both Ewing and the Knicks, although
he said it was more likely than not that Ewing will be a member of
the team when training camp opens Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for both the Sonics and the Knicks to tally their
losses and try to move on, their relationships with their star
players now frayed. Baker, not fond of coach Paul Westphal, is
eager to get out of Seattle and play near his home state of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, who has not made any recent public comments, apparently
wants out of New York so badly that he was willing to accept a
trade to a city, Seattle, that lies a continent away from the two
places where he would prefer to play, Washington or Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing retains his no-trade clause and can veto any trade not to
his liking.
</P>
<P>
   While Gary Payton, Baker's Olympic and Seattle teammate, was
unhappy he was left out of the loop on what he thought was a bad
trade, the big winner of the day among the Olympians was their head
coach, Rudy Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich was elated to hear that the Ewing-to-Seattle deal
was officially off because Seattle's planned signing of free agent
Maurice Taylor collapsed along with it. Houston wants to sign
Taylor to a one-year contract for $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   More fallout from the failed four-team deal:
</P>
<P>
   -- Detroit looked set to trade Laettner to Dallas for a package
of Cedric Ceballos, Eric Murdock and John Wallace. Presumably,
Mavericks owner Mark Cuban would throw in $3 million of his
Internet fortune.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rice, who also lost out on a coveted chance to play in New
York, was running out of options. According to a league source
close to the Bulls, it would not be inconceivable for Rice to sign
a one-year deal to play for Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   -- Taylor, whose signing with the Rockets could be announced as
early as Friday, has emerged as the biggest financial loser of this
summer's free-agent class. Expecting to get a maximum level
contract worth upward of $70 million, Taylor has no guarantee from
the Rockets that he'll get anything near that. The Rockets will,
however, have salary cap space next summer when Hakeem Olajuwon's
contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   -- Agent David Falk had a terrible week. Nothing turned out the
way Falk wanted after he worked behind the scenes to take care of
clients Ewing, Rice and Taylor. None got what they wanted, and all
will likely end up making tens of millions of dollars less than
they expected.
</P>
<P>
   All that gossip was welcome conversation fodder for the Olympic
team, which spent several hours going through USOC processing at a
naval base. They fly to Hawaii on Friday and open training camp
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before having their team photo taken, the players pushed big,
orange Home Depot shopping carts around a room to load up on warmup
suits, team hats, shoes, sandals and leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't hurt anybody, Kevin,'' Garnett said to himself as he
playfully screeched his cart around at two or three times its
intended speed.
</P>
<P>
   Several players were intrigued to hear how Layden and Walker
explained the big trade falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll only do what's right for everyone concerned,'' Layden
said. ''If there is a chance for Patrick to get a fresh start and
for the Knicks to improve as a team, we'll make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be with Seattle, that much is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics general manager Wally Walker flew to Washington last week
to have dinner with Ewing and Falk, and it was at that meeting that
Ewing became sold on the idea of joining the Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, scuttled Monday by the Pistons, Ewing would have
gone to Seattle; Baker, Rice and Travis Knight to New York;
Laettner and Chris Dudley to the Lakers and seven marginal players,
plus two draft picks and $3 million in cash, to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Several days of subsequent talks failed to revive the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Layden, departing from his usual practice of refusing to comment
on trades, said Ewing and Falk had never discussed a contract
extension with him and had never demanded a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Layden also said he expects the Knicks to be a contender in the
East even if they are unable to find another trade involving Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever awkward feelings there may be, I expect he will come
back and have a strong season for the Knicks. And when he comes
through the tunnel at Madison Square Garden for the first time,
there's going to be a standing ovation,'' Layden said.

<HEADLINE> Madonna Fights For Internet Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Madonna is fighting for the Internet domain name
madonna.com.
</P>
<P>
   The singer has lodged a complaint with the United Nations,
asking its World Intellectual Property Organization to order the
handover of the site, owned by New Jersey entrepreneur Dan Parisi.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can register a domain name for a few dollars, which has
led cybersquatters to file for famous names in order to make a fast
buck -- in some cases millions.
</P>
<P>
   The WIPO system allows those who think they have the right to a
domain to get it back without having to fight a costly legal
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Parisi previously used the Web site for pornographic material
but has now removed it. He claims Madonna, whose full name is
Madonna Ciccone, has no more right to the domain name than anyone
else with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe that because Ms. Ciccone named her act after
the Virgin Mary that gives her the right to stop any other party
from using the word 'madonna' as a title of their Web site,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said she thought the singer
should fight for the domain name.
</P>
<P>
   ''She happens to be the most famous Madonna in the world, so I
think she certainly has every right to try to protect a Web site
called Madonna,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The WIPO arbitrator is due to rule on the dispute in
mid-September.

   BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Peter Fonda and Kris Kristofferson have
agreed to appear in a movie that begins filming in North Dakota's
western Badlands next month.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda said he was attracted by the screenplay's
''extraordinarily well-crafted'' characters. He will play a western
North Dakota sheep rancher and Kristofferson his curmudgeonly
friend. The film, ''Wooly Boys,'' focuses on the Fonda character's
relationship with his grandson.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get a part like that only a few times in your career, and
I have to jump at that one,'' he said. ''All of the parts are just
fabulous.''
</P>

   Gov. Ed Schafer said Thursday that ''Wooly Boys'' will be the
first major movie to filmed mostly in North Dakota.

<HEADLINE> Gleason Statue Planned in NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A larger-than-life statue of Jackie Gleason will
grace the front of the city's Port Authority bus terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're always looking for ways to bring TV icons back to the
public,'' Rob Pellizzi, TV Land marketing vice president, told the
New York Post in Thursday's editions. ''This was really a great
honor to literally put Ralph Kramden on a pedestal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gleason played Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden in ''The
Honeymooners.''
</P>
<P>
   TV Land, the cable channel which airs the ''The Honeymooners,''
commissioned the 8-foot-high, 1,000-pound sculpture which depicts
Gleason in a bus driver's uniform and holding a lunchbox.
</P>
<P>
   The statue is scheduled to be officially unveiled on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gleason rocketed to fame in the early 1950s when he introduced
''The Honeymooners,'' which featured the unsuccessful
get-rich-quick schemes of Kramden and life with his wife Alice,
played by Audrey Meadows.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Ballet Angers Strikers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Ballet plans to hire musicians from
the Czech Republic to fill in for striking orchestra members,
prompting protests from the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like hiring migrant workers to come in and pick your
cotton for a day,'' said Andrew Cos, secretary treasurer of the
Atlanta Federation of Musicians, Local 148-462. ''It's a plantation
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballet says it has signed a contract with Prague-based
Poksound to replace the orchestra temporarily but that it wants to
continue negotiating with the musicians, who went on strike almost
a year ago in a dispute over a pension package.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for Poksound to provide the music for the
season-opening ''Romeo and Juliet'' in October and for the annual
holiday ''The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Orchestra members said they will continue to picket. And the
folk duo the Indigo Girls, who are from suburban Atlanta, said
they're pulling out of a proposed March collaboration with the
71-year-old ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a slap in the face that they would try to go out
of the country and give our jobs away,'' said Julie Buenrostro, the
ballet orchestra's principal horn player.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet company said it was not replacing the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went ahead and made those arrangements because, obviously,
we haven't gotten an agreement and we have performances coming
up,'' said Jacqueline Kalk, an attorney representing the ballet in
the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   For ''The Nutcracker'' last year, the ballet used a replacement
orchestra made up mostly of musicians from a nonunion symphony in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The contract with Poksound is to provide 44 musicians for
''Romeo and Juliet'' and 25 for ''The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballet, which normally employs a 48-member orchestra, says
it cannot afford to pay into the musicians' pension plan. The
company does not contribute to the dancers' pension fund, either.

<HEADLINE> Army Private Charged in Kosovo Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Army soldier on peacekeeping duty in
Kosovo has been charged with negligent homicide and dereliction of
duty in the killing last month of a 6-year-old Albanian boy, U.S.
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were against Pfc. Nicholas E. Young, whose M249
squad automatic weapon discharged outside the Gornja Slatina
School, striking Gentrit Rexhepi in his upper chest and left arm.
The boy died of his injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Young is assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery
Regiment of the 1st Armored Division.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence that the charges against Young carry is 3&AMP;frac12;
years in confinement, dishonorable discharge, reduction in rank to
private and forfeiture of all pay and allowances.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred July 10 as Young and other soldiers
assigned to the NATO-led Kosovo Force were helping to prepare the
Gornja Slatina School's outer grounds for the coming academic year,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the investigation of the incident will not be
released until after the legal proceedings against Young are
completed, U.S. Army Europe officials said in a brief written
statement made available at the Pentagon.

was down 1.89 at 1,506.42.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Friday's mild declines were reflective of a number
of cross currents now at work on Wall Street. But on the whole, the
markets are in something of a holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Volume is very low. It seems the markets have reached an
equilibrium and there's just not a lot going on,'' said Ricky
Harrington, technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   No single piece of economic data or news was driving Friday's
market, Harrington added.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, investors sold stocks to capture recent profits.
Technology stocks took the brunt. A selloff in semi-conductor
stocks helped pull down the Dow. Micron Technology fell $3.313 to
$89.25, and Advanced Micro Devices was down 56.20 cents at $34.188.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, Qualcomm was down $1.50 at $59.125, and Dell
Computer was down 50 cents at $38.50.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been climbing slowly but steadily for weeks as it
became apparent to investors that the Federal Reserve Board had
concluded its strategy of raising interest rates to slow the
economy and stem inflation was working. On Tuesday, the Fed came
though, making no change in its rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed Thursday up 38.09 at 11,182.74, the highest close
since it reached 11,287.08 on April 11. And the Nasdaq is at its
highest level in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerns remain, however, such as high energy prices and
tight labor markets, both of which could contribute to a rise in
inflation. In addition, several sectors have warned that profits
may be down in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   These factors could pose obstacles as the markets try to reclaim
their highs of early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 223.62 million,
down from Thursday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small companies was down 0.80 to
522.50.

<HEADLINE> China Workers Take Managers Hostage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Disgruntled workers at a joint U.S.-Chinese
packaging company held a group of foreign managers hostage for more
than a day in a feud over job cuts, the company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Up to seven foreign managers were held at the factory, located
in the northern port city of Tianjin, on Wednesday morning and
released Thursday night, said a spokeswoman for MCP Industries
Ltd., a joint venture between Ball Asia Pacific Ltd. and a Chinese
partner identified only as Wanhua.
</P>
<P>
   Parent company Ball Corp. is located in Bloomfield, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman said she did not know the exact number of
hostages taken or their nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture was to be dissolved after the Chinese side
decided to withdraw their investment and Ball wanted to move
production to another facility and lay off some workers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials are investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Ball Asia Pacific Ltd. operates 16 joint ventures, including
three in Tianjin, and with its partners is the leading maker of
beverage containers in China, according to the company's Web site.

<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A police officer nearing retirement
died of a stroke while trying to trim his bulging stomach to meet a
waistline limit, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Miralpes, 55, collapsed Thursday during a jog of just
under a mile intended to shape up 70 officers whose stomachs
exceeded 34 inches, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Miralpes is the second police officer to die in exercise
programs that began in March, when National Police Chief Panfilo
Lacson ordered the country's 117,000 police to reduce their girth
to no more than 34 inches within six months or face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Miralpes, who planned to retire in October, was recently demoted
from his post as traffic chief at the police station in Daraga in
Bicol province because of his protruding waist, said Ely Brown,
superintendent of police personnel.
</P>
<P>
   If his waist had passed muster, Miralpes would have been able to
regain his position and retire at a higher level. His waist size
was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Medical officers had advised Miralpes against strenuous exercise
because of his high blood pressure, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Large stomachs have long been a symbol of the country's
notoriously corrupt police force.

<HEADLINE> Germans Find Iraqi Missile Factory  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Germany's intelligence agency Friday
confirmed a report that it had discovered the location of a secret
Iraqi missile factory near Baghdad, supporting allegations that
Saddam Hussein has continued to build up his arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 technicians are working on short-range missiles at the
Al Mamoun Factory, said a spokeswoman from the German
Bundesnachrichtendienst.
</P>
<P>
   The report in the Bild newspaper said the complex, which has
many buildings, is located 25 miles southwest of Baghdad, and gave
the precise latitude and longitude.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ARABIL-100 missiles have a range of less than 93
miles, the production shows ''the Iraqi will and personnel for
missile development exists as before,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   There is also proof Iraqis have studied making missiles that
could reach 1,865 miles -- far enough to strike central Europe, the
agency said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Woman Has Forced Abortion  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Family planning officials in central China
induced abortion upon a woman who violated birth control policies
by getting pregnant with her fourth child, a local government
spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name was not disclosed, was taken to a
birth-control clinic in the village of Caidian near the central
city of Wuhan where the fetus was aborted, said an official for the
village government, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The baby was the couple's fourth child. They broke the
regulations of China's family planning policy,'' said the official.
</P>
<P>
   But the official denied a story in The Times of London that
claimed the woman's baby had survived an earlier attempt to induce
an abortion and had been born healthy. The Times report claimed
family planning officials seized the newborn, kicking it and then
drowning it in a flooded rice paddy in front of the parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''The baby came out dead. It's a dead infant. The officials
never kicked the baby as reported,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, China has limited urban couples to one child,
while rural families, in deference to traditional preferences for
boys, may have two children if the first is a girl.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has led to forced abortions, exorbitant fines and
punishments to enforce government-set birth limits -- although
Chinese officials insist that abuses are rare.
</P>
<P>
   A brochure on family planning issued by the State Council,
China's Cabinet, says the Chinese government is ''against promoting
induced abortion as a means of family planning.'' It claims the
numbers of induced abortions are on the decline in many areas, and
that, when required, they are performed under safe conditions.

<HEADLINE> Musicians Protest Atlanta Ballet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Ballet plans to hire musicians from
the Czech Republic to fill in for striking orchestra members,
prompting protests from the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like hiring migrant workers to come in and pick your
cotton for a day,'' said Andrew Cox, secretary treasurer of the
Atlanta Federation of Musicians, Local 148-462. ''It's a plantation
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballet says it has signed a contract with Prague-based
Poksound to replace the orchestra temporarily but wants to continue
negotiating with the musicians, who went on strike almost a year
ago in a dispute over a pension package.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for Poksound to provide the music for the
season-opening ''Romeo and Juliet'' in October and for the annual
holiday ''The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   Orchestra members said they will continue to picket. And the
folk duo the Indigo Girls, who are from suburban Atlanta, said
they're pulling out of a proposed March collaboration with the
71-year-old ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a slap in the face that they would try to go out
of the country and give our jobs away,'' said Julie Buenrostro, the
ballet orchestra's principal horn player.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet company said it was not replacing the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went ahead and made those arrangements because, obviously,
we haven't gotten an agreement and we have performances coming
up,'' said Jacqueline Kalk, an attorney representing the ballet in
the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   For ''The Nutcracker'' last year, the ballet used a replacement
orchestra made up mostly of musicians from a nonunion symphony in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The contract with Poksound is to provide 44 musicians for
''Romeo and Juliet'' and 25 for ''The Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballet, which normally employs a 48-member orchestra, says
it cannot afford to pay into the musicians' pension plan. The
company does not contribute to the dancers' pension fund, either.

<HEADLINE> China Releases Detained American  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese authorities have released an American
detained in a crackdown on an underground Christian church, but are
still holding two other Americans along with 127 Chinese members of
the church, a human rights group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Chu was released from the detention center in Xihua
county, in central China's Henan province, Friday morning, said the
Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities denied Chu's request that his wife, Sandee
Lin, also an American, be released as well, the center said. A
third American, Patricia Lan, remained in custody. The center has
said the three are missionaries from California, but has not given
their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   They were among scores of people the center said were rounded up
in a raid Wednesday on followers of the Fangcheng church, a
Protestant group Chinese authorities view as an illegal cult.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing dispatched a diplomat to the remote
area, but the diplomat has yet to phone in a report, an embassy
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the embassy said that if Americans had been
detained, it would insist on meeting them. Under a U.S.-China
agreement, Chinese authorities are obliged to allow access to
detained Americans within four days.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
described reports of the arrests as ''deeply disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Xihua county did not answer telephone calls Friday and
government religious affairs officials said they had not heard of
the Fangcheng church or of any arrests of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Information Center said police have moved 10 of the detained
Chinese from a detention center to a prison, indicating they could
be formally arrested. One, Yao Xue, has been badly beaten by
police, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangcheng church is one of scores of clandestine Christian
communities that operate out of private homes in defiance of
government restrictions on worship. China's officially atheist,
communist government forbids organized religious activities outside
state-sanctioned churches.
</P>
<P>
   Fangcheng's founder, Zhang Rongliang, was reportedly sentenced
to two years in a labor camp last December on charges of leading a
cult. Members of the group have reportedly been arrested before in
large-scale raids.

<HEADLINE> Barak Promises To Protect Mosques  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Making a case for Israeli sovereignty over all
holy shrines in Jerusalem, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Friday
that under Israeli rule no harm would ever come to the two major
mosques in the disputed city.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians dismissed Barak's assurances and said they
would not sign a peace treaty without being granted sovereignty
over east Jerusalem, which includes the walled Old City, home to
major holy sites of Islam, Christianity and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides repeated stated positions, there were hints of
a willingness to consider compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's top negotiator, acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami,
has placed the importance of the Old City to Muslims on equal
footing with its holiness to Jews, and Palestinian negotiator
Mohammed Dahlan has suggested sovereignty was negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was to meet Saturday in
Alexandria with Egyptian leaders, who have been trying to resolve
the sovereignty dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The most intractable argument is over the Temple Mount, known to
Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary. The raised platform
is home to the Al Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine, and
the Dome of the Rock mosque. Abutting the compound is the Western
Wall, the last remnant of the Jewish Temple destroyed by the Romans
in A.D. 70.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mideast peace summit in July, Barak offered the
Palestinians religious sovereignty on Haram as-Sharif, but insisted
on overall Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorbjorn Jagland
on Friday, Barak explained that neither he nor any other Israeli
prime minister would ever relinquish sovereignty over the Temple
Mount, which he said was at the ''heart of the Jewish experience
throughout the ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said there was no truth to charges by Arafat that Israel
wants sovereignty over the Temple Mount in order to excavate
beneath the mosques and unearth the ruins of the Jewish Temples.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are barred, for religious reasons, from conducting
excavations on the Temple Mount,'' Barak told Jagland. Israel wants
an arrangement that would ban all archaeological excavations there,
a statement by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's top adviser dismissed Barak's assurances. ''Without
full Palestinian sovereignty over all religious sites, Muslim and
Christian, there won't be an agreement, there won't be peace,''
said the aide, Nabil Aburdeneh.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, leaders of the Islamic militant
group Hamas warned Palestinian negotiators against making
concessions on Jerusalem, and they renewed threats of violence
against Israel. Hamas has carried out suicide bombings in Israel,
killing scores of people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israeli leaders ... want to demolish the Al Aqsa mosque,'' the
Hamas leader in Nablus, Sheik Hamed Bitawi, told a rally of 3,000
supporters. ''If anyone from Israel carries out a crime against Al
Aqsa ... there will be military attacks, and we will burn Israel.''

<HEADLINE> Man stopped in New York suspected of burying a body in Tennessee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW CASTLE, N.Y. (AP) - A man who reportedly has admitted
killing his wife in Minnesota and burying her body on a remote
tract of land in Tennessee, purchased through the Internet, is
being held here while officials in three states investigate his
story.
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre tale emerged after New Castle police ordered Jeffrey
Lewis Thompson, 38, to pull over after they spotted him driving
without a seatbelt and discovered he was driving with phony
identification.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester District Attorney's office said that Thompson,
who gave his hometown as Scio, Ore., southeast of Salem, had an
international license issued under the name Mark Miller of Idaho.
He was found to have been in trouble with the law in three states.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal News, a Westchester daily newspaper, reported Friday
that Thompson told authorities he had strangled his wife, Ruma
Hamid, 26, at a campsite in Jordan, Minn., in May. He then drove to
Bledsoe County, Tenn., north of Chattanooga, where he buried her
body in a tract of land he had purchased over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Corbalis, a spokeswoman for Westchester County
District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, said she could not confirm that
Thompson had confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   She said only that ''after further questioning by New Castle
detectives an investigation ensued involving authorities in
Minnesota and Tennessee and a woman's remains were uncovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe County Sheriff Bob Swafford said after they were given
the information from Thompson, authorities got a court order to
exhume the body and found it under two feet of dirt and decking
material.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Thompson) described it to a T, within a couple feet of where
we found the body,'' Swafford said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tennessee authorities were trying to positively identify
the woman. After that is determined, he said authorities would
decide what charges, if any, could be pursued against Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has been convicted of rape in Oregon, custodial
interference in California and fraud in Florida, Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Thompson spent six months in a California jail after
the April 1999 abduction of three children he had with an Oregon
woman. The children were found unharmed in a national park in
Florida. Thompson was arrested in nearby Altamont Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He came to New Castle after befriending a couple he met during a
recent Montana canoe trip, Corbalis said. The couple, potential
witnesses, was not identified. He reportedly told the couple his
wife had died of brain cancer; he had with him a 14-month-old boy
he said was their son.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson reportedly met Hamid in Bangladesh and married her
while estranged from the woman in Oregon. Corbalis said it was
unclear if he was married to the mother of the three children.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was being held without bail at the Westchester County
jail on charges of criminal possession of a weapon, a switchblade;
criminal impersonation for driving with a false license; and
endangering the welfare of a child, the 14-month-old. The boy has
been placed in foster care, Corbalis said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not yet clear whether Thompson's extradition would be
sought in Minnesota or Tennessee. He had not been charged with any
crime in connection with the woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is in the throes of investigating his identity and
history,'' Corbalis said. ''As soon as we put the case together
we'll go forward from there.''

<P>
   They object to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dumping up to
750,000 tons of muck in the ocean six miles off Sandy Hook at a
spot formerly called the Mud Dump Site. The sludge is being dredged
from the New York-New Jersey Harbor to keep shipping channels and
private berths open for navigation.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists claim the material is laced with PCBs and
other toxins. The Army Corps and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency say it is clean.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., wrote a letter to President
Clinton this week asking him to intervene. Torricelli wants the
president to issue an executive order to force the EPA to implement
new standards for evaluating the material and to temporarily
suspend dumping until the sludge can be analyzed under the new
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are significant environmental and scientific concerns
regarding the safety of this dredged material,'' Torricelli wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters plan to march up the coast, finishing in Sandy
Hook on Friday, the third anniversary of the date an agreement was
reached to stop dumping at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-square-mile Mud Dump Site was closed on Sept. 1, 1997, and
a 15-square-mile area around it was designated a remediation site.
Only uncontaminated material was to be placed there as a cap over
the polluted area.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the EPA and the Army Corps have been approving
permits for material to be put at the remediation site.
</P>
<P>
   Clean Ocean Action, a Sandy Hook-based coalition that opposes
ocean dumping, says the government's system to determine if the
material is contaminated is flawed and that the material being
dumped there now is contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Milligan, the group's staff scientist, said clean
material was placed at the site until about a year ago, when ''very
contaminated sediment was basically OKd by the EPA and the Army
Corps as 'clean.'''
</P>
<P>
   She said some of the material intended to clean up the site
actually is more contaminated than the toxic sludge dumped there
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency was supposed to issue new
standards three years ago, but has not done so.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result,'' Torricelli wrote, ''this material was approved
for disposal without being subject to updated evaluation
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Mary Mears said the
sludge that is being dumped meets current standards, and ''should
not cause any kind of harm to marine life or human health,'' but
the agency is reviewing the method it uses to determine what is
suitable to be placed at the remediation site.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the numbers we're using could change, but for the most
part the guidelines we're using are pretty reliable,'' she said.
''We need to review to make sure we're using the most current
science.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, earlier this month
called on President Clinton to appoint a federal mediator to solve
the dispute between the environmental groups and federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli also asked Clinton to provide the necessary funding
to ''implement alternative, more environmentally safe disposal
options'' for the sludge.

<HEADLINE> Former teacher at orphanage gets five months for assault of boy  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) - A former teacher at a northern
New Jersey high school was sentenced Friday to five months in
prison for severely beating a teen-age boy at an orphanage in
Newfoundland in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cuthbert Ford, 66, a former teacher at Bergen Catholic
High School in Oradell, turned himself in to Canadian authorities
on Thursday and pleaded guilty to one count of assault causing
bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had recommended a six-month sentence, while Ford's
lawyer asked for a conditional sentence that would mean no jail
time.
</P>
<P>
   Originally charged in 1996 after a lengthy investigation in
Canada, Ford dropped from sight for three years and then fought
efforts to extradite him from Hackensack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He originally was charged with nine counts of assault, but
Canadian prosecutors withdrew eight of the charges in return for
Ford's return to Canada and guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's court hearing, Ford apologized to the victim,
Edgar Hartery, who was 14 when he was beaten by Ford at the Mount
Cashel Orphanage in St. John's in the late 1950s. Hartery was left
unconscious in an orphanage shower, and authorities say Ford hit
Hartery with his fists and belt.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, a member of the Congregation of Christian Brothers, a
Roman Catholic order, is the 10th person convicted in Newfoundland
for physical or sexual abuse at Mount Cashel over a three-decade
period.
</P>
<P>
   He resurfaced last year after vanishing from his job teaching
math at Bergen Catholic. He left just after he was indicted in 1996
on charges that he assaulted nine children at the Mount Cashel
orphanage. The charges against Ford were part of a 10-year
investigation of physical and sexual abuse at the orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   The first reports of abuse at Mount Cashel reached Newfoundland
police in 1975, but a senior investigator intervened and an
investigation was halted. Later investigations found that officials
allegedly had helped cover up the allegations of physical and
sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The case was reopened in 1989 when the Canadian federal
government ordered a full investigation into the matter.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 12; Dow Drops 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved in and out of positive territory
Friday, as investors took profits from a rally inspired by the
newly stable interest rate environment.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 4.76 at 11,179.44.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 12.38 at 4,040.90, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up
0.03 at 1,508.34.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Friday's tepid trading was reflective of a number
of cross currents now at work on Wall Street. But on the whole, the
markets are in something of a holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Volume is very low. It seems the markets have reached an
equilibrium and there's just not a lot going on,'' said Ricky
Harrington, technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   No single piece of economic data or news was driving Friday's
market, Harrington added.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, investors sold stocks to capture recent profits.
Technology stocks took the brunt.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology fell $3.063 to $89.50 and Advanced Micro
Devices was down $1 cents at $33.75.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, telecommunications parts maker Qualcomm was down
$2.125 at $58.50, and Internet giant Yahoo! was down $2.938 cents
at $136.875.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been climbing slowly but steadily for weeks as it
became apparent to investors that the Federal Reserve Board had
concluded its strategy of raising interest rates to slow the
economy and stem inflation was working. On Tuesday, the Fed came
though, making no change in its rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed Thursday up 38.09 at 11,182.74, the highest close
since it reached 11,287.08 on April 11. And the Nasdaq is at its
highest level in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerns remain, however, such as high energy prices and
tight labor markets, both of which could contribute to a rise in
inflation. In addition, several sectors have warned that profits
may be down in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   These factors could pose obstacles as the markets try to reclaim
their highs of early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 470.12 million,
down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small companies was up 0.46 at 523.76.

<HEADLINE> Sparta schools say they may not be able to bus kids from flood area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) - Some Sparta students live in areas so badly
flood-damaged that the school bus won't be able to pick them up
next month, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 students who usually take the bus along Glen Road
will have to find their own way to school unless repairs to a
washed-out bridge are finished, Superintendent Victor Joganow said.
</P>
<P>
   The district mailed letters to 3,000 households to let parents
know that the district can't provide transportation for students
who live beyond the washed-out span.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge was one of more than a dozen that collapsed two weeks
ago when a storm dumped more than a foot of rain on northwestern
New Jersey. Damage in Sussex County has been estimated at $166
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sussex County engineers have said a temporary restoration of the
Glen Road bridge might not be finished until mid-September. School
starts on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Joganow said the district considered two alternate bus routes,
but one of the roads is too narrow and the second too congested
during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Joganow encouraged carpooling and said the district would adjust
starting and dismissal times at Sparta's five schools until the
bridge is restored.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm asking parents to be flexible, so we'd better be flexible
about lateness,'' Joganow said.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--UN-What's in a Name?, 787  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) - Go to the Web site www.barcelona.com and you can
read the latest news from Spain, buy jewelry inspired by the
architect Antoni Gaudi and check out the Spanish weather.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not for much longer, because a United Nations
organization has ordered the New York company that runs the site to
hand over the domain name barcelona.com to Barcelona's city
council.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the sort of decision that infuriates an increasingly
vocal group of lobbyists who claim that the World Intellectual
Property Organization is stifling free speech while protecting big
business and vested interests at the expense of entrepreneurs and
ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is destroying the confidence in registering a domain name.
How can you build a business based on that locator with the
knowledge that someone with deeper pockets can take it away from
you and destroy your business?'' says Leah Gallegos, founder of The
Top Level Domains Lobby, based in Virginia Beach, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos insists that WIPO's quick and cheap arbitration system
for settling disputes over who has the right to names ending in
.com, .net and .org is destroying the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since the system was introduced last December, WIPO has received
1,110 complaints about domain names. Of the 525 cases completed by
Aug. 10, almost 80 percent of decisions went in favor of the
complainant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a broad-based, underlying interest in having
authenticity in identifiers on the Internet,'' says Francis Gurry,
WIPO's assistant director-general.
</P>
<P>
   ''You aren't dealing with someone face to face. When you type in
a name you want to know you are going to that site and not to a
pornography site.''
</P>
<P>
   Winners at WIPO have included big names like Microsoft, Yahoo!
and Motorola. Actress Julia Roberts won the rights to
juliaroberts.com and singer Madonna is waiting to hear if she will
get control of madonna.com.
</P>
<P>
   But not all rulings have gone the way of the established names.
Penguin Books was denied its request for the transfer of
penguin.org from a man with the nickname Penguin, and pop star
Sting will have to find a different domain after his demand for
sting.com was rejected on the grounds that it wasn't his real name
and was a common word.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't surprising the majority of the cases have been won by
the complainants, because really you should know pretty well on
filing whether you are going to win. If you look through all the
cases, I don't think you would be very surprised by the results,''
says Gurry.
</P>
<P>
   He says the cases which WIPO handles are the black and white
cases of so-called cybersquatting, where individuals or companies
with no rights to a name buy it in bad faith with the sole
intention of selling it to the trademark owner for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   They are not designed to handle disputes such as which of two
companies with the same name has the legitimate right to a site, he
adds.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents point to WIPO decisions they say go against common
sense, such as corinthians.com, where a Web site containing
quotations from the Bible was ordered transferred to a Brazilian
soccer team. They also worry that ''complaint sites,'' where people
grumble about a business, could be swallowed up by the companies in
question.
</P>
<P>
   They are also concerned about WIPO's proposals to expand the
scope of its rules, to include terms like ''bordeaux'' or the names
of common drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't that there shouldn't be some equity, it's that there
isn't any equity,'' says Gallegos, who says she owns around 60
domain names - some of which are for sale on another of her Web
sites - and fears some of those could become targets.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, domain name owners who have been ordered by WIPO
to hand over the names are hanging on and taking their cases to
court. Both barcelona.com and corinthians.com are still in the
hands of their original owners.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle still continues over juliaroberts.com, where
Web-users can read a list of ''Baby animals whose heads Julia has
bitten off or eaten whole as snacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ''WIPO, and courts around the world and throughout time have
consistently shown favoritism to the Rich, the Famous, and the
Incorporated, while the average Joe gets the legal boot to the
teeth,'' continues the site, owned by Russell Boyd of Princeton,
N.J.

<HEADLINE> Report: Palestinian-American Shot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Soldiers who shot and killed an elderly
Palestinian-American last week were training and not part of an
intelligence-gathering operation as the army has said, an Israeli
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mahmoud Abdullah, 70, was shot in the forehead after he fired
toward soldiers he thought were thieves on his property in the West
Bank village of Surda, near Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had been wary of prowlers and slept on the roof with a
gun since his house was broken into last year, said his son, Hisham
Abdullah, a correspondent with Agence France Presse.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials told the Kol Ha'Ir newspaper that the
soldiers involved in the shooting were not engaged in
anti-terrorism activity but were training as part of ''getting to
know the territory'' in anticipation of possible tensions if the
peace process fails.
</P>
<P>
   The army denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not talking about an exercise but operational activity
that included searches for a specific person,'' the army spokesman
said in reaction to the article.
</P>
<P>
   Hisham Abdullah said army intelligence officers had questioned
him twice. They apparently wanted to extract information that might
implicate him and give them an excuse for being in the area,
Abdullah said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah was freed both times. A laptop computer, a briefcase
and other belongings that were taken after the killing were
returned to him Thursday, except for a reporters notebook, Abdullah
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia: Accused US Spy Getting Care  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's main intelligence agency said Friday that
an American businessman accused of spying has received medical care
in jail, and rejected any possibility of letting him go before his
October trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Security Service said Edmond Pope, a former U.S.
Navy intelligence officer, will remain behind bars at Moscow's
Lefortovo jail, and scoffed at health concerns that have dominated
the high-profile spy case recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''Allegations about the deteriorating mental and physical
condition of the U.S. citizen spread by U.S. representatives are
groundless,'' said a statement from the Federal Security Service.
</P>
<P>
   The agency arrested Pope April 3 for allegedly buying plans for
a high-tech submarine torpedo. He faces 20 years in prison if
convicted. Pope's lawyer said he never intended to buy secret
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has called for Pope's release, saying
Russian authorities have failed to provide evidence to support the
spying accusation, and have asked for specialized medical care.
Pope, 54, originally from Grants Pass, Ore., has a thyroid disorder
and has been treated for bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government ''remains concerned about (Pope's) health,
which appears to have deteriorated during incarceration,'' a U.S.
Embassy official said Friday on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a municipal judge rejected Pope's request for
release on bail for medical treatment despite a lawyer's argument
that he suffers headaches and dizziness in his jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   The security service's statement said Russian oncologists have
visited Pope and that Lefortovo's chief prison doctor assured
Ronald Larsen, the U.S. Embassy doctor, that Pope's health is
holding up. ''Larsen had no complaints,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy official said he had a different interpretation
of the meeting, which he said ended with Larsen saying he would
like to see more tests before reaching a conclusion about Pope's
health.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing Thursday, police hustled a nervous-looking
Pope past reporters. He wore a suit and was handcuffed, and though
he was pale he appeared to walk without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Pope worked for Pennsylvania State University's Applied Research
Laboratory after retiring from the Navy and later founded CERF
Technologies International, a company specialized in studying
foreign maritime equipment. He frequently traveled to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said he was arrested after trying to buy plans
to a secret submarine weapon, described as an underwater missile
that glides on huge air bubbles it creates and can reach speeds of
up to 225 miles per hour.

<HEADLINE> Law: Company can sell funeral policies, undertakers object  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VESTAL, N.Y. (AP) - A state law will provide a new option to
allow people to pay for their funeral in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance regulators have given Columbian Mutual Life Insurance
Co. of the Binghamton suburb of Vestal permission to sell life
insurance policies directly through funeral directors that will
cover burial costs.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company for several years had been trying to push
legislation that would have allowed a policyholder to name a
funeral home as beneficiary on a policy with specific intent of
paying for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms could follow. Funeral directors, however, remain
reluctant to participate in the effort that would require extensive
training and certification. The new program would also directly
compete with a trust established and operated by funeral directors.
</P>
<P>
   The trust accounts, maintained by a trade organization of
funeral directors, was the only other way to pre-pay a funeral
before the insurance route was approved. Now, Columbian Mutual has
designed a policy that meets state regulations and at the same time
achieves allows a policyholder to use the proceeds specifically for
burial costs, according to the Binghamton Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of naming the funeral home as beneficiary, the policy
names a family member or close associate. The funeral home agrees
to specific funeral arrangements for the face value of the policy,
with the potential for higher costs covered by policy growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came in with a product that conforms with insurance
law,'' said Theresa Marchon of the state Insurance Department.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the nod from the state, the state association of funeral
directors say it's not something they have any interest in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Funeral directors are being led to believe that something
dramatic has happened,'' said Bonnie Tippy of the New York State
Funeral Directors Association in Albany. ''They have been allowed
to do nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   Tippy accuses Columbian of ''misrepresenting the truth'' in its
presentation of the new product, saying that her organization has
some serious reservations about the legality of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Thomas Rattmann, Columbian chief executive said
his company plans to begin conducting insurance sales training
classes for funeral directors in the near future. Funeral directors
will be required to take a 40-hour course and pass a state test to
begin selling the Columbian Mutual product.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rattmann, 47 states allow insurance policies to be
used to cover burial expenses. New York was one of the last
holdouts. Rattmann argues that interest on that trust account is
taxable yearly, while the benefits in the insurance policy build
tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, these small face-amount policies - usually $15,000
and less - are primarily sold in a single-pay arrangement to
spouses that have recently buried a partner. They want to arrange a
funeral in advance to save their family from the often difficult
experience of arranging a funeral immediately following a death.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're giving consumers an option,'' Rattmann said. ''Some will
choose not to do it. I have no doubt it will become very common.''

though, making no change in its rate policy.

   The Dow closed Thursday up 38.09 at 11,182.74, the highest close
since it reached 11,287.08 on April 11. And the Nasdaq is at its
highest level in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerns remain, however, such as high energy prices and
tight labor markets, both of which could contribute to a rise in
inflation. In addition, several sectors have warned that profits

<HEADLINE> US Deplores Action Against Suu Kyi  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said Friday it deplores
the forceful action the Myanmar government used to prevent
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from traveling outside the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Philip Reeker noted Suu Kyi and other members of her
National League for Democracy have been stranded at a police
roadblock south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   They had intended to meet with fellow party members in Kunyangon
township.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. condemns this abridgment of Aung San Suu Kyi's right
to freedom of movement and her right to visit whomever she
chooses,'' Reeker said. ''We are concerned about the health and
safety of the National League for Democracy group and hold the
Myanmar authorities directly accountable for their welfare.''

   BERLIN (AP) -- Yoko Ono says her latest work of art, a freight
car bored through with hundreds of holes and illuminated from
inside was inspired by the deaths of 18 Mexicans in 1987 who
perished in a sealed freight car trying to enter the United States
illegally.
</P>

rail car as a symbol of human suffering during the ''millennium of

   '''Freight Train' is a reminder of the violence and pain which
people all over the world are suffering and, I hope, an inspiration

<HEADLINE> Liberia Drops Spy Charges  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- Under mounting international pressure,
the Liberian government released Friday a detained British
television crew accused of spying in this West African country.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Eddington Varmah said the government had agreed
to drop all charges against the four journalists from London-based
Insight News Television -- two Britons, a South African and a Sierra
Leonean -- in exchange for an apology.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as the government is concerned, with the dropping of
these charges, this case is closed,'' Varmah said at a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief, handwritten letter to President Charles Taylor, the
journalists apologized ''to both his excellency the president of
Liberia and the people of Liberia for any offense which our action
or statements have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4, the British network that commissioned the documentary
they were making, also sent a letter of apology to Taylor. Channel
4 and Insight News repeatedly have insisted the four were in
Liberia for valid journalistic purposes and were innocent of all
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who said they were under instructions not to speak to
the media, were released from Monrovia's central prison shortly
after the news conference and accompanied to the international
airport by British and Sierra Leonean diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tired but relieved, they sat in the VIP lounge drinking
bottles of mineral water and watching coverage of their release on
television before catching a charter flight to nearby Abidjan,
Ivory Coast, en route home.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be an enormous relief for the men's families,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in London. ''I am
grateful to all those friends in the international community who
have supported our calls for the men's swift release.''
</P>
<P>
   The news was also welcomed by a spokesman for Channel 4, who had
no other comment.
</P>
<P>
   Defense and prosecution lawyers met throughout the day Thursday
to work out the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Varmah said the government agreed to drop the charges on
''humanitarian grounds'' and not for lack of evidence. The men were
not, however, being deported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may continue to enjoy the warm hospitality and the
continued goodwill of the people of Liberia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists had been in Liberia three weeks working on a
documentary when they were arrested a week ago at their hotel in
the capital, Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
   They were formally charged Monday after authorities reviewed
their videotapes and found material they said was ''damaging'' to
the Liberian government and the security of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said the government believed their documentary
would try to support British and American allegations of Liberian
government involvement in diamond-smuggling and gunrunning for
neighboring Sierra Leone's brutal rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a former warlord with longtime ties to the Sierra Leone
rebels, repeatedly has denied Liberia is acting as a conduit for
rebel diamonds or weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 4 has said the men suffered ''mental abuse'' while being
held overnight Tuesday at the headquarters of the National Security
Agency, a criminal investigation unit under Taylor's personal
control. They were kept in the central prison or a police station
the rest of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests angered international leaders and press freedom
groups. Former President Carter, American civil rights leader the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, and former South African President Nelson
Mandela joined a chorus of appeals for the journalists' release.
</P>
<P>
   The men are award-winning Sierra Leonean journalist Sorious
Samura; British director David Barrie; British cameraman Tim
Lambon; and South African cameraman Gugu Radebe. Samura has been
honored for his film ''Cry Freetown'' about the 1999 invasion of
the Sierra Leonean capital.

<HEADLINE> Mary Tyler Moore Helping Horses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mary Tyler Moore is on a mission to protect the
city's carriage horses, a popular tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The actress has teamed up with the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to drum up support for proposed
legislation they say would protect the horses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forget your visions of romance and nostalgia,'' said ASPCA
President Larry Hawk, who was joined Thursday by Moore on the steps
of City Hall. ''Current city law allows these animals to work and
live in deplorable conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who keeps nine horses of her own on a farm in upstate New
York, said she hadn't ridden a city horse-drawn carriage since a
scene she did years ago with Dudley Moore in the movie ''Six
Weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had known what these horses were going through, I would
have balked. I would not have participated in that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawk and Moore said they were looking for someone to sponsor the
proposed legislation which would restrict carriages to Central
Park, set hours of departure to and from stables, and require
blanketing of horses in freezing weather.

<HEADLINE> Police identify young woman whose body parts found in bags, suitcase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A week after the body parts of a young woman
were found in the East and Hudson rivers, police have identified
her, but still do not know who killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Police uncovered the victim's identity by matching a thumb print
to fingerprints on file with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, investigators said Friday. She was identified as Lisa
Lennon, 17, originally from Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon's last known address was in the Soundview section of the
Bronx, where she lived with the father of her 10-month-old son. The
baby was placed in the custody of the city's Administration for
Children's Services.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of Lennon's in the four-story apartment building in
the Bronx said she did a lot of odd jobs to earn money, including
styling hair.
</P>
<P>
   Police had no immediate suspects, and were talking with the
baby's father, as well as other relatives, friends and neighbors.
The medical examiner's office said Lennon's cause of death was
pending after further testing.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon's body parts were discovered less than 15 hours apart on
Aug. 16 and 17. One set of body parts was discovered Aug. 16 when a
plastic bag was found stuck in the hull of a Con Edison barge in
the East River near 14th Street and the FDR Drive. The parts
contained a left leg from the knee to the foot, a right thigh, and
two arms with no hands.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers vessel traveling
north in the Hudson River near Battery Park picked up a blue
Samsonite suitcase. Inside, they discovered three plastic bags
containing a head, two hands, a left thigh, and a right leg below
the knee.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Bans Election Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Montenegro's independence-minded
government on Friday banned all state-run media from covering
Yugoslavia's federal elections in an effort to undermine local
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro and much larger Serbia make up Yugoslavia. But
Montenegro's pro-Western government has been taking steps toward
independence to protest Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing recent constitutional changes that downgraded
Montenegro's position in Yugoslavia, the government has decided to
boycott the Sept. 24 parliamentary and presidential federal
elections, and announced it would launch an anti-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their firm opposition to the elections, Montenegrin
authorities have said they would not prevent the vote from taking
place.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrins are deeply divided over whether their republic
should split from Yugoslavia, and Friday's media gag is sure to
raise tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's supporters enjoy considerable support in Montenegro,
and there are fears of conflicts should the republic's government
declare independence.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, which applies to 16 local television and radio
stations, is an apparent attempt to undermine the position of the
Montenegrin pro-Milosevic's parties, which are calling on citizens
to take part.
</P>
<P>
   The information ministry statement, read on state-run television
Friday evening, said the media must not ''take part in election
campaigning'' and warned of legal consequences if the order is
violated.
</P>
<P>
   In the same news cast, the television reported which parties in
Serbia will run in the election race, but made no mention of about
10 parties running in Montenegro.

<HEADLINE> Blacksmith takes care of horses at fair  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - For 34 years now, Dick Sears has had the
same job at the New York State Fair. He waits for accidents to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sears is the fair's farrier - or, as most people know him, the
blacksmith. And with hundreds of horses competing in shows and on
exhibit, Sears is usually kept a busy man for the fair's 12-day
run, shoeing horses and occasionally repairing a buggy or wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most people usually come to the fair set, ready to compete.
The horse, everything is ready to go,'' said Sears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mostly what I do is fix shoes, make adjustments. Hoofs grow
and you have to trim them. Shoes wear out. Shoes break,'' said
Sears. ''If a horse's foot gets sore, it can look clumsy or out of
gait and that's not good when you're competing.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sears sits in his temporary shop in the back corner of the
horse barn and waits for people to bring their horses to him. They
come in a steady stream throughout the day, which for the
soon-to-be-61 Sears begins at dawn and lingers into the night.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over as the fair's blacksmith in 1966, Sears worked
alone. Now, his adult son, and two other farriers work with him so
the load is easier, not that he's thinking yet about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I never thought about being here so long. The years go
by and you don't think about it,'' said Sears, who looks rugged,
like rawhide, with raised veins winding across his thick, tanned
forearms. Every so often, he spits out dark juice of the Red Man
tobacco he chews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoy people. There are people who come back every year so I
see their kids grow up. Then the kids start coming back with their
own families. People stop by all day to watch us work. They always
ask us questions,'' Sears said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, one question is always about whether nailing a piece of
iron onto a horse's hoof hurts, he added. It doesn't, said Sears,
explaining that a horse's bone-hard hoof is several inches thick.
</P>
<P>
   Sears' father was a veterinarian and Sears lived on a cattle
ranch in Maryland before moving to Cazenovia as a teen-ager. He
said he used to be a cowboy as a hobby, roping calves and riding
bucking horses.
</P>
<P>
   He was about 16 when he began shoeing horses. He shod several
horses that raced in the Hambletonian, trotting's most prestigious
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was quite an accomplishment,'' said Sears.
</P>
<P>
   Sears went to Cornell University in 1958 and completed a
four-month horseshoeing course. He has been shoeing ever since.
These days he works year-round at the State University of New York
at Morrisville and private ranches. He raises six horses on a farm
in Sheds, in Madison County 30 miles southeast of Syracuse, and
travels to rodeos and horse shows across the country.
</P>
<P>
   His father showed draft horses at the fair, where the younger
Sears met Jack Scranton, a former longtime farrier at the fair.
Sears worked with Scranton for several years and took over from him
a year after his mentor retired.
</P>
<P>
   Sears is both a farrier and a blacksmith, and there's a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Farriers shoe horses. Blacksmiths do other iron work, making
tools, wagon hitchings and, mostly nowadays, ornamental and
artistic pieces. Sears said he still does a little iron work but
mostly works with horses.
</P>
<P>
   He owns quarter horses - a breed trained to race short distances
- and likes to shod them best. However, his mobile shop - really,
his pickup truck - has shoes for every kind of breed, any of which
he can encounter during a typical fair.
</P>
<P>
   Sears also carries an anvil and a portable gas forge.
</P>
<P>
   While the new shoe was heating in the forge, Sears grabbed hold
of the horse's left front leg while its owner coaxed it calmly.
Sears removed the old shoe, plucking the nails out first. He dug
out clumps of dirt with a hoof knife.
</P>
<P>
   He used a nipper, similar to a huge nail clipper, to cut away
about one-eighth of an inch of hoof. With a rasp - a long steel
file - he smoothed the hoof.
</P>
<P>
   Sears sized up the new shoe on the anvil, banging several
minutes on the red-hot metal with his hammer until it arrived at
the shape he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, nails clenched between his teeth, Sears
positioned the new shoe and hammered it in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a handcraft you can come to love,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman makes mark on Gore campaign, but analysts debate impact  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAYMONT, Del. (AP) - With tears welling in her eyes, Lynn
Imperiale hands Joe Lieberman her cell phone. ''It's my mother,'' a
breast cancer victim, she tells the Democratic vice presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman turns away from fellow passengers and a gaggle of
journalists sharing an Amtrak train car. ''Hello?'' he says into
the telephone, then patiently inquires about her medical condition
and care. ''I'll have you in my prayers,'' he tells the mother.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman returns the phone to Imperiale's shaking right
hand, a tear runs down her cheek. ''Oh my heavens,'' the Nutley,
N.J., woman says. ''I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief exchange Friday, occurring 30 minutes into the
Connecticut senator's first solo campaign trip, highlighted
Lieberman's strengths as Al Gore's newly minted running mate.
</P>
<P>
   He is a folksy, smooth campaigner - certainly smoother than his
GOP counterpart Dick Cheney. And the Orthodox Jew could give Gore
some measure of inoculation against President Clinton's moral
failings, analysts say, with his constant professions of faith and
straight-arrow reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Lieberman, if he continues to show charisma, the Gore
campaign can spread him around a bit and appeal to independents and
moderates. You've yet to see that with Cheney,'' said Michigan
pollster Ed Sarpolus.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike say Lieberman has helped loosen
up the chronically stiff Gore. He also criticizes the GOP ticket
without sounding mean - a trick Gore himself as not learned.
</P>
<P>
   In his sole event Friday, a speech to 300 local supporters in
this working-class community, Lieberman poked fun at GOP nominee
George W. Bush for saying he needs to better explain his tax-cut
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect, the problem isn't with the explanation.
It's with the plan,'' Lieberman said. He delivered the line with a
soft tone and punctuated it with a clownish grin - as if to say,
''What did you think of that one?''
</P>
<P>
   Where running mates traditionally wield a hatchet, Lieberman
used a stiletto. ''They are normal, decent people,'' he said of
Bush and Cheney before claiming that Republicans would spend money
meant for schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers say Lieberman will be folded into the vice
president's campaign plan, visiting battleground states and major
TV markets. In addition, the ticket will travel in tandem more than
Bush-Cheney - maybe more than Clinton-Gore, who set the standard
with symbolic bus trips in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have noticed a difference in Gore with Lieberman
around.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore seems a little more loose. Ever since this went from a
Clinton-Gore team to a Gore-Lieberman team, Gore started smiling
more,'' said Democratic consultant Dane Strother.
</P>
<P>
   Like most analysts, Republican Scott Reed said neither running
mate is likely to make a difference on Election Day. ''But
Lieberman seems to be molding into Gore's overall strategy to make
a one-two tag team that seems very efficient,'' said Reed, who ran
Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore takes the high road and Lieberman takes the humorous low
road without being criticized for being a hatchet man,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has dropped off the political radar screen since his
nomination. He is touring secondary TV markets on the West Coast
this week, though aides say his September schedule is loaded with
major-market visits.
</P>
<P>
   His stump speech is short and unremarkable, but even Democrats
concede that the former secretary of defense, White House chief of
staff and Wyoming lawmaker adds stature to the GOP ticket to offset
concerns about Bush's readiness.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeals more to Bush's conservative base than Lieberman
does to liberal Democratic constituencies, some of whom have raised
concerns about the centrist running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cheney pick is underestimated in terms of its future
impact,'' said Marc Lundy, a Boston College political science
professor and co-author of a new book called ''Presidential
Greatness.'' He said Bush will bask in ''reflected glory'' as
voters focus on Cheney's leadership in the Gulf War later in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman gave Gore a quick boost in the polls, but analysts say
he may not provide a long-term benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a Jew myself I can say no commentator is going to criticize
Gore of picking a Jew,'' Lundy said. ''But I will say the question
is how much anti-Semitism is out there. We will find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Lieberman is generally seen as a moderate who is
favorably viewed by most voters. Cheney is generally seen as a
conservative, who also is favorably viewed, though his negatives
are slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's moral message has appeal for parents, especially
white suburban women whom Gore has struggled to win over this year,
said John Green, a specialist in religion and politics and director
of the Bliss Institute at the University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is a more distant figure than a few weeks ago,'' said
Strother, the Democratic consultant.

<HEADLINE> State-owned building near Capitol to be razed  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - For years, state officials have pondered
what to do about an empty office building near the Capitol that
some dubbed the ''money pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Should officials spend millions to renovate the 14-story glass
tower - which the state has invested nearly $20 million in since
the early 1990s - sell it at a severe loss, or even tear it down?
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gov. John G. Rowland came up with the answer: Tear it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming what he called ''the final chapter in a nightmare,''
Rowland and members of the State Bond Commission approved spending
$1.5 million to tear down the building at 60 Washington St. and
turn it into a parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes nearly eight years after the administration
of former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker bought the building for $14
million in December 1992 to house state workers. At the time,
officials called the purchase a ''steal,'' citing the
copper-colored building's location - a block from the Capitol - and
its 440-space garage.
</P>
<P>
   But in the years since, the structure has come to seem jinxed,
and some critics had taken to calling it a ''money pit'' and a
monument to bureaucratic bungling. Rowland himself Friday called
the building the ''poster child of white elephants,'' noting that
the tower has never been occupied since the state bought it.
</P>
<P>
   The state spent more than $5.5 million for remedial work,
studies and maintenance over the years, but still was nowhere close
to bringing it up to code so state workers could move in. For a
time, officials considered selling the 31-year-old building; the
Department of Public Works placed advertisements last winter
looking for buyers willing to pay as little $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, even that deal seemed too costly, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of selling the building to a developer and then leasing
it back for parking for state workers, the administration decided
to tear down the main building and keep the parking garage, Rowland
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real value there is parking,'' Rowland said, calling safe,
affordable parking the key to urban redevelopment. ''Parking is
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As outlined to members of the bond commission, the state plans
to demolish the 195,000-square foot building and retain the
eight-story parking garage, which contains 440 parking spaces. The
garage can be used by state workers and may be available to patrons
of the Bushnell theater nearby, Rowland said. The lot also may be
used in conjunction with the Adriaen's Landing development planned
for downtown Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years and scores of jokes about the empty building,
''The nightmare is behind us,'' Rowland said.

<HEADLINE> Speculation on U.S. Priest's Slaying  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- In his last few hours, the Rev. John
Kaiser -- described by colleagues as a fearless man -- appeared
nervous and agitated for the first time in his decades-old crusade
for social justice in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the Minnesota native knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   When the 67-year-old priest's body was found along a highway
with a gunshot to the back of the head, Kenyan human rights
activists immediately called his death a political assassination --
and a clear warning to those who would follow in his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was worried about his safety,'' said Brother Martin Van
Leeuwen, who last saw Kaiser on Wednesday at a mission in Nairobi
belonging to the Mill Hill Missionaries, the religious society to
which they both belonged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since this time he came to Nairobi he was different from the
other times, restless, worried. He did not express his fears, but
you could see he was different,'' said Van Leeuwen, who had known
and worked alongside Kaiser for a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   An outspoken critic of the Kenyan government's human rights
record during his 36 years as a missionary in the East African
nation, Kaiser had recently been involved in a rape case brought
against a prominent politician.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, a visibly agitated Kaiser left Nairobi,
despite pleas from Van Leeuwen to stay and leave in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Kaiser was heard from was when he reached the
residence of the bishop of the diocese of Ngong, 15 miles west of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   He left there between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday to make
what should have been a six-hour drive to his mission in Lolgorien,
150 miles west of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hours later, police found his body lying beside his
pickup near Naivasha, 40 miles north of Ngong, his head virtually
blown off by a shotgun. His blood was still fresh and the shotgun
was found beside him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Police told us there had been a struggle, he had tried to save
himself ... and the car had been forced off the road by another
car,'' Van Leeuwen said in an interview. ''With hindsight, he did
not feel safe any place where he was.''
</P>
<P>
   When news of Kaiser's death reached Nairobi, speculation was
rife about who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990's, the priest's life had been surrounded in
controversy, mainly due to his vocal criticism of President Daniel
arap Moi's government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who in Kenya was desperate to kill Father Kaiser and why now?
They could only be very powerful people who saw him as a moral
thorn in their evil flesh,'' Kenya Human Rights Network said in a
statement Friday, condemning what it called a ''political
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before a special government commission earlier this
year, Kaiser accused two Cabinet ministers of fomenting bloody
tribal clashes between 1991 and 1997 in the Rift Valley, adding
that the ministers had stolen land from those forced to flee the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Kaiser had actively supported two young women
parishioners who had brought rape accusations against Julius ole
Sunkuli, a close Moi ally and minister of state who is widely
considered the president's chosen successor.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser advised the women, both under the age of 18, to consult a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sunkuli, who was accused in court of statutory rape June 23, is
expected to appear in court again on Aug. 31, when a judge will
decide if there is enough evidence to bring him to trial. It was
not known if Kaiser would have been called as a witness or if his
recent fears were related to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying has shaken human rights activists, who consider it a
warning, said Elna Mwau of the Coalition of Violence Against Women,
which has also supported the rape victims.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser had known for a long time that there might be a price on
his head, but treated it in a ''semi-jokey'' manner -- until
recently, according to Mill Hill's East African representative,
Father Cornelius Schilder.
</P>
<P>
   ''On this last visit he was much more serious,'' Schilder said
in an interview. ''It's a terrible blow to our aspirations because
peace and justice to us is of prime importance and John Kaiser was
our spearhead of all this.
</P>
<P>
   ''He spoke out on the Sunkuli case and the land clashes ... it's
an enormous set back.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, described as a hardworking man dedicated to his
congregation who wore ordinary, often patched-up clothes, helped
the girls simply because they were his parishioners, Van Leeuwen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was working for the people when these things came up in the
framework of justice and peace,'' Van Leeuwen said. ''He was a
martyr for the faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser was raised in Underwood, Minn., and attended St. John's
University in Collegeville, Minn. A former wrestling champion and
pole vaulter, he enlisted in the Army in 1954 and became a
paratrooper, achieving the rank of sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he graduated from St. Louis University and later
studied philosophy and theology at St. Joseph's Seminary in Mill
Hill, England.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Carolita Mahoney, said her brother did not enter the
priesthood right away, bypassing the large Benedictine monastery at
St. Johns. ''He always had this calling, this longing, to be a
priest, even though I think he tried to fight it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said he later visited St. John's again, where he met an
elderly missionary priest from the Mill Hill order and decided that
was the place for him. ''John has always had a great regard for the
welfare of people, especially the poor. He's dedicated his life to
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was to be carried out Saturday and a memorial service
was planned for next week. Kaiser will be buried in Kenya as he
would have wished, Van Leeuwen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in Kenya would be so disappointed if he was buried
anywhere else because it would be taking a saint away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Air Crash Killed Family  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   AL QARARA, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Mohammed Abu Hajaj was one of
thousands of Palestinian university graduates who escaped the
squalor of the Gaza Strip and made a comfortable living in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   But after 20 years in exile, Abu Hajaj, 46, was getting
homesick. This summer, during an extended visit to Gaza, he began
looking for a plot of land near his father's home in the small
farming town of Al Qarara in the southern Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of settling back in Al Qarara, Abu Hajaj, his wife
Hanan and their seven children -- who were among the 143 victims of
this week's Gulf Air crash -- will be buried in Bahrain, 800 miles
from home.
</P>
<P>
   In Al Qarara, Abu Hajaj's 82-year-old father, Mohammed Abdel
Kader, sat quietly in a mourning tent made from blue plastic sheets
Friday, saying he accepted the deaths as God's will.
</P>
<P>
   As Koranic verses rang out from a tape recorder, the elder Abu
Hajaj, wearing a white robe, was comforted by relatives and
neighbors who fingered worry beads and sipped bitter coffee boiled
in small metal pots on a portable iron grill.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Abu Hajaj, an Arabic teacher, was one of several
thousand Palestinians from the Gaza Strip, many of them teachers,
doctors and engineers, who could not find suitable jobs at home and
worked abroad, mainly in the wealthy Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hajaj's seven children, from 1-year-old Osama to 16-year-old
Ashraf, knew Gaza only from biannual summer visits to their
grandparents' house.
</P>
<P>
   One photograph taken two weeks ago showed the family crowded
around a small table. One of the boys clowned for the camera,
flashing a V-sign. Little Osama bounced on the table and their
mother, 39-year-old Hanan, also a teacher, reached for a soft drink
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   During this visit, Abu Hajaj had begun talking about returning
to Gaza, said his brother, 29-year-old Ali. He looked for a plot of
land in Al Qarara, a town of 25,000, and one of the few idyllic
spots in crowded Gaza, where farmers grow mangos, water melon and
apples.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mohammed said he became tired of being away from his homeland,
and that he is planning to live again in Palestine,'' said Ali, his
eyes brimming with tears.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hajaj wanted his children to attend Palestinian
universities, and felt that with his eldest, Ashraf, only two years
away from high school graduation, it was time to prepare, said Ali.
</P>
<P>
   However, Abu Hajaj decided to return to his teaching job in the
United Arab Emirates for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   He initially planned to take a flight two weeks ago, but
postponed it after a printing error was discovered in his wife's
Israeli-issued identity card. The family feared that a discrepancy
between the ID card and her Palestinian passport would cause
problems with the Israeli authorities, and a decision was made to
fix the error before leaving for Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hajaj's brother said the family then planned to fly Sunday,
but was moved to Wednesday's Gulf Air flight due to technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The family will be buried in Bahrain, with Abu Hajaj's brother,
Mohammed, a resident of the United Arab Emirates, and several
cousins planning to attend.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton meets with Reno, demands swift action against NYPD  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Exiting a White House meeting with Attorney
General Janet Reno Friday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said it was time
for Justice Department to stop studying the New York Police
Department and to act against the nation's largest police force.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York City should be under federal monitor,'' Sharpton
said. ''The fact they have a new police commissioner doesn't mean
anything. The police commissioner in New York is Rudy Giuliani. He
just changed deputies.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor fired back Friday that the overt White
House involvement in Justice Department business demonstrated just
how political the investigation was.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come to a whole different era that an activist would
meet with the Justice Department (at the White House),'' Giuliani
said at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik said NYPD officials are in the
process of talking with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn
about police issues, and expressed optimism that his administration
can bring about positive changes. Kerik took over the NYPD on
Monday, after Police Commissioner Howard Safir retired to take a
job in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think with the new management in place, I think there will
be a number of things that we do that will make people very
comfortable with the police department, make people comfortable
with how we handle certain situations, how we deal with the
community,'' Kerik said.
</P>
<P>
   The NYPD has been under federal scrutiny since 1997 when Haitian
immigrant Abner Louima was brutally assaulted and sodomized in the
bathroom of a Brooklyn police station. Federal officials
investigated the department for two years and entered into
negotiations with the Giuliani administration more than a year ago
over ways to alter the department's patterns and practices.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department can sue if they do not get sought-after
concessions from the mayor's office but officials involved in the
negotiations will say only that the case remains under review.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Justice Department is weighing whether to
file civil rights charges against four New York City cops acquitted
in the 1999 slaying of Amadou Diallo, who died in a hail of 41
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Those who met with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder in March
about the Diallo case said they were promised a decision in ''a
matter of weeks not a matter of months.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought weeks meant seven days not seven months,'' Sharpton
said Friday. ''He was shot at 41 times and the federal government
has yet to come in and protect his civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton is in Washington for the ''Redeem the Dream'' march
Saturday to protest racial profiling by police, which was the main
topic of the more-than-one-hour White House meeting Friday. Among
those who joined Sharpton were Martin Luther King III, actor Dick
Gregory and Def Jam Records founder Russell Simmons. White House
Deputy Chief of Staff Maria Echaveste and counsel Beth Nolan
attended along with Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton called for President Clinton to issue an executive
order that would block federal funding for municipalities engaging
in a proven pattern of racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, the president signed an executive order
ordering the Justice Department to begin collecting data on racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Collecting data is not enough. Now we must says what we will
do with the data,'' Sharpton said. ''A toothless tiger is not going
to scare anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Study on this issue should be over,'' King added. ''The facts
are on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The group had also discussed what they said was an unfair use of
the death penalty. The majority of those on death row are black.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Kara Peterman would say only that
that the session ''was a constructive meeting on civil rights
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said Reno had listened but had made no commitments and
provided no timetable for when a decision would be made about
Diallo or the NYPD probe.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's supporters aren't the only ones pressing for a swift
decision. Lawyers for the officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon,
Kenneth Boss and Richard Murphy say their clients - exiled to desk
jobs and facing an $81 million wrongful death lawsuit from the
Diallo family - are awaiting a decision so they can get on with
their lives.

<HEADLINE> Husband sentenced for bashing wife's head with barbell  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A former Citicorp vice president who admitted
that he bashed his wife's head and face with a 10-pound barbell was
sentenced Friday to eight years and three months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Aftab Islam, 59, had pleaded guilty Aug. 11 to first-degree
assault in the attack on Theresa Havell, 53, in their East 78th
Street townhouse early April 22, 1999. He said he was angry that
Havell had asked for a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am truly sorry for the pain and suffering I have caused my
wife and children,'' Islam said. Without looking around at Havell,
he begged her and their six children - three of whom saw the attack
- to forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   Havell did not seem forgiving. She said the plea deal that
spared Islam a possible sentence of 25 years without requiring him
to admit that he tried to murder her is a denial of justice and
closure for her family.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the court before the sentencing, Havell said
their children have asked Islam to accept responsibility for the
attack. She said they know he is lying when he claims he does not
fully remember what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ''In honesty, in contrition, the defendant should have been
required to admit both what he intended to do and what he in fact
did do,'' Havell said. ''Shame on him for his failure to take
responsibility and show contrition.''
</P>
<P>
   Islam had pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, which is
punishable by up to 25 years in prison upon conviction, and his
lawyers had told the court that they planned to present a
psychiatric defense.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney John Martin said the plea bargain
was struck to spare Islam's children the trauma of testifying
against their father.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice John A.K. Bradley said he believed
the sentence was appropriate. The judge mentioned conditions of the
plea deal, which include five years supervision after Islam's
release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions also bar Islam from contacting Havell, and he may
see his children only with their permission. If he wants to see his
children, he must write and ask them, and if they agree, he must
notify his parole officials.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks before sentencing, Islam said he loves his
children unconditionally and told them, ''I long to hold you in my
arms and hug and kiss you. I hope you find it in your hearts to
forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   Police quoted Islam as saying after his arrest that wine,
prescription drugs and marital problems had made him lose control
and hit Havell. He told them he was provoked when, after gently
stroking his wife's hair and face while she appeared to be asleep,
she turned and bit his finger.
</P>
<P>
   Havell had several surgeries at New York Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center for skull fractures and a broken jaw, nose and
finger. Several of her teeth were knocked out and she needed
hundreds of stitches on her face and head.
</P>
<P>
   Islam, a native of Pakistan, was laid off several years ago by
Citicorp Securities Markets Inc., where he was a vice president in
the public finance department. He was unemployed when he was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   His wife runs Havell Capital Management, which she founded in
1996 and which has $400 million in investments. Havell came to
prominence in the late 1980s when she oversaw a $12 billion fixed
assets portfolio at Newberger &AMP; Berman Management Inc., and
appeared on CNN talk shows.

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The last thing most people think about
when the temperature is in the 80s is how they're going to heat
their homes this winter.
</P>
<P>
   But with oil and natural gas prices on the rise, it's expected
that the high cost of heating homes will continue to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Customers should be prepared for higher bills, but to say how
much higher would be a guess right now. It depends on how cold it
gets,'' said Sandy St. Pierre, spokeswoman for Yankee Gas.
</P>
<P>
   State utility regulators plan to meet with natural gas company
officials next week to discuss how to lessen the expected price
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Social Services, which administers home
heating aid to the poor, is planning for a possible rise in the
number of people who need help paying for gas or oil this winter.
Last year, $27.3 million in aid went out to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do anticipate higher home heating oil costs this winter,
and we hope Congress and the president may release some additional
dollars,'' said agency spokeswoman Claudette Beaulieu.
</P>
<P>
   This week, prices for home heating oil rose to their highest
price since the Gulf War as U.S. crude oil inventories dropped to a
24-year low.
</P>
<P>
   A shortage of home heating oil because of OPEC cutbacks drove up
prices last winter to almost three times the usual going rate.
</P>
<P>
   People who heat their homes with natural gas escaped the price
spikes last year, but indications are they won't be so cozy this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   The supply of natural gas has declined as new gas-burning power
plants were built and production was cut back because of low
prices.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage finally drove prices back up, to an all-time high
this week on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's natural gas utilities said they are certain to
have enough gas to meet demand, because they have been storing gas
all summer and because of gas supply contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Where prices - and supplies - can be expensive is on the spot
market, where gas is sold for a premium on a minute-by-minute
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Connecticut Gas Co. went to the spot market last year
and may again this winter to supplement contracts and stored gas,
said spokeswoman Romilda Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our customers will probably pay somewhat more this winter than
last winter, but our customers are protected from volatile price
spikes because of the way we purchase our gas,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Utility Control plans to meet Thursday
with gas utility leaders to figure out how to handle price
increases.
</P>
<P>
   Under state regulations, the DPUC each month compares the
wholesale cost of gas the utilities paid with the prices that were
projected when the DPUC set rates. Any additional charge or credit
shows up on consumers' bills the following month.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can take steps to reduce their heating bills now by
installing insulation, servicing appliances to make sure they work
properly or replacing old, inefficient appliances with new ones
that use less gas or oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Social Services said people can check to see
if they are eligible for home heating aid. The aid is based on
income levels, and whether the person applying is elderly or
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, households making up to 150 percent of the federal
poverty level were eligible, or up to 200 percent of the poverty
level for households with elderly or disabled residents.
</P>
<P>
   For a family of 3, the 150 percent cut off was $21,225 last
year, and the 200 percent cutoff was $28,300.

<HEADLINE> Woman in critical condition from West Nile Virus; new spray attack being launched </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS OLERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A New York City woman was listed in critical
condition Friday from complications stemming from the West Nile
virus, and the city was re-arming for its war against the
mosquitoes that can transmit the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Five city residents, including four from Staten Island and one
from Brooklyn, have been diagnosed with West Nile virus this year,
according to city Health Commissioner Dr. Neil L. Cohen. All are 63
or older, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 46 patients in the city required hospitalization for
the virus. Four of them died.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, it's less serious than last year but still a
cause for concern,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 87-year-old Brooklyn woman now in critical condition was
diagnosed with the disease on August 15 after she was hospitalized
for an unrelated ailment. City officials would not identify her or
say which hospital she was in. They said only that she is from the
central Brooklyn neighborhood of Borough Park.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, an 84-year-old woman from the Staten Island
neighborhood of Shore Acres was listed in serious condition Friday,
according to the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The city was planning to launch another round of ground spraying
on Friday night, targeting Woodlawn Cemetery and Van Cortlandt Park
in the Bronx and the Greenwood Cemetery and Prospect Park areas of
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight aerial and ground spraying was scheduled for Staten
Island on Sunday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the large concentration of cases it makes sense to spray
Staten Island again,'' said Cohen. The city's southernmost borough
is a maze of lakes, ponds and wetlands, a prime breeding ground for
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the four Staten Island patients, 40 birds and 64
mosquitoes there have been found to be carrying the virus. In the
other four boroughs, 27 birds and 13 mosquitoes had the virus.
Twelve of 13 mosquito pools with the virus are on Staten Island;
one is in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The rainy summer has been a boon to mosquito breeding, but Cohen
said the city's attack on mosquitoes was working.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, 14 birds in Suffolk County tested positive for the
virus. They were found in Huntington, Islip, Babylon, Brookhaven
and Southampton.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk County plans to spray the communities of Bellport Beach
and Water Island on Fire Island on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lobstermen who make their living on Long Island Sound
announced Friday that they have sued the makers of pesticides used
last year in Connecticut and New York to kill mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The federal class-action lawsuit blames the chemicals for the
die-off of thousands of lobsters. The plaintiffs seek $125 million
in damages, alleging the companies withheld the fact that the
chemicals are environmentally harmful.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the regional industry generated about $100 million in
revenue, an all-time high, according to state officials. But the
catch in 1999 fell about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the defendants is Cheminova Inc. of Wayne, N.J., which
sold malathion-based products to the state of New York, and Clarke
Industries of Roselle, Ill., which sold pyrethoid-containing
pesticides to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Van Wagner, a technical manager for Cheminova, has said
the allegations have no merit. A spokeswoman for Clarke, Laura
McGowen, said she had not seen a copy of the suit.

<HEADLINE> FAA To Inspect Boeing 767 Elevators  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators on Friday ordered U.S.
airlines to inspect the elevator assemblies on Boeing 767 airliners
for damaged controls.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian officials have pointed to possible tail control
problems in the still unsolved crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, a
Boeing 767, last Oct. 31 killing all 217 aboard.
</P>
<P>
   But in announcing that it was ordering the inspections, the
Federal Aviation Administration said it has received no factual
information that the problem is related to the EgyptAir accident.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it acted after receiving reports of failed shear
rivets being found in the tail elevator assemblies of three 767
airliners.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Company sent operators of the airplanes a service
bulletin last week calling for the inspections, plus an FAA
airworthiness directive giving it the force of law.
</P>
<P>
   The elevator of an aircraft is part of the horizontal tail wing,
usually the rear section. When the elevator moves up or down it
deflects air, causing the plane's nose to point up or down.
</P>
<P>
   The problems addressed by the inspection focus on so called
shear rivets. These rivets are designed so that if a jam occurs in
one part of the system, the force put in by the pilots can break
the rivets and disconnect the jammed part of the system.
</P>
<P>
   This lets the pilots use the non-jammed system to continue the
flight safely, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said the inspection calls for a check of rivets on
bellcrank assemblies. The bellcranks, attached to a hydraulic power
control unit, help move the elevators at the rear of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failed shear rivets on two or more bellcrank assemblies could
produce abnormal elevator movements and consequent reduced
controllability or loss of control,'' the FAA said in ordering the
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines must do the inspections within 30 days and replace any
problem units.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said the order covers 322 U.S.-registered 767s.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 797 of the planes in use worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The EgyptAir flight en route from New York suddenly dived into
the ocean. Recovered parts have indicated that the left and right
elevators were pointing in different directions. These controls are
designed to operate together.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation as to the cause of the disaster has focused on the
possibility of one of the pilots deliberately plunging the plane
into the sea, although the National Transportation Safety Board is
still investigating and has yet to say officially what caused the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian authorities have strongly denied that the crash was
deliberate, and have called for further investigations of the tail
controls of this type of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Investigation details released a week ago indicated that as the
plane plunged toward the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Nantucket
Island, Mass., the pilot was struggling to pull back on the
controls to make the elevator raise the nose of the plane.

<HEADLINE> Sharpton Wants Order on Profiling  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Al Sharpton met Friday with Attorney
General Janet Reno to discuss civil rights issues and then called
for President Clinton to take a stronger stand against racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton wants Clinton to issue an executive order blocking
federal funding for municipalities that engage in a proven pattern
of racial profiling, the practice of stopping and questioning
people on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   The president signed an executive order last year ordering the
Justice Department to begin collecting data on racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we must say what we will do with the data,'' said
Sharpton, an organizer of Saturday's ''Redeem the Dream'' march in
Washington to protest racial profiling. ''A toothless tiger is not
going to scare anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Study on this issue should be over. The facts are on the
table,'' added Martin Luther King III, who along with actor Dick
Gregory and Def Jam Records founder Russell Simmons accompanied
Sharpton at the meeting with Reno, White House Deputy Chief of
Staff Maria Echaveste and White House counsel Beth Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling took up most of the meeting but the group also
discussed the death penalty and the Justice Department's
investigation of the New York City Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokeswoman Kara Peterman refused to discuss
specifics, saying only that ''it was a constructive meeting on
civil rights issues.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the meeting, Sharpton said it is time
for the Justice Department to stop studying the NYPD and take
action. ''New York City should be under federal monitor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The NYPD, the nation's largest police force, has been under
federal scrutiny since 1997 when Haitian immigrant Abner Louima was
assaulted and sodomized in the bathroom of a Brooklyn police
station. Federal officials investigated the department for two
years and entered into negotiations with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
administration more than a year ago over ways to alter the
department's patterns and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik took over the NYPD on Monday
after Police Commissioner Howard Safir retired to take a job in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think with the new management in place, I think there will
be a number of things that we do that will make people very
comfortable with the police department, make people comfortable
with how we handle certain situations, how we deal with the
community,'' Kerik said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also is weighing whether to file civil
rights charges against four New York City officers acquitted in the
1999 killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black man.
</P>
<P>
   Those who met with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder in March
about the Diallo case said they were promised a decision in ''a
matter of weeks not a matter of months.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought weeks meant seven days, not seven months,''
Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said Reno listened but made no commitments and provided
no timetable for when a decision would be made about Diallo or the
NYPD probe.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Make a Stop in Cairo  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- President Clinton will meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, a Mideast ally, during a short stop in
Cairo on Monday before his return home from an African trip, the
White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two leaders will discuss the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process,'' White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre
told reporters here awaiting Clinton's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo visit was scheduled because Mubarak is unable to
attend next month's United Nations Millennium Summit, which will
bring together many other key Mideast players, Chitre said.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Washington, Clinton discussed the Cairo stopover
in telephone calls Friday to Mubarak and Ehud Barak, prime minister
of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The summit is seen as another opportunity for Clinton to try to
nudge the Israelis and Palestinians toward a final peace agreement.
An effort to broker peace at Camp David, Md., collapsed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat arranged to meet Saturday in
Alexandria, Egypt with Egyptian leaders, who have been trying to
resolve the dispute between the Palestinians and Israel over
sovereignty of Jerusalem, the issue chiefly responsible for the
collapse of the Palestinian-Israeli summit Clinton mediated at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   The new flurry of activity comes amid signs of a willingness by
both sides to consider a compromise on that issue. Israel's top
negotiator, acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, has placed the
importance of the Old City to Muslims on equal footing with its
holiness to Jews, and Palestinian negotiator Mohammed Dahlan has
suggested sovereignty was negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo visit will be Clinton's last stop on a three-day trip
to Africa. He is scheduled to spend two days in Nigeria, and one in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   He had planned to return to Nigeria for a few hours on Monday
for the refueling of his plane. Instead he will fly to Cairo and
refuel there, getting back to Washington later than planned, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has set a Sept. 13 deadline for the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state. That is less than a week after the
United Nations summit, which Arafat plans to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt in 1979 became the first country to sign a peace treaty
with Israel and has emerged as a key regional mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has appeared reluctant to press the Palestinians on the
fate of Jerusalem Mubarak, King Abdullah of Jordan and Clinton all
have said they would be willing to help bring the two sides
together again.
</P>
<P>
   Since the summit, Arabs have been angered by American comments
that seem to blame Arafat for the failure. Among those comments
were hints from Clinton that he would reward Israel for offering
concessions at the summit by moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from
Tel Aviv to west Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Camp David talks, Arab leaders made clear that
the fate of Jerusalem is not a Palestinian issue alone. Mubarak was
among several Arab leaders who insisted on Palestinian sovereignty
over east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the U.S. Embassy would be seen by many Arabs as
acceptance of Israel's claim to Jerusalem. Most countries have
refused to open embassies in the city.

<HEADLINE> 2 hurt in Lake Hopatcong plane crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JEFFERSON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A small plane that crash-landed
into Lake Hopatcong Friday afternoon might have run out of fuel,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 Piper Seminole 44 had taken off on a training flight
from Essex County Airport in Caldwell when it developed some sort
of trouble in flight, said Jim Peters, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   State Police said the plane plunged into the lake shortly after
noon, injuring the flight instructor, Michael Connery, 38, of
Manhattan, and the student pilot, Frank Peteani, 26, of Seaford,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Connery suffered a head laceration and Peteani suffered facial
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   They got out of the plane on their own, and started swimming
toward shore when two fishermen in a small boat picked them up and
brought them ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were taken by ambulance to Dover Township Hospital,
where they were expected to be released later Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told authorities the plane was quiet as it plunged
into the lake in a cove between Halsey and Raccoon islands.
</P>
<P>
   ''That tends to jibe with what the pilot told us, that he was
losing power,'' Peters said. ''There also was no fuel slick on the
lake,'' indicating the plane may have run out of fuel.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Flowers' Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A federal judge has dismissed a defamation
lawsuit Gennifer Flowers brought against first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and two former presidential advisers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Philip Pro ruled Thursday that Flowers'
lawsuit had passed the statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The original suit accused President Clinton aides George
Stephanopoulos and James Carville of libeling and slandering
Flowers continuously since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was added to the lawsuit in January. Flowers
accused the first lady of orchestrating burglaries of her home,
defaming her and invading her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers first gained national attention when she claimed during
the 1992 presidential campaign that she had a 12-year affair with
the president when he was governor of Arkansas. He later admitted
to the affair.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Farm Hid Cocaine Operation  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   UPATA, Venezuela (AP) -- For nearly two years, a nondescript
abandoned farm house in the remote eastern jungles of Venezuela
served as a sanctuary for an international drug gang smuggling
Colombian cocaine to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Venezuelan and international anti-drug agents finally
outwitted the cartel, seizing a record 10 tons of cocaine and
arresting at least 16 people in an operation that has been a source
of pride for a country at odds with the United States over
anti-narcotics flights.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan officials have lauded the bust, the largest in the
South American nation's history, as proof President Hugo Chavez is
serious about fighting drugs despite refusing to allow U.S.
anti-drug planes to fly over Venezuelan territory -- a decision that
has hurt U.S. anti-narcotics activities in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is a major trafficking route for Colombian cocaine
bound for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are still hunting the bosses of the Los Mellizos
drug gang and trying to determine who owned the businesses and
ranches that sheltered the smugglers in Venezuela for nearly two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most difficult part of this investigation is still to
come,'' Col. Jose Antonio Paez, second-in-command of the National
Guard's anti drug unit, told reporters on the desolate farm.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still don't know who was behind all of this,'' Paez said,
gesturing toward the 5,000-acre farm that has its own airstrip,
presumably to receive cocaine from Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   It took an eight-month international investigation, using
sophisticated telephone bugging equipment and a network of
informers, to find the Doble Uno ranch, nine miles from the nearest
city, Puerto Ordaz.
</P>
<P>
   The operation, dubbed Orinoco 2000, resulted in arrests in
Venezuela, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration helped finance the
raids, and Colombia, France, Britain, Italy, Greece and Panama also
collaborated.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds surrounding the rundown farm house show not a trace
of the millions of dollars of cocaine that passed through the
premises for months. Even the mile-long airstrip looks like a dirt
road.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard combed the premises for two weeks before
discovering 2.5 tons of cocaine Wednesday night buried in two
six-foot pits deep inside thickets of trees -- the latest of three
seizures netting the 10 tons of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Paez said the National Guard would have never found the latest
haul -- stored in 2.2-pound paper bags -- if not for the confessions
of two freshly nabbed suspected smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard captured the two suspects on a remote river
island about 22 miles from the ranch. On that island -- in the
middle of the Orinoco River -- authorities first discovered 5 tons
of cocaine last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Paez led 70 soldiers in pursuit of the fugitives for five days.
Seven motor boats surrounded the island and soldiers combed the
swampy land until the suspects were caught trying to hitch a ride
with passing fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   ''They couldn't hold out. They had no food and they told us that
every time they poked their heads out they saw soldiers patrolling
the grounds,'' Paez said.
</P>
<P>
   The two initially pretended to be tourists but soon confessed
and revealed the location of the pits with cocaine after being
promised lighter sentences, Paez said.
</P>
<P>
   Paez says most of those detained carry Venezuelan identity cards
which he suspects are false. Soldiers insisted most of the
detainees are Colombian. There is strong evidence to show that the
cocaine packets were airdropped from Colombia, Paez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The packets had fluorescent hooks which tells me that they
were dropped by air at night,'' Paez said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he suspects the farm was a holding spot for the cocaine
which was then taken by land or through the Orinoco River en route
to the Caribbean for shipment to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Paez insisted the presence of a major drug cartel operating in
the country does not mean Venezuela has become a refuge for
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you find these things people say, 'so does that mean that
drug trafficking is growing in Venezuela?' Why don't they say I'm
doing my job better?'' Paez said.

<HEADLINE> Berkeley Twp. residents sue gas station, alleging MTBE contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - About 100 residents of Berkeley Township
are suing the owners of a gas station, claiming a leaking tank
allowed gasoline and the additive MTBE to contaminate their water,
their lawyer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the residents of the Bayville section of the township
were sickened by the additive, said lawyer Shari M. Blecher.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have rashes, probably from bathing in it, dizziness,
liver and kidney problems and cancer. There's a lot of health
problems, unfortunately,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are current or former residents of a neighborhood
near a Cumberland Farms market and gas station, who used private
wells.
</P>
<P>
   Members of one of the families were sickened in the summer of
1999, Blecher said. Water tests showed high levels of MTBE,
prompting other residents to have their wells tested.
</P>
<P>
   A gasoline tank at the station was found to have a hole in it,
Blecher said.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Cumberland Farms removed the tank and, at the
direction of the state Department of Environmental Protection,
removed 366 tons of contaminated soil, department spokesman Rob
Schmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Cumberland Farms sampled 200 wells and found that eight had high
MTBE levels, Schmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Cumberland Farms provided bottled water to residents, paid for
water treatment units for their homes and offered to pay the costs
for residents to connect their homes to municipal water lines,
Schmitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt said the attorney general's office is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Cumberland Farms could not be reached Friday;
the telephone has been disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   The residents are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages and reimbursement for those residents who paid to be
connected to municipal water lines, Blecher said.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is used in one-third of
the gasoline sold in the United States, primarily in areas with
smog problems. The Clinton administration is moving to ban the
octane-boosting additive, which allows gas to burn cleaner but has
fouled many water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 9,000 community water wells near leaking underground
storage tanks in 31 states may be affected by contamination from
MTBE, according to a study in the journal Environmental Science and
Technology.

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Cracker Revival, Bjt,680  </HEADLINE>
By JOE MANDAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) - Rod Willcox knows crackers.
</P>
<P>
   And he knows exactly why he came back to a 477,000-square-foot
Pittsburgh bakery that Nabisco shuttered in 1998 to try his luck in
the growing ''private-label'' cracker business.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew the plant, I knew the people - and I knew the ovens,''
said Willcox, president and chief executive officer of Atlantic
Baking Group. ''It was well recognized in the industry that a lot
of the quality coming out of Pittsburgh was due to the ovens.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes those five football-field-length conveyor ovens will
provide his venture with a Midas touch.
</P>
<P>
   Parsippany, N.J.-based Nabisco is still king of the crackers,
selling 736.6 million ''units'' worth $1.66 billion last year,
according to Information Resources Inc., a Chicago market research
firm. A unit is a bag, box or other container sold to the consumer.
As such, Nabisco controls 40 percent of the cracker market, by
volume.
</P>
<P>
   But private-label bakers are overcoming images of
black-and-white wrappers with improved products and packaging,
Willcox said.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as generic, private-label products are not sold under
a brand name, but are manufactured for vendors who sell the product
under their names. The private-label market ranges from store-brand
crackers at grocery chains to two-cracker convenience packs bearing
a restaurant's moniker.
</P>
<P>
   According to Information Resources, private-label bakers sold
$277.1 million worth of crackers in the past year and 216.3 million
units - or 11.8 percent of the market, by volume - trailing only
Nabisco and Keebler.
</P>
<P>
   A former Campbell Soup executive in England, Willcox moved to
the United States in 1978 where he worked for Pepperidge Farms. He
eventually supervised the Pittsburgh cracker plant as vice
president of manufacturing for Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco closed the plant in November 1998 in a companywide
consolidation - but by that time, Willcox was living in Georgia and
trying to put together a private-label cracker venture called
Atlanta Baking Group.
</P>
<P>
   After Willcox became ill - a tumor, since removed - those plans
were further delayed when Keebler refused to sell his group an old
factory.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Steel Valley Authority, a 20-county agency
in western Pennsylvania that seeks to rejuvenate closed industries,
learned of Willcox's ties to the Nabisco plant here.
</P>
<P>
   And, quicker than you can drop the last ''a'' from Atlanta and
add an ''ic'', Atlantic Baking Group was born.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent six months walking around this city, from office to
office, and people wanted to save this plant. I think by the time
we got around to signing the papers there were 12 law companies
involved,'' Willcox said. ''It took me two days to sign all the
damn documents.''
</P>
<P>
   When all was said and done, Atlantic Baking Group signed a lease
with the Regional Industrial Development Corp., the redevelopment
agency that bought the Nabisco plant for $10 million. High-profile
public investors, including Global Emerging Markets and the Soros
Group, both of New York, have provided $25 million in working
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The plant opened last August. It employs 70 people now and will
eventually employ 400, probably by February, Willcox said. At its
peak with Nabisco the plant employed 500, and about 300 when it
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The employees are grateful. Their two unions agreed to 25
percent pay cuts from their Nabisco wages - and are also pitching
in $1 per hour, per employee, to help pay the bakery's lease.
</P>
<P>
   Willcox said that's a recipe for success, and industry experts
have praised the deal from the pages of trade journals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a perfect situation for everyone,'' said Steve
Berne, editor of Baking &AMP; Snack magazine in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''With (Willcox's) expertise, with his background, walking into
this facility that he knew - having it basically handed to him -
and then he's familiar with the equipment, the company and the
process,'' Berne said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was in the right place at the right time.''

<HEADLINE> PATCO high-speed line fares to increase Sunday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Passengers on the PATCO High-Speed Line,
which runs between southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, will have
to pay a little bit more to ride beginning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:01 a.m. Sunday, fares will increase between 10 cents and
25 cents, according to the Delaware River Port Authority, which
operates the line.
</P>
<P>
   The increase will help fund Port Authority Transit Corporation
improvements, including modernizing and maintaining PATCO cars,
station work, renovation of the West Headhouse at Broadway Station
and the replacement of outdated, wooden track cross ties.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second phase of a fare increase; the first phase
took effect last year. That was the first time PATCO raised fares
since 1983. Fares will increase again in 2001, the port authority
said.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the increases:
</P>
<P>
   -Between all New Jersey stations, from $1 to $1.10
</P>
<P>
   -Between Philadelphia and Camden's City Hall and Broadway
stations, from 85 cents to $1
</P>
<P>
   -Between Philadelphia and Camden's Ferry Avenue Station, from
$1.40 to $1.60
</P>
<P>
   -Between Philadelphia and New Jersey's Haddonfield, Westmont and
Collingswood stations, from $1.60 to $1.85
</P>
<P>
   -Between Philadelphia and New Jersey's Lindenwold, Ashland and
Woodcrest stations, from $1.85 to $2.10
</P>
<P>
   -Between all Philadelphia stations, from 85 cents to $1.
</P>
<P>
   -The 10-trip Reduced Fare Program for senior citizens and
disabled riders will increase from $4.25 to $5.
</P>
<P>
   Riders with tickets bought before Sunday may continue to use
them, the port authority said.
</P>
<P>
   The High-Speed Line connects Lindenwold to downtown
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Delaware River Port Authority owns and operates the Benjamin
Franklin, Walt Whitman, Commodore Barry and Betsy Ross bridges, the
RiverLink ferry, International Cruise Terminal and AmeriPort
Intermodal Rail Center.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Wahid Cedes Role To V.P.  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Long sidelined from the inner workings
of government, Indonesia's popular but untested vice president was
handed a new role Friday in policy and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Beleagured President Abdurrahman Wahid issued a decree giving
his deputy, Megawati Sukarnoputri, a direct say in the formulation
of state strategies and management of day-to-day issues.
</P>
<P>
   The move is central to Wahid's campaign to get his troubled
10-month-old administration back on track and to stem growing
criticism of his often erratic presidential style.
</P>
<P>
   The decree was issued after Megawati and Wahid held private
talks at her official residence Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the two have been strained by the failure of
their fractious coalition to fix a deep economic crisis or to end
sectarian and separatist violence in several outlying provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences came to a head this week when her aides
accused Wahid of stacking a new Cabinet with his own supporters
while excluding her senior backers from key positions.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has defended his choice of ministers, saying they would be
more professional than an unwieldy 35-member Cabinet he appointed
last October when he became Indonesia's first democratic leader in
four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decree states that Megawati will chair weekly meetings
of the new 26-member Cabinet appointed Wednesday, review ministers'
performances and set Cabinet agendas.
</P>
<P>
   She is authorized to appoint senior bureaucrats and top military
and police officers with Wahid's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati, 53, is the daughter of Indonesia's founding President
Sukarno and a prominent pro-democracy figure in her own right,
although she rarely speaks in public except to recite written
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Her brand of secular nationalism is especially appealing to
Indonesia's growing urban poor.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Wahid, a revered Muslim leader, has largely excluded
her from policymaking even though she leads the largest party in
the national parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old president, who is almost blind and weakened by a
series of strokes, promised to reshuffle his administration and
enhance Megawati's role after Indonesia's top assembly threatened
to impeach him earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid and Megawati are scheduled to install the new Cabinet at
the state palace on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, prosecutors formally served a summons
Friday on ex-President Suharto that demanded he attend the start of
his trial next Thursday on charges of massive corruption.
</P>
<P>
   However, Suharto's lawyers cast doubt on whether their client
would show up for the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   They said a series of strokes has left him brain damaged and
unable to comprehend questions or to remember details.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can Suharto answer questions from the judges if he can't
understand them?'' asked Mohammad Assegaf, one of Suharto's defense
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who ruled Indonesia with an iron fist for 32 years, is
accused of siphoning off at least $570 million in state funds
through a network of charities under his control.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, he could be imprisoned for life, although Wahid
has offered a pardon in exchange for the return of any ill-gotten
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who like many Indonesians uses one name, has denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto quit office in 1998 amid massive protests and riots.
</P>
<P>
   His prosecution is regarded as a crucial test of Wahid's resolve
to clean up endemic corruption in the world's fourth-most populous
nation.

<HEADLINE> Badia brand paprika recalled  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Florida-based Badia Spices Inc. is recalling about
22,000
bottles of paprika because the spice may be contaminated with
salmonella, which can cause serious infections in certain people.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Miami company recalled ''Badia Paprika'' that has the
following identification on the bottle's label: The expiration date
11-2002, and the UPC number 33844-00011. The paprika is sold in
2-ounce plastic bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should not eat the recalled product but return it to
the place of purchase for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of salmonella include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain
and vomiting. Healthy people typically recover in a few days, but
salmonella can cause serious, even life-threatening, infections in
young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Florida agriculture officials discovered the salmonella during
routine testing. Badia imports the spice from Spain and said a
supply arrived contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration classified the recall as
nationwide, although Badia said sales were in East Coast states
between Florida and New York, and in Texas. The FDA said some
recalled paprika also may have been exported to the Caribbean and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Customers may contact Badia at 305-629-8000.

<HEADLINE> Emmy Ballot Omits Chris Rock Show  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The joke was on Chris Rock: His
Emmy-nominated comedy special was left off ballots for next month's
television awards.
</P>
<P>
   The error, which the Academy of Television Arts &AMP; Sciences
scrambled to correct in the days after the ballots went out to
voters, is one of several that have beset entertainment awards
shows in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar statuettes were swiped last spring, videocassettes
intended to curry Emmy votes for the sitcom ''Everybody Loves
Raymond'' went missing and a hip-hop music awards show was shut
down by an audience melee this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been an awful lot of gremlins at the Hollywood
awards this year,'' said Thomas O'Neil, author of ''The Emmys.''
</P>
<P>
   The glitches reflect the detail involved in the awards process,
said John Leverence, Emmy Awards director.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything as complicated as the Normandy landing or the
Primetime Emmy Awards is bound to have within it opportunities for
things not to go right,'' Leverence said Friday. Because of
safeguards, he said, the voting outcome was not compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The omission of HBO's ''Chris Rock: Bigger and Blacker'' from
the variety, music or comedy special ballot was brought to the
academy's attention by one of the 120 academy members eligible to
vote in the category.
</P>
<P>
   ''We called everybody, notified them there was a problem and got
them a new ballot or, if they preferred, let them write it (Rock's
show) in,'' Leverence said.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots, which went out in June and were due back by Aug.
21, are all accounted for and complete, he said. A ballot has to
have five nominees listed to be counted so there was no chance for
an incomplete form to slip through, Leverence said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of ballots were affected, he said. In a statement,
Rock expressed confidence that the mistake would be rectified.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried. I'm sure the Academy will handle it
accordingly,'' the comedian said.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's special, which has a total of six nominations, is
competing for the variety, music or comedy special trophy with
''72nd Annual Academy Awards,'' ABC; ''Cirque du Soleil -- Quidam,''
Bravo; ''Eddie Izzard: Dress to Kill,'' HBO; ''Saturday Night Live:
The 25th Anniversary Special,'' NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Shandling will host the ''52nd Annual Primetime Emmy
Awards,'' airing Sept. 10 on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Emmy mistakes are not unprecedented but this one was more
noticeable because of the academy's new voting system.
</P>
<P>
   Winners previously had been selected by blue-ribbon panels that
met in hotels to watch the nominees on videocassettes and to vote.
This year, the academy is trying at-home viewing and voting to make
the process more appealing to more members.
</P>
<P>
   With past slips, Leverence said, ''we were right there in the
(hotel) room, somebody said 'Oops, we've got something that isn't
right here' and we were able to immediately correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new, expanded approach is ''a big, complicated, very
difficult system that inevitably is going to have problems. It's
not the problems that show the character of the awards show, it's
the response to them,'' Leverence said.

<HEADLINE> Forecasters say N.J. is in flood danger as hurricane season approaches </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sparta residents are just beginning to dry out their basements
and shore up their broken dams and bridges. In Bound Brook, 40
percent of the business district has never returned since record
flooding a year ago damaged thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   The state has seen two serious floods in less than a year, and
many say they've seen enough water. But weather forecasters say New
Jersey is so waterlogged from a rainy summer that it is poised to
flood in many parts if as little as 5 inches of rain falls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking at major flooding with even a lesser event than
Floyd,'' said National Weather Service meteorologist John
Quagliariello, referring to the tropical storm that devastated
parts of Somerset and Bergen counties a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the hurricane season reaches its peak, 13 reservoirs in
northern New Jersey are at levels 20 percent above normal, said
George McKillop, a hydrologist at the weather service.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Hopatcong in Jefferson Township, among the hardest-hit
areas by the Aug. 12 rainstorm, is at its highest level in more
than 100 years, weather officials said. The Passaic River at Little
Falls is 90 percent higher than normal and the Delaware River in
Trenton is 250 percent above normal for this time of year, McKillop
said.
</P>
<P>
   National Hurricane Center experts have predicted at least 11
named storms in the season that began in June and ends in November,
an above-average figure. The East Coast will normally see the
remnants of two or three of those, which almost always pack heavy
rain, McKillop said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people think about hurricanes, they think about the wind
damage and the storm surge,'' he said. ''The third menace is the
inland flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather forecasters predict that major flooding could occur
in flood-prone areas if 5 inches of rain fall in a short time. If
10 inches fell, forecasters say parts of New Jersey could
experience flooding like Floyd, which killed four people in New
Jersey and caused nearly $1 billion in damage last September.
</P>
<P>
   Before Floyd hit, McKillop said, reservoir levels were unusually
low because of last summer's drought.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reservoirs would not be able to store the kind of water
that appeared in Floyd'' today, McKillop said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bergen County, United Water Co.'s four reservoirs are at 87
percent of capacity, but are usually at 65 percent capacity at this
time of year, spokesman Kevin Doell said
</P>
<P>
   In Sussex County, where more than a foot of rain fell on Sparta
and 18 dams were damaged, officials are stocking up on sandbags and
hoping to avoid more water.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wouldn't like to see anything more come our way, but no one
can predict what Mother Nature will do,'' said Phil Morlock, county
administrator for Health and Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Morlock said many dams that survived the Aug. 12-14 flooding are
up to 90 percent full.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time it rains, you worry,'' Bound Brook Mayor Frank Ryan
said. ''Especially heavy rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said Bound Brook has purchased more boats, a
four-wheel-drive vehicle and an Army vehicle in case a Floyd-like
storm revisits the town this year. Quagliariello said Raritan River
levels are high in the Bound Brook-Manville area, but couldn't
predict how much rain would have to fall to cause serious flooding
there.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Biniek, who spent $175,000 in grants, loans and his own
money to rebuild a shoe store destroyed by Bound Brook flooding,
said he was stacking his inventory higher off the floor to protect
it from damage. But he said he didn't want to give into early flood
fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to worry about it until it happens,'' Biniek
said. ''I made the decision last year to return to Bound Brook and
I'm going to ride it out.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Leaves on Trip to Africa  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton left Friday on a weekend
trip to Africa to give Nigeria's fragile democracy a boost and
encourage efforts to maintain peace among warring factions in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew out shortly after the White House made known that
he is adding a Monday stop in Cairo to meet with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, a Middle East ally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two leaders will discuss the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process,'' White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre
said. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was meeting with Egyptian
officials Saturday in Alexandria, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, climbed the steps
to Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base and was met at the top
by another member of the American delegation, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who stepped aside to let the president pass.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is Clinton's second to sub-Saharan Africa and probably
his last trip to that region as president. Although brief, it is
weighted with symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   While in Nigeria, Clinton plans to tell President Olusegun
Obasanjo that the United States supports Nigeria as it secures its
democracy. He plans to announce additional help for primary schools
and disease prevention, fattening an aid package that has grown
from $7 million to $108 million in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the aid
is necessary because Nigeria's political development is at a
delicate stage. The country has been trying to restore public faith
in government with an aggressive attack on corruption and efforts
to manage the nation's oil wealth in a more responsible way. It
also faces tensions between its diverse religious and ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a make-or-break transition, not just for Nigeria but
for Africa,'' Berger said. ''If Nigeria succeeds, this can help
lift the whole region to prosperity and peace. If it fails, it can
swamp the whole region in turmoil and misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to discuss with Obasanjo how to make Nigerian oil
production more efficient and offer the suggestion that Obasanjo
work on closer cooperation with his legislature. He also hopes to
address the institution of Islamic law in several northern states,
which threatens to plunge Nigeria into a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of that, Clinton is expected to speak with the Nigerian
leader of problems throughout the African continent: debt relief,
the fight against AIDS and stopping conflicts in the Great Lakes
region, which includes Burundi, Uganda, Rwanda and Congo.
</P>
<P>
   During his stop, the president will see very little of Nigeria,
only Abuja, the gleaming new capital, and a village just beyond the
city's outskirts. He then moves to Tanzania to show solidarity with
former South African President Nelson Mandela's efforts to broker
peace between warring Hutus and Tutsis in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Nigeria has spent $10 billion in the past decade on
peacekeeping, Berger said the United States will begin this week
helping train five Nigerian battalions to serve in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an interest in helping Nigeria bear this burden,''
Berger said. ''To the extent the Nigerian military becomes a
professional military, not a political military, it is good for
stability and democracy in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's delegation includes mayors Wellington Webb, Denver;
Ron Kirk, Dallas; Marc Morial, New Orleans; Dennis Archer, Detriot;
and Sarah Bost, Irvington, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes 12 Democratic members of Congress: Reps.
Charles Rangel, New York; Jim McDermott, Washington; Donald Payne,
New Jersey; William Jefferson, Louisiana; Eddie Bernice Johnson,
Texas; Chaka Fattah, Pennsylvania; Sheila Jackson Lee, Texas; Julia
Carson, Indiana; Carolyn Kilpatrick, Michigan; Greg Meeks, New
York; Barbara Lee, California; and Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Ohio; and
Republican Rep. Spencer Bachus, Alabama.

<HEADLINE> Teacher education requirement begins this term  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - School bells won't be ringing just for
students in the coming weeks. Starting this school year, New Jersey
teachers must compile 100 hours of professional training every five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Three years in the planning, the new professional development
requirement is aimed at improving the stock of teachers and
ensuring they'll be able to teach tougher core curriculum
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But the requirement has no teeth. An early version that
threatened non-complying teachers with the loss of their
certification was watered down soon after its introduction three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two state lawmakers want to return the original language to
the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation sponsored by Sens. William E. Schulter,
R-Mercer, and Robert J. Martin, R-Morris, teachers who do not
satisfy the 100-hour requirement and have no good reason for doing
so, would lose their teaching license.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be sure that the teachers continue to improve or
become acquainted with the latest technology ... so we have uniform
quality teachers,'' Schulter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a teacher suddenly burns out and is just working toward a
pension, the students suffer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is backed by the New Jersey School Boards Association.
In addition to threatening teachers with the loss of their license,
the bill also defines the types of activities that count toward the
100 hours and gives school officials veto power over teachers who
want to pursue professional development classes during the school
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel there has to be some control,'' said association
spokesman Frank Belluscio.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association said
the teachers' union believes the bill is misguided and premature.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gallagher said the state regulations ought to be given time
to work before legislation amending them is considered.
</P>
<P>
   The NJEA opposes the 100-hour mandate as ''draconian and
punitive,'' he said. The rules about to take effect allow school
districts to discipline teachers who fail to comply with the
mandate, he said. No top-down approach is needed from Trenton,
Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, local school administrators and teachers ought to
be given the discretion to define the types of activities that can
be applied to the 100-hour mandate, and whether time can be taken
out of the class day, he said. Only local educators know what is
best for the children they deal with, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Give the regulations time to work,'' Gallagher said. ''This is
really a good program. These decisions ought to be made at the
local level.''
</P>
<P>
   The NJEA spokesman said the union will aggressively lobby
against the bill when the Legislature returns in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope it's DOA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schulter recognizes the power of the teachers' union. State
education officials backed off their original tougher wording after
the NJEA objected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, they have a lot of influence. And yes, I've been
supported in the past by the NJEA. But I believe this is necessary
to improve public education in New Jersey,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dissident group: Iranian delegation to U.N. summit includes 'terrorists' </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An Iranian parliamentary delegation coming for
the U.N. summit of world leaders includes an alleged terrorist
linked to the assassination of an Iranian human rights
representative in Geneva, an exiled Iranian dissident group said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Ali Hadi Najaf-Abadi, currently an Iranian deputy
foreign minister, ''should be arrested when he arrives at Kennedy
Airport,'' said Alireza Jafarzadeh, an official of the National
Council of Resistance of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris-based group, which bills itself as Iran's
parliament-in-exile, has at least 20,000 members and supporters.
Its officials held a news conference at a Manhattan hotel near the
United Nations to call on the U.S. government to bar three
delegates. But two of those apparently are not coming.
</P>
<P>
   Jafarzadeh maintained the delegate still listed to attend,
Najaf-Abadi, was instrumental in planning the 1990 assassination of
Kazem Rajavi, the National Council's representative to the Human
Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   He cited an opinion issued by a Swiss judge to back up his
allegation. However, Najaf-Abadi was never tried or arrested in the
killing. At the time, he was the Iranian ambassador to Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Hossein Nosrat, the press secretary of the Iranian Mission to
the United Nations, responded: ''It's the same story we've heard so
many times before. I do not think it's worth commenting on those
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   For its own part, the National Council is listed by the U.S.
State Department as an alias for the the Mujahedeen Khalq, a group
based in Iraq that has claimed responsibility for the assassination
of Iranian officials and is listed as a foreign terrorist
organization under U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Jafarzadeh said another of the delegates
to the parliamentary meeting was to be Mohsen Rezaii, who headed
Iran's Revolutionary Guards for 16 years and has repeatedly called
for the murder of Jews and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Rezaii is on a list of registered Iranian delegates received by
the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a group hosting a meeting of the
world's parliament speakers that begins Aug. 30. The parliamentary
session precedes the Sept. 6-8 Millennium Summit of 150 leaders,
including Iranian President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   But Rezaii has not been granted a U.S. visa, a State Department
official who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated
Press. He said a record of violence against Americans would affect
any visa decision, and refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Jafarzadeh said Rezaii was among the hard-line Iranians behind
the 1983 Beirut bombing that killed 241 U.S. Marines.
</P>
<P>
   As commander in chief of the Islamic Guards from the early 1980s
till about three years ago, he helped train an Iranian unit that
backed Hezbollah, the Islamic fundamentalist group blamed for the
attack, Jafarzadeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bulliet, director of the Middle East Institute at
Columbia University, says that while Hezbollah is regarded as the
perpetrator, Razaii ''may have been in Lebanon at the time, and he
may have been part of the training, he may have had a consulting
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Jafarzadeh said Karim Safai, an Iranian intelligence officer
whom he described as a ''torturer,'' also was expected as part of
the delegation. But he was not on any list of delegates as of
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 10; Nasdaq Drops 11  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were little changed Friday as traders, no
longer preoccupied with interest rates, searched in vain for
guidance on the market's direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 9.89 at 11,192.63.
The blue-chip index gained 146.15 for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 10.60 at 4,042.68, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
down 1.86 at 1,506.45. The Nasdaq gained 112.34 for the week, while
the S&AMP;P 500 rose 14.74.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Friday's tepid trading was reflective of a number
of cross currents now at work on Wall Street. But on the whole, the
markets are in something of a holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Volume is very low. It seems the markets have reached an
equilibrium and there's just not a lot going on,'' said Ricky
Harrington, technical analyst with Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The most closely watched event Friday had little impact on the
broader markets.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Emulex fell 62 percent during the session to a low of
$43 after someone issued a phony press release stating that the
network equipment maker was restating its earnings and that its CEO
had quit. The stock recovered most of the losses, closing down
$7.313 at $105.75, after the company refuted the reports as a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   Emulex officials said the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the FBI were investigating.
</P>
<P>
   No single piece of economic data or news influenced Friday's
market, however.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some investors sold stocks to capture recent profits.
Technology stocks bore the brunt.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Technology fell $3.563 to $89 and Texas Instruments was
down $2.312 at $67.063.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, telecommunications parts maker Qualcomm was down
$1.75 at $58.875, and Internet giant Yahoo! was down $5.563 at
$134.25.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been climbing slowly but steadily for weeks as it
became apparent to investors that the Federal Reserve Board had
concluded its strategy of raising interest rates to slow the
economy and stem inflation was working. On Tuesday, the Fed came
through, making no change in its rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has risen more than 650 points in the past two weeks and
is at its highest point since it reached 11,287.08 on April 11. And
the Nasdaq is at its highest level in a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerns remain, however, such as high energy prices and
tight labor markets, both of which could contribute to a rise in
inflation. In addition, several sectors have warned that profits
may be down in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   These factors could pose obstacles as the markets try to reclaim
their highs of early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 844.06 million,
well below Thursday's pace of 1.02 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of small companies was up 1.81 at 525.11.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.44 percent.
Germany's DAX index was up 1.06 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.10 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.06 percent.

<HEADLINE> Southern Lebanese Residents To Vote  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- For the first time in nearly three
decades, residents of the former Israeli-occupied border zone in
southern Lebanon are getting a chance to cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an important step because it will bring the zone back to
the fold of government authority,'' said Najwa Haddad, a grocer,
from Marjayoun. She was only only 2 in when the last election was
held in her hometown in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is also a step for the better with regard to ensuring
public services for the people in an area that has been
neglected,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Balloting in the south along with eastern provinces and the
capital Beirut is on Sept. 3, following Sunday's voting in the
north and the central Mount Lebanon area.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 589 candidates are running for 128 seats in the
legislature. Some 2.75 million Lebanese over age 21 may vote.
</P>
<P>
   The government promised fair balloting. But complaints of unfair
practices are coming from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, popular for its guerrilla war
against Israel in the south, hit out at alleged vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah chief Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said that some candidates
are offering $100 to $200 a vote and even a higher price come
election day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Islam forbids voting for a handful of dollars. Those who offer
a bribe cannot be trusted with the country's finances,'' he told a
rally in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the south, right-wing Christian groups opposed to
Syrian influence have called for an election boycott, but the call
was not expected to be heeded.
</P>
<P>
   Syria reportedly has exerted great influence over Lebanese
elections and candidates in the past have traveled to Damascus to
seek Syrian blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bashar Assad took over Lebanon policy for Syria in recent
years, such open intervention has subsided. Bashar Assad became
Syrian president earlier this year following the death of his
autocratic father Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad's technique may be more subtle, but the result is
expected to be the same: a Lebanese Parliament for the next four
years packed with pro-Syrian legislators.
</P>
<P>
   With Israeli troops out of Lebanon -- they left in May -- and the
Syrian factor a non-issue, no candidate is even mentioning the
30,000 Syrian troops posted in Lebanon. Instead, the election focus
has shifted to the economy and candidates' merits.
</P>
<P>
   Among newcomers are President Emile Lahoud's 25-year-old son --
the youngest candidate -- and the 29-year-old son of former
President Amin Gemayel.
</P>
<P>
   The main battle in Beirut is between Prime Minister Salim Hoss
and his predecessor Rafik Hariri, a billionaire businessman who has
been attempting a comeback since he stepped down after a dispute
with Lahoud in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hariri, who launched a multibillion-dollar postwar program to
rebuild Lebanon, blames Hoss' government for the economic recession
since it took office in 1998. Hoss accuses Hariri of burdening
Lebanon with a public debt of more than $20 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Forest Plan May Pose Risk  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's plan to protect 43 million
acres of roadless forests may pose a greater risk of wildfires than
the administration has publicly disclosed, Idaho Sen. Larry Craig
charged Friday, citing an internal Forest Service memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service is crafting the plan using older maps that
show a ''lower fire risk'' in four Idaho national forests, he said.
Newer, more accurate maps show a ''higher risk'' in the four
forests, including the Salmon-Challis National Forest, where a
wildfire charred more than 175,000 acres and continued to burn
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Craig obtained a memo written by Chuck Dull, who is helping
compile data for the roadless plan, to Dave Thomas, an agency fire
official from the region that includes southern Idaho. Thomas had
asked Dull about using Idaho fire maps from May in the roadless
proposal instead of data collected last November.
</P>
<P>
   But in the memo dated Aug. 15, Dull said blending the new maps
for the Boise, Payette, Sawtooth and Salmon-Challis forests with
the earlier regional and state data would make the roadless plan
''scientifically not supportable.''
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service spokesman Chris Wood said the newer Idaho maps
are an ''experimental prototype'' that involves combining national
and local data to assess fire conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The agency decided to use the earlier maps, which Wood said are
''the most comprehensive spatial data for the U.S. that have
probably ever been produced.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed a rule in May that would ban road
building in more than a fifth of the nation's 192 million acres of
federal forests. The move, hailed by environmentalists, would make
it difficult to log, mine or develop the areas, which are among the
most pristine public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials told Craig in February and July that
any additional fire risk as a result of the roadless plan was
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Craig wants the Forest Service to use the newer Idaho maps that
show a greater fire risk in crafting the roadless policy.
</P>
<P>
   He said in a letter to Forest Service chief Mike Dombeck that
the agency's failure to use the new data ''paints a picture of an
administration that did not, and in your case still does not,
consider wildfire risk to be a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig chairs the forests and public land management subcommittee
of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is a
frequent Forest Service critic.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's charges come during the worst years for wildfires in 50
years. Fires have burned 5.84 million acres nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists worry the fires could hurt the roadless effort
or lead to increased logging. They argue logging helps cause fires
because the absence of trees dries out areas and brush left behind
from logging operations is easily ignited.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that the roadless policy is responsible or played a
factor (in fires) has no validity,'' said Michael Francis of The
Wilderness Society.
</P>
<P>
   Western Republicans, logging companies and recreation groups
have been trying to delay or change the Clinton's roadless plan,
claiming it was crafted illegally. They say it would block access
to public land and increase fire risk because without roads it is
harder to thin forests and fight fires.

<HEADLINE> UN Troop Contributors Seek Support  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan called Friday
for a beefed-up force of 20,500 U.N. peacekeepers to help Sierra
Leone's government regain control of the country from rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to counter the rebel Revolutionary United Front,
the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution earlier this
month calling for an increase in the 13,000-member force and
spelling out ''priority tasks'' for its success.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. troops are now authorized to concentrate on helping the
government extend its authority by deploying at key strategic
locations and ''by responding robustly to any hostile actions or
threats of ... force.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the council Friday, Annan said he believes the
''priority tasks'' can largely be achieved under the current U.N.
mandate, provided the U.N. mission receives the necessary resources
and support from member states.
</P>
<P>
   He called for strengthening the force to 20,500 peacekeepers,
including 260 military observers, and for extending the mission's
mandate, which expires on Sept. 8, for another six months. He also
urged countries to provide the additional troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is scheduled to meet Monday to consider the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   RUF rebels reignited Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war in May
by seizing about 500 U.N. peacekeepers and keeping 233 others
surrounded for 2&AMP;frac12; months, severely embarrassing the United Nations
and prompting a reassessment of the U.N. mission, known as UNAMSIL.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Annan said the rebels continue to control large
parts of the country and the threat they pose to government forces,
U.N. peacekeepers and the general population ''should not be
underestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUF is believed to have a strength of several thousand
fighters. It is relatively well-equipped and, in spite of divisions
between some groups, maintains a relatively-well established system
of command and control,'' the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
   The additional troops will enable the U.N. force to strengthen
its presence, first with two infantry battalions deploying at key
locations in eastern and western Sierra Leone, and then gradually
eastward with three additional battalions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a future time, Annan said, the force may be required to
deploy to other key areas not under government control, including
the main diamond producing areas. He did not say whether additional
troops would be required at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Annan invited top military officers from the nine countries
contributing troops to the current force to a meeting Wednesday in
New York. Most countries stressed that their soldiers could not be
expected to take part in ''a peace-enforcement operation,'' which
would be tantamount to going to war against the rebels, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan stressed the mission's peacekeeping role, but said ''it
should be made clear to all hostile armed groups that UNAMSIL,
while fully committed to its peacekeeping objectives, has the means
and determination to use force when attacked or challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   He also urged the international community to support the mission
and help promote a political solution in the war-battered country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is imperative that the international community continues to
bring economic and political as well as military pressure to bear
on the RUF and other hostile groups and urge them to commit
themselves fully to the peace process,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the most urgent task was to restructure the force,
strengthen its headquarters, fully equip its infantry battalions,
and strengthen deployment at areas near rebel positions.

<P>
	   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) - The 16-year-old boy accused of
bludgeoning a female classmate to death has pleaded innocent to
second-degree murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua J. Horein is accused of intentionally taking the life of
15-yaer-old Amber J. Brockway.
</P>
<P>
   Brockway's body was found Aug. 7, on the second floor of an
abandoned coal yard building in a wooded area in this village 66
miles southeast of Rochester. An autopsy indicated she died
immediately after being struck several times in the head with a
blunt object.
</P>
<P>
   No motive was given for the murder, which police said happened
Aug. 5. Investigators said Brockway and Horein were friends and
both attended Watkins Glen High School.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GOOSE BAY, Newfoundland (AP) -- Smoke inside an American Airlines
Boeing 767 carrying 172 people caused the plane to make an
unscheduled landing Friday at a Newfoundland airport. There were no
reports of any injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, en route from London to New York, landed safely
about 5:30 p.m., said Larry Pittman, manager of the Goose Bay
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pilot reported smoke in the cockpit,'' Pittman said. ''He
made a precautionary landing and everything is okay now.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pittman, the pilot reported the smoke about an hour
before the plane landed. A statement from the airline said an
unspecified electrical problem caused ''some smoke in the passenger
cabin.'' It wasn't immediately clear why there was a descrepancy on
the location of the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said Flight 131 had 160 passengers and 12 crew
members aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said another Boeing 767 would be sent to Goose Bay
to pick up the passengers, and the original plane would be
inspected before being returning to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Goose Bay, about 500 miles north of Halifax in the Labrador
region of Newfoundland in northeast Canada, is the location of one
of the eastern Canadian airports commonly used for unscheduled or
emergency landings by trans-Atlantic flights.
</P>
<P>
   Planes experiencing technical difficulties or in some cases,
needing to remove unruly passengers, often make unscheduled stops
in eastern Canada before or after crossing the Atlantic Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Senators Seek Stricter Gift Rules  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upset over the corporate-sponsored bashes at
the national party conventions earlier this month, two Senate
Democrats want to make future parties off-limits to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin asked the Senate Ethics Committee on Friday to tighten
the rules against accepting gifts and meals from special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers currently can accept meals or gifts valued at $50 or
less, with no more than $100 from a single source. But the rules,
tightened in 1995, do not apply to conventions and other ''widely
attended events.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone and Feingold, who decried the corporate bashes from an
alternative gathering held down the street from the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles, said the ethics committee
should remove the exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''To allow members to attend such events, which are essentially
gifts with values greater than the current cap, plainly conflicts
with the spirit of the rule, and should not be allowed within its
letter,'' the two senators wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone, who helped draft the 1995 gift ban, said he and
Feingold will seek a change in the law if the ethics committee does
not change its interpretation. The exemption for ''widely attended
events'' was aimed at meetings with constituents, not parties throw
by corporations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think we're talking about a very different creature here
in Los Angeles, or with the Republicans in Philadelphia,''
Wellstone said. ''There was no official function that senators were
serving.''
</P>
<P>
   In both cities, dozens of corporations and trade groups
sponsored parties honoring lawmakers who sat on the committees that
oversaw their issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic and Republican conventions are perfect examples
of how the current campaign finance system works -- senators are
showered with gifts at lavish parties hosted by the same wealthy
interests with business before the Congress,'' said Feingold, the
co-sponsor of legislation to change the way campaigns are funded.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said he doesn't expect a very good reception from
fellow lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be difficult,'' he said. ''Some people in the House
and Senate will interpret it as bashing. But the reason for the
gift ban is it's not appropriate for us to receive gifts from
people who come before us. It's a violation of the legislation we
passed.''

<HEADLINE> Charity Executive Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLEY GILLESPIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A former American Cancer Society executive
pleaded guilty Friday to embezzling nearly $8 million from the
charity, using the money to pay for an addition at his home and
landscaping that included 35 Aristocrat pear trees.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Wiant, 35, earlier had agreed to admit to bank fraud,
money laundering, mail fraud and illegal use of a credit card in
the thefts that began in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have extremely deep regret for my action as well as the
damage I have done to the American Cancer Society,'' he said in a
statement. ''I make no excuses for my actions and accept all
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiant smiled at his wife, Kathy, who was seated in the front
row, after U.S. District Judge Joseph Kinneary accepted the plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   She turned him in to authorities after he called her in June to
tell her he had stolen $6.9 million from the charity by
transferring it to a bank in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the outcome of Daniel's sentencing, I will continue
to love and support my husband and eagerly await his return home,''
Mrs. Wiant said after the court session.
</P>
<P>
   No sentencing date was set for Wiant, who remains in custody.
</P>
<P>
   The maximum sentence possible would be 30 years in prison and
about a $1 million fine. U.S. Attorney Sharon Zealey said
prosecutors will argue for the stiffest term available under
sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''His primary victim is an organization that affects a lot of
people,'' Zealey said. ''Eight million dollars would go a long way
for cancer victims.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea agreement did not call for a specific sentence, but
defense attorney Victor Merullo had estimated the prison term at
five to nine years, based on federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say that beginning in April 1997, Wiant began
stealing from Cancer Society accounts what would amount to a total
of about $7.9 million. He was chief administrative officer for six
years at the society's Ohio division.
</P>
<P>
   But they say they did not discover any money was missing until
this May after Wiant secretly transferred $6.9 million from the
Cancer Society to a bank in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Wiant fled to Switzerland and Austria on June 2, but returned to
the United States and surrendered a week later after learning the
money had been frozen. The money sent to Austria eventually was
returned, but more than $900,000 has not been recovered,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Wiant set up five fake businesses that actually
were personal checking accounts and wrote Cancer Society checks
totaling about $650,000 to them as fake consulting expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Wiant used some of the money to pay for an addition to his home,
the trees for his yard, two all-terrain vehicles and to rent an
apartment, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''For almost 20 years Wiant has been preying on organizations
like ours. Any sentence is too good for him,'' said Don McClure,
chief executive of the Ohio charity. ''They should not only throw
the book at him, they should throw the whole library.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say an unindicted accomplice, identified
only as ''X,'' lived in the apartment for several months and opened
a checking account in the name of a fictitious business for Wiant.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Stuart Benis said that he is fairly certain a client of
his, former Cancer Society employee Debbie Cummings, is ''X.''
Benis said Wiant offered Cummings, his administrative assistant,
use of the apartment after she filed for a divorce and she was
unaware it was paid for with society funds.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings quit the society in May.

<HEADLINE> Greece Calls Wildfire Emergency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Wildfires raging across Greece killed five
more people Friday and prompted a declaration of a state of
emergency in the south as civilian volunteers joined exhausted
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in the Balkans and on the French island of Corsica
battled smaller fires feeding on brush and forest parched by days
of scorching heat in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was eased Friday by temperatures falling back within
more normal readings -- although still hovering around a brutal 99
degrees in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by gale-force winds, fires roared through parched woodlands
and threatened villages across Greece from the Albanian border to
the southern Arcadia province, where a state of emergency was
declared.
</P>
<P>
   The burned bodies of five women were found in three mountainous
villages close to the northern village of Aghia Marina where an
elderly couple was burned to death on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That blaze, which started in Albania, had a front about 25 miles
long.
</P>
<P>
   Following an international appeal, Israel said it was sending
two helicopters, a cargo plane, and 60 members of a support crew to
help stamp out the fires in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring countries were unable to help because they were
struggling with their own brush fires, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In Arcadia, more than 500 firefighters, 100 fire trucks, eight
airplanes and two helicopters battled a vast blaze near the town of
Megalopolis, about 90 miles southwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested an Arcadian farmer on charges he began one of
the fires to turn a forested area into grazing land for his sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Hot winds blowing out of northern Africa hindered firefighters
in Corsica as they battled flames that have consumed 24,000 acres
since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria sent soldiers to join firefighters, forest guards and
volunteers against flames that had erupted in 74 spots across the
country since Thursday, the state BTA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Italy, authorities said a 3.5-mile stretch of the
spectacular Amalfi coast drive would be closed at least through
Sunday as crews mopped up a wildfire and dealt with a landslide.

Boeing 767 Makes Emergency Landing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   GOOSE BAY, Newfoundland (AP) -- Smoke inside an American Airlines Boeing 767
carrying 172 people caused the plane to make an unscheduled landing today at a
Newfoundland airport. No injures were reported. The flight, en route from London
to New York, landed safely about 5:30 p.m., said Larry Pittman, manager of the
Goose Bay Airport. ''The pilot reported smoke in the cockpit,'' Pittman said.
''He made a precautionary landing and everything is okay now. A statement from
the airline said an unspecified electrical problem caused ''some smoke.''

Boeing Elevators Under Scrutiny
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators today ordered U.S. airlines to inspect
the elevator assemblies on Boeing 767 airliners for damaged controls. Egyptian
officials have pointed to possible tail control problems in the still unsolved
crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, a Boeing 767, last Oct. 31 killing all 217 aboard.
But in announcing that it was ordering the inspections, the Federal Aviation
Administration said it has received no factual information that the problem is
related to the EgyptAir accident.

NHTSA Considers Greater Tire Recall
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires may be expanded
if an investigation by federal regulators finds more widespread defects. Sue
Bailey, who took over Monday as chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, would not discuss specifics of the investigation but said, ''If
we feel there is a defect affecting safety, we will issue a recall.'' Congress
also is getting involved. Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who chairs the House Commerce
Committee, said he would send four committee aides to Dearborn, Mich., to meet
with Ford Motor Co. officials and review company documents related to the
recall.

Navy Faces Tailhook Allegation
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just when the Navy had restored ties to the Tailhook
Association of naval aviators, it is facing a new allegation of ''inappropriate
conduct'' by service members attending a Tailhook convention in Nevada last
week. Though much less sensational than the 1991 Tailhook sex scandal that shook
the Navy at its highest levels, the latest allegation has triggered a probe by
the Navy's inspector general. A man reported that he and his wife were in a
crowded hotel hallway and when the man asked the people -- apparently service
members -- to make room for the couple to pass, ''inappropriate comments'' were
made. The man also reported that someone made inappropriate physical contact
with his wife.

House GOP Urges Campaign Frugality
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of House Republican fund raising is urging GOP
lawmakers to save their campaign treasuries for the fall, not drain them to
respond to Democratic ads. ''The most important thing right now is for you to be
frugal with your campaign resources, resources that you will need to control
October,'' Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, wrote House Republicans. Though it leads in fund
raising, the GOP committee has less money in the bank than its Democratic
counterpart, which launched an aggressive early ad campaign. The House
Republican committee is running fewer ads so far.

Anti-Semitic Note Posted on Campaign Office
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICO, Calif. (AP) -- Someone scrawled an anti-Semitic message in the local
Gore-Lieberman campaign headquarters, a Democratic Party activist says. Bob Ray,
president of the Democratic Action Club, said he arrived at the office yesterday
and found ''No Jew in the White House'' had been written in ink in large letters
across two large erasable boards and a planning calendar. Police Lt. Mike
Simpson said investigators were told a campaign worker left the office unlocked
Wednesday night, and there were no suspects.

Tiger Woods Leads NEC Invitational
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- In a performance even more dominant than his
record-setting victories in the last three majors, Tiger Woods tied the course
record today with a 61 in the NEC Invitational and set a standard on the PGA
Tour with a 36-hole score of 125. Woods pumped his fist and smiled when his
6-foot par putt on the 18th at Firestone Country Club dropped in the hole, as if
he were aware his 9-under 61 tied the course record set by Jose Maria Olazabal
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Cops Block Suu Kyi Trip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was
stopped by police from traveling outside the capital and was
stranded on the city's outskirts Friday, her car blocked by two
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   It was Suu Kyi's first attempt to leave Yangon in two years. In
similar standoffs with the military in 1998, she remained in her
car for nearly six days on one occasion and another time for 13
days.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner's National League for
Democracy party said in a statement that her being stopped from
traveling by Myanmar's military government was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The military government said she was stopped for her own
protection. ''Due to threats of violence by armed insurgent
separatist forces, travel by prominent persons to some parts of the
country is at present inadvisable,'' a government statement said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Another government statement released late Friday night said Suu
Kyi and her travel companions ''continue to rest'' in the Yangon
suburb where they were stopped. It said ''the local authorities
make every effort to ensure their comfort and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Security problems have rarely been reported in Kungyangon, 30
miles south of Yangon, where Suu Kyi was planning to go for party
organizational work when her car was stopped Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi crossed the Yangon river in a ferry and boarded a Toyota
car with her party's Vice Chairman Tin Oo and another senior party
official, the government statement said. It said the car was
stopped by police and she was asked to return to Yangon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of her National League for Democracy confirmed the
account.
</P>
<P>
   Both the United States and Britain deplored the military's
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. condemns this abridgment of Aung San Suu Kyi's right
to freedom of movement and her right to visit whomever she
chooses,'' State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To restrict leaders of a democratic political party from
moving around the country is a denial of fundamental human and
political rights,'' Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's virtual detention and her refusal to back down was her
latest clash of will with the military government, which has ruled
this Southeast Asian nation, also known as Burma, with an iron fist
since 1988 after crushing a pro-democracy uprising she helped lead.
</P>
<P>
   A year after that she was put under house arrest. The order was
lifted in 1995 but her movements have remained restricted. The
government also refuses to honor the results of the 1990 general
elections in which her party won a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to leave Yangon four times in 1998 but was stopped by
the military.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when stopped on a trip to the Irrawaddy Delta town of
Pathein, she remained in her car for nearly six days in protest.
When police brought her back to Yangon, she said the treatment
constituted ''being kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth occasion when stopped, Suu Kyi stayed in her car
for 13 days before returning home voluntarily on her doctor's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the National League for Democracy requested that
party members and local residents of Dala suburb, where her car was
stuck, provide food and water to Suu Kyi and others.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's car and her supporters' van were moved to a small lane
off the main road and blocked from traveling further by two trucks
parked on both ends of the street, a witness said.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen uniformed policemen and several plainclothes
agents were at the scene, and an ambulance was nearby, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness said the government people brought food from a
restaurant for Suu Kyi, but she refused to eat it, preferring the
guava and other fruit given by local residents.

<HEADLINE> Couple gets probation for stealing from sick daughter's fund  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LYONS, N.Y. (AP) - A couple who set up a fund to help their sick
daughter will spend three years on probation after admitting they
stole thousands of donated dollars on things like a car and a
motorcycle with a sidecar.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their plea, Carol J. Frey and Michael Frey will keep
the charitable account set up for their daughter, 8-year-old
Jessica, but must give up control to their lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Frey suffers from a heart defect and eventually will
need a double lung transplant.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was charged with third-degree grand larceny and
first-degree scheme to defraud after family members and neighbors
noticed new things around the house like a used Honda motorcycle
with sidecar for $2,800 and a used car for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Freys led donors to believe the Jessica Frey Lung Transplant
Assistance fund would be used for travel expenses and to cover
household bills when it came time for Jessica's transplant
operation out of state.
</P>
<P>
   The Freys were accused of misusing more than $3,000 of the
$22,000 raised so far. They pleaded guilty to petty larceny and
were sentenced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They not only took money from everybody, but they took their
trust,'' said Frey's younger sister, Jenny Frey. ''They played
everybody for a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members though the punishment should have been harsher
but Michael Frey maintained he and his wife had done nothing wrong,
using the money on things to make their daughter happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything I did, I did for my family,'' said Frey. ''The
point is quality of life, not quantity of life - we know we are
going to outlive her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is 32 miles southeast of Rochester.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Seizes More Farms  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The government named another 509
white-owned farms Friday it plans to confiscate for redistribution
to landless blacks, bringing to 1,542 the number it has targeted
under a hastened land seizure program.
</P>
<P>
   Farm leaders warn the announcement casts more doubt over the
viability of commercial farming in Zimbabwe's already ailing
agriculture-based economy.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the targeted farms have until Sept. 17 to lodge
objections to the orders, Agriculture Minister Joseph Made, said in
an announcement published Friday in the state-controled Herald
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Violence on farms and in townships left 31 people dead ahead of
June parliamentary elections. Armed ruling party militants began
occupying the first of 1,600 white-owned farms in February,
demanding they be divided up among landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe has supported the occupations as a
justified protest against inequities in land distribution in a
country where 4,000 whites own one-third of the fertile farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said it will seize 3,000 white farms totaling
about 12 million acres, but has failed to detail all the properties
that will be seized. Many of the farms will be taken before
seasonal rains begin around November, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The new list includes land owned by a Roman Catholic church
mission outside Harare, Anglican church property north of the
capital, which features a top school for poor teenage girls,
several white-owned nature preserves and part of a sugar plantation
partly owned by South Africa's Anglo-American Corp.
</P>
<P>
   David Hasluck, director of the Commercial Farmers Union, said
the new seizure notices did not comply with land reform laws that
say farms being redistributed must be carved up by surveyors and
provided with roads and materials to keep them productive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no carefully thought out resettlement program that
lawful process requires,'' he said. ''They are just listing farms
to destroy them.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has admitted its land redistribution program is
broke. The state District Development Fund, whose trucks were to be
used to transport landless blacks to nationalized farms, said on
Aug. 10 that most of its vehicles were out of commission because of
shortages of spare parts and tires and misuse and corruption by
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The state Agricultural Rural Development Authority, intended to
provide seeds and tools, said it too was critically short of
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't just give people pieces of land and nothing else.
There are no resources to kick start them,'' Hasluck said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks announced earlier this month they had frozen loans to
farmers who defaulted on their repayments during production
disruptions caused by the squatters and to farmers whose properties
had been listed for seizure. Farmers require the annual loans to
buy the seeds, fertilizer and equipment necessary to plant and
harvest their crops.
</P>
<P>
   Hasluck said the owners of only about one-third of the listed
farms had enough money to carry on with even reduced production
without loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Others will simply not be able to farm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is suffering its worst economic crisis since
independence in 1980. Inflation has soared to a record 70 percent,
unemployment reached 50 percent this year and health and education
services have declined sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco earned $220 million last year and the farmers union has
predicted next year's crops of tobacco and corn, the main staple
food, could be reduced by as much a 40 percent because of the
occupations and uncertainty over the seizures.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Military Detains US Ship  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Yugoslav military personnel armed with machine
guns boarded a U.S. vessel carrying humanitarian food supplies in
the Adriatic last weekend and allowed the ship to leave after
payment of a $3,200 fee, U.S. government and shipping sources said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were moments of high tension during the incident, said
State Department spokesman Philip Reeker.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of harassment could impede future humanitarian
shipments'' in the region, he said. The shipment, consisting of
grain, was earmarked for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The vessel, known as the Delaware Bay, was seized in Yugoslav
territorial waters off the coast of Montenegro, the smaller of the
two republics that make up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the incident was first reported by the newsletter of the
American Maritime Congress, which said that the vessel also was
carrying military cargo for Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker had no comment on that allegation but other officials
said it is not uncommon for Farrell Lines, which chartered the
ship, to make such deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at a time of growing U.S. concern about
the intentions of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic toward
Montenegro, which has a pro-western government and whose leaders
have made no secret of their desire for independence. Some U.S.
officials believe Milosevic may be poised for a military move
against the province.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the Yugoslavs demanded that the ship be taken to a
military port, that communications be shut down, and that the bill
of lading and crew list be turned over.
</P>
<P>
   The ship master handed over the crew list but refused to shut
down communications, Reeker said. It was not clear whether the bill
of lading was turned over.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said Yugoslav authorities allowed the ship to dock at the
Montenegrin port of Bar, the destination of the vessel. He said the
cargo was loaded off the ship after the Yugoslavs demanded and
received payment of a fee.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter said Farrell Lines paid $3,200. The vessel was
then allowed to leave after a stay of four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Under international law, the Yugoslavs can ask for a crew list
and a bill of lading but cannot demand a communications shutdown to
or to ask that the vessel be taken to a military port, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newsletter, the seven or so Yugoslav military
personnel who boarded the ship believed that the vessel had
off-loaded ammunition and arms in Albania. Reeker did not address
that issue but the newsletter said the allegation was false.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence H. O'Toole, president of the Maritime Engineers'
Beneficial Association, wrote President Clinton, saying the
incident threatened the safety of the ship's crew and ''calls for a
swift and firm'' response.
</P>
<P>
   Reeker said the Yugoslav government is aware of the U.S.
attitude toward such ''provocative and disruptive actions.'' He
said the actions were inconsistent with a U.N. Security Council
resolution requiring Yugoslavia to allow unimpeded access to Kosovo
for humanitarian relief operations.

<HEADLINE> Looking for N.Y. molester, police turn up N.J. suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WALDEN, N.Y. (AP) - They got the wrong guy but it turned out to
be the right guy, just in the wrong place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Gregory R. Miller's mug on the television show
''America's Most Wanted,'' police busted into the apartment where
they thought Miller was living, here about 65 miles north of New
York City. Miller hadn't been seen since April 1998 when he jumped
bail after he was charged with sexually abusing two young girls.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't Miller they found. Instead, Robert Cornwell turned
out to be the arrest du jour, wanted in New Jersey on charges of
violating his probation and possessing cocaine and handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds bizarre, but that's the way it happened,'' said
Walden police officer Ken Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell has waived extradition and turned himself in to New
Jersey police.
</P>
<P>
   Police hope a recently issued federal warrant will soon lead to
Miller's arrest.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Probe Gulf Air Crash  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- As Gulf Air Flight 072 approached Bahrain
International Airport for a night landing, pilot Ihsan Shakeeb
calmly requested a ''go around'' from air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Shakeeb, an experienced pilot with more than 6,800 flying hours,
circled Bahrain International Airport once, then aborted his
landing attempt without explanation, according to Gulf Air
officials on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the Airbus 320 -- and its 143 passengers and crew
-- disappeared from the radar. It had nose-dived into shallow waters
off the north of Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. air accident experts were asked Friday to lead an
investigation that will try to determine what happened between
Shakeeb's aborting the landing Wednesday and the plane's crashing
into the sea 60 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were trying to work out why Shakeeb broke off his
attempt to land, and why the plane crashed miles from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air's chief pilot, Hameed Ali, said Friday that
investigators would examine both the speed and altitude of
Shakeeb's aborted landing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important and I may add that intracockpit
communications is even more important. We have not listened to that
yet,'' Ali told a packed press conference.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ali stressed, referring to the pilot, ''we have spotted no
error in his approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali refused to speculate on a possible cause of the crash, but
emphasized that Shakeeb was an experienced crew member with some
6,856 hours of flying time. The minimum qualifying time for a Gulf
Air pilot is 4,000 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Three investigators from the U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board flew into Manama on Friday evening, a civil aviation
authority spokesman said. They were whisked to a meeting with
Bahraini officials and were expected to start their inquiry
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the U.S. and Bahraini teams are expected to meet
with six French government experts and a representative of Airbus
Industries. They too were to have a key role in determining the
cause of the crash. Six Airbus 320s have crashed in the last 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the plane's ''black boxes'' -- the flight data and voice
cockpit recorders -- are to be sent to the United States for
analysis, civil aviation undersecretary Ibrahim Abdulla Al-Hamer
said. An official estimated it could be weeks before the data was
available.
</P>
<P>
   As Bahraini flags fluttered at half-staff Friday, friends and
relatives turned not to investigators, but to the island's mosques
for answers.
</P>
<P>
   At the central Grand Mosque, three unidentified bodies wrapped
in cloth, one belonging to a small child, lay before the faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Bahraini Prime Minister Sheik Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa and
other top officials stood side-by-side with 2,000 Muslims praying
for the victims, 36 of whom were children.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners raised a photo placard of Shakeeb at a Shiite Muslim
cemetery where the pilot's body was buried Friday. Women dressed in
black chadors prayed around the grave as Shakeeb's father,
Ehtisham, sat on a wooden bench receiving condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel dead right now,'' said Abdullah Majeed, a Gulf Air
sales executive, who described Shakeeb as a cheerful friend.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air has offered professional counseling to the bereaved. It
has also pledged $25,000 to each family who lost a relative in the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives sought comfort from religious leaders and counselors
at a local hotel as they identified their loved ones from
photographs of remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to see the pictures,'' said Nadr
al-Khawaja, a Bahraini whose cousin, her husband and their
9-month-old baby son were killed. ''It's very hard for the parents
-- it's torture.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Bahrain was planning a private memorial
service Saturday for a diplomatic courier, Seth Foti, 31, who went
down with the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Foti, a native of Browntown, Va., joined the diplomatic courier
service 14 months ago. Married for three months, he was the sixth
courier to die in a crash and the first since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of searching Friday, U.S. Navy divers found the
pouches of classified information that Foti was carrying, said
Cmdr. Jeff Gradeck, spokesman for the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Salvaging continued at the crash site. Dozens of divers scoured
the sandy seabed in search of bits of wing and fuselage. The parts
were brought to an airport hangar for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air has said 135 passengers and eight crew members were on
board. Sixty-three passengers were Egyptian, 34 Bahraini, 12 Saudi
Arabian, nine Palestinian, six from the United Arab Emirates, three
Chinese, two British and one each from Canada, Oman, Kuwait, Sudan,
Australia and the United States. Two crew members were Bahrainis
and one each from Oman, the Philippines, Poland, India, Morocco and
Egypt.

<HEADLINE> PETA says billboard company dumping its Giuliani ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) - It's one thing to criticize milk in Wisconsin.
It's apparently another to use New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said a Wisconsin
advertising company decided Friday to take down two PETA billboards
that have a picture of Giuliani sporting a milk mustache and ask,
''Got prostate cancer?''
</P>
<P>
   PETA spokesman Bruce Friedrich said the animal rights group
received a fax Friday afternoon saying the company would take down
the ads because PETA had not received Giuliani's permission to use
his likeness in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems that in addition to being linked to obesity, heart
disease, cancer, stroke and osteoporosis, in Wisconsin dairy
products also destroy your backbone,'' Friedrich said.
</P>
<P>
   PETA designed the campaign to publicize what it claims is a link
between dairy products and prostate cancer, which Giuliani has.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards went up Wednesday in Appleton and Oshkosh; a
third had been planned in Fond du Lac.
</P>
<P>
   French Advertising in Fond du Lac put up the billboards. There
was no answer when The Associated Press called the firm for comment
late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Friedrich said a Giuliani billboard was still up outside of
Lancaster, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tasteless and inappropriate to exploit my illness and
also takes advantage of my position as the mayor for advertising
purposes,'' Giuliani said Thursday. ''The message they're trying to
deliver just makes sense in their own zealous, out-of-control
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was considering suing PETA because the
organization was used his image in an advertisement without his
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin farm leaders attacked the ads as misleading and
insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   A PETA ad campaign that urged college students to drink beer
instead of milk was pulled last spring because of objections by
Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the advertising company has risen above the ridiculous
by pulling the ads,'' said Tom Thieding, spokesman for the
Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards, he said, amounted to ''exploiting an individual
who's got health problems that aren't linked to dairy
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that consumers are more savvy than to fall for that
kind of exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Wendorf Boyke, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Milk
Marketing Board, had described the billboards as PETA's ''typical
insensitive way of misleading the public for their own gain.''
</P>
<P>
   She said research points to dairy products helping fight high
blood pressure, colon cancer and osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Harvard School of Public Health in April raised
the possibility that consuming dairy products may increase the risk
of prostate cancer. But the study also said the case was far from
settled and recommended further study of calcium's effects on
health.

Clinton Bound for Africa
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has left on a weekend trip to Africa to
give Nigeria's democracy a boost and encourage peace in Burundi. Clinton left by
plane shortly after the White House said he is adding a Monday stop in Cairo to
meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ''The two leaders will discuss the
latest developments in the Middle East peace process,'' a White House
spokeswoman said. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was meeting with Egyptian
officials Saturday in Alexandria, Egypt.

Greece Declares Fire Emergency
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Wildfires raging across Greece killed five more people
Friday and prompted a declaration of a state of emergency in the south as
civilian volunteers joined exhausted firefighters. Firefighters in the Balkans
and on the French island of Corsica battled smaller fires feeding on brush and
forest parched by days of scorching heat in southern Europe. Following an
international appeal, Israel said it was sending two helicopters, a cargo plane,
and 60 members of a support crew to help stamp out the fires in Greece.
Neighboring countries were unable to help because they were struggling with
their own brush fires.

American Priest Found Slain in Moscow
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Police found the body of a U.S. Episcopal priest who
apparently was stabbed to death in his apartment in southwest Moscow, an
official said Friday. A U.S. Embassy official identified the man as the Rev.
Steve Charles Malcom, 49. Russian authorities said Malcom had died from several
stab wounds and that he had been dead for about six days before police found his
body Thursday. Relatives said living and working in Russia was a lifelong dream
for the priest, who left his work at the St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Nebraska
City, Neb., in 1998 to teach English in Russia. Malcom had lived in Moscow for
several years.

Nader Condemns Oregon's Suicide Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- While counting on Oregon voters to give a big boost to
his third-party bid for the presidency, Ralph Nader today condemned the state's
first-in-the-nation assisted suicide law. Hours before appearing at a rally that
backers hoped would be his biggest campaign event of the year, the Green Party
candidate told reporters he thinks Oregon voters made a mistake by twice
endorsing a law that allows doctors to prescribe lethal doses of drugs to the
terminally ill. ''It's cruel to people who would otherwise not want to die if
they had adequate pain relief,'' Nader said.

NHTSA Tire Probe Called Late
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first lawsuits alleging some Bridgestone/Firestone
Inc. truck tires suddenly lost their tread were filed nearly a decade ago, but
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn't start investigating
until May. And that was nearly a year after Ford Motor Co. replaced Firestone
tires on its vehicles in parts of Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.
Critics say the case illustrates a fundamental problem with the agency
responsible for auto safety: NHTSA largely depends on manufacturers to police
themselves and notify it when problems are uncovered.

False Report Tumbles Tech Stock
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A bogus Internet news release picked up by financial news
agencies sent a network equipment maker's stock plunging more than 60 percent
today, but the shares recovered after the company refuted the reports. Shares of
Emulex tumbled as low as $43 from their previous close of $113.063 after false
news circulated that the California-based company was restating its earnings,
that its CEO had quit and that it was under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The false reports, originating on Internet Wire, are under
investigation.

On the NYSE, losers slightly led gainers. The Nasdaq was down 10.60 at 4,042.68

Tiger Woods Leads NEC Invitational

   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- In a performance even more dominant than his
record-setting victories in the last three majors, Tiger Woods tied the course
record today with a 61 in the NEC Invitational and set a standard on the PGA
Tour with a 36-hole score of 125. Woods pumped his fist and smiled when his
6-foot par putt on the 18th at Firestone Country Club dropped in the hole, as if
he were aware his 9-under 61 tied the course record set by Jose Maria Olazabal
in 1990.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Releases Letter on Bomb  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan released
a controversial letter Friday which assured Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi that a trial of two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of
a Pan Am jetliner would not ''be used to undermine the Libyan
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense team for the two Libyans, who have been on trial in
the Netherlands since May 3, asked British authorities to release
the Feb. 17, 1999 letter from Annan to Gadhafi detailing the terms
of a trial under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   Libya accepted the terms and handed over the two suspects seven
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's letter was not made public at the time, but U.S.
officials informed some family members of the victims that Gadhafi
was told there would be ''no attempt to undermine the Libyan
regime'' as a result of information obtained from questioning the
two suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Families of some of the 270 people killed in the crash over
Lockerbie, Scotland, responded angrily that Gadhafi was being
offered too sweet a deal -- and claimed the assurance in the letter
meant the investigation would not go beyond the two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
   The letter released Friday actually states that ''the two
persons will not be used to undermine the Libyan regime.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time the letter was sent, the secretary-general was a key
intermediary in the international effort to get Libya to hand over
the two suspects for trial, which was to be following by a
suspension of U.N. sanctions against the Gadhafi government.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Corell, the U.N. undersecretary-general for legal affairs,
stressed at a news conference Friday that the clarifications about
the trial in the letter were provided by British authorities, and
that the United States and Britain signed off on its contents.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked repeatedly how important the sentence about not
undermining the regime was to the handing over of the two suspects,
and replied that he didn't know. ''The secretary-general was not
involved in negotiating this text at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the United States have been pushing for the letter
to be made public because speculation about its contents had upset
the families, and they welcomed the secretary-general's decision to
release it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary-general's decision should put an end to any
speculation that a 'secret deal' was made concerning the turnover
of the suspects in the Pan Am 103 case,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have long pushed for the letter's release, primarily
because we take seriously the sensitivities of the families of the
Pan Am 103 victims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's top legal official has said repeatedly that he
considers it his duty to follow any evidence that comes to light,
and that nothing in this correspondence in any way inhibits him in
prosecuting the crime, a point that British officials reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the letter was written, British officials said the
Libyans were concerned that Britain and the United States wanted to
use a trial to undermine Gadhafi's regime.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was included ''to make clear that the trial would
be an entirely independent legal process, not subject to any
political pressure by any government,'' a British official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The British stressed that the sentence did not say prosecution
of any other individuals was off limits: it said only that
undermining the Libyan regime is not the objective of the trial.

<HEADLINE> Furyk Goes With His Putting Stroke  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Jim Furyk is easily recognized on the PGA
Tour as the guy with the loopy swing. This week at Firestone
Country, his putting stroke also stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to overcome a poor patch of putting, Furyk is
gripping the club so low that his hands are nearly parallel with
his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed last week with my dad's help that I was lining it up
a little too far to the right,'' Furyk said after a 1-under 69 on
Friday while paired with Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   His goal with the unusual posture is to get his arms hanging
more loosely. It appeared to be working. Through two rounds, Furyk
has taken only 50 putts, second in the tournament to Woods and
Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to figure out what's wrong,'' Furyk said. ''The
hard part is trying to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ALL ALONE: With the field reduced to 37 players after Vijay
Singh's late decision to withdraw, one player will go off by
himself each day. On Friday, that duty fell to Ireland's Padraig
Harrington, who got around Firestone in 2 hours, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time I've played on my own in a competitive
round, as an amateur or a professional,'' he said. ''It felt very
strange, but at least there were still some people out there.
Normally, I always learn from the guy I'm playing with. Today, I
was all alone in my little bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't complain about the results -- a 5-under 65, that
moved him into the middle of the pack. His reward? He gets to play
with Jeff Maggert in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TIGER, BEWARE: The only other time Tiger Woods had a 61 on the
PGA Tour was the first round of the 1999 Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up in a tie for seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Cottonwood Valley was giving up plenty of low scores
that day. Paul Goydos had a 62, and Nick Price had a 63 -- while
playing in the same group as Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was pretty cool,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so cool was what happened in the third round, when he hit a
5-iron into the water on the 17th for a quadruple bogey and never
threatened in the final round. Then again, he was tied with Steve
Pate after 36 holes. This time, he leads by seven.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   IN THE MONEY: The three players who had to withdraw from the
NEC Invitational will still receive money, although it won't go in
their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval (back), Steve Elkington (hip) and Vijay Singh
(forearm) will get last-place money of $26,500 to donate to a
charity of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   MONTY MADNESS: Colin Montgomerie will go another year without
winning in America, unless he can make up 15 strokes on Tiger Woods
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the smiles?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Ryder Cup or some majors in the United States,
Montgomerie has heard cheers, not jeers, over the past two weeks.
Some of that has to do with the 20 pounds he has dropped this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Kentucky and Ohio are a far cry from Boston, New
York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crowd reaction this week has been super,'' Montgomerie
said. ''It's a big thrill to have that change. There's a buzz
around the tees and the greens, people saying, 'He's lost weight,
he's looking good.' I have really enjoyed my last six rounds
here.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Nab 15 Smugglers, 1,000 Aliens  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO MONTES
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- An immigration service crackdown focusing on
airports and immigrant ''drophouses'' in Phoenix and Las Vegas has
led to the arrest of 15 suspected smugglers and the capture of more
than 1,000 illegal immigrants, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service agents began
round-the-clock surveillance two weeks ago of Phoenix's Sky Harbor
International Airport and Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport
to counter smuggling networks that use airlines to send immigrants
to the East Coast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, officials have noticed a decline in illegal
immigrants trying to go through both airports and an increase in
the numbers traveling by car through Colorado, said Russell Ahr, an
assistant to the director of the Phoenix INS district.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that's a result of what we're doing here in Phoenix,''
Ahr said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the operation began Aug. 9, INS agents have caught 524
illegal immigrants at Sky Harbor, 690 at McCarran and 238 at eight
drophouses in the Phoenix area. Drophouses are staging areas where
smugglers gather immigrants until they pay to be moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Ahr said most of those caught were Mexicans who have since been
returned to Mexico. About 20 have been kept in the United States as
witnesses against the smugglers, who are in federal custody.
</P>
<P>
   But some human rights groups have complained that the crackdown,
intended to disrupt and dismantle smuggling operations, will not
solve the problem and only increase racial profiling of innocent
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who do you think is going to be targeted in the airports?''
Isabel Garcia, founder of Coalicion de Derechos Humanos, or
Coalition for Human Rights, said earlier this month. ''It's going
to be brown-skinned people who can't speak English very well.
There's just no way they can tell who's undocumented and who's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   INS officials have said the operation will not affect legal
travelers and will focus on patterns of behavior often associated
with migrant smuggling, such as last-minute purchases of a large
number of tickets and late-night flights.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia said she doubts the program will work, adding that
smugglers will always find ways around it.

<HEADLINE> Torre Clarifies Comments on Mendoza  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- New York Yankees manager Joe Torre
clarified his comments on Ramiro Mendoza, saying Friday there was a
chance the reliever would return this season.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Torre said he was not sure whether Mendoza would
pitch again this year. Mendoza has been on the 15-day disabled list
with tendinitis in his right shoulder since July 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''I might have said something like that,'' Torre said before
Friday night's game against the Oakland Athletics. ''That almost
makes it sound like his injury is worse, but he's not hurt any more
than he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I based that statement on the fact he hasn't thrown off a
mound yet and there's only 30 games left,'' he said. ''There's a
chance he'll be back and if he comes back, fine. My mind set is it
will be a bonus if he comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Mendoza's second stint on the DL. He missed 28 games
between June 25 and July 27 with weakness in his right shoulder. He
went back on the DL three days later.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no place for him to rehab by the time he's ready to
pitch,'' Torre said. ''It's a matter of getting him back to where
he needs to be to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Mendoza's return would be a welcome relief to his
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a wild card for us,'' he said. ''He can pitch late or
early. He gives us a lot of flexibility, and he's been successful
at this time of the year.''

<HEADLINE> Lazio: Clinton into ''fear mongering'' and living in ''fantasyland'' </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALTA, N.Y. (AP) - Republican Rick Lazio charged Friday that
Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign ''is built entirely
now on fear mongering, on negative attacks and on ripping our state
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine that Mrs. Clinton is proud of the kind of
campaign she's running right now,'' the congressman from Long
Island told reporters after a visit to a Racemark International
plant in Saratoga County north of Albany that makes floor mats for
automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   He also said her campaign was ''in fantasyland'' because of its
complaints about the tax-cut plan he unveiled Thursday. While he
said it would be worth $776 billion over 10 years, the Clinton camp
said its true cost was $1.24 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's sharpest attack to date on his Democratic rival came
after the first lady's campaign criticized him for having among the
worst disclosure rates for candidates when it comes to reporting
who their donors work for.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick Lazio should come clean with New Yorkers and fully
disclose who his contributors are. What is he hiding?'' said
Clinton campaign spokeswoman Karen Dunn. ''It's not surprising
though - this is the same candidate for Senate who refuses to
release his tax returns despite having promised to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   A report this week from the Washington-based Center for
Responsive Politics showed that in Lazio's filings with the Federal
Election Commission just 68 percent of donors are identified by
occupation or employer as required by FEC regulations. Clinton's
disclosure rate is 93 percent, the center noted.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, according to the center, ranked the third worst Senate
candidate in the nation for disclosure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to track people down all over the
country,'' Lazio said. ''The campaign does its very best.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman called such complaints from the Clinton camp
''the height of hypocrisy'' given that the first lady and President
Clinton ''are raising these enormous bucketloads of soft money that
aren't disclosed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign has benefitted from aggressive soft-money
fund raising in which donors give unlimited amounts of money to
party committees that can then use it to help candidates such as
the first lady. Earlier this month, she and President Clinton
staged just such an event in Hollywood that her aides said raised
more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the Senate campaign in New York has been marked
by a series of ads run by the Clinton campaign and her allies
attacking Lazio's congressional record and his positions in an
attempt to portray him as a right-wing conservative. Lazio has
preferred to present himself as a moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign took exception to Lazio's comments Friday,
saying he started it all first.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although Rick Lazio promised New Yorkers he would run a
positive campaign, he couldn't even get through his announcement
speech without launching personal negative attacks against
Hillary,'' said Clinton spokeswoman Cathie Levine. ''New Yorkers
know that Hillary has been running a positive, issue-oriented race
for over a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has also been under fire for not yet making public his
income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Since he entered the race in mid-May, reporters have been asking
to see Lazio's tax returns and have been repeatedly told they will
get to do so. Lazio has said they will be available before the end
of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's failure to make the tax returns public thus far has left
him facing regular attacks from the Democrats. In recent weeks he
has been dogged by Democratic operatives dressed up as ''Uncle
Sam.'' The ''Tax Man'' character has been demanding the tax returns
and appeared Thursday at the State Fair in Syracuse, walking and
talking not far from Lazio as the congressman from Long Island
strolled around the fair grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's taking long at all. We've only been in the
race for 2&AMP;frac12; months,'' Lazio said Friday, adding that looking at his
tax returns will prove to be ''a very unremarkable experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman also waded into the thorny issue of stem cell
research, saying that while ''stem cell research should continue to
go forward, in general,'' it is important ''the federal government
not incentivize the harvesting of (human) embryos'' for the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the National Institutes of Health issued
guidelines allowing federal funding for research with stem cells
that have been removed from human embryos. The rules forbid
research on the embryo itself, which is prohibited by federal law.
The guidelines have drawn objections from anti-abortion groups and
the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, the first lady attended a rally in New York
City aimed at energizing the city's black voters, a key
constituency in Clinton's campaign for the Senate seat.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Arrested in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An Argentine living in Mexico is the same man
accused of torturing people during Argentina's military
dictatorship, Interpol said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After former Argentine political prisoners identified the
ex-director of Mexico's private National Registry of Motor Vehicles
as their torturer, Interpol detained him Thursday when the airplane
he was flying on stopped briefly in Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they had not decided whether they would
formally arrest Ricardo Miguel Cavallo despite the fact that they
had confirmed he was the same person whom the political prisoners
knew as Miguel Angel Cavallo. The 48-hour detention order expires
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the same person,'' Interpol's Juan Miguel Ponce said at a
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the building, a half dozen protesters held a banner
calling for Cavallo's extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who issued the warrant that kept
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet under house arrest in
London for 16 months, has accused Miguel Angel Cavallo of torture,
terrorism, car theft and forgery.
</P>
<P>
   While admitting he served in Argentina's military, Cavallo
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a judge in Spain issued an arrest warrant for
Cavallo, sending the orders to Interpol and asking the agency to
start extradition proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators in France have asked Mexican
officials to investigate whether Cavallo had anything to do with
the death of several French citizens in Argentina, including two
nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo was serving as director of Mexico's private National
Registry of Motor Vehicles, but the company -- criticized by many in
Mexico for charging too much to register cars -- announced his
replacement after his detention and urged authorities to
investigate the former director's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo's arrest came after five former political prisoners
identified Cavallo as Miguel Angel Cavallo, their torturer at the
infamous Naval Mechanical School detention center. Ponce said
Cavallo used the name Miguel Angel as a false name while in the
army.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, the Spanish judge, is investigating human rights abuses
under the former military dictatorships of Chile and Argentina, and
has brought charges against officials for the deaths of Spaniards
in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   At least 9,000 Argentines vanished during the country's 7-year
military dictatorship, which ended in 1983. Human rights groups put
the figure closer to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Under an Argentine amnesty law, military officials responsible
for human rights violations during the dictatorship cannot be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another historical decision by the Spanish justice,
the same as with Pinochet,'' Carlos Slepoy, a lawyer who is working
with Garzon, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a retired army officer wanted for
questioning in the 1976 disappearance of a French woman during
Argentina's dictatorship was detained in Italy. Jorge Antonio
Olivera is being held in Rome, while officials await word on a
possible French extradition request.

<HEADLINE> Henninger Leads Reno-Tahoe Open  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Brian Henninger matched the course record with
a 9-under-par 63 on Friday to take a one-stroke lead over Peter
Jacobsen and Steve Flesch in the Reno-Tahoe Open.
</P>
<P>
   Henninger's bogey-free round included nine birdies, eight of
those putts from 8 feet or closer. He had a 10-under 134 total.
</P>
<P>
   Notah Begay also shot a 63 last year en route to his victory on
the 7,552-yard Montreux Golf and Country Club, the second longest
course on the PGA Tour behind Castle Pines.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never know when these kinds of rounds are going to show
up,'' said Henninger, 37, who had a second-round 63 en route to a
tie for sixth place in the Western Open last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you get a couple of these a year it's a lot of fun and
today was one of them,'' he said. ''I hit to within 10 to 15 feet
of the pin a lot of the time today.''
</P>
<P>
   Henninger, whose career earnings total $2.5 million, won the
Southern Farm Bureau Classic last year. He's 103rd on the money
list this year with $354,558. The winner's check at Reno is worth
$540,000.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McCarron, who was tied for the lead after the first round
with a 66, chipped in from 40 yards for an eagle on his last hole
Friday for a 70, two strokes off the lead at 8 under along with Bob
May of Las Vegas and Mathew Goggin of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   May, who narrowly lost a playoff to Tiger Woods last week in the
PGA Championship, birdied five holes for a 67 to go with his
opening round 69.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of golf to be played. I feel good about my
position,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   David Toms shot a 65 to pull within three strokes of the lead,
and Spanish star Sergio Garcia rebounded from an even-par opening
round with a 67 to move within striking distance at 5 under.
France's Jean Van de Velde shot a 71 to move to 6 under.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's 12-foot birdie attempt at the 18th lipped 360-degrees
around the hole before missing.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was pretty unlucky,'' Garcia said. ''One shot is a big
difference going into the weekend. But I hit the ball better today
and I putted pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron played at UCLA and Henninger at rival Southern
California, but they recently learned they were born in the same
hospital, Sutter Memorial in Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't that weird?'' said Henninger, who now lives in
Wilsonville, Ore. Their two families were headed to the beach at
nearby Lake Tahoe Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nice round, buddy,'' McCarron told Henninger as he entered the
media tent. ''Are you ready for some jet skis?''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, trying to win his first PGA Tour tournament since
1995, shot a 69 for a 9-under 135 total.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had some good putts for birdies that I didn't make,'' he
said Friday. ''It's a tight leaderboard, which is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Flesch, who has won more than $1 million this year with seven
finishes in the top 10, followed his 67 in the first round with a
68 Friday to join Jacobsen tied in second place. More than a dozen
players were within five strokes of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of guys up there, so it's going to be an
interesting weekend,'' Flesch said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, whose Portland-based company is managing the
tournament, also is a friend of Henninger. They play together out
of the Oregon Golf Club in the Portland area.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pound for pound, Brian may be the best player on Tour. He
weighs as much as my right leg,'' Jacobsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour guide lists Henninger at 5-foot-8, 155 pounds, but
McCarron insisted he is ''135 pounds dripping wet.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, who lives in Sacramento and has family in Reno, has a
hometown gallery that let out a roar when he chipped in for an
eagle at his last hole of the day, the 616-yard, par-5 ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I lipped out a lot of putts, a lot that looked like they were
going in, so I feel I was owed that last one a little bit,'' he
said.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- An immigration service crackdown focusing on airports and

suspected smugglers and the capture of more than 1,000 illegal immigrants,
officials said today. Immigration and Naturalization Service agents began
round-the-clock surveillance two weeks ago at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International

International Team Probes Gulf Air Crash
</SUBHEAD>

   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- As Gulf Air Flight 072 approached Bahrain
International Airport for a landing Wednesday, pilot Ihsan Shakeeb requested a
''go around'' from air traffic controllers. Shakeeb, an experienced pilot,
circled Bahrain International Airport once, then aborted his landing attempt
without explanation, according to Gulf Air officials. Moments later, the Airbus
320 -- and its 143 passengers and crew -- disappeared from the radar and
nose-dived. Air accident experts are try to determine why Shakeeb broke off his
attempt to land, and why the plane crashed miles from the airport. U.S. and
Bahraini teams are expected are meeting with six French government experts and a
representative of Airbus Industries to determine the cause of the crash.

Zimbabwe Seizing More White-Owned Farms

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The government named another 509 white-owned farms
Friday it plans to confiscate for redistribution to landless blacks, bringing to

leaders warn the announcement casts more doubt over the viability of commercial

the targeted farms have until Sept. 17 to lodge objections to the orders,
Agriculture Minister Joseph Made, said in an announcement published Friday in

NHTSA Tire Probe Called Late
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first lawsuits alleging some Bridgestone/Firestone
Inc. truck tires suddenly lost their tread were filed nearly a decade ago, but
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn't start investigating
until May. And that was nearly a year after Ford Motor Co. replaced Firestone
tires on its vehicles in parts of Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.
Critics say the case illustrates a fundamental problem with the agency
responsible for auto safety: NHTSA largely depends on manufacturers to police
themselves and notify it when problems are uncovered.

Economy Grows Despite Slower Spending

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew robustly in the spring even as
consumer spending -- the main engine of growth -- rose at its slowest pace in
three years. Existing-home sales plunged in July hitting their lowest point in
five months as rising mortgage rates turned off prospective buyers. Both
reports, released today, provide further evidence that the Federal Reserve's six
interest-rate increases over the last 14 months are working to slow consumer
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, economists
said.

set by Jose Maria Olazabal in 1990. Only that wasn't the case. ''I didn't want

to hit good, solid shots. I just want to get the 'W.'''

<HEADLINE> WWII Airmen Remains Found in Iceland  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD MIDDLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) -- After battling icy cold and unsettling
tremors on an Icelandic glacier, rescuers reached the bodies of
four British airmen preserved in the ice for almost 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen in time alongside the victims were poignant reminders of
young lives cut short -- a flying jacket, a toothbrush, a birthday
watch.
</P>
<P>
   A team including Britain's Royal Air Force, Iceland's mountain
rescue and coast guard and an American Black Hawk helicopter
reached the crash site this week.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the wreckage, scattered over a 165-feet radius, team
members found the bodies of the men, who died when their Fairey
Battle bomber crashed into a snow-covered mountain in May 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very emotional time for everybody up there,'' said
Nick Barr, the Royal Air Force expedition leader. ''To hear the
shuddering of the glacier and to see the wreckage made you feel
that there, but for the grace of God, go I. There was a feeling of
helplessness in that four men had died there.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service, attended by relatives of the men, will be
held Sunday at the Fossfogur Commonwealth war grave cemetery in
Reykjavik, where the four are to be buried.
</P>
<P>
   The wreckage was revealed only last year after unusually warm
weather melted some of the ice on the glacial peak between
Eyjafjordur fjord and Oxnadalur in northern Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-man rescue party endured temperatures of 14 degrees and
ice tremors within the glacier to reach the site 700 feet below the
summit of the 4,000-foot mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said that the wreckage of the bomber was visible only from
100 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we got closer, one or two things were instantly
recognizable -- a tail wheel upside down and sticking out of the
ice, a bit of wing spar and a propeller with three seven-foot
blades,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first thought was amazement at the devastation of such a
crash. The wreckage was in thousands of bits, from aircraft washers
to 12-foot pieces. It looks as if the crash was a very short, sharp
shock which probably ended in a fireball.''
</P>
<P>
   Many items were still frozen into the ice, and the teams used
icepicks and chisels to dig out corned beef tins, boot polish, two
Browning Mark II machine guns complete with 200 rounds of
ammunition, and parts of a fuel meter and other instruments.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the personal possessions that gave the find
poignancy: a flying jacket and boots, a Flying Officer's rank
braid, a toothbrush, razors, a wallet containing Icelandic coins --
bent by the impact of the crash -- and a Swiss watch inscribed ''A.
Round from Dad. 14.2.34.''
</P>
<P>
   The watch had been given to the pilot of the doomed plane,
Flying Officer Arthur Round, two days after his 19th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   With Round, a native of Wellington, New Zealand, were radio
operator Reginald Hopkins, 21, from Southampton, England, Flight
Sgt. Keith Garrett, 22, from Worksop, England, and 24-year-old
Pilot Officer Henry Talbot of North Shields, England.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does bring the reality and tragedy straight home to you,''
said Royal Air Force Sgt. Ian Ellis, member of the search team.
''You try to treat the bodies with the respect you hope members of
your own family would treat you.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash site was discovered after a 20-year search by
Icelandic historian Ordur Geirsson, who had been inspired by tales
of Flying Officer Round's reputed aviation skills.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash has remained a mystery, but Fairey Battle
aircraft were practically obsolete by the start of World War II.
Underpowered and under-armed, they were used mainly to train pilots
and on reconnaissance missions.
</P>
<P>
   Geirsson, 40, has visited the crash site eight times this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no words to describe it,'' he said. ''Each time I go
there I feel that all the air goes out of my body, exhausted. I
don't feel glad to have found it, even after such a long time --
mainly sadness at the loss of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the expedition left the site Wednesday, rescuers recited
the Lord's Prayer in both English and Icelandic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the proper thing to do,'' Barr said. ''It was a time to
remember the bits and pieces we had seen had once been living young
men like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the 60th anniversary of the crash, the Royal Air
Force will unveil a memorial at Akureyri airport to commemorate the
four airmen.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the personal items recovered could be given to the
relatives of the victims, but equipment such as the machine guns
are likely to be placed in an Icelandic museum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Chris Holt pitched 7 1-3 strong innings and
Richard Hidalgo went 3-for-5 with a two-run single to lead the
Houston Astros to a 3-1 win over the struggling Montreal Expos on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Astros catcher Tony Eusebio went 2-for-4, singling in the second
to extend his career-best hitting streak to 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   Holt (6-12) allowed one run and seven hits to win his second
straight decision. He struck out four and walked none. Houston has
won nine of its last 11 games. Octavio Dotel pitched the ninth for
his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal has lost four straight overall and nine straight at
Olympic Stadium. The Expos have won just twice in their last 15
games and have lost 24 of 30.
</P>
<P>
   Felipe Lira (3-4) allowed five hits and three runs -- two earned
-- over five innings in his second start since joining the Expos'
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Lira walked Roger Cedeno to lead off the third. Julio Lugo hit a
grounder to third baseman Geoff Blum, whose throw was dropped by
second baseman Jose Vidro for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell singled to load the bases and Hidalgo followed with
a two-run single to put Houston ahead 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who advanced to third on Hidalgo's single, scored the
Astros third run of the inning on Moises Alou's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal got three straight singles in the fifth, including
Michael Barrett's RBI single, to draw to within two at 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Astros INF Tripp Cromer left the team for personal reasons
which were not divulged by the team. Cromer, 32, was 1-for-8 in
nine games since he was called up to take the place of the injured
Craig Biggio on Aug. 2. Cromer was placed on the 15-day disabled
list and RHP Rusty Meacham's contract was purchased from New
Orleans. ... The Astros have won their last four series. ... The
Expos went 0-7 on their last homestand and have lost and have lost
13 of 14 at Olympic Stadium. ... Vladimir Guerrero didn't start for
the fourth straight game with a strained left shoulder. He
pinch-hit in the ninth and flied out to center.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Detained in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An Argentine living in Mexico is the same man
accused of torturing people during Argentina's military
dictatorship, Interpol said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After former Argentine political prisoners identified the
ex-director of Mexico's private National Registry of Motor Vehicles
as their torturer, Interpol detained him Thursday when the airplane
he was flying on stopped briefly in Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said they had not decided whether they would
formally arrest Ricardo Miguel Cavallo despite the fact that they
had confirmed he was the same person whom the political prisoners
knew as Miguel Angel Cavallo. The 48-hour detention order expires

   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who issued the warrant that kept
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet under house arrest in
London for 16 months, has accused Miguel Angel Cavallo of torture,
terrorism, car theft and forgery.
</P>
<P>

   In addition, investigators in France have asked Mexican

<HEADLINE> American Found Dead in Moscow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Police found the body of a U.S. Episcopal priest
who apparently was stabbed to death in his apartment in southwest
Moscow, an official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Embassy official identified the man as the Rev. Steve
Charles Malcom, 49. Russian authorities said Malcom had died from
several stab wounds and that he had been dead for about six days
before police found his body Thursday, an Interior Ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy official said that next of kin had been
notified of Malcom's death and the Embassy would assure his body
was returned home.
</P>
<P>
   Malcom, a native of Cozad, Neb., had lived in Moscow for several
years. Relatives said Friday living and working in Russia was a
lifelong dream for the priest, who left his work at the St. Mary's
Episcopal Church in Nebraska City in 1998 to teach English in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Malcom's brother-in-law, Rob Prillaman of Cozad, said Malcom
spent July teaching in the Siberian city of Irkutsk, about 2,600
miles east of Moscow, and had been looking for employment in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry spokeswoman refused to give a possible
motive for the killing, but said audio and video equipment were
stolen from the man's apartment. The Embassy official would not
comment on the police report or say when Malcom died.

<HEADLINE> Speedskater To Be on Cycling Team  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Speedskater Chris Witty's spot on
the U.S. Olympic cycling team was assured Friday after revelations
that a challenger for her roster position tested positive for a
high testosterone level.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Thomas of Yazoo City, Miss., who narrowly beat Witty in
the 500-meter time trial in the Olympic trials in April, had
challenged Witty's appointment to the 27-member team that was

</P>
<P>
   However, Thomas withdrew her appeal Friday, the deadline for
team officials to submit the final roster for the Sydney Olympics.

   ''The USOC determined she was ineligible to be nominated to the
Olympic team based on a positive, elevated testosterone level,''
said Sean Petty, director of athlete performance for U.S. Cycling.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas also was suspended for one year by the U.S. Cycling
Federation, retroactive to April 29, the date the sample was taken
after Thomas beat Witty in the Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Petty said team officials learned of the test result ''late,
late, late last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas reportedly left Colorado Springs after dropping her case
and wasn't available for comment. Her attorney, Bill Bock of
Indianapolis, declined comment when asked about the drug test.
</P>
<P>
   ''She decided to step aside. She feels this is in the best
interest of the U.S. cycling team,'' Bock said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Witty is competing in this week's U.S. Nationals, she
wasn't at the velodrome Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris and everyone involved with Chris is thankful of that
decision,'' said Jeff Benz, a San Francisco attorney who
represented Witty. ''As far as I know, this thing is over. Chris is
a member of the cycling team.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty said the Olympic roster was submitted ''with all the
appeals and challenges resolved.'' With the litigation apparently
concluded, Petty said it's time for the team to focus on Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I truly believe nobody wins in this scenario,'' he said. ''It
pits athletes against athletes, coaches against athletes, USA
Cycling against athletes. We've got a lot of good athletes who want
to go forward. It just creates a negative environment for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Witty's case was the most high-profile of several challenges to
U.S. Cycling's selection process, which based this year's Olympic
team roster on two years of international racing results.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, an independent arbitrator ruled in favor of
women's sprinter Tanya Lindenmuth of Trexlertown, Pa., whose
selection had been challenged by Jennie Reed of Kirkland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Distance specialist Mike Tillman of Santa Monica, Calif., was
another unsuccessful challenger. After his initial appeal was
rejected by the USOC, he decided not to take his case to an
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   Another cyclist, Steve Larsen of Jacksonville, Ore., threatened
a challenge after he wasn't named to the two-member men's mountain
bike squad but his appeal never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Witty, of Park City, Utah, placed fourth at the 1998 world
cycling championships in the 500 time trial, months after winning a
speedskating silver medal in the 1,000 meters and bronze in the
1,500 at the Nagano Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   When she rode against Thomas in April, Witty had concluded her
speedskating season less than a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
   An arbitrator ordered a rideoff between Witty and Thomas to help
determine the disputed spot. But Thomas rode alone last Sunday
after Witty filed a counter-complaint, arguing she was denied due
process at Thomas' hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Witty is trying to become the first American woman, and the
fourth person ever, to win medals at the winter and summer
Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Animal Group's Ad Angers N.Y. Mayor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Billboard advertisements that New York Mayor
Rudy Giuliani criticized for using his cancer diagnosis to parody
the popular ''Got Milk?'' ads are being removed, according to the
animal rights group that sponsored them.
</P>
<P>
   The company that put up the billboards informed People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals that it would remove the group's ads,
PETA said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The two billboards in Wisconsin, a top milk-producing state,
feature a picture of Giuliani sporting a milk mustache and ask
''Got prostate cancer?'' The ads claim a link between milk
consumption and prostate cancer, which Giuliani has.
</P>
<P>
   PETA spokesman Bruce Friedrich said the company said it would
take down the ads because PETA had not received Giuliani's
permission to use his likeness in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Giuliani criticized the group for ''exploiting his
illness'' and taking advantage of his prominence for advertising
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to French Advertising, the Wisconsin company that
put up the billboards, were unanswered late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Reds 6, Marlins 0  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. had three hits and Elmer Dessens
ended his losing streak at four as the Cincinnati Reds beat the
Florida Marlins 6-0 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey singled in the first, third and fifth innings, helping
stake the Reds to an early 3-0 lead. Dessens (6-4) gave up seven
hits in seven innings for his first win since July 28. He struck
out five and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, losers of six of their last eight, continued to
struggle offensively. They extended their scoreless streak to 23
innings with their sixth shutout of the season and their third in
the last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has not scored since the fourth inning Tuesday against
San Francisco. The club record is 27 innings, set in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who won for the fourth time in 11 games, scored a pair
of runs in the third inning off Reid Cornelius. Chris Stynes led
off with double and moved to third on Barry Larkin's single.
Griffey and Sean Casey followed with RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin and Griffey each finished 3-for-5.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati made it 3-0 in the fifth when Larkin scored on
Casey's sacrifice fly. Larkin led off with a single and moved to
third on Griffey's third single of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius (3-7) lost his fifth consecutive decision. He allowed
nine hits and three runs in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins had their best scoring chance in the fifth inning
when they loaded the bases with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox singled with one out, and Ramon Castro and pinch-hitter
Mark Smith followed with singles. But Luis Castillo, who has just
nine RBIs in 409 at-bats, hit into a 1-2-3 inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati scored twice in the eighth to make it 5-0, getting an
RBI single from Jason LaRue and an RBI groundout from pinch-hitter
Dante Bichette.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ochoa hit his sixth homer of the season, a solo shot in the
ninth to make it 6-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dessens got what would have been a base hit in the sixth
inning, but he didn't run to first base and was thrown out by right
fielder Mark Kotsay. ... Florida's Preston Wilson, without a home
run in his last 34 games, just missed a pair of homers with two
deep, high flyouts. ... Castillo stole his major league-leading
48th base. ... The crowd of 25,042 was Florida's seventh-largest
turnout at home this season.

<HEADLINE> Woman's rights activist killed on front lawn  </HEADLINE>
prfonsho
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANBURY, Conn. (AP) - A woman's rights activist was gunned down
Friday on her front lawn, the apparent victim of a murder-suicide,
her lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Monsky, 60, was shot five times just after noon, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Nancy Burton, said police in Brookfield found
Monsky's neighbor dead in his car of an apparently self-inflicted
gunshot wound. Jean Claude Braendle had been in a legal dispute
with Monsky over a driveway they shared, Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Danbury Police would only confirm that a suspect in the murder
had been identified and ''is not a danger to the public.''
Brookfield police confirmed they were investigating the suicide of
a man found dead inside his car.
</P>
<P>
   Monsky is perhaps best remembered for a lawsuit she filed in
1996 against a Superior Court judge who brought his dog to the
office. Monsky argued that Judge Howard Moraghan's golden retriever
had lifted up her skirt with ''aggressive nuzzling,'' interfering
with her ability to use the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit eventually was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barbara Monsky was all of 5-feet tall, but she had no fear to
take on any issue or fight any battle for what was right and fair,
decent and honest,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Monsky also hosted a local public-access television show called
''The Other Side.''

<HEADLINE> Nader Condemns Assisted Suicide Law  </HEADLINE>
By BRAD CAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- While counting on Oregon voters to give a
big boost to his third-party bid for the presidency, Ralph Nader on
Friday strongly condemned the state's first-in-the-nation assisted
suicide law.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before appearing at a rally that backers hoped would be
his biggest campaign event of the year, the Green Party candidate
told reporters he thinks Oregon voters made a mistake by twice
endorsing a law that allows doctors to prescribe lethal doses of
drugs to the terminally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The law was promoted by sponsors as a matter of patient choice
but is open to abuse by doctors under financial pressure by health
insurance organizations to hold down the costs of caring for the
terminally ill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cruel to people who would otherwise not want to die if
they had adequate pain relief,'' Nader said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Jim Moore said Nader's comments are consistent
with his overall views about greedy corporations putting their own
interests ahead of the interests of people.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ''it was silly thing to say, given that most of Nader's
supporters in Oregon are also supporters of assisted suicide,''
said Moore, who teachers political science at the University of
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nader received some good news in Illinois, where a
federal judge ordered state officials to give his supporters until
Tuesday to file petitions for a spot on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for submitting petitions was in June. But U.S.
District Judge William Hibbler ruled that Nader should get the
extra time because a state Board of Elections rule on circulating
petitions hindered his ability to gather signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's Death with Dignity Act first was approved by voters in
1994, and at least 43 terminally ill people have used the assisted
suicide law to end their lives since it cleared the final legal
hurdles and took effect in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he was worried that the law targets terminally ill
patients who suffer from depression or who worry about being an
undue financial burden to their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then along come doctors working for HMOs who are under
pressure to cut costs, and the deed is done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As of midday Friday, more than 5,300 people had paid $7 each to
attend the Nader rally at 12,500-seat Memorial Coliseum and Nader's
backers were hoping that overall attendance would increase to 9,000
by the evening event.
</P>
<P>
   Nader says he's different than Gore and Bush because he is not
beholden to corporate interests -- a message Oregonians, who are
known for their independence, like to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our two-party system has sold out our government to the
highest bidder,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori: US Plan May Aid Colombia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori said Friday that a
U.S.-backed anti-drug initiative in Colombia could escalate
guerrilla conflict to the point of threatening regional stability.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.3 billion U.S. aid package, known as Plan Colombia, is
meant to beef up military action against the narcotics trade.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori said it is actually aimed at Colombia's leftist
rebels who finance their insurgencies with drug money.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is the concern that has been generated here in the
region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The authoritarian leader, who is credited with defeating Peru's
Shining Path insurgency in the 1990s, expressed concern earlier in
the week that increased military aid could push Colombian
guerrillas across the border into Peru's northern Amazon territory.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori reiterated Friday that Peru's military was not involved
in the purchase of Russian-made assault rifles from Jordan that
were funneled to Colombian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sale, I repeat, was not with the armed forces of Peru,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His comment came hours after U.S. Under-Secretary of State
Thomas Pickering affirmed in Washington that Colombia's military
had captured weapons apparently traced back to the 1998 Jordanian
arms transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said ''several scores'' of weapons were ''identified
as being from stocks that originally were sold by an East European
country in the communist days to the Jordanians.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials believed they were selling the weapons
''legitimately'' to Peru, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori on Monday accused members of Jordan's military of
conspiring with international arms dealers, including a retired
Peruvian army lieutenant, who allegedly parachuted the weapons last
year to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Colombia's
largest rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian authorities denied the allegation and suggested Peru's
military was involved in the weapons smuggling.

<HEADLINE> Former Player Sues Coach for Racism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A year after an internal investigation found
evidence of racism in the University of South Florida women's
basketball program, a former player has filed a lawsuit claiming
blacks were singled out and segregated on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Dione Smith, a starter for three seasons but dismissed from the
team by coach Jerry Ann Winters in April, filed the lawsuit
Thursday in U.S. District Court. The lawsuit also names Winters,
the university and athletic director Paul Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges Winters, the team's coach for four seasons,
often used a racial slur in referring to blacks, including members
of her team. It also alleges Winters segregated the players on road
trips, treated black players more harshly and separated the players
by skin color during practice.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's team consisted of eight whites, four blacks and
one Hispanic. Three of the five starters were black.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she was cut after she sang a song during a team bus
trip that questioned Winters' job security.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing I've ever dreamed about was playing
basketball,'' Smith said. ''But this cycle can't keep on going.
Someone had to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Battson, USF's associate vice president for public
affairs, said the university would take action if any wrongdoing is
substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Winters declined to comment on the allegations to local news
organizations and did not immediately return calls for comment
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gathright, Winters' former assistant coach, called the
lawsuit a ''witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach Winters is not the villain,'' he said. ''Racism is the
furthest thing from her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former player, Sarah Wilson, who is white, said she
never heard Winters use racist words.
</P>
<P>
   ''If so, I would have piped up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Iris Fleming, a former player who is black, said she heard
Winters make racist comments and at first thought she was joking.
But the comments persisted.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a while it wasn't funny,'' said Fleming, who played from
1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, university officials investigated allegations of
racism and concluded such comments were made often and loosely.
Winters was ordered to attend a diversity seminar, and in turn
ordered her team to attend it with her. The case was then closed.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jeff Suppan pitched a five-hitter and
the Kansas City Royals snapped a five-game losing streak, beating
the Boston Red Sox 6-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweeney hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the seventh
inning. It was his career-high 23rd home run, surpassing last
year's total, and came against Bryce Florie (0-4).
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon added a two-run homer in the eighth off Florie. The
Royals finished with 13 hits, and every starter had at least one.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan (7-7) got off to a shaky start, giving up Carl Everett's
30th homer in the first. But after allowing a double to Scott
Hatteberg in the second and a single to Jose Offerman in the third,
Suppan did not allow another hit until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan struck out three and walked three in his first complete
game since last Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Everett hit a two-run homer, the 99th of his career, with two
outs in opening inning. He became the first Red Sox outfielder
since 1984 to hit 30 home runs in a season -- Tony Armas had 43 and
Dwight Evans had 32 that season.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals got a run back in the third on Rey Sanchez's single
with two outs. Jeff Reboulet singled and stole second.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals pulled even in the sixth when Jermaine Dye led off
with a double down the left-field line and scored on Joe Randa's
single. Kansas City loaded the bases with one out, but Reboulet
struck out and Damon flied out.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Sanchez led off with a single and Sweeney
homered.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Everett's home run was the 199th allowed by the Royals,
three shy of the club record set in 1999. ... Red Sox SS Nomar
Garciaparra missed his third straight game with a strained left
hamstring. He is listed as day-to-day. ... Sweeney has a 12-game
hitting streak. ... The Royals now have four complete games in the
last eight games, after recording only three in the first 120
games.

games at home. Entering Friday night, Toronto had lost 11 of its
last 14 on the road, but had won 10 of 14 at home.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: LHP Matt Perisho is expected to be removed from the
rotation before Tuesday, his next scheduled start. Rookie RHP Ryan
Glynn would replace Perisho if Glynn continues to progress on his
rehab assignment for the club's Oklahoma Triple-A farm team. Glynn,
on the 15-day DL after passing out in the dugout during his last
major league start on Aug. 11, allowed two runs and five hits over
seven innings in Oklahoma's 5-2 victory over Tucson on Thursday
night. Glynn has been diagnosed with neurocardiogenic syncope, a

... Frank Thomas went into Friday's game needing three runs scored
and seven walks to reach 100 in both categories for the ninth time
in his career. That would rank the third most in the majors behind

Thursday's 8-5 loss to Baltimore in the eighth inning because of a
tender hamstring, was in the lineup.

   SEATTLE: Manager Lou Piniella didn't seem overly concerned about
his team's 1-10 slide before a six-game homestand at Safeco Field.
The Mariners had a 2&AMP;frac12;-game lead over Oakland in the AL West going
into Friday night's game against the Chicago White Sox. ''This is a
simple game,'' Piniella said. ''You've got to catch and you've got
to pitch. It's gotten off of kilter for the last 11 days, but it
can get back on track just as quickly.'' The Mariners have
committed at least one error in seven consecutive games and in 10
of their last 11 games. During Seattle's 1-5 road trip, its
pitching staff had an 8.03 ERA. ... RF Jay Buhner's right hand has
been placed in a splint for five days. He has a sprained pinky
finger, a strained tendon in his thumb and a sore wrist. Buhner,
who has 22 homers and 73 RBIs this season, is eligible to come off
the DL on Sept. 1, but Piniella doesn't expect him back until after
Sept. 10. Buhner was injured in a collision with 2B Mark McLemore
while attempting to catch a blooper against Detroit Aug. 16. ...
RHP Gil Meche will pitch a rehabilitation assignment for Single-A
Everett Sunday. Meche has been on the DL since July 31 with a
strained right shoulder. ... LHP Rob Ramsay, a reliever who has
been on the DL since Aug. 14 with a strained left biceps, will
pitch a rehab assignment with Everett Saturday.

   NEW YORK: Manager Joe Torre clarified his comments on Ramiro
Mendoza, saying Friday there was a chance the reliever would return
this season. ... OF Bernie Williams, who has not played since Aug.
18 because of a sore rib cage, took fly balls in the outfield and
swung the bat before the game. Torre said he was going to be
cautious with Williams. ''He's fine defensively, but I'll be
surprised if he plays this weekend. I hope I'm wrong. This is the
scary part of the year. If anything major happens, there's not time
left. When he swings off a tee, we'll have a better read.'' . ...
OF Paul O'Neill sat out his second game to protect his sore right
hip. O'Neill will probably return Sunday. ... 3B Scott Brosuis, who
is still favoring a sore leg, was given the night off. ''He'll
never ask for a day off,'' Torre said. ''But he's still getting
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 1B Jason Giambi, who injured his shoulder while
swinging the bat during a game against Cleveland on Aug. 14, doubts
he'll ever get back to playing first base this season. ''It's
playable and that's about it,'' Giambi said. ''I don't hit with my
hands as high now because I want to take the pressure off my
shoulder. I don't know if I'll ever be back on the field this
year.'' Mike Stanley replaces Giambi at first, but that creates a
logjam behind Giambi at the designated hitter. ... Despite the
injury to Giambi, Howe said his team is getting heather ''slowly
but surely. We're in better shape now than we were two days ago.''
Giambi and 2B Randy Velarde were both able to play on Thursday
after missing six games. The A's were 1-5 without them. ... Batting
and infield practice were canceled because the ground crew was
still working at converting the field back into its baseball
dimensions when the gates opened at 4 p.m. PDT. The Raiders played
an exhibition football game Thursday which ended at 9:30 p.m. It
took the crew a full 20 hours to make the conversion, the quickest
turnaround in Oakland Coliseum history.

   CLEVELAND: Chuck Finley will face his ex-Angels teammates for
the third time this season on Sunday -- his first start in Anaheim
since leaving the Angels to sign a three-year, $27 million contract
with the Indians. The Angels' career leader in wins, starts and
innings pitched was recognized for his accomplishments in a brief
ceremony before Friday's game -- and noticed his name and likeness
on the outfield wall with the other members of the Angels' all-time
team. ''I just hope they don't send any balls over it,'' Finley
joked. ... Pitching coach Dick Pole confirmed that RHP Bartolo
Colon will make his next scheduled start against Texas. Colon was
forced out of Wednesday's game because of tendinitis in his left
knee. ... The Indians, who face Anaheim left-handers Scott
Schoeneweis and Kent Mercker over the weekend, are 11-19 against
lefties.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Leadoff batter Darin Erstad started for the first time
since Aug. 19, when he left a game in New York because of muscle
spasms in the left side of his rib cage. Erstad, who leads the
majors in hits, singled his first time up to break the club record
for left-handed hitters, set by Garret Anderson with 189 in 1997.
The hit put Erstad within 13 of the overall club record set by Alex
Johnson set in 1970. ... The Angels' forgotten man, injured SS Gary
DiSarcina, stopped by the clubhouse for only the fourth time since
undergoing surgery on his right shoulder in early May. ''I think
part of the therapy is not being with the guys, not being dead
weight in the clubhouse and not getting in the way,'' DiSarcina
said. ''I always felt if you can't play, get out of the players'
way till you can play again.'' ... Closer Troy Percival, who has
been on the DL since Aug. 5 because of tendinitis in his right
elbow, expects to be activated sometime during the weekend. ''I
can't say I feel like gangbusters, but I feel as good as I'm going
to feel the rest of the season,'' he said.

Dodgers-Cubs

   LOS ANGELES: Hoping to avoid a scene, the Dodgers want the
team's legal counsel to accept any subpoenas stemming from the May
16 brawl with Wrigley Field fans. Lawyers for the three Chicago
Cubs fans charged with disorderly conduct in the fight have said
they plan to subpoena Dodgers players this weekend, particularly
backup C Chad Kreuter, who sparked the brawl when he went into the
stands to chase a fan who took his cap. No subpoenas were issued
Friday, the Dodgers said. ... Catchers Todd Hundley and Chad
Kreuter had combined to throw out eight of 11 runners in the
previous nine games. But former Dodger Eric Young spoiled that fine
mark by stealing two bases in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The Cubs activated 3B Shane Andrews off the 60-day DL
before the first game Friday, and he was in the starting lineup for
the second. ''It feels like Christmas morning,'' Andrews said.
''Just playing is good.'' Andrews had been on the DL since May 15
with a herniated disc in his lower back. He had surgery to remove
the disc on June 7. ... Manager Don Baylor had a long meeting with
team president and acting general manager Andy MacPhail on Friday
morning to discuss September callups. ''We discussed as far as when
certain guys could join us, how many guys,'' Baylor said. ''We

Craig Biggio's season-ending knee injury. Cromer was placed on the

cartilage in his left knee, could return to the lineup early next
week. With Floyd back, manager John Boles says he will not use a
four-outfielder rotation, meaning Henry Rodriguez likely will end
up on the bench: ''The priority on this club is who's coming
back.'' ... RHP Alex Fernandez's recovery from midseason shoulder
surgery is going so well that he now expects to be ready for spring
training: ''I feel optimistic, about 70 to 80 percent more
optimistic than earlier on. I didn't think things would be going

media availability before Friday's game. With Helton chasing the
majors' first .400 batting average since 1941, the Rockies have
decided to stage a news conference at the start of each series.
Helton said it's been no problem to answer questions that way.
''This is just talking to people,'' he said. ''It's not like I'm
dreading coming out here and talking. It's no big deal if you think
about it. I talk to people for 15 minutes, then I get to go out and
play and that's the fun part.''... Helton said he doesn't play any
golf during the season but it's not because he worries that
swinging a club would affect his hitting stroke. ''I golf
right-handed so that's not it,'' he said. ''I just don't want to
get up early on an off day and go out and play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: RHP Jason Schmidt said his shoulder feels great one
week after season-ending arthroscopic surgery. Schmidt said he also
has peace of mind because he knows that the problems that had
plagued him since spring training have been corrected. Schmidt said
doctors told him the clean-up procedure in his shoulder was, ''a
50,000-mile tune-up. It was just the normal wear that a pitcher is
going to have.'' Schmidt isn't expected to start a throwing program
until Dec. 1. ... Brad Clontz, who hasn't pitched since April 30,

Diamondbacks have lost five straight at Shea Stadium, including the

   NEW YORK: LHP Mike Hampton had a 12-minute, 60-pitch bullpen
session Friday to test his fractured rib and he was cleared to
rejoin the Mets' rotation Sunday against Arizona. ''When I threw in
the 'pen today, it actually felt better than in previous starts,''
said Hampton, who was injured while batting on August 17 against
San Diego. The injury forced him to miss one start. ... Joe McEwing

Johnson. McEwing entered 6-for-17 (.353) against Johnson. He has
four doubles and a homer in his career against The Big Unit.
McEwing, subbing for lefty-hitting Robin Ventura, flied out to left

<P>
   PROSSER, Wash. (AP) -- Firefighters set backfires across southern
Washington's parched sagebrush country Friday in an attempt to
control a fast-moving wildfire that had spread across 100,000 acres
in two days.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, sparked by lightning on Wednesday, was threatening 50
homes near the Yakama Nation reservation and already had consumed
24 other structures.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can save one home or a farm -- you'd like to save them
all -- then it's a done job,'' said Paul Hill, a firefighter for
Benton County Fire District 3 in Prosser.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5.84 million acres have burned across the United
States this year in what has been called the worst western fire
season in a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Friday ordered the federal government to
make as many as 2,000 managers and supervisors available to support
the firefighting efforts. The Agriculture and Interior departments
will immediately send personnel to assume management and
supervisory positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our federal firefighters and management personnel are working
under extremely dangerous conditions to protect the public and our
lands from the threat of these wildfires,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   An Army battalion from Fort Campbell, Ky., also began arriving
for wildfire duty in Montana, which will soon enter its sixth week
of catastrophic burning. The 500 Fort Campbell soldiers, plus
support personnel, will bring the number of people fighting Montana
wildfires to about 12,000, according to the National Interagency
Fire Center in Idaho. Five hundred additional soldiers from Fort
Bragg, N.C., are expected to arrive on Monday, the center said.
</P>
<P>
   High winds fanned two major wildfires in Montana's Bitterroot
Valley and prompted more evacuations Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Chinn of the Ravalli County Sheriff's Department said many
of the hundreds of residents forced out earlier are back in their
homes, but he didn't have numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross began distributing air filters to
asthmatics in Montana and others whose health could be endangered
by the thick smoke that still hangs over the state. The charity has
spent more than $500,000 to assist Montana fire evacuees and others
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, roughly 400 firefighters burned away
lines of brush and grass and used the region's maze of rural roads
as natural firebreaks to try to halt the advancing blaze.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-mile line of flames stretched across the rolling Horse
Heaven Hills, and a blanket of smoke hung over the Yakima Valley's
vineyards and fields of hops. Fifty homes were voluntarily
evacuated, and incident commander Dave Johnson said teams had been
dispatched to protect them from the flames.

<HEADLINE> Padres 4, Brewers 0  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Brian Tollberg allowed four hits over seven
innings for his first victory since June 25 as the San Diego Padres
beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-0 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers' four-game winning streak -- their longest of the
season -- was snapped by the rookie Tollberg (3-2), who has pitched
well but had eight no-decisions in his previous 10 outings. He
hadn't won since his first two major league starts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darr had three hits and drove in a run for the Padres, who
won for the fifth time in six games. San Diego scored three runs on
four hits in the third inning, capped by Darr's RBI double against
Milwaukee starter Jamey Wright (6-7).
</P>
<P>
   The offensive punch the Brewers showed while winning seven of
their previous nine games fizzled. Richie Sexson, who homered in
each of his last three games, was among five Brewers who struck out
looking against Tollberg. The right-hander has allowed only two
runs over his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg walked three batters in the first inning but settled
down and allowed just one runner past second base. He got six
strikeouts -- including three called strikeouts to end innings -- and
retired nine of the last 10 batters he faced before leaving for a
pinch-hitter in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was hit early and often, though not terribly hard. He
gave up nine hits -- just one for extra bases -- and four runs in
five innings while losing his third straight decision.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin and Bret Boone drove in runs with groundouts, and
John Mabry had an RBI single. Ron Belliard's fourth-inning triple
was Milwaukee's only extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Damian Jackson stole his 19th base in the third inning. He
beat a rare poor throw by Brewers catcher Henry Blanco, but Blanco
recovered to throw out Ryan Klesko in the seventh. Blanco has
thrown out 33 of 59 base-stealers this season. ... Wright went 3-1
with a 2.06 ERA in the month of June, but he has just one victory
since then. ... San Diego started a seven-game road trip. ... The
Padres are 14-7 against Milwaukee since the Brewers joined the NL
in 1998.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Russ Ortiz had a career-high three hits and
recorded his fifth straight victory as the San Francisco Giants
pounded out 21 hits in a 16-3 rout over the Philadelphia Phillies
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, winners in nine of their last 11 games, extended
their lead to 3&AMP;frac12; over Arizona in the West Division -- the largest
lead by the Giants this year. San Francisco has won nine straight
against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Bernard had four hits and two RBIs and Rich Aurilia drove
in three runs for the Giants. Armando Rios had the lone home run of
the game -- a two-run shot in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's outburst was more than enough for Ortiz (10-10).
The right-hander allowed two runs and six hits in six innings with
four walks and five strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who entered the game batting .182, also was 3-for-3 with
a walk. He singled in three consecutive innings starting in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco scored six runs in the first two innings to chase
Kent Bottenfield (1-2). The Giants had 12 runs on 16 hits through
five innings. And, it could have been worse as the team left 11
baserunners stranded during that span.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took a 1-0 lead on a Barry Bonds RBI single in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco made it 6-0 in the second. Mueller had a two-run
double, Jeff Kent followed with an RBI double, J.T. Snow had a
sacrifice fly, and Ellis Burks capped the frame with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia cut the deficit to 6-2 on Marlon Anderson's two-run
double in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants jumped on Jason Boyd for four more runs in the
fourth. Aurilia doubled in two, Bernard had an RBI single and Bonds
hit a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Ortiz and Bernard added RBI singles against Wayne
Gomes. Aurilia doubled home a run off Chris Brock in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Prince's RBI double made the score 13-3 in the seventh off
Aaron Fultz.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants knocked around Ed Vosberg for three in the eighth on
a Ramon Martinez double and a two-run homer by Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Anderson had three hits for the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mueller went 2-for-2 with two doubles off Bottenfield and
is 12-for-22 (.545) against the right-hander for his career. ...
Phillies CF Doug Glanville celebrated his 30th birthday, but
watched his 11-game hitting streak end after an 0-for-2. ... After
pitching his first complete game of the season and first career
shutout five days earlier, Bottenfield lasted just two innings in
his shortest outing of the year. ... Ortiz reached the .500 mark
for the first time since he was 2-2 on April 21. ... Bernard had
five at-bats and four hits before the game was even official. ...
The large deficit led to early exits for many of the starters for
both teams, including the Giants' Bonds, Kent, Burks and the
Phillies' Scott Rolen and Mike Lieberthal. They all left by the
sixth inning. ... C Bobby Estalella was the lone Giant starter
without a hit. He went 0-for-6 with three strikeouts. ... The
Phillies surrendered a season-high for hits (21) and runs (16).

<HEADLINE> Schools Try to Bypass Prayer Rule  </HEADLINE>
By AMY GEIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATESBURG-LEESVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- On a sweltering August night,
football fans in the small town of Batesburg-Leesville stood
quietly, many with their heads bowed, while the student body
president said a prayer over the school's public address system.
Then they cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Similar scenes played out on other fields across the country
Friday as the first high school football games of the season began
under a two-month-old Supreme Court ruling that declared
school-sponsored prayer at sporting events a violation of students'
constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Searcy, Ark., members of the school board voted to let a
nonprofit interdenominational group hold prayers around a stadium
flag pole before high school games. Actor Tom Lester, who played Eb
Dawson on the 1960s television show ''Green Acres,'' led a prayer
at a game in Hattiesburg, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do what the law says. We don't control what our fans do,''
said Joe Howell, principal at Pelahatchie High School, where
students had planned a ''spontaneous'' pre-game prayer Friday but
decided to keep it silent in the face of television news cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars warned that some districts could be opening
themselves up to legal challenges by allowing the prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Two students already have called the American Civil Liberties
Union's South Carolina branch to express concern about the
''voluntary'' prayer before the Batesburg-Leesville game, said
LaVerne Neal, executive director of the group.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's ruling came in a Texas case brought by two
families, one Catholic and one Mormon, who challenged a school
policy of letting students elect someone to lead the benediction.
</P>
<P>
   The court, which ruled the district's policy of allowing such
student-led prayers violated the constitutionally required
separation of government, wrote: ''Nothing in the Constitution ...
prohibits any public school student from voluntarily praying at any
time before, during or after the school day. But the religious
liberty protected by the Constitution is abridged when the state
affirmatively sponsors the particular religious practice of
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lexington School District 3, the key word in allowing
prayers was ''voluntary.'' School board members said they believe
students stepping up to pray on their own -- even over the school's
public address system -- won't run afoul of the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Three students signed up to speak at the Batesburg-Leesville
game Friday night, and student body president Kimi Boozer said the
prayer before kickoff. Each week that the school has a home game,
others will be able to sign up to speak, she said.
</P>
<P>
   No one visibly protested the prayer Friday night, but the crowd
had mixed feelings about possibly breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart's for it,'' said Olins Hooks, ''but I think a moment
of silence is just as effective.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., said earlier he's disappointed
that schools have to give up their traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''A prayer at a high school football game asking that the
players on the field not get hurt and the fans get home safely is
in no way the establishment of religion by the government,'' Graham
said. ''In my view, the Supreme Court set a terrible precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people who practice other faiths, like Nancy Greer of
Greenville, who follows Nichiren Daishonin Buddhism, said the
Supreme Court's ruling is protecting their rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very difficult to have a totally universal-type prayer
that would be applicable to everyone who might attend a football
game,'' Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Vance, associate pastor at Westminster Presbyterian Church
in Greenville, understood her position. Public prayer can be
intrusive, insensitive and unkind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not ashamed of Jesus. That's where I find my meaning,'' he
said. ''But I also know there are other ways of worshipping.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kim and Ted Sutton, who drove to Batesburg-Leesville to show
support for the prayer, said keeping the tradition is important.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm for freedom of expression,'' Kim Sutton said. ''If we
didn't have our religion, we'd be lost.''

Clinton Heads to Africa, Middle East
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is en route to Africa to give Nigeria's
fragile democracy a boost and encourage efforts to maintain peace among warring
factions in Burundi. While in Nigeria, Clinton plans to tell President Olusegun
Obasanjo that the United States supports Nigeria as it secures its democracy. He
plans to announce additional help for primary schools and disease prevention,
fattening an aid package that has grown from $7 million to $108 million in two
years. He flew out shortly after the White House made known that he is adding a
Monday stop in Cairo to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a Middle
East ally, to discuss the Middle East peace process.

<P>
   PROSSER, Wash. (AP) -- Firefighters set backfires across southern
Washington's parched sagebrush country today in an attempt to control a
fast-moving wildfire that had spread across 100,000 acres in two days. The fire,
sparked by lightning on Wednesday, was threatening 50 homes near the Yakama
Nation reservation and already had consumed 24 other structures. More than 5.84
million acres have burned across the United States this year in what has been
called the worst western fire season in a half-century. President Clinton today
ordered the federal government to make as many as 2,000 managers and supervisors
available to support the firefighting efforts.

Argentine 'Torturer' Held in Mexico
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An Argentine living in Mexico is the same man accused of
torturing people during Argentina's military dictatorship, Interpol said Friday.
After former Argentine political prisoners identified the ex-director of
Mexico's private National Registry of Motor Vehicles as their torturer, Interpol
detained him Thursday when the airplane he was flying on stopped briefly in
Cancun. Mexican officials said they had not decided whether they would formally
arrest Ricardo Miguel Cavallo despite the fact that they had confirmed he was
the same person whom the political prisoners knew as Miguel Angel Cavallo.

Fujimori: U.S. 'Aid' Could Escalate Conflict
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori said Friday that a U.S.-backed
anti-drug initiative in Colombia could escalate guerrilla conflict to the point
of threatening regional stability. The $1.3 billion U.S. aid package, known as
Plan Colombia, is meant to beef up military action against the narcotics trade.
But Fujimori said it is actually aimed at Colombia's leftist rebels who finance
their insurgencies with drug money. The authoritarian leader, who is credited
with defeating Peru's Shining Path insurgency in the 1990s, expressed concern
earlier in the week that increased military aid could push Colombian guerrillas
across the border into Peru's northern Amazon territory.

circled Bahrain International Airport once, then aborted his landing attempt
without explanation, according to Gulf Air officials. Moments later, the Airbus
320 -- and its 143 passengers and crew -- disappeared from the radar and
nose-dived. U.S. and Bahraini teams are expected are meeting with six French
government experts and a representative of Airbus Industries to determine the
cause of the crash.

<HEADLINE> Debby Dissipates Off Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS TUNAS, Cuba (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby dissipated Thursday
off Cuba after showering the eastern part of the island with
much-needed rain and soaking northern Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   As the one-time hurricane lost its punch, authorities lifted an
evacuation order for the Florida Keys, and tropical storm warnings
were lifted in Cuba and other Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m. EDT, Debby's winds had dropped to about 40 mph, well
below tropical storm force. Its remnants were swirling hours later
between Cuba and Jamaica. Forecasters continued to watch the former
hurricane for signs it might regain strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still some strong winds'' in that area, said
forecaster Laura Salvador of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, which warned that the danger of floods in Haiti, Cuba and
Jamaica continues.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had evacuated at least 7,000 people in Cuba. Heavy
rains and winds lashed the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in
southeastern Cuba, home to nearly 1,600 U.S. servicemen and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing fine. They prepared for the heavy weather and
lashed down anything that could become a flying object,'' said Pat
Dooling, spokesman for U.S. Navy Region Southeast in Jacksonville,
Florida, which oversees the Guantanamo Bay base.
</P>
<P>
   Feared mudslides in Haiti's deforested northern mountains didn't
happen Thursday. ''We're relieved it's all over,'' said Jacques
Louis Henry, owner of the private Radio Etincelle in Port-de-Paix.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the Dominican Republic said more than 700 people
had been forced out of their homes by flooding Wednesday, but Debby
caused little damage to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and
small northeast Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   Rains ''continue to be the most significant factor in this
storm,'' for drought-stricken Cuba, the government station Radio
Reloj reported. It has been the driest summer in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''A good rain wouldn't do us any harm,'' said Roger Batista,
civil defense director in the Cuban coastal province of Las Tunas.

<HEADLINE> Final defendant pleads innocent to assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VESTAL, N.Y. (AP) - The final defendant in the beating of a
Binghamton University Korean-American student pleaded innocent
Friday to a misdemeanor third-degree assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Scott, 18, said nothing as he was arraigned. Scott and two
other students, Nicholas Richetti, and Christopher Taylor were
initially charged with felony charges of second-degree gang assault
in the February 27 beating that fractured fellow student John Lee's
skull.
</P>
<P>
   But the gang assault charges were reduced despite demonstrations
and pleas from students and the Asian community both here and in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Richetti and Taylor have pleaded guilty to lesser charges.
</P>
<P>
   Scott was released on his own recognizance. He is being
prosecuted as a youthful offender because the charge is a
misdemeanor, and Scott is 18 years old with no prior criminal
record. Already suspended from the college until 2002, he faces a
maximum of six months in jail if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Ravens 24, Giants 17  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- This one was all about rookie
prospects -- Chris Redman for the Ravens and Ron Dayne and Ron Dixon
for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Redman, the third-round choice Baltimore hopes can be its
quarterback of the future, rallied the Ravens to 24 points in the
second half in a 24-17 victory over New York on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Reman threw touchdown passes of 28 yards to Germany Thompson and
4 yards to Ryan Collins to help the Ravens (4-0) win their 12th
straight exhibition game over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne and Dixon, meanwhile, shone for the Giants (0-4), who
finished winless in preseason for the first time since 1971 despite
entering the game first in the NFL in preseason offense and fourth
on defense. With starters for both teams played little more than a
quarter, New York dominated the first half and led 10-0 at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But as with many preseason games, it was an audition for
rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, the Heisman Trophy winner, carried 15 times for 60 yards
and scored his first professional touchdown on a 5-yard run in the
first quarter. Dixon, New York's surprise third-round pick from
little Lambuth College in Tennessee, returned a kickoff 90 yards
for a touchdown in the third quarter and had two receptions that
set up a second-quarter field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Redman took over in the second half against New York's second-
and third-stringers and dominated where Tony Banks and Trent Dilfer
had failed in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   He drove the Ravens 61 yards in six plays at the start of the
half, capping it with the 28-yard TD to Thompson that made it 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Dixon returning the ensuing kickoff for his score,
he led the Ravens to 17 straight points. The winning TD, which came
with 3:40 left came on a 3-yard run by rookie Jason Brookins after
a 35-yard pass-interference call against New York's Emmanuel
McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took a 7-0 lead midway through the first quarter on a
drive that was almost all Dayne.
</P>
<P>
   After Tiki Barber returned a punt 31 yards to the Ravens' 39,
Dayne carried three straight times to the 25. Kerry Collins then
hit Ike Hilliard for 20 yards and Dayne carried it in from the 5.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Daluiso's 34-yard field goal with 3 seconds left in the
half made it 10-0. It was set up by two passes from Jason Garrett
to Dixon, one for 18 yards and the other for 21.
</P>
<P>
   Another top prospect for the Ravens, first-round pick Jamal
Lewis, saw his first action of the preseason. He gained 9 yards on
four carries, all against New York's first-team defense.

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Left in Wild-Card Hunt  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- They sank like a stone, dimming the luster of
brand-new Comerica Park within weeks of its opening and leaving
Detroit fans disappointed if not disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Tigers started playing the way manager Phil Garner said
he was sure they could. After a 9-23 start, the Tigers were playing
.500 ball this late in the season for the first time since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They took a 63-63 record into Friday night's game at Minnesota
before losing 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Tigers found themselves just five games behind
Boston and Cleveland in the AL wild-card race, creating murmurs of
a playoff appearance for the first time since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a major objective,'' Garner said after Detroit hit
the break-even mark with Wednesday's 10-3 victory over Oakland.
''We had to get here before we go anywhere else. Now the fun
starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the season begun on May 11, Detroit would have the
second-best record in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Picked by many pundits to be Cleveland's strongest challenger in
the AL Central, the Tigers won their season opener at Oakland. Then
they lost five straight and their bats went cold as April wore on.
</P>
<P>
   A pitching staff cobbled together with journeymen such as Hideo
Nomo and Dave Mlicki, and youngsters Jeff Weaver and Brian Moehler,
couldn't keep games from getting away.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit hit bottom on May 10 with a 6-0 loss to Kansas City. It
was already the Tigers' sixth shutout loss, and matched the
franchise record for the worst 32-game start.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a bad start; it's no secret,'' second baseman Damion
Easley said. ''That's why .500 was such a hurdle. We can be
relieved. It's like we're starting over now. We have to keep
playing ball the way we've been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 3&AMP;frac12; months, the Tigers have overcome injuries to
slugging first baseman Tony Clark, Easley, Mlicki and role players
Greg Jefferies and Robert Fick. The starting pitching has been
shored up by a good bullpen, featuring AL saves leader Todd Jones
and veterans Doug Brocail and C.J. Nitkowski.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Dean Palmer has been consistent, outfielder Bobby
Higginson has bounced back from a terrible 1999 season and
shortstop Deivi Cruz hits harder and better than ever. Reserves
such as Rich Becker, Wendell Magee and Shane Halter have made
unexpected contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Juan Gonzalez, the two-time AL MVP and star of a
season-long subplot.
</P>
<P>
   The off-season trade that brought Gonzalez from Texas was a bold
move meant to jump-start both the team's offense and marketing
efforts. But he hit poorly when a string of nagging injuries
allowed him to play at all. By late June, Detroit was shopping
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative trade with New York collapsed when Gonzalez, who can
become a free agent after this season, rejected a $12.5 million,
one-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez earned a reprieve from weeks of home-crowd booing on
July 18, but only by going on the 15-day disabled list with a sore
left ankle. By then, injuries already had kept him out of 24 of the
team's 90 games.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy since then, Gonzalez is playing up to expectations. He
also continues creating controversy, suggesting Comerica Park's
fences be moved in and refusing to commit to the Tigers after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, the subplot has shifted to the
possibility of a postseason berth that seemed ridiculous in
mid-May, when the Tigers were deep in the division cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing .500 is being mediocre, and I don't want to play for a
.500 team. I want to play for a winning team,'' catcher Brad Ausmus
said. ''When you start the way we started, you have to chip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Higginson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been playing some pretty good baseball against some
pretty good teams, and I don't see us stepping backwards,'' he
said. ''We dug ourselves a hole and got out of it. We've got a
month left to see if we can keep playing well, and then see where
we're at.''

<HEADLINE> Redskins 17, Steelers 10  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Kent Graham threw the ball, the receivers
dropped it. Kordell Stewart threw the ball, the receivers dropped
it.
</P>
<P>
   The game that was supposed to decide the Pittsburgh Steelers'
quarterback battle instead became an advertisement for stick-um.
Graham and Stewart had six passes dropped between them, plus one
bobble that was picked off and returned for a touchdown, as the
Steelers dropped their exhibition finale 17-10 Friday night to the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Graham started for the first time this preseason and was
7-for-16 for 94 yards. He overthrew wide open tight end Mark
Bruener in the end zone on the Steelers first drive, but three
other misfires weren't his fault. Two were dropped, and the third
bounced off running back Richard Huntley's chest into the hands of
Lloyd Harrison, who dashed untouched 55 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, whose poor play in the first four games had coach Bill
Cowher postponing his decision on an opening day starter, entered
the game midway through the second quarter and played into the
third. He finished 9-for-22 for 117 yards and suffered four drops,
including one that should have been handled by a sliding Troy
Edwards at the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Surely enough, Stewart's biggest play didn't involve a receiver.
It was a 29-yard scramble in which the mobile quarterback he evaded
and broke tackles in classic Stewart style.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Graham nor Stewart led a scoring drive. The Steelers
(3-2), trailing 10-0 at halftime, finally got on the board when
second-year quarterback Anthony Wright hit Courtney Hawkins over
the middle for a 33-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   While the Pittsburgh quarterbacks were the drama of the night,
Jeff George reminded the Redskins (3-1) that he'll be ready in case
starter Brad Johnson needs relief this season. Johnson didn't play
because of a foot infection, so George got the nod and put his
trademark zip on his first two completions to Albert Connell.
</P>
<P>
   That opening drive nearly produced a touchdown, but George's
third-down pass to Michael Westbrook was batted away by Deshea
Townsend at the goal line. Brett Conway, recovered from a strained
quad injury, then made a second-chance 30-yard field goal after his
miss from 35 yards was negated by a Steelers offsides penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins had their starters out of the game before the end
of the first quarter, leaving the reserves to fight for the final
roster spots ahead of Sunday's cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest remaining duel in Washington is for the punter's
job. Fifteen-year veteran Tommy Barnhardt punted five times for a
43.6-yard average, while first-year player Rodney Williams had
three punts and a 44.0 average.
</P>
<P>
   After Hawkins' touchdown, Adrian Murrell restored the 10-point
lead for the Redskins with a 3-yard run on the next possession.
Kris Brown later added a 26-yard field goal for the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Jason Simmons had two interceptions in the second
quarter off rookie Todd Husak, both on underthrows. Harrison's
interception and return for a touchdown came in his Washington
debut; the third-round draft pick sprained his ankle before the
first exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers running back Jerome Bettis gained 18 yards on six
carries in his first action since bruising a knee in the opening
exhibition game against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins running back Skip Hicks left the game with a mild knee
sprain in the second half and did not return.
</P>

   Deion Sanders was given the night off at cornerback for the
Redskins, but was on the field twice to return punts for the first
time since joining the team. Sanders did a little dance and waved
his arms, egging on the Steelers to kick to him, but neither punt
landed anywhere close to Prime Time.

<HEADLINE> Titans 34, Bears 28  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Steve McNair started quickly and so did the
Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   McNair completed 17-of-23 passes, hitting 13 straight at one
point in the first half, as the Titans built a 31-6 lead Friday
night and held on to beat the Chicago Bears 34-28 in the preseason
finale for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans finished exhibition play 3-1, the Bears 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   With little pressure from the Bears' pass rush, McNair found
receivers wide open all over the field, picking the defense apart,
especially on the Titans' first three series.
</P>
<P>
   McNair hit 16-of-22 passes for 262 yards in the first half as
Tennessee jumped to a 17-6 lead. Early in the third quarter after a
29-yard punt return by Derrick Mason, he hit Michael Roan with a
5-yard touchdown pass to make it 24-6 before taking the rest of the
night off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came here and did what we wanted to do in the passing
game,'' McNair said at the half. ''We wanted to throw the ball and
let some guys make plays, and that's exactly what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Yancy Thigpen caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Neil
O'Donnell after it deflected off teammate Erron Kinney to make it
31-6.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago backup Jim Miller hit rookie Dez White with a 15-yard
scoring pass late in the third to cut it to 31-13.
</P>
<P>
   Then in a fourth quarter featuring reserves and those looking
for roster spots, the Bears got back in the game behind Shane
Matthews, who completed 8-of-10.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Barnes had an 18-yard TD run and Frank Murphy a two-yard
scoring run after a 31-yard pass from Matthews to D'Wayne Bates. A
two-point conversion pass to Corey Bridges made it 31-28.
</P>
<P>
   Al Del Greco kicked a 22-yard field goal with 3:24 left to make
it a six-point game. The Bears moved to the Titans 27 in the
closing seconds behind Mark Hartsell, but a Hail Mary pass was
batted down in the end zone on the final play.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee drove 65 and 89 yards for touchdowns on its first two
possessions -- capped by 1-yard runs from McNair and Eddie George --
and then got a 29-yard field goal from Del Greco after its third
drive reached the Bears 7 and stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears scored on Paul Edinger's 45-yard field goal, five
plays after a 54-yard kickoff return by Glyn Milburn. Jarret Holmes
kicked a 36-yarder to make it 17-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans threatened to score again with a two-minute passing
drill, but Chicago safety Tony Parrish, who lost his starting job
earlier in the week, intercepted McNair on the goal line with 25
seconds remaining in the half.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- Carl Barks, the Disney illustrator
credited with giving Donald Duck his distinctive feisty and comical
personality, died Friday. He was 99.
</P>
<P>
   Barks had been receiving chemotherapy for leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   He drew Donald Duck for Walt Disney Studios from 1935 until
1942.
</P>
<P>
   Although other animators had a hand in the duck's activities,
Barks polished up Donald, rounding him out and shortening his beak,
and gave him a personality that was more jolly, though still with
the trademark temper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Barks turned from cartoons to illustrating comic strips
and books. He gave Donald a hometown (Duckburg) populated by such
characters as Uncle Scrooge McDuck, Gladstone Gander, the Beagle
Boys and Gyro Gearloose. Barks also is credited with giving Huey,
Dewey and Louie -- Donald's nephews -- their distinctive
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Western Publishing gained the rights in 1942 to publish Walt
Disney characters in comic books, and from 1942 to 1966, Barks
served as the creative genius behind the Duck universe.
</P>
<P>
   The early comics were slapstick conflicts between Donald and his
nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie or other characters. Barks later sent
the ducks on exotic adventures around the globe and into space.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped drawing in 1966, but continued writing duck tales
until his retirement in 1973. He painted Disney figures in oil at
his home in Grants Pass until he contracted leukemia 13 months ago.

</P>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Larry Brummett, the chairman and chief
executive of Oneok Inc., the parent company of Oklahoma Natural Gas
Co., died Thursday after a two-year battle with cancer. He was 49.
</P>
<P>
   Brummett started working for Oklahoma Natural Gas in 1974 and
became chairman, chief executive and president of Oneok in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Under his leadership, Oneok grew from a $1 billion natural gas
utility to a more diverse energy company with assets exceeding $5
billion.

</P>
<P>
   MILLVILLE, Del. (AP) -- Philip J. Burke, a longtime New York
sports public relations executive with Columbia University, the New
York Rangers and the old Roosevelt Raceway died Wednesday night. He
was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Burke had undergone a series of surgeries in recent years for
brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   In l960, Burke joined Columbia and was the publicist for the
school's Ivy League co-championship football team in 196l. He left
five years later for Roosevelt Raceway in Westbury, N.Y., then the
nation's leading harness racing track.
</P>
<P>
   Burke later worked for the Rangers for two seasons and was part
of the public relations staff for the opening of the current
Madison Square Garden in February 1968.
Bill Sudeck
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Bill Sudeck, a basketball coach for 37 years at
Case Western Reserve University and a predecessor institution, died
Thursday of cancer. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Sudeck was 280-394 in 29 years at Case Western Reserve and 49-88
in eight years at Case Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sudeck also was a former member of the selection committee for
the U.S. Olympic basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   He coached track and cross country at the school, winning five
North Coast Conference titles -- two each in men's cross country and
men's indoor track and one in men's outdoor track. He was
conference coach of the year in all three sports in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Sudeck was Kent State's all-time leading scorer in
basketball in 1948 and is a member of its athletic hall of fame.

<HEADLINE> Lions 21, Bengals 13  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Detroit Lions' depleted offense was dealt
another major setback Friday night when receiver Herman Moore
separated his shoulder during a 21-13 preseason victory over the
Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   The injury, revealed after the game, was another blow to a team
missing its top two quarterbacks and tight ends. Coach Bobby Ross
said Moore will be out 4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Moore had a 3-yard catch for a touchdown on the Lions' opening
drive, his only catch. It's the second year in a row that injuries
have limited him -- he had only 16 catches last season after missing
most of the first half with two knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Moore, the Lions' offense moved the ball easily
behind Stoney Case, who threw two touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals' first loss at their new stadium gave coach Bruce
Coslet an old concern. Four days after the Bengals cut Doug
Pelfrey, the most accurate kicker in franchise history, rookie Neil
Rackers missed both of his field-goal attempts and an extra-point
try.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-round draft choice from Illinois was wide left on a
46-yard attempt early in the second quarter. He was booed after he
missed a 27-yarder, also to the left, with 4 seconds left in the
half, and fans chanted ''Pelfrey! Pelfrey!'' after Rackers was wide
left again on an extra-point attempt with 6:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (2-2) headed toward the regular season hoping to get
back quarterback Charlie Batch and several other offensive
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Case, who took over after Batch and Mike Tomczak sustained
broken legs, gave Detroit some encouragement by leading the offense
to a pair of touchdowns and 260 yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   One of his touchdown passes went to a tight end -- another reason
for optimism. Walter Rasby, a third-stringer filling in because of
injuries, made a nice leaping catch over cornerback Rodney Heath
for a 12-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals got another big play from rookie Peter Warrick, who
ran past cornerback Bryant Westbrook for a 53-yard catch that set
up Akili Smith's 3-yard bootleg touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Smith finished a solid preseason by completing 6-of-8 passes for
67 yards. He completed 65 percent in preseason and had a passer
rating of 90.4, well above average.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Dillon also looked much better in his second preseason
game, picking up 45 yards on six carries. Dillon missed the first
two games in a holdout and was ineffective last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals completed another 1-3 preseason. They've gone either
1-3 or 0-4 five times in the last 10 years, and haven't had a
winning season since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance also dropped for the second game at 65,600-seat Paul
Brown Stadium. The Bengals sold 48,420 tickets for the Lions game,
a week after they had a gate of 56,180 for the inaugural game
against the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Case was 14-of-20 for 161 yards in the first half against a
defense missing four starters, including linebacker Takeo Spikes.
In addition to their regular quarterback and tight end, the Lions
were without rookie guard Stockar McDougle.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Sauter threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to finish off an
18-play, 82-yard drive in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Coslet had challenged his defense to stop giving up big plays --
the Bengals were shredded for touchdown passes of 73, 45 and 45
yards in the first three games. It wasn't up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions drove 80 and 67 yards for touchdowns on their first
two possessions. Case completed a 40-yard pass to Germane Crowell
and had five more completions of at least 12 yards in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Jason Hanson also had trouble kicking on a warm, clear
evening, missing field-goal attempts from 43 and 40 yards.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins 22, Saints 17  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Jay Fiedler went one up on Damon Huard in
Miami's quarterback race as the Dolphins closed the preseason with
a 22-17 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler led the Dolphins to a touchdown in his first exhibition
action of the year, something Huard failed to do in the previous
three games. Huard did not play against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler, who had arthroscopic surgery Aug. 3 to repair torn
cartilage in his right hip, took the Dolphins 83 yards in the
second quarter, with J.J. Johnson scoring on a 1-yard run. Fiedler
passed for 41 yards on the drive.
</P>
<P>
   On Miami's first possession, Fiedler drove the Dolphins 46 yards
to the Saints' 5 only to settle for a 23-yard field goal by Olindo
Mare.
</P>
<P>
   Mare's 31-yarder in the second quarter gave the Dolphins (3-1) a
13-10 halftime lead. Mare also made a 34-yarder in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Fiedler, who worked just under two quarters, was 10-of-14 for
109 yards. He was sacked once and intercepted three times.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Quinn finished the game for the Dolphins, going 8-for-16
for 82 yards and a touchdown. He hit Jed Weaver with a 5-yard
touchdown pass in the third quarter, and directed a 66-yard fourth-
quarter drive that was stopped on the 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blake, New Orleans' starting quarterback, was in for just
nine plays, engineering a 56-yard drive that set up Doug Brien's
field goal. The Saints' first-team offense scored just one
touchdown in the preseason. Against Miami, New Orleans' defense
contributed the first-quarter touchdown as Darren Perry scored on a
58-yard interception return.
</P>
<P>
   Brien also made a 34-yard field goal in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The question the Saints (1-3) hoped to answer in the final
preseason game was who their backup quarterbacks are.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Brooks, acquired in a trade with Green Bay on July 31,
completed 7 of 10 attempts for 107 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Delhomme, who started the final two games for the Saints
last season, stated his case with a 99-yard touchdown drive that
ended with an 8-yard scoring pass to Willie Jackson with 1:55 left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme was 14-of-22 for 171 yards. He was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year veteran Billy Joe Tolliver did not play.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were sloppy, the Saints had 13 penalties for 85 yards
and six turnovers. Miami had seven penalties for 79 yards and four
turnovers.

<HEADLINE> Barks, Donald Duck Illustrator Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- Carl Barks, the Disney illustrator
credited with giving Donald Duck his distinctive feisty and comical
personality, died Friday at the age of 99.
</P>
<P>
   He had been receiving chemotherapy for leukemia, but ''was funny
up to the end,'' said his caregiver, Serene Hunicke.
</P>
<P>
   Barks drew Donald Duck for Walt Disney Studios from 1935 until
1942, and continued afterward as the creative genius behind the
Donald Duck universe.
</P>
<P>
   Although other animators had a hand in the duck's activities,
Barks polished up Donald, rounding him out and shortening his beak,
and gave him a personality that was more jolly, though still spiked
with that trademark temper.
</P>
<P>
   Barks' early writing credits included the 1937 Donald Duck
short, ''Modern Inventions,'' in which Donald runs into trouble at
an exhibit of labor-saving devices, including a robot butler.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he turned from cartoons to illustrating comic strips
and books. He gave Donald a hometown -- Duckburg -- populated by such
characters as Uncle Scrooge McDuck, Gladstone Gander, the Beagle
Boys and Gyro Gearloose, and he is credited with giving Huey, Dewey
and Louie -- Donald's nephews -- their distinctive personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Barks got his start drawing one-panel ''gag strips'' for
magazines when he was in his 20s and 30s, but the job lost its
allure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking then that I'd like to do comics with whole
stories,'' Barks recalled in a 1994 interview. ''You know, like
Prince Valiant; stuff with continuity, not single, one-shot gags
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, he saw an ad for cartoonists to work for Walt Disney
Studios in Hollywood. Leaving a steady paycheck in Minnesota, he
packed his bag and decided to take a stab at animation.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly advanced from drawing the tiny details between the
characters and the main background to primary character artist, and
his handiwork could be seen in more than 60 short subjects, many
featuring Donald Duck.
</P>
<P>
   When Western Publishing gained the rights in 1942 to publish
Walt Disney characters in comic books, Barks was asked to
illustrate a 10-page Donald Duck story written by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story just didn't seem to hang together,'' Barks recalled.
''I made some changes. Western kind of liked it and asked me if I
wanted to do my own stories. From there on, I was their fair-haired
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Like every other artist in those days, Barks' name never
appeared on a comic book.
</P>
<P>
   But that anonymity ended after he retired. Comic book fans came
out of the woodwork in the 1970s with the creation of specialty
shops, trade publications and conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was astonished by the number of people who'd read my work
and liked it,'' Barks once said. ''These comic book fans seem to
want to shake the hand of the guy who drew all that stuff. It's
still mystifying to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barks stopped drawing in 1966, but continued writing duck tales
until his retirement in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He painted Disney figures in oil at his home in Grants Pass
until he contracted leukemia 13 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barks is survived by a daughter, Dorothy Gibson of Bremerton,
Wash., four grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and eight
great-great grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Former teacher gives $2.8 million to Eastman School of Music  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A former music teacher has left $2.8
million to the Eastman School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   A scholarship fund in Edna McLaughlin's name will provide
approximately $150,000 in annual unrestricted scholarship support
to students at Eastman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This extraordinary gift will provide ongoing financial support
to countless students in the years to come,'' Bruce Van Hise,
executive director for development, told the Rochester Democrat and
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's especially gratifying when a graduate remembers the
school in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, a Rochester native, graduated from East High School
and studied piano at Eastman. She taught music at a local high
school in the 1930s and 1940s, worked as an accompanist and gave
private lessons.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin died April 24, 1993, in California, where she had
been living for several years.

<HEADLINE> Dreyer Sets Out for Athletic Feat  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES PRICHARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Marathon swimmer Jim Dreyer entered
Lake Ontario on Friday in preparation for a 45-hour-plus swim
across the Great Lake to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   He hit the waves at 9:30 p.m. after a brief changeover.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer completed the second portion of his ultra-triathlon by
biking 112 miles to Niagara-On-The-Lake, N.Y. shortly after 8:20
p.m., according to his Web site, which periodically posted updates
on his progress.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to complete his first endurance test last month
due to dehydration and fatigue, the Byron Center native planned to
run 26.2 miles along the beach at Long Point, Ontario; bicycle 112
miles to Niagara-On-The-Lake; swim across Lake Ontario to Toronto;
and then touch shore, turn right back around and swim back to
Niagara-On-The-Lake for a total of 63.2 swimming miles.
</P>
<P>
   If completed, the nonstop athletic feat would cover 201.4 total
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer, 37, started his marathon-length run Friday morning. He
originally planned to begin around 7 a.m., though the exact time he
actually started was unclear. His Web site did not note his
starting time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am feeling good,'' the site quoted Dreyer as saying, 19
miles into the run.
</P>
<P>
   The site said Dreyer completed the run shortly after 1 p.m. Ten
minutes later, after changing gear and taking nutrition, he started
the bicycling portion of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer earlier said he figured to spend about 12 hours running
and biking and another 46 hours swimming, meaning his attempt would
end sometime Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   All of Dreyer's athletic tests have been to raise money for Big
Brothers Big Sisters of America, a youth-mentoring program.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, Dreyer set out to swim Lake Erie, run 26.2 miles,
bike 112 miles and then swim Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer swam 26 miles across Lake Erie and completed the run but
stopped before bicycling because he suffered dehydration and
cramping and could not remain conscious. His body temperature
dropped to 93.7 degrees, and he had to wrap himself in blankets to
ease shivering.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer, who swam across Lake Michigan in 1998 and Lake Huron in
1999, told The Grand Rapids Press before starting his most recent
feat that he expected a tough mental challenge after reaching
Toronto, the halfway point of his swim.
</P>
<P>
   ''The toughest part of this thing is going to Toronto and not
getting out of the water,'' he said. ''Getting out in Toronto is
not an option. You can't even have that thought in the back of your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In training for this ultra-triathlon, Dreyer said he has worked
with a sports nutritionist in the hope of avoiding the severe
cramping that doomed his last effort.

<HEADLINE> Sacred Arizona Mountain To Close  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT THOMSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A northern Arizona mountain held sacred by 13
Indian tribes will be closed to pumice mining under an agreement
with the mining company, the Interior Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mine operator Tufflite Inc. will close the mine on the San
Francisco Peaks within the next six months, relinquish its 49
mining claims in the area and restore the mine site, according to
the pending agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the federal government will pay the Phoenix-based
company $1 million. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is scheduled
to visit the area and sign the agreement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian tribes and environmentalists had teamed up to block
an expansion of the 90-acre White Vulcan pumice mine on the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes gather medicines and conduct sacred ceremonies and
prayers on the Peaks, an extinct volcano. At 12,643 feet, it's the
state's tallest mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do feel good about it,'' Navajo Nation spokesman Merle Pete
said. ''We had always hoped the Department of Interior would make
this type of decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas G. Martin, an attorney for Tufflite, said the agreement
had not been finalized Friday afternoon. The government needs to
identify a funding source for its payment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tufflite Inc. has been extracting pumice under the 1872 Mining
Law, which allows companies to buy land for as little as $2.50 an
acre to mine hardrock minerals such as gold, silver and copper. The
law excludes companies from paying royalties to the government for
the minerals they find.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the agreement also drops a government lawsuit
against Tufflite that alleged the company should have paid
royalties on pumice that was too small to be considered a hardrock
mineral. Pumice is used primarily in making concrete and products
like stonewashed jeans.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 4, Devil Rays 3  </HEADLINE>

   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Jerry Hairston homered and drove in a
career-high four runs as the Baltimore Orioles rallied to beat
Tampa Bay 4-3 Friday night, foiling the Devil Rays' bid to escape
last place for the first time since April.
</P>
<P>
   Hairston hit a two-run homer in the sixth to tie the game. Then,
after Tampa Bay scored a run in the seventh, Hairston hit a
two-out, two-run single in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who had at least one error in a franchise-record 16
straight games, finally ended the dubious streak.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams had two hits and an RBI for the Devil Rays, who
would have passed Baltimore in the AL East with a victory. Tampa
Bay has been stuck in the cellar since April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay starter Albie Lopez gave up two runs, five hits and a
career-high seven walks before leaving with a right hamstring cramp
after taking his warmup tosses in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Taylor (1-3) got the first two outs before Jeff Conine
singled. After two walks loaded the bases, Hairston sent an
opposite-field bloop to right.
</P>
<P>
   B.J. Ryan (2-3) got two outs in the seventh after replacing Pat
Rapp, who left with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Trombley worked the eighth and rookie Ryan Kohlmeier struck
out John Flaherty with the bases loaded to pick up his sixth save
in six chances.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, pitching for the first time since his father died Sunday,
allowed three runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. Despite a fine
effort, he remained winless since July 21.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay chased Rapp in the seventh. After Jose Guillen hit a
leadoff double and took third on an infield hit, Williams lifted a
popup that fell in front of center fielder Luis Matos for an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore wasted several scoring chances until the sixth, when
Conine hit a leadoff double and Hairston hit a two-out drive that
barely cleared the glove of a leaping Steve Cox at the left-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay went up 2-0 in the first. Williams hit a leadoff
single and scored on a double by Greg Vaughn, who came home when
Fred McGriff doubled on a 3-0 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore stranded a runner in scoring position in each of the
first five innings, failing to take advantage of two singles, two
doubles and five walks. Albert Belle stranded four, making the
final out in three innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Belle went 0-for-5 and stranded five overall on his 34th
birthday. He's 5-for-37 over his last nine games. ... McGriff has
seven RBIs in his last four games and 92 for the season. ...
Baltimore was 3-for-3 in stolen base attempts against Devil Rays
catcher Flaherty. ... Conine got three hits and has seven in his
last 10 at-bats.
