<HEADLINE> US Consumer Prices Up by 0.1 Percent in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer prices, helped
by a record decline in natural gas costs, increased by 0.1 percent
in March, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tiny rise in the Consumer Price Index was substantially
below the 0.3 percent advance in February.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the cost of gasoline, home heating oil and
natural gas all declined in March. The 4.2 percent drop in natural
gas prices was the biggest one-month decline since the government
began keeping records in 1952.
</P>
<P>
Total energy costs in the U.S. declined by 1.7 percent in the
month, the biggest decrease since a 2 percent decline last June.
</P>
<P>
Food costs were unchanged in March after having jumped 0.3
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the
so-called core rate of inflation posted a modest 0.2 percent
increase in March, matching the February gain.
</P>
<P>
For the first three months of this year, U.S. consumer prices
were rising at an annual rate of just 1.8 percent, far below the
3.3 percent increase for all of 1996. The improvement reflected
moderation in both food and energy costs, which had been adding to
price pressures most of last year.
</P>
<P>
The core inflation rate in the past three months has been
rising at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, only slightly higher than
the 2.4 percent for all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts say the U.S. economic expansion is too rapid and
the resulting wage and price pressures will trigger higher
inflation unless the U.S. Federal Reserve dampens demand by
increasing borrowing costs. It seems that the report could relieve
some economists' worries on the inflation.

<HEADLINE> French PM Vows to Ban Illegal Telephone Tapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe
today told the French National Assembly (lower house of
parliament) that he would "put an end to the totally condemnable
practice of " illegal phone tappings in France.
</P>
<P>
"I intend to put an end with your help to the totally
condemnable practices which jeopardize the individual liberty and
private life of the persons," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
He said that "if necessary," he would "go further to change
the legislation" on tapping operations by government bodies.
</P>
<P>
Juppe last week ordered the re-examination of the tapping
operation launched by an anti-terrorist cellular under former
President Francois Mitterrand from 1983 to 1986, after the
National Committee of Control on Interception of Secrets accused
the former president of abusing the operation for private
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that 100,000 French citizens have become
the victim of illegal telephone tapping by government bodies and
private individuals who wanted to collect industrial and social
information, or out of suspicion or curiosity.
</P>
<P>
The commission's chairman, Paul Bouchet, said that he would
lift the defense on the secret of some of the tappings in order to
fully publicize the scandal.
</P>
<P>
But Juppe said that it is the responsibility of the government
and the state to protect individuals and groups in "the
collective interests and security of the nation" through defense
of secret.
</P>
<P>
"No one could decide to lift the defense of secret... because
this will not find its justification except in the superior
interests of the state," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Rejects EU Deal on Reducing Fishing Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government has flatly
rejected a European Union (EU) agreement on reducing fishing
quotas by saying that it has "not a shred of intention" of
implementing the deal.
</P>
<P>
The EU fisheries ministers meeting in Luxembourg voted today to
slash EU fishing quotas by 30 percent through reduced trawlers
fleets in a bid to conserve the most depleted fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today in Tavistock of western England,
British Prime Minister John Major said that the British government
would ignore the EU decision until an agreement with EU partners
was reached on quota-hopping, which means Spanish and Dutch
fishermen grab British share of fishing quotas by buying British
fishing licences.
</P>
<P>
"I have not a shred of intention of cutting the British catch
until or unless we get a satisfactory agreement on quota-hopping."
</P>
<P>
Major also reaffirmed his determination of blocking the EU's
Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) at the EU Summit to be held in
Amsterdam in June unless the quota-hopping issue was resolved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry echoed
Major's tough words by telling his EU counterparts in Luxembourg
"the UK isn't prepared to contemplate any further reduction in its
fishing fleet until the whole issue of quota-hoppers is dealt
with."
</P>
<P>
"That's grossly unfair on British fishermen and can not
continue," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Spend 2 Billion Dollars to Cut Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Finance Minister Eric
Asbrink earmarked 16.3 billion kronor (2.1 billion U.S. dollars)
in his spring budget plan unveiled today to slash the country's
unemployment rate from 10 to 4.5 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The plan, presented to parliament for approval, includes
proposals to fund early retirement schemes, reduce social charges
for small businesses and encouraging local governments to put the
jobless back to work.
</P>
<P>
The target jobless rate of 4.5 percent falls short of the
government's aim of keeping unemployment below 4 percent by the
end of the century. The government has made tackling unemployment
one of its overriding priorities.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Swedish Labor Market Board last week said
there are 334,626 people out of work, about 10 percent of the
country's labor force.
</P>
<P>
In his budget plan, the finance minister forecast gross
domestic product (GDP) would grow 2.3 percent this year and 2.5
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He also targeted the budget deficit to be 2.1 percent of GDP,
well below the 3 percent criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty
for European Union countries wanting to join the single currency
in 1999.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sale Price Rises Slow down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The rate of retail sale price
rises in Britain declined last month due to the combined effect of
tough competition among retailers and a strong pound, according to
the British Retail Consortium (BRC) today.
</P>
<P>
The annual value of retail sales in March rose 3.7 percent,
down from 4.3 percent in February and 4.9 percent in January,
reflecting "continuing downward pressure on prices", the BRC said.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed how low inflation was in the retail sector,
although some sectors had been hit by uncertainty in the general
election run-up, the BRC added.
</P>
<P>
The BRC figures followed Monday's official statistics showing a
fall in manufacturers' input and output prices in March.
</P>
<P>
The combination triggered economists' speculation that an
expected half-point rise in base interest rates after the general
election next month may be averted.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Bissau to Join African Franc Zone in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Guinea Bissau will replace its
non-convertible currency of peso with African franc on May 4, to
become the first Portuguese-speaking African nation to join the
African franc zone, the Agence France-Presse reported today.
</P>
<P>
Guinea Bissau will sign its adhesion to the franc zone at the
conference of finance ministers of the franc zone countries to be
held in the Cotonou, the capital of Benin, on April 16-17.
</P>
<P>
Two English speaking African countries, Gambia and Ghana, and
Guinea-Conakry, could also join the 14-nation franc zone, in which
the CFA franc is convertible with the French franc with a fixed
rate of 100 CFA francs for one French franc.
</P>
<P>
The admission of Guinea Bissau by the franc zone is backed by
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which estimate
that the CFA franc has recovered from an overnight 50 percent
devaluation against the French franc by the French central bank on
January 1, 1994.
</P>
<P>
All the countries in the African franc zone have registered a 5
percent annual economic growth since 1995, and officials of the
French Ministry of Finance have expressed confidence over the
stability of the parity between the CFA franc and the French
franc.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of CFA franc caused an earthquake in the cities
of the franc zone countries, while their rural areas benefited
from the devaluation which stimulated export of farm products.
</P>
<P>
The franc zone member countries are Benin, Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Comoros, Cote
d'Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea Equatorial, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Chad and
Togo.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Speaker to Be Questioned Over Hanbo Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean prosecutors said today
that they would summon National Assembly Speaker Kim Soo-han for
questioning this week over allegations he received money from
the owner of the failed Hanbo business group.
</P>
<P>
Kim, one of 33 persons alleged to be on the bribery list of
Hanbo's owner Chung Tae-soo, is suspected of having received 50
million won (about 560,000 U.S. dollars) in political donations
from Hanbo, whose flagship unit Hanbo Steel Co. collapsed in January
under six billion dollars of debt.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's action came right after the Seoul Conference
of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which Kim chairs, closed this
morning after a six-day session.
</P>
<P>
Kim, the highest level political figure publicly named for his
involvement in the Hanbo bribes-for-loans scandal, refused to
appear at the prosecutor's office for questioning, citing his
position as head of the legislature, an official said.
</P>
<P>
One of Kim's aides said prosecutors were going too far in
calling in the head of the legislative body without any concrete
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that they would complete the questioning
within this week and that Kim could be questioned at a venue of
his choice rather than at the Prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
This latest move by prosecutors to spread the investigation
into the scandal to ruling and opposition presidential hopefuls
and powerful parliamentary figures, is embarrassing the
Presidential Office Chongwadae.
</P>
<P>
A top offical accused the prosecution of intentionally leaking
news of the Speaker's summoning to the press despite the
presidential office's wish for the prosecution to deal with the
matter carefully to protect Kim's image.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hoi-chang, the second executive after President Kim Young
-sam of the ruling New Korea Party (NKP), accused the prosecution
of investigating politicians indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
He warned that summoning politicians and officials allegedly on
Chung Tae-soo's list was destroying the political status of the
nation and called for an early end to the investigations.
</P>
<P>
Forty-one people involved in the scandal, including Chung and
his aides, his son Chung Bo-keun and several officials and
lawmakers, have been arrested since the scandal broke in January.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution decided last week to summon the 33 officials
and lawmakers on the so-called Chung bribery list. They are
alleged to have helped Chung to obtain 5 trillion won in loans.

VALLETTA, MALTA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from the 15
European Union (EU) members and their 12 Mediterranean partners
today started their two-day discussions on how to advance their
ambitious cooperation process.
</P>
<P>
The Malta conference, the second of this type, is expected to
review the progress achieved in the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation
which was launched in the first Barcelona conference in November
1995, and find practical ways to push it ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona conference set up a goal to establish an EU-Med
free-trade zone by 2010 through forging partnership with Algeria,
Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria,
Tunisia, Turkey and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda is the faltering Middle East peace process
which has caused severe tension between Israel and Arab countries.
Analysts voiced fear that the issue could cast shadow over the
dialogue on economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In protest against Israeli hard-line policy in the Middle East
process, the Arab League announced a fortnight ago the suspension
of normalization of relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Hans Van Mierlo, who toured the southern Mediterranean
countries before the meeting, has said the Middle East will be
discussed, but "very moderately."
</P>
<P>
The participation of all the partners, including the presence
of Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, at the Malta conference
itself is fruitful, EU officials and European Commission
Vice-President Manuel Marin said.

KAMPALA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Rampant catch of immature fish
is threatening existence of the fish resources in lakes George

<HEADLINE> BT's Merger with MCI Pays Way for "Attack" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications Plc's
(BT) shareholders overwhelmingly voted on Tuesday in favor of the
merger with US group MCI Communications Corp which would create
one of the first great companies of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting
here this afternoon, BT's Chairman Iain Vallance said: "If BT is
to develop and grow, it will do so most successfully with MCI, in
Concert."
</P>
<P>
"Together we can bring benefits to our customers and
shareholders that we simply could not deliver alone," he added.
</P>
<P>
The global telecommunications market is huge -- more than 650
billion US dollars today, and expected to top a trillion dollars
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
At the moment BT and MCI have a six percent share of that
global market, but outside the US and the UK only 17 percent of
the market is open to competition; by the year 2000 that could be
95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vallance said: "There is a great opportunity here. Were we to
do nothing more than to hold on to that six percent, Concert would
have revenues of 34 billion pounds (54.4 billion US dollars)
within a few years."
</P>
<P>
BT officials claimed that with MCI at its side, they can stride
together to conquer new markets.
</P>
<P>
BT and its new partner MCI on Monday beat AT&AMP;T, America's
biggest long-distance operator, by signing up Portugal Telecom to
help gain a backdoor route into the South American market.
</P>
<P>
The deal involves the two companies investing 113 million US
dollars for a 1.5pc stake in the next stage of Portugal Telecom's
privatization later in the year.
</P>
<P>
The latest expansion is seen as well-timed and likely to
reinforce BT's contention that buying MCI is the only way to
provide a genuinely global service to customers.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts continue to have reservations about the
price BT is paying and the potential commercial benefits.
</P>
<P>
A strategy, announced for the mergered company, is "not tilting
at windmills but a focused plan of attack".
</P>
<P>
The primary focus would be on Europe and on the US local
markets which offered a new 100 billion US dollars opportunity.
There is also a need to build the company's presence in Asia
Pacific and in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The deal still needs approval from the European Commission and
the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

(IDB) of Kenya has negotiated some export and import financing
facilities to develop Kenyan industries.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper Kenya Times today quoted the IDB Group's
chief of operations J.G. Chege as saying that the trade financing
facility would facilitate the import of industrial inputs and
stimulate exports of Kenyan goods.
</P>
<P>
The bank official said that the IDB had negotiated a credit
line with the Export/Import Bank of India worth 5 million U.S.
Dollars to finance the import of capital goods from India.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it also had successful negotiations with the
China Export/Import Bank, which would finance finished and
capital goods from China with the trade credit line amounting to
10 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also entered a credit line with the Africa
Export/Import Bank, a subsidiary of the African Development Bank
based in Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Chege pointed out that the financing facility amounting to a
loan of 5 million Dollars would facilitate the import and export
of goods between Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
A credit facility of 3 million Dollars with the Export/Import
Bank of Korea will not only finance trade between the two
countries, but also serve as an important link between Kenya and
one of the emerging Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Chege noted that the introduction of all these trade financing
facilities is designed to spur Kenya's industrial expansion and
create employment.

<HEADLINE> Fire Erupted in Mina Ahead of Pilgrimage Peak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 15 (Xinhua) -- About 50 people were killed
in a fire which broke out this morning at pilgrims' camps outside
Mecca, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported to have started in the east of King Abdul
Aziz Bridge in the Islamic holy city of Mina in Saudi Arabia this
morning ahead of pilgrimage peak.
</P>
<P>
Official Saudi Press Agency reported that the fire that started
11:45 local time spread to the northern Mina region due to strong
winds. So far no detailed reports of casualties are available.
</P>
<P>
About two million pilgrims, 1.2 million from the Arab and
Islamic world and the rest Saudis and residents in the Kingdom,
were either at Kheif mosque to say praises or stay in Mena to
spend the whole day today.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia announced earlier April 16 would be the climax of
Haj when the pilgrims would march to Mount Arafat, when pilgrims
symbolically stone the devil and slaughter sheep and other
animals.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of health centers have been established in various
areas to provide services to the needed.
</P>
<P>
High-tech fire extinguishing devices were also employed to
automatically and forcefully sprinkle water to cap any fire
possible during the Haj festival.
</P>
<P>
The Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and every Muslim
who is able and can afford to perform it should do so at least
once in his life time.
</P>
<P>
The fire occurred a day ahead of the Arafat day when the
pilgrims will converge on Mount Arafat at the peak of the
pilgrimage services.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) --Zairean President Mobutu
Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent Kabila might hold direct talks
in South Africa in the next few days, South African Foreign
Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said today.
</P>
<P>
Nzo made the remarks in his speech on President Nelson
Mandela's budget vote in the National Assembly in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said South Africa was in constant touch with all the major
role-players in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, the South African government and the Zairean Embassy
in Pretoria were still in the dark on whether or when Kabila
would visit the country for possible direct talks with Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing reports that Kabila was scheduled to arrive in South
Africa today, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad
said in Cape Town that the rebel leader was not yet in the country,
but he added such a visit was probable.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the government was in contact with United Nations
Special Envoy Mahomed Sahnoun to find out if he had definite
information about the matter. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African Interim
Medical and Dental Council (SAIMDC) has approved two years of
additional vocational training for medical practitioners as of
1998, extending doctors' training from seven to nine years.
</P>
<P>
Under the SAIMDC decision, doctors doing their internship this
year would have to do an additional two-year training before they
are allowed to enter private practice, the South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted SAIMDC registrar Nico Prinsloo as
reporting today.
</P>
<P>
In the past, graduates only did one year's vocational training
before entering the field.
</P>
<P>
Prinsloo said the vocational training would be done at
institutions recognized by the council, saying that they would
have to meet certain requirements, such as the availability of
facilities and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Provision for the introduction of the system would be included
as part of the council's recommendations relating to amendments
to the Medical Act, which are expected to be tabled in parliament
this year, the report said.

PARIS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- France today said that the human
rights resolution on China proposed by Denmark at the United Nations
Human Rights Commission in Geneva is "useless"and is a
"hypocrisy."
</P>
<P>
The French government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said that the
resolution to be presented by Denmark this evening in Geneva "is
useless."
</P>
<P>
"For seven years, China has the legal and political means to
prevent the debate from taking place in the United Nations, " said
Lamassoure at a government meeting.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that "to end this hypocrisy," French President
Jacques Chirac proposed at the Euro-Asia Bangkok summit in March
1996 that one "organize dialogue with China on human rights, not in
a spirit of confrontation but in a spirit of cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"That shows that this constructive approach is the one which is
effective in favor of human rights. This approach has been since
then held by a great majority of the international community, and
France will continue in this way, " he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan PM on Strong Defense, Vibrant Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif today vowed to pursue an independent foreign policy
supported by a strong defense capability and a vibrant economy and
said the economic center of gravity is shifting to the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Defense College here, Sharif said his
priorities for the future of Pakistan will be to achieve a strong
and impregnable defense capability and pursue an independent
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
To revive the national economy and strengthen the industrial
and agricultural sectors will also be on the top agenda of the
government, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said his government will also launch a crash program for
the development of infrastructure and make great efforts for
restoration of law and order and creation of a sense of security
among the people.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will restructure financial
institutions to safeguard national resources, and pledged to
continue the accountability process and eradicate corruption.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to strengthen Pakistan's infrastructure
and said it was important for Pakistan to develop its trade and
commercial ties with Central Asian states.
</P>
<P>
The great hub of commercial and industrial activities in the
Central Asian region will help uplift not only Pakistan's economy
but also that of the entire region, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said he was seeking to revive Pakistan's economy through
bold innovative measures. "We are taking difficult but
well-thought-out decisions. These decisions were long overdue and
necessary," said the Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government had introduced revolutionary
reforms in the taxation system, reducing taxes and expanding the
revenue base.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, with a relatively strong record of economic growth of
over six percent, had been driven during the last three years into
recession marked by runaway inflation, high unemployment and an
unbearable burden of debt, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said his government will work in concert with people from
all walks of life to bring about a just social order, "which can
be achieved only with unity of purpose and a demonstration of our
ability to shape our destiny."

<P>
KAMPALA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Rampant catch of immature fish
is threatening existence of the fish resources in lakes George
and Edward in western Uganda, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dangerous situation will face future generations of fish if no
stern measures be taken to curb the trend, said Bamusede
Bwambale, a local official from western Kasese District, quoted
by "The New Vision".
</P>
<P>
Kana Mbaga, a local fishery assistant, said the curbing of
illegal fishing is the responsibility of Zonal Fishery Office,
but an official in the office said they did not patrol the lakes
ten years ago due to lack of fund.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mbuse, assistant resident district commissioner of
Kasese District, threatened to arrest fish mongers who sell
immature fish.
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen, in their turn, complained that the government

SARAJEVO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The explosives discovered last

<HEADLINE> UNDP Sees Heavier Task for African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- African countries are facing heavier
tasks to handle although many of them have made tremedous progress
since independence in the 1960s, a United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) official said today.
</P>
<P>
Babashola Chinsman, UNDP Resident Representative in Nigeria, noted
that many African countries in the past four decades made spirited
efforts to improve the well being of their citizens in a broad range
of social, economic, institutional and policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, "the task facing Africa today is heavier than ever before
and the challenges of extreme poverty, social injustice, social
exclusion, marginalization and environmental degradation are many and
daunting," he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The age-long development approach of economic growth and top-down
planning had not improved the people's welfare, he said, stressing that
the current development strategy and efforts need to be oriented to
the people.
</P>
<P>
At a three-day workshop on "sustainable human development" organized
by the UNDP today in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, Chinsman said the vogue
now was to evolve policies that promote the private sector as the
engine of growth and good governance.
</P>
<P>
The policies should also ensure sustainable unilization of a
nation's natural resources to promote development, he added.

He said the Israeli settlement policy, particularly the Har
Homa plan in East Jerusalem, has constituted a serious violation
of the signed agreements in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the faltering Middle East process has drawn much
attention at the Malta Euro-Med conference, the second to the
Barcelona held in November 1995. There is a general concern that
the issue would cast shadow on the economic cooperation topics at
the conference.
</P>
<P>
A Number of delegations, particularly those from EU members,
called for concentration on common interests among the partners,
instead of hurling accusations upon each other over their
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
But still, political and security issues are being much talked
about in conference, which is designed to deal with issues on
cooperation in various dimensions.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the Palestinian people lay much emphasis on the
political and security dimension, viewing it as a prerequisite for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians' cooperation with Israel is based on the
implementation of all the signed peace agreements, he said, adding
a lack of Israel-Palestinian cooperation has made the Palestinian
people in self-control areas suffer a lot.
</P>
<P>
The Malta meeting is aimed at paving way for the
Euro-Mediterranean cooperation which has a goal of establishing a
free trade zone involving the EU and its 12 Mediterranean partners,
namely Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon,Malta,
Morocco,Syria,Tunisia, Turkey and Palestine.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Cargo Handled by Canadian Ports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- More and more cargo destined for
the United States is being routed through Canadian ports as a
result of lower taxes and deeper harbors, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
A new study shows that the value of U.S. cargo shipments
handled by Canadian ports jumped 15 percent in 1995 to nearly 20
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The study found that the value of U.S. exports shipped through
Canada in 1995 rose 13.4 percent to 7.72 billion dollars, while
the value of U.S. imports rose 17.1 percent to 12.04 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Most of these shipments originated in or are destined for
Europe, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. shippers use more Canadian ports for several reasons. One
is that silting has left U.S. ports shallower than Canadian ones,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Another is the U.S. harbor maintenance tax, which can add
hundreds of dollars to the costs of a container shipment. Since
the tax was quadrupled in the past six years, there has been a
sharp increase in diversions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tax is tied to the value of goods shipped,
which means high-priced goods such as computers and machinery tend
to be routed through Canada, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> German Gov't, Opposition Fail to Reach Compromise on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the German ruling
coalition and the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD)
today failed to strike a compromise on a government plan to
overhaul the country's taxation system, but agreed to continue
negotiations later this month.
</P>
<P>
After more than three-hour of talks with German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine said that the tax reform
package put forward by the government was still unacceptable. But
he also declared that the high-level negotiations will continue.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Theo Waigel, the next
Kohl-Lafontaine tax summit would be on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Kohl said after the meeting that he would "try everything in
order to bring (the tax talks) to a result". The tax reform was
urgently needed in order to boost the economy and create new jobs,
he added.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to predict whether an agreement with the
opposition was possible.
</P>
<P>
Both Kohl and Waigel said that the government would soon bring
its package before the lower house of the parliament known as the
Bundestag, parallel to the negotiations with the SPD. According to
them, the first parliament reading of the government package could
begin as early as mid next week.
</P>
<P>
Aimed at bolstering business confidence, investment and hiring,
tax reform has become the German government's top domestic policy
priority and its main recipe to curb unemployment, which is
currently at a post-war record high of about 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
Under its proposed reform plan, the government wants, among
other things, to cut income taxes to 15 percent for low-wage
earners and 39 percent for people with high incomes instead of the
current marginal rates ranging from 25.9 percent to 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
If succeeded, it would be the country's biggest tax-revision
package since 1949.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, however, has spoken in favor of keeping the top income
rate at 53 percent or trimming it only modestly, a strategy meant
to keep the tax burden on those best suited to pay.
</P>
<P>
The government needs to strike a compromise with the SPD if the
reform plan is to survive the upper house of the German
parliament, Bundesrat, where the SPD controls a majority.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said government and opposition still had a long way to
go before reaching a compromise, but they remained confident that
an agreement would be possible within this year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have held two previous rounds of negotiations
since February 26, both failed to make headway. The SPD walked out
of the talks last month to show solidarity with coal miners
protesting against a government plan to cut state subsidies for
the inefficient coal-mining industry.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Air Force Urged to Repair Planes Locally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has
been urged by the Head of State General Sani Abacha to find ways
to repair its planes locally.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered to the air force by the Chief of Defense
Staff, Major-General Abdulsalam Abubakar, who declared the opening of
the "NAF Reunion '97" in Kaduna on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The general charged the air force to turn to local industries
for the fabrication of essential tools and spare parts for its
maintenance schedule.
</P>
<P>
"The idea of Re-Union '97 is to interact with our retired
colleagues, to let them know the position of the service today, and
rub minds on how to positively move forward," Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the air force is not at its best level of
operational capability.
</P>
<P>
An embargo of weapons and spare parts were imposed on Nigeria by
West nations after Nigeria hanged Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni
activists in November 1995.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls Mutual Trust in Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could not
succeed unless there was maximum cooperation between
democratically-elected officials and employees in the public
service, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's remarks, made in his state-of-the-nation address
introducing debate on his budget in the National Assembly in Cape
Town, was apparently referring to a public row between National
Police Commissioner George Fivaz and Safety and Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi, reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the new constitution was clear on the issues of
political authority and operation autonomy, adding mutual
confidence deriving from integrity and mutual trust in pursuit of
common objectives should always be cherished.
</P>
<P>
Success would elude South Africa if capacity problems in the
civil service, the criminal justice system, the provinces and
local authorities, and the economy had not been addressed,
frankly and urgently, said the President.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the level of crime would not come down just because
the resources available to the criminal justice system had been
boosted, if the responsible agencies did not have operation and
managerial skills and the communities did not accept their
responsibility to join the police in fighting crime, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fivaz was allegedly threatening to resign unless he was assured by
Mandela there would be no political interference in his job.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Mufamadi was also reportedly accusing Fivaz of
having broken an agreement about how the restructuring of the
police would be announced.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mandela endorsed Mufamadi and Fivaz as the best
team "the country ever has to ensure the citizens of South Africa
have safety and security".

<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's police forces and
judicial system have been severely criticized by a report,
published on Tuesday by a Belgian parliamentary commission, over
their handling of investigations into a child sex and murder
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The commission which heard from more than 100 witnesses over
six months condemns investigators' "inactivity and insensitivity".
</P>
<P>
A string of kidnaped, raped and murdered children might have
been rescued if authorities had worked together, says the special
report.
</P>
<P>
The commission calls for in a report a complete overhaul of the
country's policing system.
</P>
<P>
The scandal broke eight months ago in Belgium with discovery of
four bodies of murdered girls. A fifth victim was found last
month.
</P>
<P>
The cases deeply shocked the country, provoking an
unprecedented crisis of popular confidence in governing
institutions.

<HEADLINE> British PM Urges End to EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Major once
again urged today the European Union to lift its ban on British
beef exports which started following the mad cow crisis in March
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Major said EU's beef ban should be ended now that Britain was
slaughtering cattle most at risk of carrying the disease and had
tightened its hygiene checks on meat, which were now the toughest
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, speaking to farmers at the market town of
Tavistock in western England in his campaign tour, said the
crisis, which has so far cost British taxpayers 3.5 billion pounds
(5.7 billion U.S. dollars), was not the fault of farmers but "the
result of market panic and in some cases political panic in
countries right the way across Europe."
</P>
<P>
The mad cow crisis erupted in March 1996 when the European
Union slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after scientists
discovered evidence that a fatal brain-wasting disease could be
transmitted to humans from cattle.
</P>
<P>
He told the European partners that Britain has put its house
neatly in order and they should follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"So firstly, begin to lift the ban on British beef and,
secondly, since you have felt so strongly about us putting our
house in order, isn't it about time that you put your own house in
order?" Major said.
</P>
<P>
Major toughened his position on Europe policies these days
partly to woo voters by staunchly defending the national interest.
The ruling Conservative Party still lags behind the opposition
Labor Party but the gap has been narrowed from last week's 23
percentage points to the current 16 points in Sunday's opinion
polls.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Justice Department
report said on Tuesday some of the FBI crime lab's practices need
"substantial change."
</P>
<P>
The report by the department's inspector general stems from an
18-month investigation following Dr. Frederic Whitehurst's charges
that tests in the FBI forensic lab were routinely skewed in favor
of the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
A number of cases were tampered with including the bombings of
the World Trade Center, the Oklahoma City federal building and an
Avianca Airlines jet, he said.
</P>
<P>
Inspector General Michael Bromwich told a news conference that
Whitehurst "raised some valid concerns." He added, however, "We
did not substantiate the majority of his allegations, including
his most inflammatory charges of perjury and fabrication."
</P>
<P>
The report cites a slew of "serious and significant
deficiencies," including the use of scientifically flawed
testimony, inadequate documentation of test results,
scientifically flawed reports, and poor record-keeping.
It recommended a number of personnel changes within the lab.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Up on Benign US Inflation Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
recovered from Monday's losses and rallied strongly today,
boosted by benign US inflation data today which to some extent
eased worries about higher US interest rates.
</P>
<P>
British shares closed with solid gains after tracking a strong
rally on Wall Street, inspired by a modest 0.1 percent rise in US
consumer prices in March, with the FTSE 100 index up 35.1 points,
or 0.83 percent, at 4,286.8.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the subdued inflation figures restored
investors' confidence and quashed fears of an imminent US interest
rate hike and a sharp bond sell-off.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares closed at higher levels achieved
earlier on the Dow's overnight gains, but failed to build on
initial gains as caution set in ahead of the release of the US
consumer price index, with the DAX-30 index 47.78 points, or 1.46
percent, higher at 3,327.68.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, French shares also closed sharply higher
in line with stronger international markets, with the CAC-40 index
up 54.5 points, or 2.12 percent, at 2,620.63.
</P>
<P>
The market was supported by a bullish outlook for monetary
union, a firmer dollar and Wall Street's early gains, traders
said.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended up 35.1
points at 4,286.8. The Frankfurt DAX-30 index finished 47.78

<HEADLINE> Gorbachev Says NATO Expansion A Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Soviet Union leader
Mikhail Gorbachev today said that the expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a "bad mistake."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.S. Congress here, Gorbachev said, "The whole
idea is wrong... a bad mistake."
</P>
<P>
But he added that Russia's opposition to the alliance's
expansion could be mitigated if NATO commits itself to
non-deployment of nuclear weapons, combat forces and military
infrastructure in the new members.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member alliance is scheduled to convene a special summit
in Madrid in July and will invite some of the Eastern and Central
European countries as new members. The plan was strongly opposed
by Russia.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia are now negotiating a document that will shape
their future relationship. The negotiations are expected to
conclude by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who was the last leader of the former Soviet Union,
is now in Washington to attend a U.S. congressional meeting on
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and components.

<HEADLINE> US to Provide More Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- In response to an emergency
appeal from the World Food Program, the United States has decided
to provide an additional food aid to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its children, the State Department
announced today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters at a
regular briefing that the United States has decided to provide 15
million dollar additional food aid because it was convinced by the
assessment by the World Food Program that "the food situation in
North Korea will reach a critical stage this spring."
</P>
<P>
The new food aid, on top of 10 million dollars promised in
February, was offered on the eve of crucial talks to be held
Wednesday in New York between the DPRK and the United States and
South Korea about a U.S.-South Korean proposal of four-party peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
But Burns denied there weres any links between the food aid and
the upcoming talks. The U.S. announcement of new food aid came a
day before the New York talks, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Even if Pyongyang does not agree to enter into the talks
Wednesday, the food aid will go forward, he said.

<HEADLINE> More Computers Infected by Viruses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The rate of computer virus
infection in corporate America has nearly tripled in the past year
despite a significant increase in the usage of anti-virus
products.
</P>
<P>
This was indicated by the results of a survey released today by
the National Computer Security Association (NCSA). The survey also
found that electronic mail is now one of the leading methods of
transmitting viruses.
</P>
<P>
Virtually all medium and large organizations in North America
experienced at least one computer virus infection firsthand, and
the survey indicated about 40 percent of all computers used in the
surveyed companies would experience a virus infection within a
year.
</P>
<P>
Macro viruses carried in common word processing documents and
spreadsheets were the biggest problem, representing 80 percent of
all infections, compared to 49 percent a year ago, and the NCSA
survey indicated the instances of macro virus infection had
doubled about every four months over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 virus encountered, by far, was the Word-Concept,
which caused almost half of all infections reported. The Wazzu
virus, another macro virus that infects Word documents, was
responsible for about one-fifth of all infections.
</P>
<P>
Of the 300 survey respondents representing more than 700,000
desktop computers and 24,000 servers, the infection rate was found
to be about 33 of 1,000 machines infected in any given month, and
406 of 1,000 machines infected in a given year. This is a
significant increase from 1995, when the chance of experiencing a
computer virus was about 10 out of every 1,000 PCs per month, the
survey found.
</P>
<P>
While reporting the growing likelihood of computer virus
infections in corporate America, the NCSA's annual Virus
Prevalence Survey also reported that use of anti-virus software
had grown from 60 percent of the machines included in the 1996
survey to 73 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Computer users apparently agree. Nearly 43 percent of
respondents thought the computer virus problem had gotten worse
this year.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Cuba have
signed a bilateral framework agreement on education cooperation,
Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu announced today in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
In a statement following his visit to Cuba, Bengu said the
possible educational cooperation between South Africa and Cuba
should not be clouded by ideological prejudices against the
Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was a declaration of South Africa's intention to
cooperate with Cuba in the development of their educational
systems, said Bengu.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Cubans may be invited to South Africa to
help teach mathematics, natural sciences and agronomy.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation among high education institutions, on the exchange
of experts in various fields and on setting up joint ventures on
the study of various educational aspects has been stressed in the
agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
A high-profile Cuban delegation would visit South Africa in
June to consult with various experts and eduz]lnal
practitioners to see the country's needs and capabilities, and
the scope for possible cooperation, he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Led Anti-China Attempt Foiled in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China today defeated an anti-China
attempt by a group of Western countries, led by the United States,
at the 53rd session of the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
In a vote on a no action motion presented by China, a majority
of the commission members voted for the preemptive measure,
aborting a resolution drafted by Denmark and co-sponsored by 14
other Western countries, including the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
China's motion was approved 27-17 with nine abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The 27 countries which voted for China's motion were Algeria,
Angola, Bangladesh, Belarus, Benin, Bhutan, Cape Verde, China,
Colombia, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, India, Indonesia,
Madagascar, Malaysia, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, Uganda, Ukraine, Zaire and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Countries which voted against it were: Austria, Britain,
Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Denmark, El Salvador,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands,
Nicaragua, South Africa, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Argentina, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, the
Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russia and Uruguay abstained.
</P>
<P>
France announced in late March that it would not sponsor a
resolution against China. France's stance won support from
certain Western nations like Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Japan
and Australia. They also vowed to follow France's suit.
</P>
<P>
With the opposition of France and other European Union (EU)
members, the EU was not able to submit an anti-China draft this
year.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-China draft, presented by Denmark, was
co-sponsored by Austria, Belgium, Britain, Finland, Iceland,
Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway,
Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In order to push forward an anti-China resolution, Bill
Richardson, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, rushed to
Geneva in early April.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day stay, Richardson wasted no time to persuade
delegations to the session to to put forth a resolution against
China and to block an expected no action motion of China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the session, Richardson fired unwarranted
accusations against China on human right issues and maliciously
damaged China's image.
</P>
<P>
He said his country had demanded the commission to impose
pressure on countries which it considered have problems in human
rights record only to embarrass the governments of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by Washington, a small group of Western countries
drafted a resolution against China at the last minute. On one
hand, the carefully-worded draft resolution had to recognize
China's progress in its economic development, improvements in its
legal system and protection of human rights. On the other hand, it
slammed China for its legal system, religious policy and policy on
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
However, the majority of the commission members were not
deceited by the draft resolution. They supported China's no action
motion, thus defeating the Western draft right before it was
brought to a vote.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Geneva said that the victory at today's
session not only belonged to China but also to all the countries
that pursue the policy of promoting and protecting human rights
through international cooperation and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador to U.N. in Geneva, Wu Jianmin, said in a
speech that what is behind the anti-China draft resolution is that
the West don't like China's mode of development and that they try
to determine the fate of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have followed their own way for 5,000
years. Nothing can turn them away, certainly not a few anti-China
resolutions. No force on earth can stop 1.2 billion Chinese people
from advancing," Wu said.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Reach Agreement on Fishing Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
fisheries ministers meeting in Luxembourg adopted today by a
qualified majority plans to slash fish catches to safeguard
endangered stocks and ensure the survival of European fishing
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to local radio reports, it was agreed at the two-day
meeting that endangered and overfished stocks would be cut by
respectively 30 percent and 20 percent over the next five years to
the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, member states are given the flexibility in
choosing whether to cut fish catches by laying up vessels, or
reducing fishing effort -- time spent hunting stocks in targeted
areas with specified gear -- or a combination of both.
</P>
<P>
Britain voted against the deal, insisting that the EU must
first solve the problem of "quota hoppers" -- vessels from one EU
state which register in another to take part of its quota.
</P>
<P>
Around 20 percent of the British national fish quota is now
allocated to 150 foreign vessels, mainly Spanish and Dutch,
legally registered under the British flag.
</P>
<P>
France, which wanted a 15 percent cut, also voted against.

<HEADLINE> New Technology Enables Computers to Identify User Voices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Technology that makes computers
more secure by identifying and verifying the voices of the people
who use them was announced today by the Speech Recognition API
Committee of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The speaker verification product will be available this spring
to software developers and manufacturers for use in applications
such as telecommunications, electronic commerce, banking and
finance to enhance the computer system's security, according to
the developer.
</P>
<P>
The open, standard application programming interface (API) will
expand the market for these solutions by allowing developers to
engineer applications that will be compatible and interoperable
with systems from different vendors, including customers' existing
information networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Studies show that speaker verification is more effective in
most security applications than conventional systems that ask the
user to type a password.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambian health minister Katele
Kalumba called on the police of the country to build its own
mortuaries as soon as possible to keep unclaimed bodies.
</P>
<P>
He said that his ministry has no money to pay for unclaimed
bodies.
</P>
<P>
Local report has said that over 145 unclaimed bodies are
decomposing at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) mortuary
because of delays by police to conclude investigations.
</P>
<P>
The stench smell from the UTH mortuary has riled residents
nearby, according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
UTH, the country's biggest hospital, has not cleaned the old
mortuary as a result of unclaimed bodies, most of which are
police cases, UTH assistant spokesperson Pauline Mbangweta,
said.
</P>
<P>
The fridges with a capacity of 63 are unable to cope with the
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
A fridge meant to take one body is now overloaded with three
to four bodies and these have been there for about five to seven
months due to long police investigations.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Standwell Lungu said most of them are
accident victims and there is not much the police could do but
carry out investigations before bodies could be buried.

WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The ability of cooperation in
fighting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is
threatened by arms sale competition between the alliance's
European members and the U.S., said the latest issue of Defense
Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"Ferocious competition between Europe and the U.S. for arms
sales on world markets threatens to undermine the military
foundation of the alliance, the ability of NATO's 16 member
nations to fight together with compatible weaponry," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted senior NATO officials as saying that the
growing trans-Atlantic rift led to fears that the alliance's
integrated military command will be weakened in combat by weapon
incompatibilities.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that arguments about the sharing of industrial
benefits still are hampering the implementation of an integrated
Air Command and Control System of NATO.
</P>
<P>
"While trans-Atlantic defense cooperation is stalled, Europe
is progressing with efforts to consolidate the European defense
market and bolster its defense role," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member European Union (EU) is making efforts to create a
common foreign and security policy under the union's constitution.
EU governments are also expected to open talks on building a

WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Dennis Ross is

<HEADLINE> Zairean People Hope to Return to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KISANGANI, April 15 (Xinhua) -- It is the urgent task for
eastern Zaire and the whole country to return to peace and
stability to ease poverty and improve Zaireans's life, said Yagi
Sitolo, Governor of Eastern Province, here today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, he lamented that
"everything has been destroyed. We have no basis. We must do
everything ourselves for rehabilitation step by step."
</P>
<P>
Sitolo, a doctor running a clinic in Kisangani, was elected as
Governor of the diamond-rich province (formally known as Upper
Zaire) by local chiefs and well-known residents after rebel
troops led by Laurent Kabila seized the city on March 15.
</P>
<P>
He urged his people to change the habit of waiting for grants
and assistance and work hard to promote production.
</P>
<P>
The most urgent need is to improve conditions of security,
communication and health care, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Security is being improved. Banditry, robbery and other
violent crimes, rampant in the past, are reducing after the city
fell to the rebel troops, said Sitolo.
</P>
<P>
However, communication and health environment are in mess,
said local residents. All the roads in Kisangani have been
damaged and during the current rainy season, it is very difficult
to drive in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Roads leading to the outside are even worse. It took the
Xinhua reporter two hours to arrive by car at a refugee camp
which is only 26 kilometers away from the city.
</P>
<P>
Along the street rubbishes are seen now and there, although
cholera, malaria and other epidemics are posing threats to the
local people.
</P>
<P>
Once peace and stability return to the central African
country, foreigners will be welcome to come to join the Zaireans
to explore diamonds in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If we want foreigners to live in our country, we must rule it
with good governance and build it with hard work first," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The British newspaper, the
Financial Times, launched at its headquarters today a
video-on-demand service that is set to dramatically change the way
in which companies communicate with institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The service, called Veritas, will deliver live and on-demand
video coverage of corporate announcements, analysts' meetings and
presentations directly to the desktops of individual fund
managers.
</P>
<P>
In addition it will provide industry sector video reports and
market information presented through special news bulletins each
working day.
</P>
<P>
It will also have regular commentary from financial analysts
(including morning briefing summaries from Natwest Markets the
leading City analysts) and interviews with chief executive
officers.
</P>
<P>
The service will be brought together by the Financial Times and
distributed via satellite to a closely targeted financial audience
across Europe and the key financial centers of America.
</P>
<P>
Launching the service, Ad Barerjee, managing director of
Veritas, said: "There is a real need for institutional
shareholders and quoted company management to communicate with
each other in an efficient and easy-to-use way."
</P>
<P>
"After extensive research into the nature of corporate
information supplied to the financial markets....Veritas is
designed specifically to meet that need," he added.
</P>
<P>
Trials of Veritas have proved the popularity of the service;
the combined market capitalization of the companies that have
joined the service to date is over 200 billion pounds (320 billion
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was announced that the institutional investors currently
installing Veritas represent 65 percent to 70 percent of the UK
funds under management, which includes eight out of the ten
largest institutions.

<P>
NEW YORK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motor Co., the second
largest automaker in the U.S., said today its first-quarter profit
more than doubled from a year ago to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
Ford's automotive operations earned 1 billion U.S. dollars, a
seven-fold increase from the 142 million U.S. dollars they netted
a year ago. Its first-quarter U.S. automotive profits were 836
million U.S. dollars, compared with 48 million U.S. dollars a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Ford attributed its improved performance to sales of
higher-profit vehicles and its Ford 2000 cost-cutting program.

Earnings from Ford's international automotive operations were
less impressive but still showed improvement at 168 million U.S.
dollars, up from 94 million U.S. dollars a year ago.

MADRID, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Carlos Moya showed his clay-court
ability with an impressive victory over Francisco Clavet Wednesday
at the Barcelona Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Open finalist outplayed his fellow Spaniard with
an identical 6-4, which avenged his surprising loss to Clavet last

Clavet, the losing finalist in Estoril, failed to take his only

SEOUL, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A delegation from the Korean
Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) said today
progress has been made on the construction of nuclear reactors and
other issues in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
KEDO, the U.S.-led international consortium set up to provide

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa on Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1997 is a momentous
 year for all the people in Hong Kong and the citizens have a
unique opportunity to shape Hong Kong's future, according to Tung
Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce this
evening, Tung said that under the concept of "one country, two
systems," Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy is guaranteed by the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He said the future well-being of Hong Kong is very much tied to
China, stressing that the long-term interests of Hong Kong and
China are the same.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We must constantly remind ourselves that we are part
of China. We are of one country. We need to constantly remind
ourselves that whatever we do in Hong Kong, we must take into
consideration China's objective of continuing to create wealth for
all Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's future development, Tung expressed the
confidence that Hong Kong will achieve its goals in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"We have a strong fiscal reserve; we have a high-quality civil
service; we are committed to the rule of law and free enterprises
and free trade," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have the commitment of the people of Hong Kong to
make our community a better place in the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
On the development of Hong Kong's education, Tung said that in
order to achieve all of Hong Kong's long-term goals, a
community-wide commitment to education will be vital.
</P>
<P>
Education is critical not only for sustaining economic
vitality, but also for giving everyone in the community an equal
opportunity to succeed, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is my firm conviction that the most important
objectives of education are to train the mind and strengthen the
spirit.
</P>
<P>
"Our education system needs to focus more on skills training,
but we also need to place more emphasis on strengthening the
character and morals of the next generation."
</P>
<P>
He said that on July 1, Hong Kong will become a special
administrative region of China. This day will symbolize the
beginning of a new era for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"At this significant juncture in our history," he said, "it
will be appropriate for us to re-identify ourselves. We need to
instill in our young people a clear identity that they are
Chinese."
</P>
<P>
"We need to renew our commitment to the traditional Chinese
virtues of modesty, hard-work, persistence, magnanimity to foes,
loyalty to friends, respect for seniors, emphasis on obligations
rather than individual rights and the willingness to sacrifice
one's interests for the common good," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important that the entire Hong Kong community
together renews its commitment to education and to show greater
respect and appreciation for educators.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that for the 1997-98 fiscal year, Hong Kong's
total expenditure for education will be 45 billion HK dollars (6
billion U.S. dollars), which is about 21 percent of the total
public expenditure and the largest item of expenditure in the
budget.

<TEXT>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, More than 80 percent of
the villages held multi-candidates elections this year, some
villages even saw several dozens of candidates running for six or
seven positions in the villagers' committee.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 30 percent of the members in
previous villagers' committees have lost the election.
</P>
<P>
More than 85 percent of the villagers all around the province
participated in the election, while the previous election in 1993
received ballots from no more than 80 percent of villagers.
</P>
<P>
Some villagers asked the departments of civil affairs for
written texts of the Organization Law of the Villagers'
Committee. Others turned to governments at higher levels to
complain illegal actions in the election, some of them even made
appeals by sending telegrams to the Provincial Department of Civil
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that farmers in this province have improved their
awareness of democracy, learned to use laws and other methods to
safeguard their democratic rights," said Guo, who attributed the
progress to more than a decade of painstaking efforts and the
accumulation of experience from the three previous elections.
</P>
<P>
He said that the province has made three breakthroughs in the
election procedures, which provided villagers more opportunities
to express their wishes freely and extensively.
</P>
<P>
The new changes include an extensive primary election, in which
everyone can vote in deciding the formal candidates, election
speeches, and specially-designated balloting rooms.

<P>
TAIYUAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- "It is the first time that our
village has held an election with such a high turn-out," said Hao
Gensheng with a contented smile.
</P>
<P>
Hao, 58, is a resident of Baiyangshu Village on the outskirts
of Taiyuan City, capital of north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
On March 18, he and nearly 400 fellow villagers above 18
elected their new villagers' committee, or village leadership,
through secret balloting.
</P>
<P>
"The election was multi-candidate, which resulted in intense
competition," said Hao, adding that the old director of the
villagers' committee failed early in the nomination process since
his work couldn't satisfy most villagers.
</P>
<P>
A self-employed man, who is not a member of the Chinese
Communist Party and has no experience in serving as a village head,
was elected new village chief.
</P>
<P>
With a term of three years, the villagers' committee is defined
as a grassroots organization of farmers' self-management in the
Chinese countryside.
</P>
<P>
According to the Law on the Organization of the Villagers'
Committee, which was adopted by the National People's Congress in
1987, members of the committee must be chosen by the villagers
through direct election.
</P>
<P>
Four elections of villagers' committees have been held in
Shanxi since 1987. The current one, which started last spring, by
this month has been completed in over 27,000 villages, over 85
percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
The Shanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, which is
overseeing the village election, recently announced that the
current election was almost over, and the rest of the work would
be finished within this year.
</P>
<P>
To date, a new round of village election has ended in most
parts of the country. Elections are still going on in three other
provinces -- Hebei, Fujian, and Heilongjiang.
</P>
<P>
Guo Xiaoping, deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial
Department of Civil Affairs, described the direct election of
villagers' committee as a cornerstone of China's system of
villagers' self-management.
</P>
<P>
"Letting farmers freely choose whom they trust as village
leaders, will not only consolidate rural political power, but also
help solve problems haunting rural management, such as taxation,
public security, and family planning," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current village election in Shanxi is highly
democratic, and represents "historic progress" in the building of
democratic politics at the grassroots level.

<P>
Information from the departments of civil affairs showed that
problems still cropped up in the election of villagers'
committees. For example, some township officials interfered in the
election, smoothing the way for their trusted village cadres to be
reelected, under the pretext of maintaining stability.
</P>
<P>
Elections in some places were seriously affected by the
influence of patriarchal clans and factions. A handful of people
attempted to manipulate the voting by illegal means.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that the strict supervision by the departments of
civil affairs over the election procedures and the severe
punishment of the illegal acts may help to reduce the problems.
</P>
<P>
But the arduous process of democratic practices will still be
needed to cultivate and raise the awareness of democracy of
village cadres and villagers before those problems are solved, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Not all the newly-elected village cadres are qualified, due to
influence of patriarchal clans and other adverse effects." said
Guo, "But we usually support the election as long as it is legal
and valid, and represents the wishes of villagers. Villagers
can still dismiss the cadres if they fail to do their jobs well."
</P>
<P>
Democratic election is just the first step to the
self-management of villagers, Guo said, but to make sure that the
villagers' committees can really represent the interests of the
villagers, village councils, and the publicizing of the work of
village cadres should be introduced to rural areas and the
mechanism of democratic decision-making, management, and
supervision, be established and improved.
</P>
<P>
"The democratic decision-making, management, and supervision,
along with the village election, will all play a vital role in
promoting democratic politics in rural areas," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Egyptian Bitterness Shrouds Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian-EU partnership deal
augurs well for signing after nine rounds of laborious talks
until Egypt cried foul, demanding a balanced treatment to its
agricultural exports and the disadvantaged south, in general.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has blasted the European
Union proposals for clinching the economic association deal with
Egypt as "imbalanced" and threatened to quit if Europe imposes its
interests at others' expense.
</P>
<P>
The whole row started as Egypt and the EU expected to sign the
association agreement at the two-day EU-Mediterranean conference,
which opened in Velletta, Malta, Tuesday to promote the
partnership forged between 15 EU countries and 12 south
Mediterranean partners in Barcelona in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had held nine rounds of talks since January 1995
in a bid to reach the deal, which would provide for establishing a
free trade zone between them in the 12 years following the
formation of partnership ties.
</P>
<P>
But then Egypt charged that the EU proposals would put it in a
disadvantage by giving European manufactures free access to the
Egyptian market but keeping quotas on exports of Egyptian food,
the area where Cairo has the best prospects.
</P>
<P>
Egypt fears that its own products are blocked from reaching the
European markets while it is among the largest importers of
European meat and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be worthwhile to sign an agreement which fails to
provide fair market access for both manufactured goods and
agricultural products," said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
He said the only obvious benefit to Egypt would be EU aid
to help Egyptian industry adapt to the competition.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the gathering of EU and Mediterranean
foreign ministers, the furious Moussa went further to suspect the
Euro-Mediterranean dialogue a mere "tactical move" that makes "the
countries of the south pay the price in the long term in return
for the assistance they need in the short term."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the partnership talks have bumped all the way until
the EU countries agreed to increase the quotas on the most
controversial commodities, such as rice, potatoes, citrus fruit
and cut flowers, at the latest round of talks on March 10-12.
</P>
<P>
But Moussa insisted they were still inadequate and more
concessions are needed.
</P>
<P>
He demanded an agreement that would ensure a fair and balanced
access for agricultural and industrial commodities and provide
proper financial support.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Now Egypt is frustrated and
suspicious about whether EU has a "genuine and equitable political
will" to conclude an agreement with Egypt that conforms with the
true spirit of partnership, Moussa told the conference in
Velletta, Malta.
</P>
<P>
Egypt argued that its agricultural quota should be scaled up,
under the world trade accord, to a level higher than when it
traded with the Soviet Union and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Even from the beginning, the partnership negotiations have been
difficult and crucial as the European countries represents 46
percent of Egypt's foreign trade, according to Egyptian Minister
of Trade and Supply Ahmed Goweili.
</P>
<P>
During a week-long European tour in March, Goweili got
assurances of easier Egyptian access to the European markets for
customs-free items such as rice, potatoes, flowers and citrus
fruits.
</P>
<P>
But the agricultural file remains the most thorny part of the
14-item partnership agreement covering all fields of cooperation,
when each of the 15 EU nations harbors fears about the negative
impact of the Egyptian agricultural exports on its own production.
</P>
<P>
For example, Spain has a problem with orange, the Netherlands
with flowers and Germany with potatoes. The result was that the
Egyptian suggestions to raise the traditional level of these
tariff-exempt exports had been cold-shouldered.
</P>
<P>
Egypt suffers a trade deficit of about 2.7 million ECUs with
the EU in 1995 when foodstuffs account for 9 percent of its total
exports.
</P>
<P>
EU has already forged partnership with Morocco, Tunis and
Israel, and is yet to sign agreements with Egypt, Jordan and
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Warns Germany of Paying Heavy Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Supreme Leader Ali
Khamenei today warned Germany of paying a heavy price for the
Mykonos verdict a week ago, Tehran Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the strong-worded statement on the occasion of
the Armed Forces Day, which was attended by top Iranian military
brass and some high-ranking government officials.
</P>
<P>
This is the first statement he has made since the verdict of
the Berlin court which charged top Iranian leaders with ordering
the killing of four Kurdish opposition leaders in Mykonos
restaurant in Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that "Germany has paid a heavy price and will
continue to pay, and it would have to face all the consequences of
its deeds."
</P>
<P>
But observers here noted that the warning by the Iranian
supreme leader is just a warning. Iran can not afford to lose
Europe after it severed relations with the United States
18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
They said that it seems impossible for Iran to take the
initiative to reduce or sever the diplomatic relations with
Germany or other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Tehran even would not limit its trade and economic relations
with European countries. It is totally against Iran's national
interest to take such an action. Iran's vital projects are relied
on European technology, with Germany in particular, they added.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Iran's largest trade partner, which takes a lion's
share in Iran's total import and export. German exports to Iran
made up 41.3 percent of the total import of Iran while German
imports from Iran accounted for 32.8 percent of the total export
of Iran in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the Mykonos case or the Berlin court's
ruling was in fact a joint U.S.-Israeli conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Iran would never retract even one step
vis-a-vis the bullying by the Clinton administration or any other
government.
</P>
<P>
"Iran only relies on its own faith and nothing else," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Berlin court verdict, Iran has launched a
nationwide anti-German wave with various kinds of demonstrations
in 12 cities over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) nations have now withdrawn their
ambassadors from Iran, who are expected to meet in Brussels
Thursday. EU's ministerial level meeting will make a unified
action toward Iran in Brussels on April 29.

<HEADLINE> PATA 97 Travel Mart Opened in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,500 representatives from
travel agencies, airlines, hotels, and government tourism
departments of over 40 countries and regions gathered in Beijing
to attend an international travel fair which opened today.
</P>
<P>
The four-day 97 Travel Mart of the Pacific Asia Travel
Association (PATA), the first of its kind held in China, offers
456 booths covering 10,000 square meters in China World Trade
Center. There are 61 booths for China.
</P>
<P>
Sources say the PATA fair is very practical in nature and
offers a good chance for business. Instead of stressing promotion
as in many other travel shows, the PATA fair pre-arranges buyers
and sellers to meet so as they can strike deals right on the spot.
</P>
<P>
Today's travel mart is only one of the three PATA annual events
to take place in China. The PATA Chapters Conference opened today
in Shanghai, and the PATA Annual Conference will be convened in
Beijing on April 20.
</P>
<P>
"The three PATA events will push the on-going Visit China 97 to
new climaxes", said He Guangwei, Chairman of China National
Tourism Administration (CNTA), at today's opening ceremony for the
fair.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1952 and headquartered in San Francisco, PATA is an
influential non-governmental tourism organization, which plays an
important role in the development, promotion, training, and
cooperation in the field of tourism.
</P>
<P>
CNTA joined PATA in 1993, followed by 35 Chinese tourism
bureaus, travel agencies, airlines, and hotels.

<HEADLINE> Russian Deputy FM Meets Lebanese Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Victor Posevalyuk, Russia's
deputy foreign minister for the Middle East affairs, expressed
here today his country's "worry and pessimism" over an
aggravation of the situation in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Posevalyuk, who arrived here from the Syrian capital of
Damascus earlier this morning on the second leg of his tour in
the region, held a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri in the latter's office.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters following the end of the meeting, the
Russian official said that they discussed the situation in the
region, and exchanged views on how to revive the peace process
from the current stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Posevalyuk described as "useful" the ideas put forward by the
Lebanese premier. He said that his mission focused on meetings
with the officials of the countries concerned in the peace
process, in addition to making contacts with Dennis Ross, the
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator, and Miguel Angel Moratinos,
the European Union's Middle East peace envoy.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister added that he will report to
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov the results of his tour
in order to work out measures to be taken for Russia's diplomacy
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On the results of Hariri's visit to Moscow last week, the
Russian official said that the two sides had signed in Moscow a
number of economic accords which "should become a proper framework
of works for developing the relations between Russia and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"We are not satisfied with the current level of these
relations," he noted, saying that the two sides had reached an
understanding that more steps are needed in the future.
</P>
<P>
After the talks with the Lebanese premier, Posevalyuk left
Beirut for Jordan's capital Amman.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official will also visit Israel and the
Palestinian self-rule area of Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Muslim Rebels Agree on Repositioning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military today
agreed to reposition its force and the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) guerrillas in the southern province of Maguindanao to
ease the tension there, the country's military chief said.
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, Arnulfo Acedera, chief of staff of the
Philippine Armed Forces, said he rejected the MILF's demand for
the total pullout of government troops as a precondition for a
peace agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said more government troops will be deployed in the
area if necessary to maintain peace and order and protect the
people in Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Fortunato Abat, chairman of the government peace panel,
recently suggested the repositioning of both the government and
MILF forces in Maguindanao as demanded by the MILF for its return
to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the MILF called on the government troops to stay away
from their present position and return to their original
positions, which they held before a clash between the two sides in
March.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government will resume low-level peace talks
on April 23-25.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front, is currently the largest anti-government force
in the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.

<HEADLINE> Water Level Down in Caspian Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The recent drop of the Caspian
Sea's water level has prompted scientists to believe that the
amount of water at the salt-water lake fluctuate periodically.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea, the world's largest in-land lake of the kind,
was found to be down an average of 20 centimeters in water level
last year, reversing the continuous rise in previous years.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, said a report in the fortnightly Ecological
Messenger magazine published here today, was made by scientists
working with Azerbaijan's State Hydrology Committee.
</P>
<P>
Based on the new finding, S. Velelv, an Azerbaijani
geophysicist, assumed that the phenomenon could be the start of a
trend of lower water level through the middle of next century.
</P>
<P>
However, a probable long period of less water in the lake would
be in sharp contrast to what had happened until last year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, the surface of the Caspian Sea had risen 2.4 meters
on average, drowning seven residential areas, 200 oil wells and
650,000 hectares of farm land in Kazakhstan alone.
</P>
<P>
The swell of the lake was theorized last year by S. Shelo, an
academician with the Russian Academy of Sciences, as a result of
the periodical movement of earth crusts.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure coming along with the movement, he said,
underground water are squeezed upward and poured into the Caspian
Sea, leading to the rise of water level.
</P>
<P>
But once the huge amount of water builds up enough tension, the
Russian scientist said, surface water could be "swallowed" back
down and result in a lower water level.
</P>
<P>
He predicted, somehow in line with what his Azerbaijani
counterpart assumed recently, that the water level of the Caspian
Sea would be down starting from sometime between 2005 and 2020.

MADRID, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Defending world champion Tommi
Makinen of Finland won the Catalunya Rally in Lloret de Mar
Wednesday to extend his lead in this year's title race.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, driving a Mitsubishi, was seven seconds ahead of
Italian Piero Liatti in his Subaru for his second consecutive
win. He took the Rally of Portugal three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Finn had started the final leg of the rally sharing the
lead with Liatti. And he built up a 10-second edge over his most
serious rival over the first three stages of the day.
</P>
<P>
But on the penultimate stage, the 17th, Liatti set the fastest
time to bring the gap down to four seconds and set up a thrilling
final stage, which Makinen completed three seconds faster.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Gilles Panizzi brought the Peugeot team some
consolation with a third-place finish. He had led for much of the
opening day but lost the lead when he suffered a puncture on the
sixth stage.

NEW DELHI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A new leader of the 13-party
United Front (UF) would be chosen by consensus at a meeting of the
front's Steering Committee here tomorrow, a key committee member
said today.
</P>
<P>
G.K. Moopanar, who himself is the leading candidate for new UF
leader, told reporters in Chennai, capital of Tamil Nadu state,
that the leadership question would be resolved amicably, according
to the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
All issues concerning the front would be discussed at
tomorrow's meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
No political party in the country was prepared for an election
to the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) and the people were
totally against mid-term poll, he said, adding that efforts were
on to avoid another general election.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who is also leader of
the UF parliamentary party, has offered to step down after losing
a vote of confidence in his government, paving the way for the
election of a new UF leader.
</P>
<P>
The change of leadership in the UF is a precondition for the
Congress party to renew support for the front to form a new
government. The Congress party withdrew its support for the UF
late last month.

BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The general offices of the State
Council and the Central Military Commission (CMC) asked local
governments to earnestly help settle ex-servicemen and retired
officers.
</P>
<P>
The two offices called on local governments to implement a
circular about demobilization of officers issued by the Leading
Group for Settling Ex-Servicemen and Retired Officers under the
State Council, Organization Department of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), Ministry of Personnel,
Ministry of Labor, and the General Political Department of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
The circular said that retired officers will be assigned
civilian jobs according to the government plan this year. The
focus of this year's demobilization will be on retired officers at
the regimental and division levels.
</P>
<P>
Preference will be given to those who have won at least Merit
Citation Class II, those who became handicapped on duty, those who
served in remote areas and areas where natural conditions are
harsh, and those who served on aircraft or naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
The circular asked local governments to guarantee the
legitimate rights and interests of retired officers and their
families who transfer to civilian factories.
</P>
<P>
Training and housing should also be provided for retired
officers.
</P>
<P>
No government departments, mass organizations or enterprises
may refuse to accept retired officers.
</P>
<P>
The circular also encouraged retired officers to work in the
areas that need them most and to make greater contributions to the
country's modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Warfare Victims Protest against Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 victims of Iraqi
chemical warfare during the 1980-88 war between Iran and Iraq
staged a protest rally in front of the German Embassy this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims are moving on wheelchairs on the streets
and some are families of the killed, urging Iranian justice
department to prosecute German firms supplying Iraq with toxic
gas and technology to launch chemical attacks against Iranian
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Holding the effigies of a Berlin court judge, the war veterans
bearing white breathing masks carried the photos of their fellow
combatants who had succumbed to their chemical wounds as well as
models of missiles containing toxic gas used by Iraqi soldiers in
the eight-year bitter war.
</P>
<P>
The veterans urged Iran's justice department to proceed with
their complaints and take legal actions at the international
level against the German firms supplying chemical and biological
weapons to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They called on the German government to apologize to Iran for
what they called the blunder made by the Berlin court in the
trial charging top Iranian leaders of ordering the killing of
four Kurdish opposition leaders in the Mykonos Restaurant
of Berlin in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Just three days before the verdict was announced, Iranian
judicial authorities demanded 24 German firms and a number of
German government officials to appear in an Iranian court on
charges of supplying the chemical weapon to Iraq during the
Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the judicial branch said that the families of
the victims and the disabled by the chemical weapons asked for
compensation to their sufferings and losses of their lives and
punishment of German chemical weapon exporters and a number of
government officials who issued the permit for the export of the
chemical weapons to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous spokesman claimed that there are valid and
undeniable documents such as pictures, films and speeches from
German technicians who were working and cooperating with the Iraqi
army on the deployment of the chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Iran accused 84 German companies, including
Toysen, Zigma and Hebergerbau, of supplying chemical weapons to
Iraq during the war.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Mazandarani, Secretary General of the Association for
Helping Victims of Iraq's Chemical Warfare, said that Iran has
collected a considerable volume of information regarding Germany
in connection with the chemical weapon supplies to Iraq during
the eight-year war.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 25,000 Iranians were killed and 65,000
Iranian veterans were injured in the war as victims of chemical
bombs.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to German firms there were some 18 American and
British firms that were supplying the Iraqis," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that most of the bombs were given to Baghdad under
the cover of providing pesticide to Iraqis.

ANKARA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish police have seized 45
kilograms of hashish in an anti-drug operation in eastern
Turkey bordering Iran, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that through a tip-off, the police

<HEADLINE> India's Infrastructure Registers Slow Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The average growth rate of
India's seven critical infrastructure industries grew only by 3.6
percent during the first nine months of the current fiscal year
(April 1996 - March 1997) compared with the 8.3 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual report of the Indian Finance Ministry
available here today, the seven critical infrastructure industries
include electricity, coal, steel, crude oil, refined oil products,
cement and fertilizers, which make up a combined weight of about
31 percent in the index of industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The report said the slowdown in infrastructure industry growth
was mainly due to a decline in crude oil production and power
generation.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Delays Launching Bond in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has
decided to delay the launch of the country's 1.25 billion U.S.
dollars of Yankee bond in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Gabriel Singson announced the decision in
a press release issued today by the Presidential Press Office.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the bond was reset in the light of the highly
unfavorable market conditions that have prevailed in the last few
days in the U.S. bond market, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Salomon Brothers, a famous U.S. investment firm which was in
charge of issuing the bond, agreed with the decision, said
Singson, who is now in the U.S. to prepare for the launch of the
bond.
</P>
<P>
The bond was initially scheduled to be launched in the U.S. on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the current market conditions have resulted in the
sudden and sharp increase in the interest rate on the U.S.
Treasury 30-year bond as well as the widening of spreads asked for
by investors.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, economists had warned the central bank against
launching the bond at this time because the bank will have to pay
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will quickly come back to the U.S. market to
launch the bond at a much more favorable and appropriate price
than what can be obtained under present difficult overall market
conditions, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
In view of its sustained high economic growth, the Philippines
wants to launch the 1.25 billion dollars Yankee bond to boost its
international reserves.

<HEADLINE> Securities Market Important to China's Economy: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The securities market has become
an important part of China's socialist market economic system,
senior government securities officials said at an international
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
"The securities market has played a positive role in pooling
funds, transforming the operating mechanism of Chinese
enterprises, and optimizing the distribution of resources," Zhou
Zhengqing, chairman of the Securities Committee of the State
Council, said at the opening session of a conference of the
Asia-Pacific Regional Committee of the International Organization
Securities Committee (IOSCO), which also functions as a symposium
on Asian-Pacific securities markets.
</P>
<P>
China will further tap the role of the securities market in
raising capital and transforming the operating mechanism of
enterprises, and will give keen support to the state-owned
enterprises to issue shares or convertible bonds, said Zhou, who
is also Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, or the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Daojiong, chairman of China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), said that China has always attached importance
to standardizing the securities market and has over the years
promulgated a number of securities laws, rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
"As our market expands, we should establish an effective system
and mechanism to guard against market risks," he said.
</P>
<P>
CSRC, China's securities industry watchdog, joined IOSCO, a
standing international organization established in 1983 and
headquartered in Montreal, Canada, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
China's securities market has basically taken shape after rapid
development in the six years since its establishment. By the end
of February, there were 561 companies listed on the country's two
stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, with a market
capitalization of more than 1.16 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 87 Chinese companies have issued inside the
country shares exclusively for overseas investors, raising a total
of 3.9 billion US dollars in capital. Another 29 Chinese firms
have listed on overseas bourses and pooled 5.9 billion US dollars
in the aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Today's conference, which will last through Friday, drew
securities officials and experts from India, Australia, Malaysia,
Japan, Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as officials
and experts from a number of Chinese government departments, such
as the State Planning Commission and the People's Bank of China,
the central bank.

<HEADLINE> All EU Ambassadors Recalled from Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- All ambassadors of the European
Union (EU) member nations have been recalled from Tehran in a
protest against the alleged involvement of Iranian leaders in
murdering Kurdish dissidents, a European diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said on condition of anonymity that even Greek
Ambassador Dimitri Tsikouris had left here this morning for
Brussels to participate the special meeting to examine relations
between the EU and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua in a telephone interview that the EU member
states will start a meeting Thursday with all ambassadors
present.
</P>
<P>
"You can interpret the trip by the Greek ambassador whatever
you like," he replied on a question whether the Greek ambassador
was "recalled" or not for the "consultation."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, he was not sure how long it will take for
these ambassadors to come back after the consultation. "That is
the decision to be made at the EU ministerial meeting at Brussels
due on April 29."
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador Horst Beshma was the first to leave from
Tehran after the call from Bonn. Italian Ambassador Ludovico
Ortona left for Rome early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Three non-EU ambassadors from Australia, Canada and New Zealand
have also been recalled back to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Ambassador of New Zealand John Hayes had returned to
Tehran late last night, but he left for Dubai, UAE, this
morning. The Embassy of New Zealand said that he would come back
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government announced on April 12 that it has
decided to stop purchasing meat, butter and wool from New Zealand
due to Wellington's negative response.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the recalling of ambassadors means a
big backward in Iran's relations with EU countries though they do
not officially downgrade their diplomatic ties from ambassador
level to the level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
The EU political measure has frustrated Iran's efforts to fight
against isolation and embargo by the United States. Nevertheless,
EU's reaction has been within the political and diplomatic
area. It is believed that They are not going to impose economic
sanctions under the pressure from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
In a response to the EU's political action, the Iranian
government declared that it will recall its ambassadors as a
tit-for-tat measure against European countries.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin high court in its verdict on April 10 accused
Iranian leadership of ordering the assassination of four exiled
Kurdish opposition leaders in Mykono restaurant in Berlin in
1992. The move triggered the diplomatic row between Germany and
Iran. It will also greatly affect economic and trade relations
between Iran and EU member states, which take a share of 41.3
percent of total imports and 32.8 percent of the total exports of
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Securities Legislation at Critical Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's securities legislation
has entered a crucial period in its long-term process of
establishment and perfection, a senior legislative official
said today.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the emerging but immature Chinese securities market,
the task to establish a complete legal framework becomes all the
more urgent, and to establish a unified securities market in
China, uniformity of legislation should be pursued," said Bian
Yaowu, deputy director of the Commission of Legislative Affairs
of the Standing Committee of National People's Congress, China's
top legislature, at an international conference of securities
regulatory committees.
</P>
<P>
The official pointed out that securities trading rules will be
an important part of the upcoming securities law, in order to
ensure orderly and safe securities transactions.
</P>
<P>
"The law should provide severe penalties on illegal activities
like insider trading and securities price manipulation," Bian
said, adding that the legal framework will also take into account
regulations on information disclosure and access to the securities
industry.
</P>
<P>
The legal official also called for stock exchanges to be
further standardized, saying that stock exchanges should be set up
only in a small number and adopt unified forms and standards, and
the law also needs to cover qualifications, rights, and duties of
their staff.
</P>
<P>
China has formulated a series of securities regulations and
rules since 1993, and the draft Securities Law is still being
examined by the nation's legislative body, said Bian.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the inclusion of securities crimes in the new
criminal law as a "necessary act" to standardize the market for a
sustained and sound development.
</P>
<P>
"A primary goal of securities legislation is to protect the
investors, and to do this, we also need to turn to the power of
the law to further standardize the market and curb
excessive speculation and irregularities," he noted.

<HEADLINE> ANA Donates to Building a School in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- All Nippon Airways (ANA), one of
the leading carriers in Japan, has donated 300,000 yuan to China's
Hope Project for building a primary school in Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
ANA made the donation upon the tenth anniversary of the first
air routes to China. The money will be used to build a primary
school named ANA Blue Sky Hope Primary School in Sandigoumen
Village about 150 km from Beijing, according to Seiji Fukatsu,
ANA's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
The school, built for about 200 school-age children in the
village, is scheduled to open on September 1.
</P>
<P>
ANA operates nine services between Tokyo and Osaka and Beijng,
Dalian, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Hong Kong which is scheduled to
return to the motherland on July 1, said Fukatsu. The carrier
initiated its first China-Japan route in April, 1987.
</P>
<P>
He added the passenger flow on ANA's China-Japan routes surged
six times over the past decade, and it now accounts for one forth
of the total on the carrier's international routes.
</P>
<P>
"We have already regarded the routes to China as the most
important market for our international service," Fukatsu noted,
adding that ANA is applying for permission to extend services to
Tianjin, Shenyang, and other Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The International Air Transport Association estimates that air
transport in the Asia-Pacific region will make up half of the
world's total, and that between China and Japan will expand
especially rapidly.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Average Growth Estimated at 2.9 Pct: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia's annual economic
growth would be at an average of 2.9 percent in the remaining
years of this decade, but it would be still faster than the
average growth of 2.7 percent projected for the world economy
during 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
The estimates were given today by the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the average economic growth rate predicted by
the Australian Government in its last year's budget was 3.5
percent, and in order to reduce unemployment, the country needs to
keep its growth rate at 4.5 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP expects Australia's inflation rate to climb to an average
of 3.4 percent. Last month Treasurer Peter Costello said inflation
remained the key determining factor in setting official interest
rates in Australia.
</P>
<P>
An ESCAP survey for 1997 projected annual gross domestic
product (GDP) growth for economies in the region, at 6.7 percent a
year, slower than that in the past five years, and Australia's GDP
growth is expected to be below the average.

<HEADLINE> China Takes Firm Measures to Relieve Farmers' Burdens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China will take tough measures to
punish local government officials who impose heavy financial
burdens on farmers, according to the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
Heavy financial burdens imposed on farmers have become a
prominent problem affecting the country's rural reform,
development, and stability, according to a circular issued jointly
by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Chinese
Communist Party and the Ministry of Supervision.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide inspection of the work to reduce farmers'
burdens will be carried out by the Party and the government
disciplinary inspection and supervision organizations at all
levels, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
"Any leads to cases involving the imposition of financial
burdens on farmers will be investigated and dealt with," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
"Leading local goverment officials will be blamed if severe
cases of imposing heavy burdens on farmers are discovered in that
region," the document warned.
</P>
<P>
"An inspection and supervision mechanism must be established
and improved with farmers serving as supervisors, liaison workers,
and information collectors in these efforts," it said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Receive Two Million Overseas Visitors in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Over two million overseas people
are estimated to tour Shanghai in the year of 2000, bringing the
city 17 billion yuan (more than two billion U.S. dollars) of
tourism income.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Shanghai vice-mayor Chen Liangyu at a
convention of the Pacific Asian Travel Association (PATA) here
today.
</P>
<P>
Chen told the convention that Shanghai has made a profit of
1.17 billion U.S. dollars by receiving over 1.4 million tourists
last year, an increase of 3.7 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is expected to receive nearly 200,000 visitors more
each year, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has become a tourist destination for seven overseas
visitors out of every ten.
</P>
<P>
Chen, one of the city's decision-makers, said that Shanghai is
making tourism a new economic growth area of the city.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that it is possible for Shanghai tourism to
grow at an annual speed of eight percent. Shanghai used to be the
most important metropolis of industry, economy, trade, and culture
in China's modern history.
</P>
<P>
Currently Shanghai is a leading city across the country in
terms of development pace, scale, and economic returns of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The Municipal government has announced Tuesday that two
agencies were formed to outline comprehensive plans of tourism and
coordinate the city's tourism development.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has over 260 travel agents, 118 star-level hotels with
over 30,000 rooms, and over 50 high schools and colleges of
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai connects itself with nearly 90 domestic and overseas
cities in the air as it has become the hub of over 300 air
routes. This largest port city of China also receives some 20
luxury pleasure boats each year.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Rebel Leader Kabila Leaves Zaire for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebel leader Laurent
Kabila left Lubumbashi, southern Zaire, today for South Africa to
discuss the Zairean crisis with President Nelson Mandela, a
report reaching here this afternoon said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Kabila departed at 11:40 am (0940
gmt) on a South African air force jet bound for Cape Town after a
two-day visit to the second largest city of Zaire. His forces
captured the capital city of the mineral-rich Shaba Province on
April 9.
</P>
<P>
The report said, their discussions will center on arrangements
for face to face talks between Kabila and Zairean President
Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo on Tuesday
predicted "dramatic progress within days" in ending the civil war
in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance of Domocratic Forces for the Liberiation of
Congo-Zaire led by Kabila took arms last October in eastern Zaire
to topple President Mobutu. In less than six months, the rebels have
occupied more than half of the third largest country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kabila's forces are now 300 km away
from the Zairean capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan yesterday appealed to UN
members to press Kabila to seek a negotiated solution through a
ceasefrire and sustained talks on Zaire's future.
</P>
<P>
However, Kabila refused the appeal, saying "how can I
declare a ceasefire when the people are against one? The people
do not want a ceasefire, they want an end to this corrupt regime."
</P>
<P>
"A ceasefire would be against the people's will," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Voices Resolute Opposition to US F-16 Sales To Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China has urged the United States
to promptly correct its wrongful decision to provide Taiwan with
F-16 fighter jets, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang said
today.
</P>
<P>
Shen said this follows a decision made by the United States in
1992 about the jet sale, in complete disregard of the opposition
of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, decided to sell
150 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The move, in direct violation of the August 17 Joint Communique
of the two countries, interferes with China's internal affairs and
has seriously impaired the great cause of the Chinese people for
the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and brought grave
harm to Sino-US relations as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
In noting that the Chinese government lodged a strong protest
with the US side on the issue, he said that today the US insists
on carrying out its wrongful decision in spite of protests and
representations by the Chinese side, which is again expressing its
utmost indignation and resolute opposition to this and has already
made stern representations to the US on this matter.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the United States immediately adopt effective
measures to correct its wrongful decision on selling F-16 fighter
aircraft to Taiwan and that it return to the right track of
conforming to the three Sino-US joint declarations so as to avoid
causing fresh damage to the Sino-US relations," Spokesman Shen
Guofang said.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Expected to Grow 8.7 Percent Annually To 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy will grow at
an annual rate of 8.7 percent for the remaining part of the
century, according to a report from the United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), issued
today.
</P>
<P>
Viet Nam is expected to lead Asia and the Pacific region's
economic development with a rate of 9.9 percent, and the
Asia-Pacific region will continue to be most economically vigorous
area in the world, with its economy continuing a yearly rate of
6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Globally, the report said, the third world's economic growth
will be ahead of that of advanced economies by 2.8 percentage
points. The former is expected to grow at 4.9 percent every year.
</P>
<P>
The report cautioned countries in the Asia-Pacific region
about demographic changes, as the ratio of elderly rises
substantially. "By the year 2020, it is estimated that the
developing economies of today will have a fourth of their
populations below the age of 25 and about 12 percent over age 60,"
the report says.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more people will move from rural to urban areas by
2020, pushing up the urban population ratio overall to 50.8
percent from the current 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
ESCAP was founded in 1947 in Shanghai and later moved its
headquarters to Bangkok. This is its 50th annual report on the
region' social and economic development.

<HEADLINE> Island to Build Two Rail Links to Mainland (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South China's island province of
Hainan plans to build two rail links across the Qiongzhou Strait
to connect it with neighboring Guangdong Province and Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region to the north.
</P>
<P>
The new railway lines, including ferry facilities across the
33-km strait, are expected to ease the pressure on strained
transport services between the island and the mainland, according
to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of rail links, Hainan, a main vegetable
provider in winter, transports most of its vegetables by road,
which costs much more than rail transport, the officials explained.
</P>
<P>
The cost difference in 1995 was estimated at 320 million yuan,
and will reach 1.6 to 1.8 billion yuan by 2000, they said, adding
that the development of several large industrial projects in
Hainan also increased the demand on rail links between the island
and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
A rail line between Hainan and Guangdong, including a section
from Maoming in southwest Guangdong to Hai'an at the seaside, a
ferry between Hai'an and Haikou in Hainan, and a section between
Haikou and Chahe, was approved by the central government in 1993.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million yuan have so far been invested in the
five-billion yuan project, which is jointly undertaken by the two
provinces and the Ministry of Railways. However, construction of
the Hainan-Guangdong rail link has been slowed down due to a
shortage of funding.

<P>
Hainan therefore plans to build another rail link between
Hainan and Guangxi first, which is estimated to cost only 1.78
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of the Hainan-Guangxi link is that the
recently-opened Nanning-Kunming railway provides a main rail
passage to the vast southwest region, which includes Guangxi and
the two provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
The Hainan-Guangxi line is designed to include a ferry between
Qinzhou, a coastal port in Guangxi, and Yangpu in Haikou, and a
section from Yangpu down to Sanya, the southernmost city in China.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is expected to have a passenger volume of 830.74 million
and a cargo volume of 376.39 million tons by the year 2010, which
will provide enough demand for the two rail links, according to
experts from the No. 4 Surveying and Designing Institute under the
Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
They said the eastern Hainan-Guangdong railway mainly will
carry passengers, while the western Hainan-Guangxi will handle
cargo transport. Central and provincial authorities will be the
chief investors in the Hainan-Guangdong rail link, and local
authorities and enterprises will operate the Hainan-Guangxi line.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility report on the Hainan-Guangxi railway has been
completed by the institute, and some domestic and overseas
businesses interested in the construction of the new railway have
approached authorities in the two provinces.

<HEADLINE> Diarrhea Hits Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Diarrhea in Bangladesh's capital
city, Dhaka, has taken a serious turn over the last week with
about 600 diarrhea cases reported every day to the diarrhea
hospital in the city, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot term the present situation epidemic, but it is true
that the situation is serious," Dr. Iqbal Kabir, scientist of the
International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, was quoted by
the English-language Independence as saying.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the spread of diarrhea to "contaminated" water
and was worried that the situation might get worse if adequate
steps were not taken to ensure the supply of pure drinking water
in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
The hospital was overcrowded with diarrhea patients, most of
them children from the city's suburbs. During the last week, the
number of diarrhea patients was 550 to 600 everyday on the
average.
</P>
<P>
"The number of patients is larger compared to the same period
during last two years," Dr. Kabir said.
</P>
<P>
The center has a capacity for treatment of about 200 patients
in normal situation. Hospital authority had to increase the number
of beds to tackle the situation. Tents have also been set up for
accommodating the patients.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Kabir, the number of patients is likely to
rise in the coming months. "Normally in July and August the number
of patients increases. This year the number may increase further,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Reiterates Decision to Step Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
reiterated today that he will definitely step down from office
when his term ends on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"My position is very clear and I've said it many times, I'll
graduate on the 30th of June 1998 from this office," Ramos said at
his weekly press conference.
</P>
<P>
The president was replying to a question that overseas
businessmen wanted him to run for a second term, which the
country's current constitution prohibits.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businessmen were reportedly worried that the political
and economic stability of the country might be affected if a new
government takes over.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has vowed repeatedly that he will not seek any
re-election. But his political critics are doubting this because
Ramos' supporters have been pushing for an amendment to the
charter to lift the term limit for all elective officials,
including Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Ramos ordered his ruling Lakas Party to
create a committee to recommend conditions for choosing his
successor. He is expected to soon anoint his successor, who will
run for the Lakas Party in the May 1998 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Among the possible presidential candidates in the
administration are Defense Secretary Renato de Villa, Speaker of
the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia, Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo and Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to Continue to Aid Tibet Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a top leader of the
Chinese Communist Party, has urged other provinces and regions to
continue to aid the development of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Li, a Standing Committee member of Political Bureau of the
Party Central Committee, said today that this is the basis of
various work projects in Tibet, and that "expanding Tibet's
economy is not a mere economic issue, but a great political issue
that has a vital bearing on Tibet's social stability and progress."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day meeting on economic assistance to Tiber
which ended here today, he pointed out that this work is related
directly to the struggle against the Dalai Lama's splittist
attempts and against international anti-Chinese forces, and an
issue on safeguarding China's unification.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, the central government, provinces,
and regions, especially economically-prosperous coastal ones, have
launched campaigns to provide economic, scientific and cultural
support for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, praised these selfless
efforts, and said they have helped forge closeer links
between Tibet and other regions and central government departments.

<HEADLINE> PNA, Israel Promise to Resume Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VALLETTA, MALTA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and Israel today promised to return to
negotiation table after a direct high-level meeting brokered by
the European Union here.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between PNA President Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy was held in a hotel outside the
capital of Malta under the presidency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
This is the first direct official meeting between the two
sides since the Middle East peace process plunged to the worst
crisis in its seven-year history.
</P>
<P>
During the twenty-minute meeting, Arafat and Levy pledged
commitment to the peace process and returning to the
negotiations, said Arafat's spokesman Marnan Kanafani said after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He described the meeting as a "good-will step" in pushing
ahead the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"There were warm and friendly exchanges of views" during
the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Levy expressed their appreciation to EU's efforts
in helping reactivate the stalled Middle East peace process, he
said.
</P>
<P>
An European Union (EU) source quoted Hans Van Mierlo,
foreign minister of the EU president, the Netherlands as saying
that the meeting will help "overcome the psychological obstacles"
in reviving the Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
Also present at Arafat-Levy meeting were PNA Minister of
Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath,
European Middle East peace envoy Miquel Moratinos, French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Turning down reports saying that both Palestinian and Israeli
sides did not want to talk with each other despite EU
mediation, another EU source said they both expressed willingness
to talk but citing "usefulness" as the precondition.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries and the Palestinian National Authority have
suspended normalization process of their relations with Israel in
protest of Israeli hard-line policy in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, now coupled by daily stone-throwing incidents in
the West Bank, was triggered off with Israeli settlement policy
carried out a month ago in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Levy are attending the current
European-Mediterranean conference here, which devoted much of its
discussions to the impact of the faltering Middle East peace
process on the cooperation scheme between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Europe scored by successfully
brokering the Arafat-Levy meeting in its efforts to seek a
bigger role in the region aimed at counterbalance the United
States influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the most important mediator in Middle
East peace. But its Israeli-biased stand costs Arab's trust in
it.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Levy had separate meetings with EU
delegations at the conference last night. Earlier, they shook
hands with each other while taking a family photo of all the
participants of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the second of the type, is being attended
by the 15 EU members and their 12 Mediterranean neighbors,
which include all the major parties directly involved in the
Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Wool Market Set for Gradual Recovery in 1997-98: WI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Wool International (WI) today
released its first forecast for wool prices in 1997-98, saying it
expected a gradual but subdued recovery in the market.
</P>
<P>
WI, charged with selling off the wool stockpile, said
Australia's eastern market indicator was expected to average 630
Australian cents (491.5 U.S. cents) in 1997-98, plus or minus 100
Australian cents (78 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
WI also predicted that average wool price for 1996-97 would
remain unchanged at 600 Australian cents (468 U.S. cents) per
kilogram, assuming that prices would remain at the current level
during the final quarter of the season.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly insight newsletter, WI spokesman Bill Watkins
was quoted as saying, "WI expected some pick-up on the basis of
exports to China and others and economic recovery in Western
Europe."
</P>
<P>
Currently around 824,000 bales of wool is held in growers'
stocks, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Australia's chief commodities forecaster, the Australian Bureau
of Agricultural and Resource Economics, has earlier predicted an
average indicator price of 600 cents per kilogram this fiscal year
and 650 cents (20 cents more) per kilogram for 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Expresses Condolences Over Those Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The King of Saudi Arabia Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz expressed condolence over the death of those
killed, at least 217, in the fire outside the Holy city of Mecca
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd demanded that speedy aid be provided to the wounded
until their full recovery, Saudi Press Agency reports said..
</P>
<P>
A gas cylinder exploded Tuesday, setting some 70,000 tents
ablaze in the holy plain of Mena, a holy site of the the annual
pilgrimage Hajj in Saudi Arabia, some 11 kilometers outside Mecca.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of the fire rose to 217 pilgrims and 1290 were
wounded, according to latest official figures available here today.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency quoted a statement made by Director General
of the Saudi Civil Defense Department Mohammed Bin Ali Al-Sumaili
as saying that most of the casualties were caused by critical
injuries sustained by pilgrims as a result of the blazes.
</P>
<P>
He also said that scores of pilgrims were in critical
condition and are under treatment.
</P>
<P>
Prince Majed Bin Abdul-Aziz, the Amir of Mecca and Chairman
of the central Hajj Committee, has issued orders to the
authorities to provide tents and food for the ill-stricken
pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
A very tough job was started to clear the huge area hit by the
fire and to repair the damage inflicted to power sources, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The fire stricken pilgrims had moved to Mount Arafat to
perform Hajj early this morning.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest tragedy to hit Hajj in Saudi Arabia
which had drawn about 2 million Muslim pilgrims from various
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The people who were killed in the fire were mainly Indians,
Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.
</P>
<P>
The annual Hajj has seen tragedies in recent years despite
Saudi Arabia made every possible efforts to ensure the safety for
the pilgrims and provide convenience to the pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
The worst of the recent Mecca tragedies was a stampede during
the 1990 Hajj in which 1426 pilgrims were crushed to death in a
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, 270 pilgrims were killed during a stampede at
Mena. In March 1991 a plane crash in northern Saudi Arabia killed
91 Senegalese soldiers returning from a trip to Mecca.

JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South African bank staff
are more afraid of armed robberies than retrenchment or any other
dangers, local daily "The Star" reported today.
</P>

The significant increase in the number of bank robberies has

Bob Tucker, chief chief executive officer of the Council of South

the cost may eventually have to be passed on to the consumer.

Tucker believed that more could be done to curb bank
robberies.

He also suggested the national bank system take more

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is scheduled to hold a
trade exhibition in Ethiopia in June this year to tap the
unexploited Horn of Africa markets.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the Network Business Promotion (NBP),
organizer of the fair, said that Kenyan companies have to divert
their trading interests and partners to the Horn of Africa as "we
are facing stiff competition from South Africa in our traditional
markets of Uganda and Tanzania."
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that Kenyan companies wishing to make
business contacts in the sub-region will benefit from the low
tariffs and political stability in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
NBP Director Jeremiah Nyagah said he expected about 50 Kenyan
companies to participate in the exhibition which he said will
attract businessmen from Ethiopia, Yemen, Djibouti and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major trade fair to be held by Kenyan firms
in Ethiopia with a population of 52.8 million people.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Network Business Promotion staged a "Kenya in
Uganda" exhibition where more than 50 Kenyan companies took part
and made business deals worth 22 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the same organizer staged a "Kenya in Tanzania" show
where Kenyan participants accrued orders worth about 37 million
Dollars.

JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Demark is considering to
cut much of its foreign aid to South Africa next year in favor of
projects in other countries of the southern African region, a
local daily "The Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Danish Minister of Development and Cooperation Poul Nielson
was quoted by the report as saying in Cape Town on Tuesday that
Denmark, which committed about 112 million U.S. Dollars to South
Africa between 1994 and 1998, will thereafter give aid to more
challenging and difficult nations in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, Nielson said his country was very happy with how
South Africa had used Danish aid resources.
</P>
<P>
He said about one-third of the Danish aid package, including
joint ventures between Danish companies and their black South
African counterparts, will continue beyond the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed that the Danish government will continue to
commit one percent of its annual gross domestic product to
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior South African official thanked the Danish
government for the invaluable technical support, expertise and
funds given to South Africa, citing the planned aid cut is part
of a "normalization process" in relations between the two
countries.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Investment Promotion
Center (IPC) of Tanzania has approved 854 projects worth about
2.5 billion U.S. Dollars since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Ole Naiko, IPC's Director of investment, said on

of 140,000 people.
</P>
<P>
He was presenting a paper at an one-day seminar on Tanzania

Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The IPC director said 85 percent of projects approved since
1990 have been focused in mining, agriculture, fisheries,
manufacturing and tourism.
</P>
<P>
He said privatized industries at the time also showed positive
results. Their productivity was increased, making Tanzania's
potentials more attractive to foreign investors, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Naiko said plans were underway to enact a law which will lead
to creation of an investment authority.
</P>
<P>
"The new IPC will be the body responsible for dealing directly
with the established bureaucracy on behalf of the investors" in
terms of acquiring land, getting permits, obtaining licenses and
residence permits, he said.

<P>
The body will also assist investors in completing other
necessary formalities like tax compliances, he added.

this sector.
</P>
<P>
He Shaohua, vice mayor of Chengdu, attributed the rapid growth
of commerce and trade to a great expansion of local markets in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The local government has invested one billion yuan in building
745 new markets and 1,100 shops.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu has also become an exhibition center. The national

<HEADLINE> Zambia Slows Down Pace of Mining Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
reviewing some of the privatization packages of the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) "because they are not in favor
of Zambians", Mining Minister Christon Tembo has said.
</P>
<P>
After Konkola, northern Zambia, the minister said he was not
happy with the way some of the packages have been offered in the
bids, pressing for re-negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today quoted him as saying that after the
sale of ZCCM, private monopolies should not be created and the
government is determined to ensure that the sale of ZCCM should
benefit the Zambian people.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said he was prepared to slow down the pace of the
privatization process to ensure that Zambians and the government
receive maximum benefits.
</P>
<P>
The bids for the mines and assets of ZCCM opened at the end of
February this year, and under the government plan the ZCCM
privatization will completed next year.

<HEADLINE> Top S. African Executive Managers Get Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's top
executive managers are commanding higher salaries of 25 and 50
percent above market rate.
</P>
<P>
Jim Steer, director of DSA-Contact, a major human resource
consultants of the country, said on Tuesday that premiums of this
magnitude are paid only for experienced, top executives who have
proven abilities.
</P>
<P>
Steer said South Africa's business community was like a
village, the best, successful executive were well-known within
their respective industries and were frequently targeted by
head-hunters.
</P>
<P>
Companies wishing to recruit these "high-flyers" could expect
to pay a hefty premium to induce them to move from one top-level
position to another, particularly when they had to be compensated
for share options and incentives offered in their existing
positions, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, highly publicized salary packages paid to top
executives who were haed-hunted, would bear little resemblance to
market-related rates paid to executives with lower profiles or
new entrants to the top rank of executives, he added.
</P>
<P>
The size of South Africa's pool of top executives was believed
to have not increased over the past 15 years, except for the
addition of a small number of Black executives who were in more
demand than their white counterparts.

<HEADLINE> China's Quarterly Tax Revenues Up 17.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial and commercial
tax revenues grew 17.5 percent on a yearly basis to 156.65 billion
yuan (about 18.87 billion US dollars) in the first quarter of this
year, according to the State Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
That is an increase of 22.3 billion yuan over the same period
of last year, and 22.5 percent of this year's targeted figure.
</P>
<P>
Quarterly central tax revenues were 84.7 billion yuan, up 17.7
percent over a year ago, while local tax revenues rose 17.3
percent to 71.948 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from domestic value-added tax and the consumer tax,
two major items in China's new tax system introduced in 1994, were
up 17.2 percent on a yearly basis to 85.39 billion yuan in the
first three months.
</P>
<P>
The southern city of Shenzhen reported the largest increase in
industrial and commercial tax revenues for the period, followed by
Yunnan Province, the city of Qingdao, and Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
An SAT official said that there were still problems in the
collection of industrial and commercial taxes in the first three
months, and pointed to a resurgence in delayed tax payments,
stagnant growth in commercial tax revenues, and poor sales for
some enterprises that are major tax sources.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, industrial and commercial tax defaults
increased by more than 10 billion yuan during the period.
Value-added taxes from the commercial sector grew a mere 5.4
percent over a year ago to 18.42 billion yuan in the first three
months, with the rate much lower than that of retail sales during
the same period.

<HEADLINE> Bank Steps out to Control Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank plans
to reform its outdated accounting and auditing system to deal with
the increasing number of financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qishan, the bank's president, said that the accounting and
auditing system still in use is not capable of meeting the bank's
growing needs for commercialization.
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of an advanced accounting or examination
system, commercial banks will be unable to expand their business,"
Wang noted in a speech at a meeting on accounting.
</P>
<P>
All the main state-owned banks in China began to turn
themselves into commercial banks several years ago to adapt to
tough market competition, but an effective accounting and auditing
system is yet to be introduced, and it is what commercial banks
need most, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that his bank will gradually separate these functions
of accountants from those of auditors. Previously accounting and
auditing were combined as one, and the bank will restrict the
power of presidents of its 45 branches at the provincial level to
extend loans.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also put a spending ceiling on each branch bank
at the county level, and keep a close watch on the performance of
each branch every year, he said.

<HEADLINE> 33 Civil Servants of S. Leone on Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, April 16 (Xinhua) - A total of 33 civil servants of
Sierra Leone, charged with corruption, appeared at a magistrate
court in capital Freetown today.
</P>
<P>
The accused, mainly middle-level accountants including seven
women, are from the ministries of health, fisheries and marine
resources and the treasury.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution, led by Attorney-General Solomon Berewa, said
the 33 people, 18 of whom are from the Health Ministry and the
Treasury, "falsified the government payroll to include people who
were not employed by the state and stole millions of Leones from
the state coffer from 1994 to 1996."
</P>
<P>
On the growing corruption in the civil service, Berewa said
the gap between revenue and expenditure has been growing over the
years.
</P>
<P>
"Part of this has to do with dishonesty by public officials
who operate within a complex conspiratorial web, particularly in
the Treasury," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Within the scheme, only a fraction of the revenue collected
on behalf of government by individuals was reported," said
Berewa.
</P>
<P>
"Ghost workers (non-existent workers whose names are still in
the state payroll) make the government keep paying huge sums into
the pockets of a few fraudulent individuals," he added.

<P>
VALLETTA (MALTA), April 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy met and held talks here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first direct official meeting between the two
sides since the Middle East peace process plunged to the worst
crisis in its seven-year history.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in a hotel outside the capital of Malta
under the presidency of the European Union and their talks
centered on the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, according
to sources of the Euro-Med Conference.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting, Arafat and Levy expressed their
appreciation to EU's efforts in helping reactivate the stalled
Middle East peace process, an European Union (EU) source said.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Hans Van Mierlo, foreign minister of the
EU president, the Netherlands as saying that the meeting will
help "overcome the psychological obstacles" in reviving the Middle
East peace.
</P>
<P>
Also present at Arafat-Levy meeting were European Middle East
peace envoy Miquel Moratinos, French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
European Middle East peace envoy Miquel Moratinos is present at
the on-going meeting.
</P>
<P>
Turning down reports saying that both Palestinian and Israeli
sides did not want to talk with each other despite EU mediation,
the sources said they both expressed willingness to talk but
citing "usefulness" as the precondition.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries and the Palestinian National Authority have
suspended normalization process of their relations with Israel in
protest of Israeli hard-line policy in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, now coupled by daily stone-throwing incidents in
the West Bank, was triggered off with Israeli settlement policy
carried out a month ago in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Levy are attending the current
European-Mediterranean conference here, which devoted much of its
discussions to the impact of the faltering Middle East peace
process on the cooperation scheme between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Europe scored by successfully
brokering the Arafat-Levy meeting in its efforts to seek a bigger
role in the region aimed at counterbalance the United States
influence in the regin.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the most important mediator in Middle
East peace. But its Israeli-biased stand costs Arab's trust in
it.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Levy had separate meetings with EU delegations
at the conference last night. Earlier, they shook hands with
each other while taking a family photo of all the participants of
the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the second of the type, is being attended by

CHANGCHUN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Jilin Province plans to
bring in four billion US dollars worth of investment from abroad
in the 1996-2000 period, a provincial government official said
here recently.
</P>
<P>
The figure is 45 percent more than for the previous five-year
period, he said, and 370 million US dollars will be used to import
advanced technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The import and export volume of the province is expected to
reach five billion US dollars by the year of 2000, and have an
annual increase of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has reported marked progress in foreign trade in the past
few years, with 2.6 billion US dollars worth of exports and
imports last year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, imports and exports as a percentage of
Jilin's GDP, had gone from 5.5 percent in 1990 to 16.3 percent,
and foreign exchange earned by overseas-funded firms from exports
made up 16.26 percent of the province's total.
</P>
<P>
A province-wide drive to readjust the export structure in
recent years has boosted exports of industrial products. The
number of types of manufactured goods for export has risen to over

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reviews Decree to Boost Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
planning a major review of the Nigerian Investment Promotion
Commission (NIPC) Decree 16 of 1995 in a bid to boost inflow of
direct foreign investment into the country.
</P>
<P>
The review is in consonance with the promise of Head of State
General Sani Abacha in this year's budget to abrogate all laws
inhibiting investments in key sectors of the national economy,
the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the liberalization of the investment laws in recent
years, foreign investors are still reluctant to invest in the
non-oil sectors of the Africa's largest oil producing country,
due to various stringent procedures, especially in terms of
license registration.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment to the NIPC decree would ensure that
the power to register and license potential investors is vested
in the commission which is yet to be inaugurated, said the
national newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Levy Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VALLETTA (MALTA), April 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy met and held talks here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first direct official meeting between the two
sides since the Middle East peace process plunged to the worst
crisis in its seven-year history.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in a hotel outside the capital of Malta
under the presidency of the European Union and their talks
centered on the stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, according
to sources of the Euro-Med Conference.
</P>
<P>
But details of the meeting are not available.
</P>
<P>
European Middle East peace envoy Miquel Moratinos is present at
the on-going meeting, an European Union (EU) source said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Turning down reports saying that both Palestinian and Israeli
sides did not want to talk with each other despite EU
mediation, the source said they both expressed willingness to
talk but citing "usefulness" as the precondition.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries and the Palestinian National Authority have
suspended normalization process of their relations with Israel in
protest of Israeli hard-line policy in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The crisis, now coupled by daily stone-throwing incidents in
the West Bank, was triggered off with Israeli settlement policy
carried out a month ago in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Levy are attending the current
European-Mediterranean conference here, which devoted much of its
discussions to the impact of the faltering Middle East peace
process on the cooperation scheme between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Europe scored by successfully
brokering the Arafat-Levy meeting in its efforts to seek a bigger
role in the region aimed at counterbalance the United States
influence in the regin.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the most important mediator in Middle
East peace. But its Israeli-biased stand costs Arab's trust in
it.
</P>
<P>
Both Arafat and Levy had separate meetings with EU delegations
at the conference last night. Earlier, they shook hands with
each other while taking a family photo of all the participants of
the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference, the second of the type, is being attended by
the 15 EU members and their 12 Mediterranean neighbors, which
include all the major parties directly involved in the Middle
East peace process.

<HEADLINE> 2 Hezbollah Fighters Killed in Israel's Swoop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Two guerrillas of the Lebanese
Hezbollah, or Party of God, were killed in the first clash with
Israeli forces in south Lebanon in a month, Beirut's press
reported Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops punched out of the occupied border strip Tuesday
morning to hunt down two Hezbollah fighters in a combat
reminiscent of Israel's grapes of wrath operation in April 1996
that claimed some 200 Lebanese lives, most of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
The daily Star, the only English daily in Beirut, said that
troops belonging to Israel's special force, known by their Hebrew
name of Egoz, thrust out of the so-called "security zone" and
raided the guerrillas at Wadi Froum some three kilometers north of
the demarcation line.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah admitted the losing of two fighters, Ali Ahmed Nazzal,
24, and Ahmed Mohammed Alayan, 20, in the pre-dawn battle, which
raged for more than 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Nazzal was buried in his hometown of Srifa and Alayan in
Qalawiyeh after midday prayers Tuesday, the report added.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah statement said there were casualties among the
Israelis, which Israel denied.
</P>
<P>
Voice of the South Radio, mouthpiece of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army militia (SLA), quoted Major General Amiram
Levine, Israel's northern front commander, as congratulating the
soldiers "for a job well done."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the attackers were members of Egoz, the
special force whose main task is to track and hunt down resistance
fighters before they are able to penetrate the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, which spearheads a guerrilla warfare in south
Lebanon to oust the Israeli occupation forces, has refrained from
pointing its barrel at the Israelis in nearly one month.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in recent weeks has pitted only the SLA, Israel's
client militia patrolling the buffer enclave, against the Lebanese
resistance militants.
</P>
<P>
In the last of three attacks since this month, a SLA militiaman
was killed and two others were wounded when Hezbollah fighters
detonated a roadside bomb near Teir Harfa on the edge of the
western sector of the zone last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 to protect its northern border.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and British
sides on the Sino-British Land Commission reached agreement here
today on the land disposal program for the period from April 1 to
June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
At the 34th meeting of the commission held this morning, the
two sides agreed that 98.76 hectares of land will be granted for
the last quarter before the handover.
</P>
<P>
The land comprises 8.15 hectares for commercial, residential
and industrial development, 4.45 hectares for the Private Sector
Participation Scheme, Hong Kong Housing Society development and
Village Housing, 1.42 hectares for public utilities, educational,
welfare, religious, recreational and other uses and 84.74 hectares
as special requirements.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing after the meeting, Chen Rongchun, Chinese
senior representative to the commission, reassured that after the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) government, all the assets of the HKSAR Government Land
Fund will be transferred to the HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
The fund has been managed by trustees on the authorization of
China's central government, since its founding over 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-British Land Commission is also due to dissolve on
midnight June 30.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Company to Export Medicines to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has approved
two contracts for a Jordanian firm to supply Iraq with medicines
in line with the UN oil-for-food agreement with Iraq, the
Jordanian news agency Petra reported today.
</P>
<P>
Petra quoted Anis Muasher, chairman of the Arab Pharmaceutical
Manufacturing Co. (APMC), as saying that his company approved by
the Iraqi government, will dispatch the first shipment of
medicines to Baghdad in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The chairman added that the two contracts are part of the 26
deals, worth 20 million U.S. dollars, that the APMC has signed
with Baghdad. The remaining contracts will be approved soon, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The new approval brings to 13 companies the number of
Jordanian firms which received the U.N. permission to supply Iraq
with the humanitarian need.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the world body approved 11 contracts to supply the
sanction-hit country with 35 million dollars of detergents and
cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 Jordanian firms are still awaiting to receive the
U.N. consent.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food accord Iraq is permitted to sell 2
billion dollars worth of oil, 1.3 billion dollars of which will be
funneled to Iraq to buy food and other necessities for its 19
million citizens.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Iraq lashed out at the U.N. for being
responsible for the delayed delivery of medicines Iraq bought
under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with U.N.-Iraqi agreement, Iraq gets
humanitarian purchases through the Jordanian port of Aqaba,
Iraqi port of Um Qasr and through Iraqi northern borders with
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has maintained its seven-year embargo on Iraq since
the Gulf War when the Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait
following its invasion of the oil-rich neighbor in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Although official business exchange between Jordan and Iraq is
extremely difficult due to the U.N. embargo policy, unofficial
exchange seems to boom.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian and Iraqi businessmen on March 31 signed a
memorandum of understanding in Amman, which called for joint
ventures among businessmen in the two countries, exchange of
visits by trade delegations and holding trade fairs in their
respective capitals.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf crisis, Jordan sided with Iraq but distanced
itself from Iraq after the war.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Take Measures Against Shipping Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Marine Department
 will take a series of safety measures to forestall the
increasing accidents on the Hong Kong sea waters.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 27 people were injured when a catamaran carrying
121 passengers and eight crew members collided with a car carrier
in western Hong Kong waters.
</P>
<P>
The collision caught the attention of the local communities and
the Marine Department which issued a warning for shipping
accidents.
</P>
<P>
According to the warning, booming port traffic could raise by
nearly half the annual number of marine accidents by the year 2011.
</P>
<P>
The department is stepping up policing and prosecutions among
the proposals outlined in conclusions from a two-year study on
making the territory's waterways safer.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by Au Posford consultants, forecasts a 43
percent rise in marine accidents -- from 223 in 1994 to 333 by
2011 -- unless urgent measures are taken.
</P>
<P>
Besides collisions, the study tackled incidents such as ships
running aground or catching fire.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended more government control over vessel
movements, enforced by prosecution if necessary.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that the Marine Department boosts the number
of patrol crafts, provide more training for staff in the Vessel
Traffic Center and divert traffic from the most congested areas
and "black spots".

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Plans To Counter Its Pollution Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- This pollution-threatened
capital of south China's Guangdong Province has signed a contract
for a waste-water treatment system to purify 400,000 cubic meters
of effluent a day.
</P>
<P>
The Xilang Sewage Treatment System will be built in two steps
by the Lemna Co, a US firm, beginning sometime after June, said
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The system will help reduce water pollution along the Guangzhou
stretch of the Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the new treatment system will cost 1 billion
yuan (120 million US dollars) and will be ready for use in the
year 2000. It will be able to cleanse 200,000 cubic meters of
waste water a day.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's water supply facilities are often imperilled by
polluted water.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, 500 kg of heavy oil leaked into the Pearl River
300 m from the intake valve of the Baihedong water supply plant
when workers were unloading a Yuexing Shipping Co vessel in a
protected zone.
</P>
<P>
The plant was forced to cut off the water supply to residents
of the Fangcun district for more than three days as a precaution
against polluting their drinking water, said Tan Xiaomei, the
secretary of the water company.
</P>
<P>
"The incident, the most serious in the company's history,
caused enormous financial losses," Tan said.
</P>
<P>
Nor were the district's inhabitants happy.
</P>
<P>
"We did not receive any notice. The water was suddenly cut
off," said a Guangzhou Shipping Co official, who gave his name
only as Zeng.
</P>
<P>
He said the water company must improve its service.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Economy Expected to Grow 6 Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's economy is expected to
grow 6 percent every year before 2000 after the country achieved a
moderate economic growth during the first half of the 1990s,
according to a survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
The Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 1997,
prepared by the Bangkok-based Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), said Nepal's average annual growth
rate of gross domestic product (GDP) during the period from 1990
to 1995 was about 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, such a moderate economic growth left little room for
any perceptible rise in Nepal's per capita income, which stands at
around 210 U.S. dollars at present, mainly due to the over
2-percent population growth every year, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
A shining point in the generally gray picture of Nepal's
economy painted by the ESCAP survey is that the economic growth
was 6 percent last year after the government adopted liberal
economic policies to encourage private investment including
foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that such a growth rate will be maintained in the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also pointed out that like other least developed
countries, Nepal's high dependence on agriculture limited its
capacity to attract foreign investment and participate in
international trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, Nepal attracted some 8 million dollars
of foreign direct investment in 1995 and its trade deficit still
represented a high percentage of GDP in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Northeastern Port City Using Foreign Funds for Retooling State-owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, a coastal city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, has used more than 700
million US dollars from some 50 countries and regions to improve
technology and equipment in state-owned enterprises over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
Local government has been encouraging state-owned firms to form
joint ventures for their land, workshops, and equipment. A Dalian
pen factory has spent 34 million yuan on a workshop and equipment
to form a joint venture with a Canadian firm that provided cash,
equipment, and technology.
</P>
<P>
Some of the better state-owned enterprises have opened
branches or trade offices in Southeast Asia and Europe. The
Bingshan (Iceberg) Group has set up 15 Sino-foreign joint
ventures, nine of which were built with the help of funds from
Japan's Sanyo.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the amount of overseas investment
absorbed by local industrial enterprises accounted for a quarter
of that in the city last year.

<HEADLINE> Sanwa's Shanghai Branch Relocates to Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the Sanwa
Bank Ltd. of Japan has relocated to the city's Pudong New Area to
qualify for business in the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese bank, one of eight overseas banks approved by the
People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, to deal in the
local Renminbi yuan, has moved to the 16th floor of the Shipping
Building.
</P>
<P>
Sanwa Shanghai will start the yuan-based business after passing
the examination by the Chinese central bank on the hardware it
uses, said Yoshiaki Kawamata, the branch president.
</P>
<P>
"We need to learn from our Chinese counterpart, as yuan-based
business is an entirely new field to us," he told Xinhua, adding
that he is confident in the prospects of the new business.
</P>
<P>
China's central bank has approved two groups of eight overseas
banks to deal in the yuan on a trial basis in Shanghai's Pudong
New Area, a financial and trade district separated from downtown
Shanghai by the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
As a qualification for the new business, the overseas banks
must move their Shanghai branch to Pudong, though they are allowed
to retain a sub-branch in the downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
The overseas banks can accept yuan deposits from the
overseas-funded enterprises registered in Shanghai and from
overseas individuals, and they can extend yuan loans to
Shanghai-based overseas-funded enterprises and to state-owned
Chinese enterprises, according to rules set by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Sanwa's Shanghai branch was set up in May 1991 and has since
participated in a number of syndicated loans to China's major
construction projects. The Japanese bank has another two branches
in China, in southern Shenzhen City and northeastern Dalian City.

<HEADLINE> Japan Shuts Down Nuke Power Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A tritium leakage has prompted
Japan's Power and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (Donen) to
shut down an advanced thermal reactor, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Donen's delayed report on the accident has angered Japan's
Science and Technology Agency, which ordered the shutdown of the
Fugen reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, on late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tritium leakage is the third accident to have occurred at
the Donen's plants in less than one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Sodium coolant leaked in December 1995 at the Monju prototype
fastbreeder reactor in Tsuruga, and an explosion happened in March
this year at a bituminization facility at the nuclear fuel
reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Fugen, the only heavy water reactor among the 50 nuclear
reactors now in use in Japan, started operation in 1979 with an
annual capacity of 165,000 kilowatt-hours.

<HEADLINE> China to Send All Top Players in Defence of Sudirman Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shuttlers, fresh from
their historic victory in the All-England championships, are
confident to retain the title in the Sudirman Cup World Badminton
Mixed Team Championships, which are scheduled in Glasgow, Britain,
on May 19.
</P>
<P>
They also eye for at least two titles in the 10th World
Championships following the team event.
</P>
<P>
Looking through the name lists of the 28 Glasgow-abound
players, no one has the doubt that these are only the odd dreams.
</P>
<P>
Olympic runner-up Dong Jiong and Sun Jun, ranked first and
second in the world, have the calibre for a big shot in the men's
singles.
</P>
<P>
Both have showed their top form last month by securing the top
two places in the men's singles in the All-England championships,
in which China bagged four out of the five titles on offer.
</P>
<P>
Women's world number one Ye Zhaoying, a member of the winning
team in the Sudirman Cup and singles title holder two years ago,
has regained her prowess again after a disppointing slump in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Ye breezed past compatriot Gong Zhichao, now
ranked second in the world, to win the women's singles in the
All-England tourney.
</P>
<P>
The world top two shuttlers are sure to launch a two-pronged
thrust at the women's singles.
</P>
<P>
World top duo Ge Fei and Gu Jun, who won the gold medal in the
Atlanta Olympic Games, are also favorites for the women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
China is also believed to be strong enough in the mixed doubles
event as the mixed tandem Liu Yong and Ge Fei boasted of their
unbeaten slate in 1997 by winning all the titles in their four
outings.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles event is the only weak link for the Chinese
team. But after a hard training session, Ge Cheng and Tao
Xiaoqiang, Liu Yong and Zhang Wei are capable of staging serious
threat to any pairs in the upcoming tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Privately-run enterprises and
individual household-operated firms contributed 12.5 billion yuan
to the economy of northwest China's Gansu Province last year,
emerging as a major force in local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 830,000 people from about 400,000 enterprises and
households are engaged in the sector, accounting for 5.6 percent
of the province's total labor force, the provincial Administration
Bureau for Industry and Commerce said.
</P>
<P>
The province abolished some regulations that hindered the
growth of the private sector, and reduced the number of fee
charges from the original more than 200 to 33.
</P>
<P>
Those private enterprises and individuals that concealed their
identities, fearing they might be charged excessive fees at
random, are requested to make themselves known to fairly compete
in the market.
</P>
<P>
The Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture took the lead in
developing its private economy, aimed at helping the needy shake
off poverty. The local government encouraged its poor population
to go outside the mountainous areas and engage in transporting
goods for sale. One third of the farmers in the prefecture were
able to increase their income as a result.
</P>
<P>
The registered capital of the province's private sector has
amounted to 5.03 billion yuan, and more investment has gone into
primary and secondary industries, the bureau said.

<HEADLINE> Suzhou Works to Control Pollution in Taihu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Suzhou city in east
China's Jiangsu Province are now getting higher-quality drinking
water from the newly-purified Taihu Lake.
</P>
<P>
Taihu is the third largest freshwater lake in China, covering
an area of more than 2,300 sq. kilometers, about 80 percent of
which is in the province.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, the lake's water quality is in
line with the state criteria for Category II water.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Taihu's water quality has dropped to the
third category as a result of heavy pollution, and the lake was
listed as a key national pollution control project.
</P>
<P>
To decontaminate the lake, the city government launched a
"Clean Water" project last year, which led to the closing of more
than 190 enterprises which were sources of pollution. In addition,
regulations were formulated to ban any new enterprises expected to
be excessive polluters.
</P>
<P>
Under the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the city will
invest 770 million yuan (about 93 million US dollars) in
pollution-control, and one billion yuan (about 120 million US
dollars) in the comprehensive treatment of the water environment.
</P>
<P>
In Wujiang, a county-level city known for its silk printing and
dyeing industry, no more printing and dyeing projects will be
approved, some illegal mills for wool sweater printing and dyeing
were closed, and some projects which caused heavy pollution were
ordered to stop production.
</P>
<P>
Run-off of fertilizer and pesticide from the farmland is
another major cause of lake pollution. The city has built pilot
scientific farming areas along the waterfront to teach farmers how
to till Farmland with less pollution and higher yield.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou invested 45 million yuan (about 5.4 million US dollars)
in sewage treatment last year, dredging 35 kilometers of river
along part of the city area.
</P>
<P>
Four sewage treatment plants, able to treat a total of 130,000
tons of sewage each day, have been built in the city, raising the
sewage treatment rate to ten percent.

<HEADLINE> Aquatic Products Transaction Growing Rapidly in Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's total output of aquatic
products is expected to increase at a double-digit rate to reach
31 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the figure topped 28 million tons, up 11.2 percent
from the previous year, lastest statistics from the Fishery Bureau
of the Ministry of Agriculture show.
</P>
<P>
The demand for aquatic products is bound to increase, as
China's rural and urban residents both have more and more income,
ministry authorities note.
</P>
<P>
However, they point out that the supply and demand of aquatic
products are not balanced in all regions, owing to the limitations
of frozen, processing, and transport conditions, and the Chinese
market's lack of high-grade aquatic products.
</P>
<P>
Generally, the business grew very quickly. Statistics show that
the transaction volume of aquatic products stood at 10.15 million
tons last year, with a value of 113.5 billion yuan, up 20.8 and
30.5 percent, respectively, over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Though the price index of aquatic products rose by six percent
last year, the growth rate was 8.4 percentage points lower than
1995. In addition, the increase was 8.6 percent in the first half
of 1996, and only 3.5 percent in the latter half.

<HEADLINE> More Rural Residents in Henan Use Clean Toilets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 6.8 million farmers,
or 36 percent of the rural households, in central China's Henan
Province have replaced traditional dry latrines with flush
toilets, improving environment to a great extent.
</P>
<P>
Chinese environmentalists deem it a "revolution" in rural
China. For centuries, the old-style latrine was an earthen pit
with two boards on each side. it gave off a foul odor and
attracted swarms of flies.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a farmer named Song Lexin, in Yucheng County of Henan,
invented a new-style toilet complete with jars underneath the
seat, a cover on the top and a flush system.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he travelled around the country by bicycle to
persuade the fellow countrymen to try his new design.
</P>
<P>
The new toilet is clean, odorless, cost-efficient and more
likely to prevent spread of disease than the traditional model. In
addition, the fermented soil can be used on grain crops, and is
said to be able to raise the output 20 percent, Song said.
</P>
<P>
Song's toilet has become widespread in Henan since 1989. The
provincial government plans to transform all the rural latrines in
the coming years.

<HEADLINE> New Products to Give Cleaner Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- New products to control car
exhaust emission have been in wide use in northwest China's Gansu
Province as part of the local "Blue Sky Plan" to battle air
pollution.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 80,000 vehicles in the area, which each
produced nearly 1,000 tons of exhaust per year.
</P>
<P>
A local company used new technology from Japan to develop two
kinds of systems to curb excess tailpipe emissions.
</P>
<P>
Inspections conducted by the provincial environmental
protection bureau show that the new products' purification rate of
carbon monoxide reached from 31 to 60 percent; that of
hydrocarbon, from 20 to 80 percent; and more than 80 percent for
diesel fumes.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturer said that new products could also help
vehicles to economize on gasoline, improve engine functioning and
reduce noise pollution caused by engines.

<HEADLINE> Total Closure on West Bank Reimposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel reimposed overnight a
total closure on the West Bank amid warnings of new terror
attacks against Israeli targets.
</P>
<P>
The order to impose the indefinite closure, which became
effective at midnight last night, was issued by Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and Army Chief of Staff Amnon Lipkin Shahak.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials said they had concrete warnings of
terrorist attacks by Palestinian militants.
</P>
<P>
Under the closure, all Palestinians from the West Bank are
barred from entering Israel and the Jewish settlements in the West
bank, while Israelis are banned from entering areas under
Palestinian control. Unlike in the past, the closure does not
affect the Gaza Strip and Palestinian workers coming from there
are still being allowed in to seek jobs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli army restricted the rule of hitchhikes by
soldiers, who are easy targets of terrorist attacks and
kidnapings. According to the new rules, soldiers traveling
between 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. must hitchhike in pairs, and after 7
p.m., they must be armed. Female soldier is only allowed to
hitchhike when accompanied by a male soldier, and forbidden to
hitchhike at night.
</P>
<P>
Closure of the territories is a common practice adopted by
Israeli government at every time when there is a warning of
terrorist attacks. The Palestinians slammed the practice as a form
of collective punishment.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a full closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
on March 21 immediately after a suicide bomber from the militant
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) blew himself up at a Tel Aviv
cafe, killing three Israeli women and wounding 40 others. The
closure barred tens of thousands of Palestinian workers from
entering Israel to return to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
But Israel significantly eased the closure in the past days,
allowing over 20,000 Palestinians workers to enter Israel to
work.

<HEADLINE> Moi Criticizes West Nations Over Double Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said Kenya is dismayed by western countries' move to impose
export quotas on the products from developing countries and to
provide subsidies to their own exports.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the developed countries of using double
standards to push for economic liberalization, saying that their
protectionist practices are unfair and constrain economic growth
in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day exhibition on Tuesday organized by the
British government, Moi stressed that trade liberalization could
only remain permanent and rewarding if all nations liberalize
trade.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader pointed out that the developed world has
been at the forefront in calling for global liberalization and
should therefore be the last ones to engage in protectionism.
</P>
<P>
He noted that east African countries have come together under
the auspices of the East African Co-operation to remove trade
barriers.

<HEADLINE> Polluter Shut-down Influences Economy Very Little: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The director of China's State
Bureau of Environmental Protection said here today that the
country's large-scale polluter shut-down has had very little
impact on the overall regional economy.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua told Xinhua News Agency that the regional economy
has witnessed only about one percent change as a result of the
move.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the factories' employees are farmers and
migrant workers, he noted, adding that they have been helped to
find jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that the shut-down is meant to develop the economy
while saving resources and energy. It is conducive to the healthy
growth of the rural economy and ecological protection, he said,
adding that it also helps factories choose the "right way" for
development.
</P>
<P>
Such a large-scale move is rare in the world, Xie said, and
many developed countries are unable to do it, let alone other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"This shows China's determination in environmental protection,"
Xie stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has shut down 62,561 factories causing serious pollution,
according to the lastest official statistics. Those closed so far
include paper mills with an annual production of less than 5,000
tons, tanneries producing less than 30,000 pieces of cow leather,
coking plants using outdated production processes, and other
factories causing serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
The action came following last year's decree of the State
Council, China's highest governing body, that required all the
country's 15 types of small-sized factories causing serious
pollution to close their doors.
</P>
<P>
These polluters have seriously affected the country's economic
development and barred the improvement of the living environment.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the bureau said that the bureau and the Ministry
of Supervision will inspect the country's 17 province-level areas
on their implementation of the council's decree, and prevent the
closed factories from resuming operation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Mobile Telecom Networks to Adopt CDMA Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The rapidly growing Chinese
mobile telecommunications industry is now importing the latest
wireless technology - CDMA (code diversion mode accesses) standard
- to ease the pressure created by the swelling market on the
present infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiuchuan, vice director of the Mobile Telecom Bureau under
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said that the
country's mobile telephone subscription has reported a growth rate
of 120 percent over the past few years, and there will be as many
as 18 million clients in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, the radio frequency range suitable for mobile phone
use is very limited, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To meet the ever-growing market demand, "the only way out is to
develop a technology that can make more use of radio frequencies,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
China is now building several trial CDMA networks in such
populous cities as Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai. The handling
capacity of the CDMA networks is reported to be ten times higher
than the present analog mobile telecom standard.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Lucent Technologies, one of the global
telecom giants leading the CDMA trend, in Beijing said that China
dialed the first CDMA call on the trial network launched by Lucent
Technologies in Guangzhou on December 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Lucent network with a switching capacity of 20,000 accesses
will undergo its final test by the end of this month, and will go
into formal operation next month. It will be the first commercial
CDMA system operational in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Quan, manager of wireless network unit of Lucent
Technologies (China) Ltd., said that China, as the fastest-growing
market in the Asia and Pacific Region, and in which the company
has won CDMA contracts of 250 million US dollars, is now
technically qualified to adopt the CDMA technology countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Motorola, another major CDMA supplier from the US, is also
accelerating the construction work on two trial networks in
Beijing and Fujian Province. It made the first CDMA call in
Beijing early this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other CDMA manufacturers, including Nortel of Canada
and Samsung of South Korea, are eagerly waiting to enter the
Chinese marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that once the country decides to open the market to
foreign CDMA suppliers, the telecom administrative body will
encourage the foreign companies to make technical transfer.
</P>
<P>
"China has always adhered to the principle of trading market
for technology. Therefore, the earlier the CDMA technology is
transferred, the easier it will be for the company to make its way
into the Chinese market," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, April 16 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will "stand
firm" on its long-term economic goals, including restructuring of
state assets and a greater economic interaction with the global
market, said President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said in his state-of-the-nation address in the

Mandela said his government has been achieving surprising
progress in many fields, but admitted it is yet to make its
activities sufficiently visible to the public.
</P>
<P>
"The momentum in our program to improve the quality of life
can be observed in the economic sphere," said the president,
adding the government's macro-economic strategy is steady and
surely starting to bear fruit.
</P>
<P>
While referring to labor organizations' opposition to
privatization, Mandela called on labor and business to recognize
that their interests are not in opposition, but complementary.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit From Grain Storage Organization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers in disaster areas
are getting adequate food supplies thanks to relief grain storage
societies that have been emerging in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots organizations were begun by civil affairs
departments to help alleviate the governments' burden by helping
farmers cope with periods of shortages.
</P>
<P>
Villages and townships are responsible for putting aside a part
of farmers' surplus grain and for doling out relief supplies to
the needy, for free, or by borrowing or selling at a discount.
</P>
<P>
Haidong Prefecture in northwest China's Qinghai Province is a
major grain producer for the province, but has long been plagued
by natural disasters, causing more than 100,000 people to run
short of grain annually, said Ba Mingwang, director of the
prefecture's Civil Affairs Department.
</P>
<P>
So, the department encouraged farmers in poor villages and
townships to set up mutual aid and relief societies in 1994,
asking farmers to set aside surplus grain on their own. Societies
have been set up in 104 of the prefecture's 150 townships, and
more than 200,000 households have joined, accounting for nearly 60
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The societies had over four million kg of grain in storage and
handed out 3.5 million kg to the needy last year, effectively
regulating the grain supply in disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
This practice has been welcomed by rural Chinese homes, because
grain stored this way can keep its value and save farmers the
trouble of storing too much grain at home.

<HEADLINE> Three-Fold Increase in Number of Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of Chinese cities has
tripled since 1980, to 666, according to the latest statistics
from the Chinese Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the ministry told Xinhua today that
China's urbanization is characterized by growth in medium-sized
and small cities, and an increasing number of cities in central
and western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
The country's urbanization strategy aims at "controlling the
number and scale of large and extra-large cities and to give
greater room to medium-sized and small cities as well as small
rural towns," he noted, adding that it has begun to pay off.
</P>
<P>
Of these 666, extra-large and large cities account for 75,
medium-sized cities, 192, and small cities, 399.
</P>
<P>
The official said that because of economic development
nationwide, the rapid pace of urbanization has improved the uneven
distribution of cities in eastern, central, and western parts of
the country to some degree. These three areas now account for 44
percent, 37 percent, and 19 percent, respectively, of the total
number of cities.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and Ningxia
and the provinces of Hubei, Qinghai, Shanxi, Anhui, Henan and
Jiangxi are seeing faster urbanization than the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The number of cities is expected to reach 800 by the turn of
the century.

<P>
BEIHAI, April 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region has begun to develop transport facilities in the Beibu Gulf
area to provide clear access to the sea for the Nanning-Kunming
railway line, a new transport artery in China's vast southwestern
region, linking the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau with the gulf area.
</P>
<P>
Beihai, Qinzhou and Fangcheng are the three main ports in the
area. In recent years, Guangxi has spent nearly one billion yuan
on transport and telecommunications between them and Nanning, the
regional capital and the eastern end of the 898-km Nanning-Kunming
railway line.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of railway lines between the three ports and
Nanning is 10.25 million tons annually, enough to meet the cargo
demands of the Nanning-Kunming railway for now.
</P>
<P>
Work on an expressway from Nanning to Beihai, a section of the
Chongqing-Beihai expressway to be completed before the end of
2000, has begun, and the Qinzhou-Fangcheng expressway is scheduled
to be open this year. So, an expressway network connecting Nanning
with the three ports is expected to be completed by 1998.
</P>
<P>
The three ports have 15 deep-water berths, handling more than
13 million tons of cargo each year, and port authorities are
renovating and improving warehouses, and loading and unloading
facilities to cope with the expected influx of cargo from the
railway.
</P>
<P>
Twelve more deep-water berths will be built in the three ports
by the end of the century. Construction of two has begun already
at Fangcheng port.

China will play Myanmar on April 20, face South Korea on April

Currently, Myanmar has whistled its footers to China's southern
city of Kunming to gear up for the East Asian Games to be kicked

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese NPC Leader Concludes European-Asian Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) Qiao Shi
today concluded his European-Asian tour, which took him to France,
Norway, Italy and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time a top Chinese NPC leader had visited
the four countries.
</P>
<P>
During his three-week trip, Qiao met with heads of state,
parliamentary leaders and prime ministers, as well as other senior
officials, and exchanged views with them on bilateral relations
and issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to developing
cooperation with the four countries in politics, the economy,
trade, culture and other fields.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to further cooperation with these countries on
the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and
together with them, to establish long-term, stable cooperative
relations geared towards the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China was also willing to enhance friendly and
good-neighborly relations with Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the four countries said that China, as a permanent
member of the United Nations Security Council, was an important
factor for world stability and played an influential role in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
They believed it was very important for their countries to
better relations with China, as China was one of the prosperous
markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three European nations reaffirmed their support
for China's efforts to enter the World Trade Organization, while
Mongolian leaders said Mongolia would continue to maintain
long-term, friendly and good-neighborly relations with China.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, France and Italy informed him that they would
not raise anti-China resolution at the United Nations Conference
on Human Rights in Geneva. Qiao expressed his appreciation for
their action and reaffirmed China's stand on the human rights
issue.
</P>
<P>
On the Hong Kong issue, Qiao stressed that China would adhere
to the policy of "one country, two systems" and implement
conscientiously the Basic Law (of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China), so as to
ensure that the region would enjoy a high degree of autonomy and
maintain long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three European countries agreed that it was
important to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. They
said they believed the Chinese government could deal with the
problems which would emerge after it resumed the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also told these leaders that China would continue
unswervingly along the road, blazed by the late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping, of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. It would strive to push ahead with the
modernization drive by deepening reform and opening wider to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the Chinese NPC leader's four-nation
European-Asian tour had enhanced mutually-beneficial cooperation
between China and European countries, as well as friendly and
good-neighborly ties between China and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
Qiao's visits had further strengthened exchanges and
cooperation between the Chinese NPC and parliaments of these four
countries, they said.

<P>
HARARE, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe has urged Africa's health professionals to come together
and help fight mounting challenges posed by diseases and
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth international congress of the Association of
Medical Laboratory Scientists of South-Central and Southern
Africa held in Harare on Tuesday, Mugabe said there is a need for
medical facilities to be accessed by the majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
"The challenges for health have never been greater because in
the field of human development, ill health, diseases and
disability have all been recognized as retarding factors in that
process, especially in the African context," he said.
</P>
<P>
The congress is being attended by top African scientists from
all over the continent.

Mugabe asked the laboratory technologists to strive for higher
goals by producing quality scientific results to help establish
proper patient diagnosis.

ROME, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and Italian

Albania was providing humanitarian assistance rather than

into other countries in the Balkans.

<P>
Advance force had already arrived to make preparations for the
main force.

<HEADLINE> National Park's Elephants Play Havoc With Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The increasing number of wild
elephants in a national park of West Nepal have reduced the
presence of other wildlife in the park and created difficulties
for villagers living nearby, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Bardia National Park, about 400 kilometers southwest of
Kathmandu, used to have some 70 tigers but the number of visible
tigers has decreased sharply due to the havoc wreaked by the
elephants, the Kathmandu Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The elephants, numbering 45, have also spread chaos in nearby
villages by destroying trees, plantation and crops.
</P>
<P>
Local inhabitants urged the park authorities to take urgent
measures to stop further damage to crops by the elephants and
protect the villagers from losing their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the Nepali government and the World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) have initiated measures to grant relief to the
people living around the nearly 1,000-square-kilometer park, which
also has a buffer zone of 460 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The measures include uplifting the living standard of the
villagers and preventing wild animals from leaving the park by
digging trenches around the park.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's semi-private
telecommunications company Pt. Indosat has begun operating three
newly completed submarine optic fiber cable systems worth a total
of 1.8 trillion rupiah (783 million U.S. dollars), an official
said.
</P>
<P>
Janathan L. Parapak, secretary general of the Tourism, Post and
Telecommunications Ministry, said here Tuesday that the three new
systems, which began operation on Monday, are the Jakarta-Surabaya
(East Java) submarine optic fiber cable system (J-S), the Asia
Pacific cable network (APCN) and the Jakarta-Australia submarine
optic fiber cable system (JASURAUS).
</P>
<P>
The J-S system, with a distance of 715 kilometers, had been
built by Alcatel Submarine Network (ASN) since May 1995 with an
investment of 115 billion rupiah (50 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The APCN, covering a distance of 12,082 kilometers, was jointly
built by 56 telecommunications operators form 27 countries. Its
cable terminals are located in Jakarta, Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The APCN system, which is connected with Southeast Asia, the
Middle East and Western Europe, was built with a total investment
of 1.45 trillion rupiah (602.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The JASURAUS system was built by Telstra and Optus Australia
with a total investment of 156.9 million Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The three cable systems use a technology called "synchronous
digital hierarchies" (SDH) with a large transmission capacity,
which is able to transmit 60,480 telephone lines simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
"These three cable systems have made Jakarta a hub of the
global information network linking Western Europe, the Middle
East, Australia, Asia-Pacific and America," Indosat President
Director Tjahyono Soerjodibroto said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Tourism Benefits From Indian Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Many Indian films shot in Nepal
have played a vital role in promoting Nepal as a tourist
destination for Indian visitors, a leading businessman of Nepal's
tourism industry said.
</P>
<P>
Indian film makers who shoot their feature films in Nepal's
picturesque backdrops would also help make the Visit Nepal Year
1998 program a success, President of the Hotel Association of
Nepal (HAN) Yogendra Shakay said at a recent reception here.
</P>
<P>
The reception was organized by the HAN in honor of nearly 10
Indian film stars who were in Kathmandu for the inauguration of an
Indian Film Week beginning last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There is a great relevance between India's film industry and
the hotel industry in Nepal, Shakay told the actors and actresses
from Mumbai, India's capital of film industry.
</P>
<P>
The publicity and promotion that Nepal could receive from
Indian films are immense as these films have a strong influence on
people in the South Asian region especially in India, he said,
adding that Indian visitors account for one-third of the total
tourist arrivals in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Visit Nepal Year 1998, the tourism promotion program launched
by the government one year ago, is aimed at attracting 500,000
foreign tourists next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 16 (Xinhua) -- A top commander of the Afghan
Taliban militia has been captured by an anti-Taliban faction in
the fighting which broke out three days ago, a local newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Wahid, the Taliban commander in charge of the frontiers
75 kilometers northwest of the capital of Kabul, was taken
prisoner by Hezb-e-Wahdat, an Afghan Shiite Muslim faction which
is a main part of the country's anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 60 Taliban soldiers have been captured and
dozens killed in the fighting, the report quoted a general of the
faction as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Hezb-e-Wahdat general, Bashir Tawhidi, said the Taliban had
attacked the faction's positions in the Ghorband Valley which is
seen as a "backdoor" to the north for the Taliban to conquer the
remaining one-third of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the attack was repulsed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which seized Kabul on September 27 last year,
control two-thirds of Afghan territory.

<P>
Making a speech titled "My Vision of Future Pakistan" at the

Pakistan to the Kashmiri people.
</P>

An equitable and just settlement of the Kashmir dispute, the
core issue between Pakistan and India, can guarantee peace in
South Asia, he said.

However, he noted, "We fully realize that there is no short cut
to the process of normalization of relations with India."

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Hold Talks on Eastward Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) Secretary General Javier Solana met Russian Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov here today for the fourth round of
secret talks about future relations between Moscow and the Western
alliance after it expands eastward.
</P>
<P>
After three hours of talks, the Russian side came out with a
brief statement which said that a planned pact on future relations
was far from ready, and consultations between the two sides would
continue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides came nearer on a series of issues but still had
some problems that must be solved, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Russia's State Duma (the lower house
of parliament) said today that the current trip of Solana to
Moscow was aimed at discussing some details of the document
governing Russia-NATO relations in future, including NATO's use of
military facilities of the former Warsaw Pact bloc and deployment
of armed forces on soil of its new member countries.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said last week that Russia hoped to sign a partnership
document with NATO on May 27 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
But Russian President Boris Yeltsin said, in an interview with
the German magazine Stern today, that Moscow would not sign such a
document unless the results of the talks suited Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia fears that the Western alliance's plans to invite in
former Soviet bloc countries in July would lead to a military
build-up near its borders. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
are the front-runners to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Russia is also demanding a role in NATO decision-making,
complaining that some NATO members were not showing enough desire
to seek a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Solana left Moscow immediately after the end of today's talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian presidency Tuesday
agreed on the circulation of a unified currency known as
"convertible mark" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The currency with a one-on-one rate with German mark is likely
to be issued within 100 days, said Mirza Hajric, an advisor to the
chairman of the presidency, Alija Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
Hajric said that the currency will be temporarily circulated
for one year until "some technical problems" about a permanent
banknote are sorted out.
</P>
<P>
For the present, the three ethnic groups in Bosnia use three
different currencies with Bosnian Dinar for Muslims, Yugoslav
Dinar for Serbs and Croatian Kuna for Croats.
</P>
<P>
The use of a single currency in the country is one of the
requirements set by the international community for holding a
conference on financial assistance to Bosnia this year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Standardize Economic Data System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Finance Ministry will
speed up economic data gathering and reporting to maintain the
confidence of foreign investors and avoid mistakes in
macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
Chatu Mongol Sonakul, permanent secretary of the Finance
Ministry, said he had asked the Customs Department to report
import and export data within 10 days instead of 45 days, and the
Fiscal Policy Office to report gross domestic production every
three months rather than annually, according to the Nation today.
</P>
<P>
During a recent visit to Thailand, Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, urged Thailand to
standardize its economic data system and said that the government
should quickly disseminate comprehensive and accurate information.
</P>
<P>
Reliable economic data would make it easier for the government
to deal with macroeconomic issues, while inaccurate information
from the government will send wrong signals which may cause the
private sector to fail to adjust to the changing economic
conditions, the IMF official said.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus told the Finance Ministry that Thailand's economic
data is messy. Government agencies give out different data even
though they obtain it from the same sources, according to Chatu.

MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Special police foiled a bus
hijacking in southern Russia Monday, rescuing 27 hostages and
capturing the hijacker.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, a 25-year-old man from the Republic of Chechnya,
forced the bus driver and the passengers to go to the airport on
Monday afternoon in Makhachkala, capital of the southern Republic

</P>
<P>
The hijacker, armed with a grenade and automatic rifle,
demanded 100,000 U.S. dollars and a helicopter from the
authorities for his escape.
</P>
<P>
It took some 3 hours for the special police to end the
incident.
</P>
<P>
The Caucasus Mountains region has been troubled with

COLOMBO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE), who has been fighting a 14-year guerrilla war for a
separate Tamil state, is reported to be in the throes of crisis
both militarily and politically, according to Tamil informed
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The crisis ranges from man power to logistics to being
increasingly rejected by the Tamil community not only in Colombo
but also in the North and the East where they hold very little
real estate now following major military reversals, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the LTTE lived a nomadic life in jungles
and was unable to conscript children and youth.
</P>
<P>
It was also experiencing difficulties in procuring arms and
ammunition as the rebel supply lines have been disrupted since the
government troops re-took Jaffna peninsula last May.
</P>

Meanwhile, they also face an acute shortage of medicine to

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 15 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since the
division of the former Soviet Union's Black Sea Fleet, the
Ukrainian Naval ships today joined a Russian-sponsored manoeuvre.
</P>
<P>
Two Ukrainian ships left the Sevastopol base today to
participate in the exercise and will act as observers when the
Russian fleet reachs the navy port of Kerch.
</P>
<P>
The manoeuvre, involving 50 vessels, marine corps, naval air
force, ground rocket artillery force, will carry out over 160
combat programs, under the direction of Viktor Klavchenko,
commander of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The large-scale manoeuvre is seen as a show of force against a
proposed multinational manoeuvre on the Black Sea to be
participated by NATO countries in August.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the navy before the manoeuvre, Klavchenko said
that Russia's southwestern part is of great military importance in
view that the forces of the non-Black-Sea countries are becoming
increasingly active with NATO's eastwards expansion nearing the
border of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet was divided between Russia and Ukraine in
August 1992, but the two countries still keep a joint fleet
headquarters to carry out manoeuvres.

during his working visit to Belarus today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russian Pipeline to Go Through Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Bulgaria will further
their cooperation by laying a natural gas pipeline from Russia to
the Balkans through Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique on the scheme was signed today by Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his visiting Bulgarian
counterpart, Stefan Sofianski.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bulgaria agreed in principle to allow Russia to lay
the pipeline which would cost 600 million U.S. dollars. In return,
Russia agreed to continue its supply of oil and natural gas to
Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-fax news agency said the signing of the communique
guaranteed the transit of natural gas from Russia to the Balkans,
and free trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two prime ministers also exchanged views
on bilateral trade and some international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told reporters that both sides reached common
understanding on many issues and Russia would further its
cooperation with Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Russia's supply of Mig-29 jet fighters to Bulgaria was also
discussed, and the text of the agreement on this was nearly
finalized, he noted.
</P>
<P>
But Bulgaria would like to further study this military
contract, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's eastward expansion,
the Russian prime minister pointed out that Russia respected
Bulgaria's stand in hoping to join NATO, but did not support the
idea.

Russia would not forsake its principle of opposing NATO's
eastward expansion, he said.

COLOMBO, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Central Bank has
decided to grant loans to farmers in northern Jaffna peninsula in
an effort to reactivate the neglected agricultural sector there.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper reports today, agriculture has
been the main source of income for the majority of the people in
Northern and Eastern provinces. But following the 14-year ethnic
war agriculture in the areas has been totally disrupted.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna peninsula was once the stronghold of the Tamil
rebels, who waged a guerrilla war for a separate state in the
north and east of the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the loan scheme each farmer will be given Rs 10,000
(about 170 US dollars). All farmers who have resettled in the
Jaffna peninsula will be eligible to apply for the loans.
</P>
<P>
The government has also made arrangements to supply seed,
chemicals and agricultural equipment required by the farming
community in the peninsula.

BUDAPEST, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Hungary and Romania have agreed
to conciliate their 1987 diplomatic dispute and improve their
relations, a spokesman at the Hungarian Foreign Ministry said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Szentivanyi Ga'for, said that foreign ministries

the near future the general consulates in each other's countries,
which were closed after each country expelled a diplomatic
official of the other in 1987.
</P>
<P>
In November that year, Romania accused a Hungarian commercial
counsellor at the Hungarian embassy of carrying out activities
incompatible with his status and declared him as "persona non
grata." In retaliation, Hungary also expelled a counsellor of the
Romanian embassy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is seen here as a new step to improve relations
between the two countries after the new Romanian government came
into office in November last year.

The academy has received increasing funding in recent years
from the central budget. Many Chinese leaders have given speeches
and communicated by letter to the institute, considered a hotbed

</P>
<P>
The high-profile celebration will feature exhibitions, seminars
and other activities to reflect the academy's achievements in
stepping up the Chinese economy and social progress -- the current
focus of its 2,000 researchers.
</P>
<P>
Also in May, some foreigners will be given honorary titles as
senior researchers of the academy.
</P>
<P>
The academy, the leader in this field with a lot of young
scholars studying or working abroad, is a bridge to connect

<HEADLINE> Philippines Launches Campaign Against Polio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 16 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 9 to 10 million
children will flock to medical centers all over the Philippines
today for polio immunization as the first round of this year's
massive campaign against the disease unfolds in the country.
</P>
<P>
An official report from the Department of Health showed that
the polio virus was last isolated from a case in the southern city
of Cebu in 1993. Since then, there was no reported polio case due
to wild poliomyelitis virus.
</P>
<P>
But the health authorities said that the Philippines still can
not be certified polio-free because the country's active acute
flaccid (AFP) paralysis surveillance failed to meet basic
requirements and standards.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the polio disease is eradicated in the country, the
health authorities decided to regularly launch a massive Knock Out
Polio Campaign nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country will take measures to improve its AFP
surveillance system, which reportedly lags very much among the
countries and regions in the Western Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (25-26) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (25-26)
in a question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: Can holders of the British Dependent Territories
Citizens (BDTC) and British Nationals Overseas (BNO) passports
continue to use these passports and travel outside Hong Kong after
1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Since Hong Kong returns to China on July 1, 1997, the
BDTC passports will be valid only until June 30, 1997. The Chinese
Memorandum attached to the Sino-British Joint Declaration states,
"Taking account of the historical background of Hong Kong and its
realities, the competent authorities of the Government of the
People's Republic of China will, with effect from July 1, 1997,
permit Chinese nationals in Hong Kong who were previously
called 'British Dependent Territories Citizens' to use travel
documents issued by the Government of the United Kingdom for the
purpose of travelling to other states and regions."
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law also clearly stipulates that Hong Kong residents
have the freedom to travel and to enter or leave the
region. Unless restrained by law, holders of valid travel
documents will be free to leave the region without special
authorization.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, holders of the BDTC passports can apply for BNO
passports currently issued by the British Government, and continue
to use BNO passports to travel after 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, holders of BNO passports will not be entitled to
British consular protection in the Hong Kong SAR and other parts
of China on account of their holding the above-mentioned British
travel documents.
</P>
<P>
Question: Will Hong Kong residents have freedom of movement?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Article 31 of the Basic Law stipulates that Hong Kong
residents have freedom of movement within the Hong Kong SAR and
freedom of emigration to other countries or regions. They will
also have freedom to travel and to enter or leave the region.
</P>
<P>
Unless restrained by law, holders of valid travel documents
will be free to leave the region without special authorization.

MANAGUA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman today asked the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN)
to act in a civic way, saying that "Nicaragua will be the only
loser" of the protest marches that are being carried out in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, the president said that he has

Answering Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega's proposal for a
dialogue between the government and the FSLN with the
participation of the international community, Aleman said that the
Nicaraguans "are grown up now." "Our domestic problems should be
solved by the Nicaraguans," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to call on other countries when we can solve our
problems among Nicaraguans with good will," Aleman said, adding
the transition period of his country "is behind us and there is a
need to institutionalize democracy through laws."
</P>
<P>
"The forums for debate are the national forums decided upon by
the people, such as the National Assembly, and for that reason I am
calling on the Sandinista Front to make a change for Nicaragua
without violence," he said.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Foiling Anti-China Draft Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
expressed its admiration and gratitude to all the countries that
have upheld justice and rendered support to China in foiling for
the seventh time an anti-China draft resolution proposed by some
Western countries.
</P>
<P>
China also expressed its hope that the US, Denmark and a few
other countries that have clung to a confrontational approach will
seriously consider the call of the international community for
cooperation and against confrontation, draw a lesson from their
failure and make a clear break from their erroneous practice of
tabling an anti-China draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang made the
remarks here today after some Western countries' attempt to pass
an anti-China resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission session
was foiled for the seventh time.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of April 15, Geneva time, the Commission on
Human Rights of the United Nations decided, with 27 votes in
favor, 17 votes against and 9 votes in abstention, not to take
action on the so-called "Situation of Human Rights in China" draft
resolution co-sponsored by the US, Denmark and a few other Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Chinese government has all along
attached importance to the issue of human rights, and made
unremitting efforts and scored enormous achievements in promoting
the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"However, the US, Denmark and a couple of other Western
countries have, in total disregard of facts, obstinately clung to
their position of politicizing the human rights question, and
attempted to use the Human Rights Commission session to table an
anti-China draft resolution, in a bid to put pressure on China,
interfere its internal affairs, undermine its stability and
obstruct its development and progress," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
As such a practice runs counter to the fundamental principles
of the UN Charter, it has naturally met with the opposition of the
majority members of the UN Human Rights Commission, Shen noted.
</P>
<P>
"China has always stood for resolving differences between
countries on human rights through dialogues on an equal footing,
and against creating a political confrontation over it," he
stated. "China is heartened to note that a considerable number of
Western countries have stayed away from cosponsoring this year's
anti-China draft resolution while expressing the will to resolve
their differences on human rights with the Chinese side through
dialogues and cooperation."

<HEADLINE> More People to Surf Internet for Purchasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 million people will
regularly make purchasing on Internet by the year 2000, according
to a survey by a U.S. research group recently.
</P>
<P>
"We are about to experience a fundamental change in marketing
and in how we approach the Internet," said J. Neil Weintraut,
founder of the 21st Century Internet Partners.
</P>
<P>
The on-line marketplace recorded 300 million U.S. dollars in
commerce in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The survey involving 100 of the nation's foremost marketing,
advertising and media experts, who met recently to debate the
future of on-line commerce.
</P>
<P>
While 22 percent of survey respondents felt Internet commerce
would become a profitable industry by 2000, 43 percent felt
Internet commerce would not be a profitable business for most
companies until after the turn of the century. Marketers and
advertisers are trying to decide how and when their investment in
new media will pay off.
</P>
<P>
The experts polled all agreed that there are still serious
barriers to the Web becoming a mature retail medium.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four percent of respondents who thought the most serious
barrier was that many products cannot be fully experienced on the
Web. Other barriers noted included the difficulty of using the Web
for purchasing transactions, and the perception by consumers of a
lack of "iron clad" credit card security.

<HEADLINE> Confrontation on Human Rights Unpopular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 16 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd session of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights today approved China's
preemptive no action motion, thus defeating the attempts of the
United States, Denmark and some other Western countries to seek
confrontation in the Human Rights Commission and to interfere in
China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The approval of China's no action motion means that the
commission will not vote on a draft resolution on China's human
rights practices concocted by the United States, Denmark and some
other Western countries.
</P>
<P>
As an old Chinese saying goes, "Thrice is the maximum." Before
today's failure, the United States had for six consecutive years
instigated and supported certain countries to table and try to
push through anti-China resolutions in the Human Rights
Commission. And every time, its efforts were foiled because of the
opposition of the majority of the commission's members.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the United States, Denmark and some other
Western countries refused to learn from the previous
embarrassments and was unwilling to end confrontation with
China. They resorted to double-dealing this time: on one hand,
they claimed that they favored dialogue, but on the other hand,
they made confrontations by insisting on a new anti-China
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The move of these countries naturally met opposition from the
majority of the commission's members.
</P>
<P>
Facts prove that confrontation on human rights is not popular.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people care most about their human rights and they
are best qualified to speak on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the Chinese people, oppressed by imperialism, feudalism and
bureaucrat-capitalism, enjoyed no human rights at all. After the
founding of the People's Republic, the Chinese people completely
shattered off the chains of oppression and became masters of their
country and the human rights situation in China was fundamentally
improved.
</P>
<P>
Since China began its policy of reform and opening up to the
outside world in the late 1970s, China focused its attention to
economic development and at the same time, improved its democracy
and legal system. With less than 7 percent of the world's arable
land, China feeds 22 percent of the world's population and has
significantly improved their economic, social, cultural, civil and
political rights.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, China takes an active part in U.N. activities
promoting and protecting human rights. It has signed 17
international conventions on human rights and announced that it
will sign "the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights" before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
At present, China enjoys political stability, economic growth,
social progress and ethnic unity and the living standards of the
Chinese people are increasingly rising. Its human rights conditions
have kept a good momentum of continuous improvement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the New York Times, J. Stapleton Roy,
former U.S. ambassador to China, said current human rights
conditions in China are the best in the past 100 years. Based on
their own experiences in China, former U.S. President George Bush
and a Ford Foundation representative in China said that most
Chinese people now enjoy unprecedented human rights and freedom.
</P>
<P>
Totally disregarding those facts, repeated vetos by the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights and even the announcements by some
Western states not to participate in drafting anti-China
resolutions, the United States and a few other nations insisted on
having their own way and tabled a seventh draft resolution against
China.
</P>
<P>
What calls for deeper thought is that the years during which
they kept tabling anti-China drafts were exactly the ones during
which China registered fast economy growth and all-round human
rights progress.
</P>
<P>
The countries sponsoring anti-China drafts in the U.N.
Commission on Human Rights are the nations which once invaded
China and wantonly trampled on the human rights of the Chinese
people. It is obvious that the United States and a handful of
Western states have ulterior motives in making a fuss about the
so-called China human rights issue year after year.
</P>
<P>
To put it bluntly, they want to see neither China's pursuing of
an independent and peaceful foreign policy and sticking to the
development road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, nor its development into a powerful nation and
the real improvement of its human rights conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, they made a miscalculation. China, with 5,000 years of
civilization, is a country full of vitality and hopes. The 1.2
billion Chinese people, who have stood up and are making strides
forward, will never yield to alien pressure and change their road
of development.

<HEADLINE> EMI Unsatisfied With EU States' Marks to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Monetary Institute
(EMI) today said it is generally unsatisfied with the European
Union (EU) states' performance to meet the qualification
requirements for the planned single European currency.
</P>
<P>
The EMI also urged these states to adopt even stricter
budgetary discipline.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report for 1996 released today, the
Frankfurt-based EMI, the forerunner of the planned European
central bank, noted that there had been some progress toward
curbing inflation, achieving exchange rate stability and
harmonizing long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
But the situation in many EU states still remained very
unsatisfactory with regard to budget deficits, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficits of most of the EU countries remained above
the limit of 3.0 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)
required by the Maastricht Treaty for qualifying for the common
currency called the Euro, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The EMI also voiced concern over another key Euro target which
requires a member state to trim its national debt to no more than
60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that despite favorable developments in some
countries, it had registered an overall rise in EU states'
national debts.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg still remained the only country so far to meet all
the five Euro criteria, the EMI said.
</P>
<P>
The EU is targeting to launch the Euro on January 1, 1999.
Decision on which countries will be able to make the first wave to
join the Euro is expected to be made in May 1998, based on full
economic data of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The EMI report said despite of growing concern over whether the
Euro could be launched on time, the preparations were going ahead.
</P>
<P>
The first designs of the Euro notes unveiled late last year are
being revised at the moment, after which, production of the
printing plates for the notes would get underway, the EMI said.
</P>
<P>
The Euro notes are due to formally enter into circulation by
January 1, 2002 at the latest.

<HEADLINE> IFC Invests in Jordan's Tourism Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today announced the approval of a loan of up to
15 million U.S. dollars and an equity investment of up to 3
million dollars in Jordan's tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
The investment for Zara, a tourism company in Jordan, will be
utilized to develop two hotel-and-business complexes in Amman and
the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
The projects will comply fully with the World Bank
environmental guidelines, the IFC said. This is particularly
critical for the Dead Sea project which will serve as a model for
future tourism projects.
</P>
<P>
IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and the largest
multilateral source of equity and loan financing for the private
sector in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, IFC has invested 186 million dollars, including 70
million dollars for the account of participants and 116 million
dollars for its own account, in 10 projects in Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Confrontation on Human Rights Unpopular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As every one knows, the U.S. is not a country with glorious
human rights record. It has serious human rights abuses, such as
deep-rooted racial discrimination, money-bag democracy, violence
and terrorism, wide-spread drug abuses and AIDS, increasing
single-parent families, the homeless, discrimination against
women, neglect of children and infringement upon other
countries' human rights.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, when the U.S. was trying to exert pressure on China
under the pretext of human rights at the 53rd session of the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights in late March, a human rights
abuse incident occurred in the U.S. where it was not accidental. A
13-year-old black boy was badly beaten up in Chicago by three
young white men who were actuated by racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast speech following the accident on March 29,
President Bill Clinton admitted that racism is a "constant curse"
in the nation and African Americans and other ethnic minorities
have to endure racial discrimination in their daily life.
</P>
<P>
What right has the United States, a country with such a bad
human rights record, to play the role of "world human rights
judge"?
</P>
<P>
Instead of examining its own mistakes, the U.S. persists in
slashing other countries' human rights records and instigating
resolutions against other countries in the U.N. Human Rights
Commission. What is this if it is not typical double standard?
</P>
<P>
The anti-China resolution initiated by the United States and a
small group of western countries was once again defeated at the
current session of the U.N. Commission on Human rights. The fact
shows that confrontation on human rights is a dead end and
cooperation and dialogue are the only choice.
</P>
<P>
This year's session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission is
characterized by growing calls from developing countries for
cooperation and non-confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen developing countries, including China, have put
forward a draft resolution calling for cooperation, dialogue and
consultation.
</P>
<P>
More and more developing countries voiced their criticism over
the practices of some Western countries to politicalize the human
rights issue and take the advantage of the session to engage in
political confrontation and adopt double standards. They strongly
called for cooperation instead of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Western countries such as France, Germany, Italy,
Spain, Greece, Japan, Australia and Canada announced that they
would not co-sponsor anti-China resolution and advocated that
constructive dialogues should replace confrontation at the
U.N. session on human rights.
</P>
<P>
The stance of these countries shows that more and more
countries come to recognize that to create confrontation by
presenting country resolutions in the Human Rights Commission have
come to a dead end.
</P>
<P>
We advice the U.S. and a small group of other Western countries
to abandon confrontation and move towards cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to join hands with other countries in the
world to continue to safeguard the principles of the U.N. Charter,
to promote international dialogues and exchanges in the field of
human rights and to push the development of human rights on
healthy track.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Falls in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell today after
hitting its second straight 38-month high against the mark.
</P>
<P>
In intraday dealings, the dollar reached a high of 1.7374
marks, the strongest since February 1994 and the second
consecutive 38-month high, before retreating to settle at 1.7270
in New York, down from 1.7298 Monday. The dollar settled at 126.09
yen, down from 126.20.
</P>
<P>
The pound rose sharply to 1.6316 dollars, up from 1.6210.
</P>
<P>
The dollar began to fall against the mark after the Commerce
Department reported lower-than-expected consumer inflation data
for March, which diminished the prospects that the Federal Reserve
may raise interest rates again at its next policymaking committee
meeting in May.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Friday: 1.4665
Swiss francs, down from 1.4705; 5.8085 French francs, down from

NEW YORK, April 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
bounced back again today after interest rates eased from a

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Defends No-Action Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China's chief of delegation to the
53rd session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, Wu Jianmin,
today defended China's no-action motion on a draft resolution by
some 15 Western countries led by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the session, Wu outlined the reasons why China
proposed that the commission take no action on the draft
resolution against China.
</P>
<P>
"It is sheer demagogy to claim that the no-action motion proposed
by the Chinese delegation is asking for special treatment and
non-cooperation," said Wu. "China has always adopted an attitude of
cooperation with the UN human rights bodies. It has never proposed a
no-consideration motion. The no-action motion proposed by the Chinese
delegation in the past years was to counter those anti-China draft
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
He called the allegation that the no-action motion asked for
special treatment "totally groundless." "The no-action motion is
clearly provided for in the Rules of Procedure. It is not an
invention by China," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone with common sense knows that in the meetings of many
other UN bodies, no-action motion is resorted to in accordance
with the Rules of Procedure," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the draft resolution was a gross
distortion of China's reality designed to assert that China had a
deplorable human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged those countries bent on tabling the anti-China draft
resolution to return to the path of dialogue and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a vote by the 53 commission members today, China's no-action
motion was approved 27-17, with nine abstentions.
