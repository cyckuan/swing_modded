<HEADLINE> UK Troops in Gulf Refuse Anthrax Jab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Defense Sunday
refused to rule out the compulsory vaccination of British troops
going to areas such as Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, BBC TV reported nearly three-quarters of British
servicemen deployed to the Middle East during February's Gulf
crisis refused anti-anthrax injections because of fears over Gulf
war syndrome.
</P>
<P>
The anthrax jab is the same as one that formed part of a
cocktail of injections blamed by some for outbreaks of mysterious
illness among veterans of the 1991 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
George Robertson, the defense secretary, was publicly
vaccinated in an attempt to rebuild confidence in the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
However, on Britain's Gulf flagship, the aircraft carrier
Invincible, not a single sailor in the 1,200-strong crew took the
injection.
</P>
<P>
On Illustrious, the carrier that replaced Invincible, only two
sailors agreed to be vaccinated. The low take-up of the jabs was
regarded here as a blow to the secretary.
</P>
<P>
Every serviceman was reported to receive a letter from
Robertson assuring them that the vaccine was safe and that their
protection was "paramount."
</P>
<P>
But officials from the Ministry of Defense believe that troops
concern about Gulf war syndrome outweighed fear of being attacked.
</P>
<P>
One official was quoted as saying, "If we force people to take
the vaccine, we will be accused of compromising their rights, and
if we don't, we will be accused of ignoring their safety."

<HEADLINE> India Rejects UN Security Council Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- India Sunday evening rejected the
U.N. Security Council resolution issued Saturday urging India and
Pakistan to halt their further nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
India's senior External Affairs Ministry officials regarded the
resolution as "ultra virus" and "unacceptable". Following up New
Delhi's strong reaction to the resolution, the officials said that
exception had been taken to the "deeply offensive" tone and the
manner in which it had addressed India.
</P>
<P>
They termed the resolution as "coercive" and "unhelpful". They
said that "contending the problem of non-proliferation could not
be arbitrarily confined to a narrow geographical segment, but
addressed meaningfully only in a global framework."
</P>
<P>
The officials argued, "India did not recognize the council's
role in trying to address the issue of non-proliferation which was
not provided in its charter."
</P>
<P>
"We find it strange that attempts have been made to coerce
member states to accede to international treaties. This is
contrary to the norms of international law," they said.
</P>
<P>
The council's move had not contributed in any manner to
international peace and stability, they further said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, these officials also assailed the council for
its reference to the Kashmir issue in the resolution, describing
it as "unwarranted" and "unnecessary". They said, "India was
awaiting a formal response from Pakistan to its renewed offer for
a direct comprehensive dialogue with Islamabad to address all
outstanding issues, including Kashmir." They made it clear,
however, that "it would not accept any third party mediation" over
the Kashmir issue.

activities including peace operations in Burundi.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Enid Blyton Announces Asia Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Enid Blyton Sunday announced the
formation of a substantial new joint venture company, Enid Blyton
(Asia) Pte Limited.
</P>
<P>
The new company will give Enid Blyton a significant presence in
the vast Asian market and will enable the company to greatly
increase its opportunities for extending business in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Enid Blyton, a recipient of the Queen's Award for Export,
focuses on developing broadcast, publishing, licensing and
merchandising activity.
</P>
<P>
Enid Blyton (Asia) Pte Limited will operate from Hong Kong and
cover all countries in the Asian region including Australia, New
Zealand, India, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture company will have the same rights as the Enid
Blyton Company enabling it to build close, long lasting and
mutually beneficial partnerships with Asian companies and
individuals who are recognized experts in their own specialist
fields.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the launching of the joint venture, David Lane,
managing director of the Enid Blyton Company, said, "While we have
had a presence in Asia for a number of years, we believe that it
is culturally and economically difficult to maximize the real
potential of Enid Blyton in Asia from a UK base."
</P>
<P>
"Our joint venture partners will bring local knowledge,
experience and the specific market expertise to enable Enid Blyton
(Asia) Pte Limited to penetrate these important and diverse
markets," he added.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Appeal for Lift of Sanctions on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The council of ministers of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has appealed once again
to the United Nations Security Council to immediately lift the
"unjust sanctions" it had imposed on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The OAU council of ministers, which is about to end a
four-day meeting here Sunday night, called on the Security
Council to do so "pending the delivery of a verdict by the
International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the dispute" between
Libya on the one side and Britain and the United States on the
other.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council began to impose sanctions on Libya in
1992 after the bombing of Pan AM flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the U.S., who have been insisting on the trial of
the two accused Libyans involved in the bombing to be held in the
ICJ, disputed with Libya, which said the trial should be
conducted in a third country other than the world court in Hague,
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The obdurate stand of the two countries and the sanctions have
met strong opposition from Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Foreign Minister Lawrence Shimba, in an interview with
Xinhua, said the sanctions have only brought sufferings to the
people of Libya.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the sanctions should be lifted as early as possible
by the Security Council, he added.
</P>
<P>
The OAU council of ministers meeting also hailed the holding
of the Security Council session in March this year that focused
international attention on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, in a resolution, commended the flexibility and
keenness shown by Libya in its position and its consistent
commitment for an equitable solution to the dispute.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Report on Ties With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Foreign
Affairs Department Sunday denied a newspaper report that Pretoria
is trying to avoid being too close to France when French
President Jacques Chirac visits the country at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times quoted South African officials as saying,
"South Africa is wary of being associated too closely with France
in Africa, although Pretoria is happy to deal with Paris on
issues of trade, culture and technology."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement that it had
noted the article with concern.
</P>
<P>
"The department would like to point out that this article is
speculative and contains inaccuracies. It does not reflect the
true nature of the state of bilateral relations between South
Africa and France."
</P>
<P>
South Africa highly values its strategic partnership with
France and political and economic relations are on an excellent
footing, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The article, entitled "SA (South Africa) won't let Chirac use
Mandela on Visit," said the planned state visit has caused
anxious behind-scenes by both countries.
</P>
<P>
It quoted South African foreign affairs officials as saying
that France, using the high-profile visit by U.S. President Bill
Clinton in March as a precedent, had insisted Mandela accompany
Chirac on at least five occasions.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has made it clear that Mandela will host a
face-to-face meeting with the French president and a state
banquet -- normal protocol for a head of state, the article said.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the article, France asked for Mandela to
accompany Chirac to a France-South Africa business conference in
Johannesburg and on visits to Soweto, a black township near
Johannesburg, and Robben Island off Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Department said the program for the visit,
scheduled for June 26-28, was still being finalized, and
therefore speculation about specific program items was premature
at this stage.
</P>
<P>
The paper said France regarded the visit as key to the
promotion of its revamped African policy, which is aimed at
broadening French interests outside French-speaking countries and
which France hopes will have a special focus on southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted South African officials as saying that they
were concerned France wished to use the perception of a
friendship between Mandela and Chirac as a way of promoting the
new French policy.
</P>
<P>
"We are sensitive about the perception of a joint French-South
African onslaught on Africa -- that the two countries are
`colonizing` Africa," one official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted a scholar, Deon Fourie, as saying that
"Chirac wants France to play a role in Africa in line with
conservative thinking. South Africa sees French interests as
neo-colonial and would not want to aid that."
</P>
<P>
Chirac would also visit Namibia, Mozambique and Angola.

<P>
Available statistics show that in spite of some positive
developments which have led to some repartiation exercises in
some member states, a lot still remains to be done by all parties
concerned to address this dehumanizing problem of refugees and
displaced persons as the refugee population still stands to about
6 million and that of displaced persons is estimated close to 20
million, and in both categories, a majority of the victims are
women and children.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Restricts Number of Eritrean Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced Sunday that
it has ordered the Eritrean Embassy to Ethiopia to limit the
number of its diplomatic staff to three and the rest to leave
Ethiopia at noon on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said
the measures were taken following "the uncivilized act by the
authorities in Asmara."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea's air raid against the city of Mekelle in north
Ethiopia last week which claimed the lives of 44 people and
wounded 135 others was a premeditated strike that aimed at
unleashing terror among the civilian population, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
It said the bombs were dropped twice, the first on a school
and the second on a crowd assisting victims.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean authorities have provoked the hostilities when
"they occupied Ethiopian territory and rejected a recommendation
proposed by the facilitators who have attempted to defuse the
tension triggered by Eritrean aggression," the press release
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian News Agency reported that 48 of the
Eritrean diplomatic staff in Ethiopia have left the country at
noon Sunday in accordance with the order given by the Ethiopian
government.
</P>
<P>
The only remaining staff are the Eritrean ambassador and his
two aides, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between the two Horn of African countries
turned violent when either side accused the other of invasion.
</P>
<P>
The row centers on a rocky 400 square km triangle of land
which both countries claim.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for World Treaty on Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Sunday called for the creation of an international disarmament
treaty to rid the world of nuclear weapons within two decades.
</P>
<P>
"I have been wishing that all weapons of mass destruction be
eliminated from the whole world and that an international treaty
be reached covering 15 or 17 years after which the world would get
rid of weapons of mass destruction," Mubarak said after casting
his vote in the mid-term election of Shura Council, the Egyptian
parliament's consultative body.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who has campaigned for a nuclear-free Middle East
since early 1990s, expressed concern that the recent Indian and
Pakistani nuclear tests might encourage other countries in the
region to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"Israel, as well as India and Pakistan, possesses nuclear
weapons and it is possible that other countries would carry out
their nuclear tests, like Iran and others," he was quoted by
Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president said these states will encourage other
non-nuclear countries to enter this field out of fear that they
would be exposed, even by mistake, to the threats of such weapons.
</P>
<P>
On the Egyptian stance in this respect, the president said: "We
call for eliminating all weapons of mass destruction not only
from the Middle East but from the whole world through an
international treaty as these weapons threaten all mankind."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been urging Israel, which is believed to be the only
nuclear power in the Middle East, to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and open its arsenal to international
inspection.

<HEADLINE> Israel Plans to Double Number of High-Tech Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- To meet the need of its rapidly
expanding high-tech sector, Israeli government began discussing a
plan Sunday aimed at drastically increasing the number of
university graduates in high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Education Minister Yitzhak
Levy and Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai discussed
with university heads ways how to double the number of high-tech
workers from 30,000 to 60,000 within five years.
</P>
<P>
Of the 30,000 new workers, about two-thirds would be university
and college graduates in the fields of electronics and computers,
while the remaining third would be graduates in non-technology
fields, who would undergo retraining. This category would include
new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The plan, submitted by the Council for Higher Education, was
designed to sustain the rapid growth of Israel's high-tech
sectors. There are currently about 3,500 high-tech companies in
Israel, and the high-tech products account for 80 percent of
Israel's total exports.
</P>
<P>
A shortage of high-tech personnel has developed in recent
years, and Israeli companies have even turned to other countries
for recruiting computer programmers and electronics engineers.
</P>
<P>
Professor Nehemia Levtzion, head of the council's Planning and
Budget Committee, said Saturday that the number of graduates from
academic institutions in high-tech areas would increase from about
2,000 to 4,000 annually by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction that, for the first time, Israel's
government, academia and industry are ready to ensure the
continued growth of high-technology industries by making available
trained personnel in the quantity and quality needed by the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu asked the council two months ago to devise a plan to
increase the number of university and college students in the
high-tech fields in order to preserve Israel's relative advantage
in high-tech industries and to enable increased exports.
</P>
<P>
Levtzion said that the high-tech industry would continue to
expand for as long as it continues to offer computer science and
electronics engineering graduates professional challenges and
good working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The professor added that the current plan to increase the
number of high-tech students was supported by the Finance
Ministry, which will increase the annual budget of the
participating institutions accordingly despite the budgetary
cuts.

<HEADLINE> Africa Takes Common Position on Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The grave child labor
situation in Africa has aroused much concern among ministers
attending the 68th ordinary session of the council of ministers
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted by the session which is to end Sunday
night, all delegates agreed on the African Common Position and
plan of action on child labor in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The resolution endorses the report of the OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim as well as the
recommendations put forward by the 21st session of the OAU Labor
and Social Affairs Commission held in Pretoria, South Africa,
from 13 to 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations will constitute the African common
position on child labor.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations suggest that OAU member states urgently
sign, ratify and implement the African Charter on the Rights and
Welfare of the Child in order to ensure the protection, welfare
and development of the African children.
</P>
<P>
The 68th session asked the OAU secretary-general in
collaboration with United Nations Children's Fund, International
Labor Organization (ILO) and social partners to carry out a study
and devise an appropriate strategy, persuade member states to
sign and ratify the charter to ensure its coming into force as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent ILO data, there are about 80
million child workers in Africa, the highest number than in any
other part of the world. Against this background, the future is
gloomy and if the current economic and social trends persist, the
number of child laborers in Africa could swell to well over 100
million by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
Child labor, as defined by OAU, is work, paid or unpaid, which
deprives the child of an education or threatens safety, health,
or morals which is considered as exploitation of the child, even
when employed in family enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In order to find solutions to the most intolerable, hazardous
and abusive forms of child labor, a number of international
meetings have been held in recent years.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Call for Contribution to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- African countries have
appealed to the international community to contribute to a
special continental fund for drought and famine in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The special emergency assistance fund for drought and famine
in Africa, set up by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), has
so far raised a total reserve of 5.75 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
But more resources should be pooled for the fight against
Africa's continuous drought, famine and natural disasters, which
constitute a constant threat to the economy and the survival of
people in many African countries, according to OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
"The worsening food situation, the persistent drought in
Africa and insufficient and inadequate financial transfers have
made it imperative for us to translate into concrete action
African cooperation and solidarity," Salim told an OAU council of
ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council of ministers, which will soon conclude its 68th
ordinary session here Sunday night, adopted a resolution,
extending an appeal for international aid to the fund.
</P>
<P>
The resolution "appeals to the international community,
governments, governmental and non-governmental organizations,
businessmen, as well as economic operators to contribute
generously to the fund," the resolution said.

<HEADLINE> Air France Striking Pilots Vow to Continue Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

PARIS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The head of the principal union of
striking pilots of Air France said Sunday that the pilots are
determined to continue the strike until the end.
</P>
<P>
"We will go until the end of the conflict. The ball is in the

the president of the SNPL, the biggest pilots' union in France,
</P>

Air France pilots have been on strike since last Monday despite

"The conflict will continue. But we hope to resume talks with
the management as soon as possible. I think they would resume," he

The pilots are disputing a plan by the management to lower
their salaries by 15 percent in exchange for the company's shares.
</P>
<P>
They are also demanding the scrapping of a double standard in
pays for younger pilots, which are much lower than that for older
pilots.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Slams Iraqi Statement on Border Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday flatly
rejected the Iraqi statement that shed doubt on U.N. Security
Council Resolution 833 on the demarcation of the Kuwait-Iraq
borders.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan was reported to have
said in Rabat, Morocco, that there was no legal value in the
Resolution 833 concerning the demarcation of the borders between
Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Kuwaiti Cabinet after its weekly
session said that the Iraqi stance was a "serious threat" and
revealed the true Iraqi intentions against the State of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet said the Kuwait-Iraq border demarcation was based
on the agreements existing between the two states as well as
documents and testimonials submitted by the sides.
</P>
<P>
It added that the demarcation was done through the precise
technical work by the U.N. committee entrusted with border
setting, and that the process was not just a reallocation of
territories.
</P>
<P>
This demarcation was legalized by the U.N. Security Council in
a unanimous vote, by the border demarcation committee resolutions
and the endorsement by the Iraqi government itself, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry Friday deplored the
Iraqi statement, saying that Kuwait would take legal and
political actions required at both Arab and international arenas
to preserve the country's rights and enforce the full
implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait led to the Gulf War in 1991,
which ended with Iraq's defeat. In May 1993, the U.N. Security
Council adopted the Resolution 833 on the demarcation of
Iraqi-Kuwait borders based on the recommendations put forward by a
U.N. demarcation committee.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait approved the resolution shortly after its passage, but
Iraq only accepted it in November 1994 as part of its efforts to
end the U.N. sanctions imposed after the Gulf War.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac said
Sunday that security is the essential concern for France in the
upcoming football World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Agence France-Presse (AFP), Chirac also
called on the striking Air France pilots to end their week-long
strike and take up their responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"As for security, it is our essential concern. I know by
experience that, in this field, we can never be sure about
anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that France is doing all it can to ensure security
for all during the World Cup finals from June 10 to July 12.
</P>
<P>
"Concerning the strike or the demonstrations, each one should
evidently prove a spirit of responsibility. There will be credit
to the image of France," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also defended the stand of the French Committee of
Organization (CFO) in ticket distribution, saying that the CFO is
following the rule of the International Federation of Football
(FIFA).
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has severely criticized the CFO for its
way of distributing tickets, accusing it of being unfair to other
European countries.
</P>
<P>
"The ticket distribution concerns only the CFO and the FIFA. It
should be between the two that the problem be solved. To my
knowledge, the CFO has applied the rules of the FIFA," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that any abuse of drugs must be fought with
firmness during the matches.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the opening ceremony Wednesday, Chirac will also
attend the match between France and Denmark to be held in Lyon.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi and Jordanian officials
Sunday held talks on promoting bilateral cooperation in health
area in an effort to help the worsening health situation in the
sanctions-ridden Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, officials from the two sides discussed means
of developing bilateral relations in health area and stressed the
importance of exchanging visits and medical and pharmaceutical
expertise, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak reviewed the
deteriorating health situation and the impact of continuing U.N.
sanctions on Iraq, saying hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people,
mostly children, have died as a result of sanctions-caused
shortage of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Ashraf Kurdi, the Jordanian health minister, who
arrived here on Friday leading a medical delegation, hailed Iraq's
national position and its people's steadfastness and courage in
facing up to the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his ministry's service was placed at the
disposal of the Iraqi health and medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that three special committees would be set
up to consider curative, preventive and medical matters.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian medical team participating in the current
Iraqi-Jordanian medical week on Sunday performed a number of
surgeries in Iraqi hospitals of eye diseases, digestive apparatus,
bone fracture and heart diseases.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Visits Sudan to Continue Push for Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
visited Sudan Sunday in his continued bid to push for holding an
Arab summit to pressure Israel to carry out the long-delayed
further redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Arafat concluded his several-hour visit following talks with
President Omar al-Bashir on the Middle East peace process and
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
But top on his agenda here was to solicit Sudanese support for
his idea of holding an Arab summit to discuss the protracted
deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here, Arafat blasted Israel for pushing the
region into the current state of tension and crisis by failing to
abide sincerely and accurately by the signed Israeli-Palestinian
accords.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader stressed that the peace accords with
Israel are not bilateral but international ones signed by Russia,
the U.S., the European Union, Norway, Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He once again urged the international community to take
actions to save the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's Sudanese visit was apparently part of his ongoing
efforts to convene an Arab summit in order to formulate a common
Arab strategy to confront the Israeli intransigence. The
Israeli-Palestinian talks have been stalled for over one year
mainly because of Israel's repeated delays in carrying out further
troop redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Since late May, Arafat has already visited Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates, Oman, Jordan and Yemen to lobby for support
for holding an Arab summit. Although most Arab leaders have agreed
to attend such summit, no agreement has been reached on when,
where and how to hold it due to the difference over what stance
should take toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the call for holding an Arab summit aims not only
to review the Middle East peace process, but also to discuss ways
of restoring unity and solidarity among the Arab world. It will
also explore ways of facing up to the challenges posed to the Arab
world as one integrated and cohesive power at this delicate stage,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made clear that the time and venue of the summit have
not been specified so far and that most of the Arab countries
which he has contacted agreed on holding the summit.
</P>
<P>
"Since the Madrid Peace Conference, the Arab nation was keen on
the Middle East peace process under the land-for-peace banner,
while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raises the
security-for-peace banner," Arafat said.

<HEADLINE> Africa Vows to Boost Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- African ministers Sunday
reaffirmed their determination to boost education for the
development of the continent's immense natural riches and
numerous potentials.
</P>
<P>
At the end of its 68th ordinary session, the council of the
ministers of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) agreed to
adopt the strategy on the establishment of the coordination,
follow-up and evaluation mechanisms to facilitate the
implementation of the first decade of education in Africa between
1997 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
The council also adopted a draft program of action of the
decade of education, which was launched by OAU in November 1997
as a collective effort to promote education in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The program of action aims to help translate into concrete
terms the political will of African countries to establish
education systems suitable to the development of the continent.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, African countries should endeavor to give
access to basic education for all Africans, develop technical and
vocational education, beef up higher education and research, as
well as language education to facilitate exchanges among African
countries, where a good number of languages are used.
</P>
<P>
The priority areas of the program also cover education for
girls and women, and children in all conditions.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the training of teachers, the comprehensive
program also stresses education of adults in rural areas, working
adults, the unemployed and refugees in a broad field ranging from
civic education to that for regional integration and
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim,
diminishing financial resources and the growing demand for
education and training have constituted the major challenges that
Africa has to face up to at the dawn of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The program therefore proposed that African countries build a
purposeful will to help release resources and pool resources by
all possible means.
</P>
<P>
The mechanisms for coordination, follow-up and evaluation
institution should be established for various countries to steer
the implementation of the program to the objectives at regional
and continental levels.
</P>
<P>
Thus the council of ministers requested all OAU member states
and sub-regional economic communities to cooperate with OAU by
drawing up their respective programs of action and establishing
similar structures for harmonized conduct of activities.

<HEADLINE> Iran Concerned Over Ethiopia-Eritrea Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday expressed serious
concern over recent military clashes between Ethiopia and
Eritrea, calling on the two African countries to solve their
disputes through political means.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that
it is incorrect to solve differences and disputes by resorting to
force and hostility, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that both Ethiopia and Eritrea should make use
of their natural resources and economic potentials for their
development, adding that Iran supports any sincere efforts to put
an end to the conflicts and bring tranquillity and stability to
the region.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea entered into a military confrontation
since Friday when they bombarded each other, but both sides
claimed that their actions were merely defensive.
</P>
<P>
The two African countries were one until Eritrea gained
independence in 1993. They are at odds over a border area that is
claimed by both sides. Both countries have used aircraft, tanks and
artillery.

<HEADLINE> Hussein Optimistic About Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Following talks with Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai here Sunday, Jordan's King Hussein said
that he is optimistic about resuming the long-stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said this was because Israel is considering the peace
proposal put forward by the United States and ready to sign an
agreement with the Palestinians on troops withdrawal from the
occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
During his whirlwind visit here, Mordechai briefed Hussein on
the Israeli government's latest ideas about the U.S. proposal
aimed at restoring the deadlocked peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"I'm more optimistic," said Hussein to reporters after the
meeting. "I'm satisfied with what I heard from Mordechai and I
hope that things will move in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
As to the U.S. peace proposal, the king said that it is an
important one which came as the result of long study and should
deserve positive response. He added that he was glad to see that
the U.S. remains to be the main sponsor of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Mordechai said that Israel is still considering
the U.S. proposal calling for a 13 percent Israeli withdrawal in
the second stage of three-phase pullbacks in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the framework of the U.S. proposal, the Israeli
government will "soon" reach an agreement with the Palestinians
on the Israeli troop withdrawal and both sides will "find a way to
move forward with the peace process," said Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
"There are some projects and some ideas that need to be
encouraged by everyone -- in the Israeli side, in the Palestinian
side -- and of course by His Majesty the king, to support the
peace process," added the minister, while declining to give more
details.
</P>
<P>
This was the second official visit that Mordechai paid to Arab
countries in the past weeks to promote the Israeli idea about the
U.S. proposal. He went to Egypt to meet President Hosni Mubarak
last week.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been trying to prevent the holding of an proposed
Arab summit being actively pushed by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, who hopes to exert pressure on Israel over the
redeployment issue.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, hopes emerged that an agreement on the
redeployment is imminent because Israel is closer to accepting the
U.S. pullback plan.
</P>
<P>
But the optimism has been dampened Sunday by remarks made by
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told the weekly
Cabinet meeting that "it is not possible we are on the verge of an
agreement."

<HEADLINE> Sudan Renews Support for Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir
renewed Sunday his country's support for holding a summit grouping
all the Arab countries to discuss problems facing the Arab nation,
including the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with visiting Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat here, al-Bashir told reporters that
the Arab nation is in need of reviewing the situation in the Arab
arena to adopt a position that guarantees the restoration of the
Arab rights, safety and security.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the proposed summit would be a step forward
to the restoration of the Arab solidarity and unification of the
Arab rank, pointing out that without unity, the Arabs would never
be able to foil the conspiracies targeting them.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the summit would normalize relations
among the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Arafat said that his call for an Arab summit does
not aim to deal with the stalemate of the Middle East peace
process only, but it also seek to restore the Arab solidarity and
joint action, thus enabling the Arab nation to face up to the
challenges as one integrated power.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference after his meeting with al-Bashir,
Arafat said that contacts are still underway and that some of the
Arab leaders who have been contacted are against the summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here from Cairo for a several-hour visit before
heading for the summit of Organization of African Unity, due to
open on Monday in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Israeli Peace Activists Joinly Bash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented development, two
Egyptian and Israeli peace movements joined hands in a grass-roots
campaign seeking the change of the policies of Israel's Likud
government towards the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
A joint document will come to light after a full year of
serious discussions and studies by popular forces and
intellectuals to face the serious deterioration of the process,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Egyptian peace activist
Lotfi el Khouli as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The document pronounces an outright rejection to the policies
of the Likud government, said Khouli, member of the Egyptian Peace
Movement, a group that features a number of prominent writers and
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The document will be made public at a joint press conference
given by the Egyptian Peace Movement and Israel's Peace Now
movement in Cairo on Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of Peace Now, Israel's largest peace group with
thousand of members, arrived here on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Khouli said the document provides a further step towards the
Copenhagen Peace Declaration, which was launched in January 1997
through an initiative by European intellectuals and called for
cooperation among world peace activists.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time intellectuals and popular forces
contribute in a public and organized manner to abort the policies
of Netanyahu and the radical forces and open the door to a just,
balanced and overall peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of this unparalleled document is to "guide
peace on the popular, intellectual and cultural levels to override
the stalemate," he said, adding that "our main affliction is to
change the policies and not the government."
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has been gradually grounded to a
standstill since the Likud government taking power two years
ago. International mediation has so far failed to change the
Israeli hard-line policy.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies IMF Pressure Behind Bank Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Economy Yousef
Boutros Ghali Sunday categorically denied that Egypt has bowed to
pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in privatizing
its state-owned banks.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview here, Ghali said the agreement that
Egypt signed in 1991 with the IMF will end in July and there will
be no other agreements in future, an indication that Egypt no
longer needs to borrow money as its economy is going strong.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Egypt "might seek some foreign
experience to develop the banking sector. But Egyptians will be
responsible in the first place for the developing of this
important sector."
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Sunday that the Egyptian Trade Union Federation (ETUF)
will set up a special committee to discuss the protection of the
rights of bank workers and improving banking services during the
privatization process.
</P>
<P>
ETUF Secretary General Mohamed Moursi said shares should be
offered first to bank employees, then to Egyptian investors and
finally to Arab investors.
</P>
<P>
"The sale of shares should be in accordance with fixed
percentages and the role of the state should continue to provide
guarantees to depositors, in order to protect them against any
economic shakes and to encourage citizens to invest their money in
national banks so that they may continue to play their economic
role," he added.
</P>
<P>
ETUF does not oppose privatizing the banks so long as the
rights and benefits of workers are protected, Moursi said.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary sub-committee on the economy approved in May a
bill to privatize the four national banks, namely the National
Bank of Egypt, Misr Bank, Bank of Alexandria and Bank du
Caire. The four banks hold 70 percent of the country's commercial
assets, 60 percent of deposits and 68 percent of loans.
</P>
<P>
The parliament is expected to vote for privatization in
mid-June, allowing the government to put the banks on sale before
the end of the year, although actual privatization would begin later.
</P>
<P>
The move to privatize the banks and state-held insurance
companies has unleashed a wave of protests in Egypt, as opponents
warned that the sale of national banks would undermine the economy.
</P>
<P>
But Ghali has assured earlier that the privatization process
would be accompanied by strict government measures to protect
depositors, including Central Bank intervention in case of
problems.

<HEADLINE> Africa Moves to Boost Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- African ministers have decided
to invite their heads of state and government to be here for a
summit next monday to focus on the promotion of economic
integration in the continent.
</P>
<P>
At a ministerial meeting called by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) which is to end Sunday night, the participants
discussed a report on the African Economic Community (AEC).
</P>
<P>
The report, made at the AEC Economic and Social Commission
meeting two months ago, covers a wide range of issues concerning
the structure and future operations of AEC, inaugarated at last
year's OAU summit in Harare, Zimbabwe, for continental economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
The issues include preparation for an AEC budget, cooperation
between AEC and other regional and sub-regional economic
communities, as well as the development strategies of the
community.
</P>
<P>
At the 68th ordinary session of the OAU council of ministers,
the ministers decided to submit the said report to the assembly
of heads of state and government for approval.
</P>
<P>
the meeting also called for scrupulous implementation of the
protocol on the relations between AEC and regional communities,
which was signed in February this year.
</P>
<P>
Regional economic communities which have not yet signed the
protocol are urged to do so as early as possible, while member
states of the Arab Magreb Union and those of AEC are also
requested to pursue efforts for normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
For a continent that has been mired in almost two decades of
economic crisis, Africa has achieved encouraging economic growth
over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the momentum, African countries are fully
aware that economic integration is the only way for collective
development.
</P>
<P>
Perfect performance of AEC is regarded as the first and most
important step to this end.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus: U.S. Embassy Letter Not A Sign of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
clarified that a letter issued by the U.S. Embassy here to its
citizens in Cyprus is not a sign that the embassy fears a war on
the island over the Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
A written statement by government spokesman Christos
Stylianides available Sunday said "it has been clarified after an
investigation, and assurances have been given by the U.S. Embassy
that the letter is normal practice in order to fill in the
personal data of the list of American citizens living in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Stylianides was responding to a TV report on Friday night that
the U.S. Embassy had issued a letter to its citizens living in
Cyprus, requesting information on the number of Americans living
on the island.
</P>
<P>
The TV report has suggested that the letters were sent because
of U.S. fears over the planned deployment of the Russian S-300
missiles on the island later in the year.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said that the U.S. Embassy has also assured the
Cypriot government that the process is carried out at regular
intervals.
</P>
<P>
The embassy, however, said earlier in the week that it did have
a contingency plan for the evacuation of the 2,000 or so
U.S. citizens on the island.
</P>
<P>
A similar report in the British press a week ago caused
outrage on the island when it was revealed that the British
government had a contingency plan to evacuate 250,000 British
tourists in the event of war.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus openly accused Britain's Defense Ministry of leaking
the information in an effort to prevent the deployment of the
missiles. As a result, Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides Friday
snubbed the Queen's official birthday celebrations on the British
bases in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered the Russian-made surface-to-air
S-300 missile system in January 1997, which is expected to be
deployed on the island in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The deal was criticized by the U.S., Britain and some others,
and met strong opposition from Turkey, which has threatened to
destroy the missiles if they are deployed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Unhappy With Pilots' Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos on Monday
condemned as "unpatriotic" the strike by some pilots of Philippine
Airlines (PAL), saying they were abandoning their planes and
passengers in Bangkok and Hong Kong who were on their way to
Manila.
</P>
<P>
Ramos expressed his dismay during a briefing for
President-Elect and Vice President Joseph Estrada and members of
his new cabinet Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Ramos cited the plight of passengers who were stranded in
Bangkok over the weekend when the PAL pilots declared a strike,
according to the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the act was "unpatriotic" since the pilot could have
flown the plane to Manila as it was home bound.
</P>
<P>
The PAL management has fired all leaders and members of its
620-strong pilots union for declaring a strike which entered the
third day Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talks are still going on to resolve the strike which has
crippled PAL's domestic and international operations.
</P>
<P>
PAL, the country's flag carrier, is losing some 150 million
pesos a day as a result of the work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
The pilots have been staging the strike in protest of a new
policy of the PAL management to retire pilots who have logged
20,000 flying hours. The pilots condemned the action as unfair and
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
But the PAL management said the policy was already contained in
a collective bargaining agreement signed by the union and the PAL
earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette smugglings in Vietnam are
increasing alarmingly, especially since late last year, the
Vietnam News Monday quoted the Trade Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, around 160 million packages of
cigarettes have been seized each year, according to an official of
the Trade ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said the figure represented only about 10
percent of the cigarettes illegally brought into Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
From early December in 1997 to the end of February in 1998,
more than 6.2 million packages of cigarettes were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
High profit was the main reason of continued cigarette
smuggling. Because of the financial crisis in the Southeast
region, cigarette prices have become very cheap in the Southeast
countries.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges All States to Work Towards Drug-Free World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday called on all states to coordinate their efforts and
work towards a drug-free world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the Special Session of the
General Assembly on the World Drug Problem, Annan expressed the
hope that this session will be the time when the international
community found common ground in the mission to create momentum
towards a drug-free world in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed Political Declaration is the product of hard work
and effort. It is rare for consensus to be reached on substantive
as well as political issues months in advance of a Special
Session," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"The ground-breaking Declaration on the Guiding Principles of
Demand Reduction creates a balanced approach which, for the first
time, addresses the responsibility of nations where consumption is
a problem as well as that of nations where production is a
problem," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"In each case, a target must be met. By the year of 2008,
Member States should have made real progress in eliminating or
reducing significantly crops of opium poppy, coca and cannabis.
The growing trend in abuse and production of psychotrophic
substance must be reversed," the U.N. secretary-general stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations International Drug Control Program has
risen to the challenge. It has shaped a balanced and global
strategy to implement the decisions that will be adopted during
the crucial three days. The new version represents a quantum leap
from the piecemeal and pilot projects of the past three decades,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"When we pull together from all corners of the world to try to
solve a problem, we will always succeed. Let this be one of those
occasions. It's time for all nations to say `yes' to the challenge
of working towards a drug-free world," he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Incoming Ruling Party Seen to Break Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' incoming ruling
party, the so-called United Opposition, is seen to break up as its
winning presidential candidate Joseph Estrada is trying to revive
his own tiny party.
</P>
<P>
President-Elect Estrada, who won the May 11 polls under the
banner of the LAMMP (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses) party,
confirmed Monday that the next ruling party will be his Partido ng
Masang Pilipino (PMP or Party of Filipino Masses).
</P>
<P>
The PMP is one of the three opposition parties which merged to
form the LAMMP last year in order to beat the ruling Lakas-NUCD
(National Union of Christian Democrats) party.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters that the LAMMP is not a political party
since it was not even recognized by the Commission on Elections
(COMELEC) and was created only for the purpose of presenting a
unified ticket in the elections.
</P>
<P>
The LAMMP also includes the LDP (Fight of Democratic Filipinos)
and the Nationalist People's Coalition (NPC).
</P>
<P>
But the COMELEC failed to accredit the LAMMP as a party after
some leaders of the NPC withdrew from the merger.
</P>
<P>
"The election is over and so we now should stick with our own
parties," said Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said earlier that the PMP's door is open to defectors
from other parties including the present ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is to meet with LAMMP leaders to determine the fate of
the coalition.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmaker Hopes to Improve Relations With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. Congressman said
he hoped that the United States and China will continue to work
together to improve their relationship.
</P>
<P>
In a interview with Xinhua, Representative Lee H. Hamilton, a
Democrat from Indiana, said the two countries have made some
progress in improving the relations, although progress comes hard
and slowly.
</P>
<P>
That's why the dialogue between the presidents of the two
countries is so important, said Hamilton, Ranking Minority Member
on the House International Relations Committee, who began his term
in the House in 1965.
</P>
<P>
"President (Bill) Clinton's visit to China is very important. I think
we are seeking to place U.S.-China relations on a more normal
basis, a more solid footing," Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's terribly important for the two leaders to meet
regularly to talk about the problems that exist between the two
countries and I think the summit meetings are very helpful," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Asked about China's MFN status, the Representative said it
will eventually be approved, but it will go through a "rocky
and difficult process."
</P>
<P>
MFN is a very important symbol of the U.S.-China relationship,
he said. "If we were to defeat the MFN treatment to China, it
would send a huge signal of deterioration of U.S.-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said a lot of people who oppose President Clinton are using
the China policy as a means of attacking him politically and
attacking the Democratic Party, even though the president's policy
was originally established by former President Richard Nixon and
has been carried out by every president, Republican and Democrat
since the opening to China in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
On Chinese-American relations, Hamilton said, "We have many
areas where we cooperate and many areas where we do not."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Clinton will make a reciprocal visit to
China later this month following Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
trip to the United States last fall.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Campaign to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel launched a campaign on
Monday to boost the tourism of the country which has suffered a
setback due to the stalemate in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was started with the unveiling of a logo for the
tourism of the year 2000 with the elements of the year, the holy
land and peace on display.
</P>
<P>
The logo was displayed at an official ceremony at the foot of
the wall of Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is to attract more than 4 million tourists to the
country that year, or doubling the number of foreign visitors in
1997, said Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Since Christianity attaches great importance to making
pilgrimages to the religious sites in Israel in 2000, Katsav said
there will be an increase in the Christian tourists' number in
that year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel has invested 3 million U.S. dollars to
improve tourism infrastructure in the past four years and will
continue to invest the same amount in this field before the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the campaign goes on without any political
considerations and called for the neighbor countries to cooperate
at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry is a key source of Israel's revenue. But
since the Middle East peace process was stalemated a year ago,
the number of visitors has been steadily declining.

<HEADLINE> WHO to Launch Anti-Malaria Drive in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
regional office for Africa said here Monday it was preparing for
a program that would progressively reduce illnesses and deaths
due to malaria to a minimum in Africa over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The program, called African Initiative for Malaria Control in
the 21st century (AIM), will be launched next year and will cover
all the 46 countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the WHO said the initiative will be
implemented in phases and was expected to reduce malaria
illnesses and deaths in the region by 50 percent by the year
2010.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate goal, according to WHO, is that by the year
2030, malaria will neither be the major contributor to mortality
and morbidity nor significant socio-economic consequence," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is one of the leading health problems in Africa,
especially in sub-Sahara region. About 550 million people in the
African region risk the disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease attacks between 270 and 480 million people and
kills between 1.5 and 2.7 million each year.
</P>
<P>
The malaria problem is increasing because the malaria parasite
has developed resistance to some of the anti-malaria drugs and
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
"The economic consequences of malaria-related diseases are
enormous. The direct and indirect losses due to malaria in the
region rose from 800 million U.S. Dollars in 1987 to more than
2,000 million U.S. Dollars in 1997," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The key features of the implementation of the initiative will
be early treatment of malaria cases, promotion of the use of
insecticide-impregnated nets, prevention and strengthening of the
capacities of countries and communities to combat the disease,
according to the statement.

<HEADLINE> International Ferroalloy Congress Brings China Closer to World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing three-day Eighth
International Ferroalloy Congress here has been seen by many as an
opportunity to connect Chinese ferroalloy manufacturers and
traders with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese participants are "abroad in China," said Yang
Zhizhong, director of the Ferroalloy department of China's
Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest ferroalloy producer but, generally
speaking, its ferroalloy industry is still closed to the rest of
the world, said Zhong Zengyong, vice-president of the Chinese
Metals Society.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhong, only a few representatives attended the
last several congresses that were held in other countries.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the current congress has attracted 160
Chinese delegates, including those representing major
manufacturers. The remaining 280 participants are from 36 other
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, China has remained the largest
ferroalloy producer and exporter, with an annual production of 4
million to 4.3 million tons and annual exports of one million to
1.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
A huge investment is, however, still required to upgrade
technology in energy conservation and environmental
protection. And the Chinese government is working on export
policies concerning the industry to better safeguard the interests
of Chinese exporters.
</P>
<P>
The congress opened Sunday and was organized by the Chinese
Metals Society.
</P>
<P>
Participants will discuss materials, treatment, energy-saving
technologies, environmental protection, automated control and
other topics during the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Discuss Issues with India, Bhutan: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said here Monday that he will discuss with Indian
and Bhutanese leaders bilateral issues on the sidelines of the
coming SAARC summit.
</P>
<P>
Koirala told the press at his official residence that during
the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) to be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in July, he
will meet with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to
discuss the issue of Kalapani in far-western Nepal which borders
India.
</P>
<P>
He said Kalapani is Nepalese territory and his country will not
even lose one inch of the land.
</P>
<P>
He said that when Indian President K. R. Narayanan visited
Nepal in late May, they talked about the issue and the president
took a positive attitude toward solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said high-level committees have been formed
in both countries to solve the Kalapani issue.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, he summoned Indian Ambassador to Nepal K. V. Rajan
to tell him that his statement on Kalapani is not correct.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with a Nepalese student delegation last Wednesday,
the Indian ambassador said that according to all the records
available to the Indian government, Kalapani has been on the
Indian side of the border since the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Koirala said he will also request Bhutanese King
Jigme Singye Wangchuck to resolve the refugee issue as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eastern Nepal
in eight U.N.-run camps after they were forced to flee Bhutan in
1989 and the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of ministerial talks between the two Himalayan
kingdoms have failed to produce any result.

<HEADLINE> Blatter Elected New FIFA President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Swiss Joseph Blatter will succeed
Joao Havelange as president of the International Football
Federation (FIFA) after winning 111 votes from 191 members of FIFA
meeting here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old secretary general of FIFA was formally elected
after his rival, Swedish Lennart Johansson, 68, announced his
withdrawal when the second round of voting began.
</P>
<P>
An two thirds absolute majority, or 128 votes, are officially
required for election in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Very excited, Blatter immediately found his daughter, Corinne,
who masterminded the campaign for her father.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing president Havelange, who supported Blatter during the
campaign, praised Johansson for showing his sportsmanship by
admitting defeat after the first round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Johansson was supported by the International Olympic Committee
president Juan Antonio Samaranch, Football King Pele, Europe (not
France) and Africa after he announced his candidacy in November
1995.
</P>
<P>
Blatter, who is a close friend of French soccer star Michel
Platini, will be the 8th president of FIFA since its creation in
1904.
</P>
<P>
He left the world with a deep impression when presiding the
World Cup lots drawing ceremony held last December in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
When he announced in Paris his candidacy for FIFA presidency in
March, he gave the following slogan: ``One football for all, and
all for football.''
</P>
<P>
"It should be above all now that the unity of football be
maintained," he said after being elected.
</P>
<P>
He proposed a closer collaboration with national football
associations, especially those most underprivileged, the
establishment of a bureau of executive committee consisting of
seven FIFA members, and the holding of annual national congresses
of the federation.
</P>
<P>
Platini, who is expected to serve as the executive director of
sports for FIFA under Blatter, said that he expects the most
difficult battles ahead.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Vow to Station Medical Teams in Poor Areas of Qinghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Up to 14 hospitals of Xining City,
capital of northwest China's Qinghai Province, have vowed to
station medical teams in 14 poor counties where local people are
living under the state-set poverty line.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the provincial health department said
that the move aims to alleviate the lingering problems of local
people who have difficulty finding medical treatment when ill.
</P>
<P>
All 14 counties are located in mountainous areas and inhabited
by a variety of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the provincial health department has
dispatched several medical teams to these areas, a move which has
met with unexpected success and warm welcome from local people.
</P>
<P>
Because of its success, the department has decided to institute
the program as a system, instead of occasionally dispatching
medical teams.
</P>
<P>
The department also has persuaded 14 hospitals to sign
contracts with the 14 counties, all pledging to station their
teams in the counties for at least six months each year.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, the 14 hospitals have dispatched 104
medical teams to these counties, providing medical treatment for
100,000 local people.
</P>
<P>
Those hospitals have also donated some 2,300 pieces of medical
equipment to the 14 counties and trained more than 1,700 medical
workers for those areas.

<HEADLINE> New Philippine Government to Inherit Huge Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President-Elect Joseph
Estrada said Monday that he expects his economic program to face
rough sailing due to the 8 billion pesos (204.6 million U.S.
dollars) budget deficit the Ramos administration will be leaving
behind.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, outgoing Budget Secretary Emilia Boncodin was reported
as saying that the huge budget deficit is already a "distinct
possibility" because "revenues (are) further deteriorating and the
avenue for further expenditure cuts (is) now practically closed."
</P>
<P>
"We have to face the reality... We have to suffer first,"
Estrada told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada expressed confidence that the economy will soon
recover, saying it has to face difficulties during the first few
months of his administration due to the deficit the Ramos
administration will be leaving behind.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his administration will also examine the manner of
disposition of funds by the Ramos government, to determine whether
the public's money was wasted.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos government had earlier set a 5 billion peso surplus
target for the whole 1998, but decided to revise the figure to
just 1 billion pesos (25.6 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Israel Inner Cabinet Fails to Decide on Hamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli inner cabinet failed
to make a decision at a meeting on Monday on whether to ban Hamas
spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin from returning to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said the inner cabinet will further
discuss this issue in the coming days and a decision would come
out soon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli inner cabinet consists of several key ministers and
makes decisions on important issues such as security and
defense.
</P>
<P>
Last week, several Israeli Knesset (parliament) members asked
the Defense Ministry to study the possibility of banning Yassin
from returning to Gaza, saying his current fund-raising trip to
Islamic and Arab nations has endangered Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here said banning Yassin's return to Gaza is
not that easy and Israel has to think about the reactions from
Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement), which is strongly opposing
the Oslo Accords and the Palestinian peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
has reportedly told the Israeli authorities on Sunday that Israel
should not prevent Yassin from returning to Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday I spoke with Israeli officials and told them not to
intervene...Yassin is a Palestinian and we will permit him to
return," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Hamas officials said Sunday that a
leaflet signed by Hamas military wing Izzadin Al-Kassam
criticizing Yassin for visiting Syria and Kuwait was fabricated or
instigated by Israel or the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet distributed at An-Najah University in Nablus and
in Gaza Sunday took issue with Yassin's visit to Kuwait where
hundreds of Palestinians have been held prisoner since the 1991
Gulf War. It argued against Yassin's stop in Syria where thousands
of Sunni Muslims were killed in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"We call on Yassin and those who accompanied him in his visit
to wake up and open their eyes, because fighters can not be bought
off with money, and fighters do not sit in front of the cameras
with oppressors," the leaflet said.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamas official Mahamoud Zahar said in Gaza on Sunday
that the leaflet is not authentic.
</P>
<P>
PNA also denied the charges on Sunday and said that the leaflet
was circulated by Palestinians opposed to Yassin's fund-raising
tour.
</P>
<P>
Yassin would reportedly cancel his trip to Libya and return to
Gaza soon via Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Li Lanqing Calls for Better Taxation, Reduced Expenditures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
today urged the country's taxation and fiscal departments to
intensify tax collection and reduce unnecessary expenditures.
</P>
<P>
At a national teleconference, Li said the national economy has
basically operated well this year, but that the situation for
fiscal revenue was not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
Li said the growth rate of value-added and consumer taxes
collected so far this year was far lower than in the same period
in the previous years.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the State Council has demanded that local
taxation departments should not exempt, reduce or postpone taxes
beyond their power. On the other hand, taxes must be handed over
to the state treasury on time, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Evasion, cheating and resistance on tax payments will be
penalized, and tax collectors who divert the fiscal revenue of the
central government will also be severely punished, the
vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to fiscal expenditures, Li said that fiscal
departments at various levels should adjust their expenditure
pattern in accordance with the reform arrangements of the State
Council and practical economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
Local departments should give priority to expenditures on grain
allowances, for basic life support of laid-off workers, for
re-employment programs, agriculture, the development of science
and technology, and education, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He urged local officials to better supervise expenditures on
key projects, suspend investment in overlapping and unprofitable
projects, and stop extravagance.
</P>
<P>
Any corrupt or incompetent officials in the country's fiscal
and taxation departments will be punished or removed, Li
said.

drugs by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
The political declaration calls for stronger domestic laws
and programmes by 2003 to deal with such issues as
money-laundering and synthetic drugs, increased drug prevention
among youth, and enhanced cooperation between nations to catch
and prosecute drug traffickings.
</P>
<P>
A declaration on demand reduction is also scheduled to be
adopted a the Special Session. It outlines principles to aid
governments to set up new or enhanced demand-reduction programmes
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also contains standards to guide governments in
setting up effective prevention, treatment and rehabilitation
programmes and calls for the provision of adequate resources for
such programmes.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Assembly is expected to adopt a series of
measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world
drug problem. Those include action plans to combat ATS and their
precursors and to promote international cooperation on the
eradication of illicit drug crops and on alternative development.
Other measures refer to controlling precursors,, promoting
judicial cooperation and countering money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations International Drug Control
Programme (UNDCP), annual illicit drug consumption is likely to
involve 3 to 4 percent of the world's population. Heroin and
cocaine -- the most dangerous drugs of abuse from the health
perspective -- are abused by 8 million and 13 million people,
respectively, but cannabis is the most widely abused substance
with 140 million consumers.
</P>
<P>
Because drug abuse transverses geographic and socio-economic
boundaries, demand reduction requires links between policy-makers
and population that are susceptible to drug use, as well as the
combined efforts of states, civil society organizations, health
professional and community leaders. Demand reduction must also
address new trends, such as "fashionable" drugs that form part of
a youth subculture.
</P>
<P>
Also during the Special Session, the Assembly will review
adherence to and implementation of international drug control
treaties. Those include, in addition to the 1988 Convention, the
1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs as amended by the 1972
Protocol, and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substance.
</P>
<P>
A number of side events are scheduled to be held in conjunction
with the Special Session, including symposiums on such topics as:
attacking the profits of crime on money-laundering; children,
youth and drug abuse, drugs and productivity; drug abuse and
HIV/AIDS; and drugs and development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Intervention in Kosovo Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said on
Monday that the United States has no immediate plans to send
troops to end ethnic fighting in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A military intervention "is not something that is on the
table," said Sandy Berger, President Bill Clinton's national
security advisor.
</P>
<P>
Berger made the remark aboard Air Force One while flying with
Clinton to New York, according to an Associated Press report.
Clinton is attending a United Nations conference on anti-narcotics.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies however may reconsider a recent
decision to suspend economic sanctions against Yugoslavia in the
next few days, said Berger.
</P>
<P>
That would likely include a ban on American investment in
Yugoslavia, whose dominant republic is Serbia.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose country
holds the current presidency of the European Union, discussed the
situation in Kosovo with Clinton by phone.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the two leaders agreed to send a strong message to
Belgrade over the escalating violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would join Britain in seeking a resolution from the
U.N. Security Council that would authorize the use of force, if
necessary, to ease tensions in the region, reported the Cable News
Network (CNN) television on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo are seeking independence
from Serbia. Washington has said that it would not support an
independent Kosovo, but insist more autonomy should be given to
the ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.

MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Office of the Philippine
Solicitor General has decided to withdraw a controversial plea it
had filed earlier seeking the acquittal of former first lady
Imelda Marcos on graft charges before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Justice Secretary and Acting Solicitor General Silvestre Bello
said Monday that they are going to submit a motion to ask for the
withdrawal of the petition.
</P>
<P>
Bello was appointed last week by President Fidel Ramos to
replace Romeo de la Cruz as solicitor general.
</P>
<P>
De la Cruz was dismissed by Ramos two days after he petitioned
the Supreme Court to reverse the 12-year graft conviction of
Imelda, widow of former President Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Ramos on Sunday ordered Bello to withdraw the petition which
has drawn strong protest from many sectors.
</P>
<P>
Bello said they will also ask the high court to give his office
10 days to study the case and file appropriate pleadings.

<HEADLINE> Construction Begins on Third-Phase of Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian and Chinese workers today
poured concrete into the base of the major factory building of the
nuclear power plant located in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The third phase of the nuclear power plant, which is now under
construction, includes China's first heavy water reactor for a
power station. Upon completion, the plant -- which will have a
generating capacity of 1.456 million kilowatts -- will begin
operations in February of 2003.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side signed contracts with Canadian businesses in
November of 1996 for the construction. The state development bank
also cooperated with foreign banks for loans.
</P>
<P>
China's National Nuclear Corp., East China Electric Group
Corp., Zhejiang Electric Development Corp., Shenneng Electric
Company Ltd. and Jiangsu Trust and Investment Corp. poured their
money into Qinshan No. 3 Nuclear Power Company Ltd., the legal
person of the nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State Council and neighboring Shanghai
Municipality and Jiangsu Province supported the project.
</P>
<P>
As the major contractor for the project, Atomic Energy of
Canada Limited took responsibility for the engineering design,
equipment manufacture, material, project management and personnel
training.
</P>
<P>
Chinese workers have excavated a total of 1.976 million cubic
meters of stone and earthwork for the project. The trunk road from
the plant to adjacent cities has also been finished.
</P>
<P>
The project now has a good start thanks to close cooperation
between Canadian experts and workers and Chinese workers, said
Zhang Huazhu, chairman of the board of directors of the Qinshan
No.3 Nuclear Power Company Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Zhang expressed his belief that the two sides will succeed in
building China's first heavy water reactor-equipped nuclear power
plant, which uses natural uranium rather than enriched uranium as
fuels.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Rejects U.N. Security Council Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee rejected Monday the U.N. Security Council resolution
adopted last Saturday which calls on India and Pakistan to stop
their nuclear and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
In his first reaction to the resolution, Vajpayee said in Rajya
Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, that decisions in
this regard would be taken by the Indian government on the basis
of its own assessments and national security.
</P>
<P>
He termed the resolution "unacceptable," saying India's nuclear
tests were necessary because of what he said the failure of a
flawed non-proliferation regime in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister described as "redundant" the Security
Council resolution urging India and Pakistan not to carry out any
nuclear weapon test and said New Delhi has already instituted a
voluntary moratorium.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the notion that the nuclear tests have adversely
affected either regional or global security.
</P>
<P>
He called for an earlier resumption of official talks with
Pakistan to resolve outstanding issues between the two neighbors
including Jammu and Kashmir, peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee ruled out any third party mediation in the dialogue
process and said India's proposals for modalities of talks have
been with Pakistan since January this year.
</P>
<P>
A secure and prosperous Pakistan is in India's interest, he
said, adding that India has always desired peaceful, friendly and
mutually beneficial relations with Pakistan based on confidence
and respect for each other's concerns.

<HEADLINE> Germany Tightens Safety Checks on High-Speed Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's rail authorities have
decided to make it routine to conduct special safety checkups on
the country's high-speed trains, officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after one of the trains derailed last week,
killing at least 98 people in the country's worst railroad crash
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
The checkup, in which ultrasonic equipment will be used, is to
determine whether the wheels of trains may have developed any
mechanical defects.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that a broken wheel led to the tragic derailment
which occurred last Wednesday near the northern German town of
Eschede.
</P>
<P>
The rail authorities have recalled 59 of the trains for an
ultrasonic checkup over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German police lowered the death toll of last
week's train crash to 98 from 102 as reported earlier, citing
reasons of a duplicate count. Rescue workers are still searching
the crash site for victims.
</P>
<P>
Officials on Monday admitted that the rail crash has undermined
public trust in the country's fastest trains, which can travel at
a speed of 280 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, another train approaching Regensburg in southern
Germany was stopped by the engineer who was concerned with unusual
noises coming from the engine. About 700 passengers were
transferred to another train as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
Authorities who inspected the train confirmed the driver's
suspicions: the noises had came from the engine, but the cause was
not known.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas to Replace Coal in Central Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will ban the burning of
coal in 105.39 square kilometers of its central districts by 2000
to reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas, piped from Shaanxi and Gansu provinces as well as
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China, will replace
coal in 40 designated regions within the Third Ring Road,
according to the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The use of coal is the main cause of Beijing's air pollution,
according to the bureau. Statistics show 90 percent of the city's
sulphur dioxide in the air in 1997 came from burning coal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Beijing will popularize quality coal with a low
sulphur content and energy-saving technology outside the 40
designated regions.
</P>
<P>
After the measures are taken, Beijing expects to reduce the
release of sulphur dioxide by 125,000 tons and dust by 84,000 tons
by 2000, according to the bureau.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Macao and the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) agreed on Monday to step up
cooperation in the legal and judiciary fields.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reached the consensus following a half-day
working visit to Macao by Elsie Leung Oi-Sie, secretary for
justice of the Hong Kong SAR. She came here at the invitation of
her Macao counterpart, Jorge Silveira.
</P>
<P>
During her visit, Leung briefed her host on the experience
gained in the legal and judicial fields since the establishment of
the Hong Kong SAR. The two sides also discussed the respective
legal systems in the two places and other legal and judicial
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Leung said the two sides agreed to increase contacts in the
future. They also agreed that it is necessary for the two sides to
reach some agreements on mutual legal assistance, such as the
transfer of documents and the repatriation of criminals and
fugitive offenders.
</P>
<P>
Leung is the highest SAR official to visit Macao since the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Tighten Wildlife Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday pledged to
further tighten wildlife protection laws to deter poaching.
</P>
<P>
"We have done so for the sake of protecting our environment by
amending our Environment Quality Act 1974 twice within a short
time frame, and we will not hesitate to do likewise to protect
wildlife from poachers," Science, Technology and Environment
Minister Law Hieng Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Between January 1997 and May 1998, five major syndicates
supplying poached wildlife for exotic food were busted and fined
in courts for a total of 50,000 ringgit (about 12,515 U.S.
dollars), he said in a speech launching the Malaysian leg of the
Asia Conservation Awareness Program (ACAP) here. The speech was
read out by his deputy Abu Bakar Daud.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the fines were reasonably high compared
to past years, his ministry is seriously looking into "tightening
further the Protection of Wildlife Act to make it a deterrent to
poach."
</P>
<P>
Law called for an awareness campaign targeted at members of the
public, who are willing to pay hefty sums for such items, to
minimize consumption of threatened wildlife and products.
</P>
<P>
The ACAP is an educational program involving the public and
local non-governmental organizations like the Malaysian Nature
Society in the conservation of threatened wildlife such as tigers,
rhinos, turtles, bears and elephants.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at encouraging the public to stop buying
products made from endangered species and increasing their
involvement in curbing the trade.

<HEADLINE> Africa Has 70% of World AIDS Cases: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has expressed concern over the AIDS mortality rate in Africa
which it said has 70 percent of the 20.8 million global cases of
infection.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, WHO Regional Director Ebrahim Samba
Monday said everyday 7,500 Africans get infected out of a global
total of 16,000 daily infections.
</P>
<P>
"The most vulnerable groups have been from Africa's most
active and productive people aged between 15 and 40. The results
have been a weakening productive base, a growing orphan
population, further strains on already under-staffed and
under-funded health services across the continent and the adverse
consequences of all these on the quality of life of Africa," said
Samba in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Samba said efforts so far made to contain the pandemic include
caring for the victims and the launching and promotion of
sensitization on safe sex.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of these efforts, the situation is worsening," Samba
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls for Reform Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B. J. Habibie
Monday asked the National Human Rights Committee to consider
setting up a working group on national reforms, an official said
here.
</P>
<P>
The working group will carry out the reform process in
political, economic and legal fields, Chairman of the National
Human Rights Committee Marzuki Darusman told reporters after
meeting with Habibie.
</P>
<P>
With the formation of the working group, the government will
gradually gain trust from the people, he said, adding that the
group will among other things work to free the government from
corruption, collusion and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Habibie said the country needs reform
brought about through an evolution, not a revolution. He explained
that this is the way in which he intends to pursue reform,
including preparations for a general election next year.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that his government has been rushing to
implement the various reform agendas. The government intends to
complete the laws on elections and political parties by August and
hold elections in May next year.
</P>
<P>
The president also promised to stick to the economic reform
programs reached between the government and the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Monday, Marzuki said, the president also
indicated that the government will release more political
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The government has released four political prisoners and
dropped charges against three female activists last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Justice Minister Muladi disclosed here Monday that a
total of 16 political prisoners will be released by the government
in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Two National Newspapers Organize Media Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Two Beijing-based national
newspapers, "Guangming Daily" and "Economic Daily," declared today
that they have organized newspaper groups as part of the reform of
China's media system.
</P>
<P>
Both newspapers are well-known among domestic and overseas
readers.
</P>
<P>
Founded nearly 50 years ago, the "Guangming Daily" has formed
an extensive network of news collection with more than 60 bureaus
at home and abroad. Three newspapers and three periodicals are
under the umbrella of the daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "Guangming Daily" has started businesses in
publishing, advertising, printing, social education and
consulting.
</P>
<P>
The "Economic Daily" was founded in 1983 along with the
country's overall reform and opening-up to the outside world. It
has set up 36 reporting stations throughout the country and
another 23 overseas. There also are six subsidiary papers and
periodicals.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also has started businesses in publishing,
advertising, printing, information services, cultural promotions
and real estate.
</P>
<P>
The founding of newspaper groups in China was started in 1995
by the "Guangzhou Daily." On May 18 the "Nanfang Daily" and
"Yangcheng Evening News" also declared that they had organized
newspaper groups.

<HEADLINE> Derivatives Increase Market Stability: HK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- For a mature financial market
with depth and breadth, risk management has become an
indispensable component, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the unveiling ceremony for the new corporate logo
of Hong Kong Futures Exchange, Tsang said: "A well-developed,
liquid and orderly derivatives market is essential to allow risks
to be easily transferred at market prices from one investor to
another." "This in turn offers support for trading and turnover at
the cash market and increases overall market stability and
liquidity."
</P>
<P>
"The growth of the derivatives market has fundamentally
transformed financial institutions' risk management and their
customers have been able to lower their funding costs and
structure risks to the desired level and configuration," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, "While we should welcome the
phenomenal growth of the derivatives market over the last two
decades, it does lead to concerns of market participants and
brings new challenges to regulators."
</P>
<P>
"Such debate is of course not unfamiliar to you who are
witnesses of the turmoil in the Asian financial market," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
Suggestions like downsizing the market, closing out more risky
operations and limiting trading might offer some comfort to those
who feel more at home with the traditional world of stocks and
shares, Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
"But even they must accept that, in a free and open market,
what has to go up will go up and what must go down will go
down. For every assertion that derivatives magnify volatility,
there is an equally valid assertion that they do, in fact,
smoothen volatility," Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government reiterated in a report released in
April this year its commitment to maintaining Hong Kong as an
international financial center and recognized the useful roles
that a properly-run and well-developed derivatives market plays in
this context, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government also recognized the need for
improvement in the market.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, we welcome the initiative by the Futures
Exchange to increase transparency of the market and enhance
trading efficiency through the upgrading of its trading system and
eventual migration of the trading of the Hang Seng Index futures
contracts to the Automated Trading System," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The Futures Exchange trades more than 26,000 index futures
contracts a day on average and offers more than 20 products
including stock indices futures and options, currency futures and
interest rate futures to its increasingly diversified clientele.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Not Concerned Over Currency Fluctuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEPANG (Malaysia), June 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here Monday that his government is no longer
concerned about the fluctuations of the ringgit against the U.S.
dollar because the country is moving toward barter trade.
</P>
<P>
"What we want to do is to get away from the value of the
ringgit and this can be done easily by conducting trade on a
countertrade basis or through practical bartering," he told
reporters after a visit to the new Kuala Lumpur International
airport here.
</P>
<P>
"We are not very concerned anymore," Mahathir said when asked
to comment on the ringgit's further decline against the greenback
Monday morning when the local unit went below the 4 ringgit mark
to 4.15 ringgit against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close Monday, the ringgit ended at 3.9950/005 to the
greenback against 3.9700/900 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia is expected to conduct trade through the
countertrade or barter trade system in an effort to reduce
dependence on foreign currency usage, especially the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He noted that even before this, the ringgit went down to 4.8 to
one U.S. dollar at one time, then recovered before it slid again.
</P>
<P>
"This is a play which we have no control of," he said,
stressing that the government would be working out how much the
country was exporting and how much it was importing in terms of
goods.
</P>
<P>
"The value of goods does not appreciate or depreciate whether
the ringgit changes in value," Mahathir said. He cited as an
example the value of a computer costing 700 U.S. dollars and a ton
of palm oil costing the same, noting that their value would be
unchanged even if the ringgit went up or down.
</P>
<P>
"When the ringgit depreciates or appreciates, it is 700 U.S.
dollars, so it makes no difference anyway," he added.

long-term, stable and cooperative Sino-Uruguayan relationship
oriented toward the next century.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Uruguayan relations have registered a smooth development

He told Batalla that China is willing to cooperate with Uruguay
in various forms and channels to further enhance bilateral
economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Batalla said he totally agrees with Hu's evaluation on
the Uraguay-China relations.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan side hopes to further boost Uraguay-China economic
and technological collaboration with the process of China's access
into the WTO, Batalla said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that China would expand its investment in
Uraguay and said Uruguay is willing to play a positive role in
promoting the relations between China and the Common Market in
south Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The two vice-presidents also briefed each other on their
respective domestic situation and reached extensive consensus on
major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed his admiration to the prolonged stable political
situation and the constant economic growth in Uruguay as well as
the country's important role in regional and world affairs.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> World Bank Aid to Angola Tops $130m </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has offered a total
of 130 million U.S. Dollars in the 10 aid programs for Angola so
far, a World Bank official has said.
</P>
<P>
Philip Civusu, World Bank representative to Angola, said in
central Angola's Calombolaca City that the first of the 10
programs aided by the bank started in 1992, which also heralded
the Bank's assistance in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank has pooled 135 million U.S. Dollars for
the programs which would take 270 million Dollars altogether as
planned, an Angola News Agency story said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the interruptions by the civil war in the country,
construction of the programs has gone half way.
</P>
<P>
The programs under World Bank financial aid mainly cover the
building of the tap water systems and the basic sanitation
facilities in Luanda and Benguela, the rehabilitation of the
power supply system in central Angola, and of four major roads,
among others.
</P>
<P>
Most of Angola's 18 provinces, Civusu said, have received aid
from the bank, with Angola social aid fund covering nine
provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Civusu said that the World Bank has helped train cadres for
Angola and offered technical support for the modernization of its
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Namibe, Lobito and Luanda, three of the major ports of the
country have been upgraded with new equipment provided by the
bank, he said.

<HEADLINE> BIS President on Medium-term Financial Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASLE, Switzerland, June 8 (Xinhua) -- It is essential to meet
certain preconditions in order to preserve the stability of the
domestic and international financial system in the medium-term,
President of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Alfons
Verplaetse said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian crisis has served as a painful reminder that the
potential benefits of open and global financial markets will be
realized only if certain preconditions are met," said Verplaetse at
the 68th annual meeting of the BIS.
</P>
<P>
Verplaetse, who is also chairman of the BIS Board of Directors,
said the public policy should, over the next few years, focus on
making progress in three interrelated areas: transparency,
incentives for market discipline and prudential regulations and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to transparency, central bankers have
increasingly emphasized that the effectiveness of domestic
policy-making depends crucially on markets clearly understanding
our objectives, our strategies and even our operational
procedures," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Transparency is equally vital in the private sector if lenders
and borrowers are to make informed decisions about the riskiness
of their prospective activities.
</P>
<P>
Public disclosure of meaningful data is a necessary
condition to ensure a proper degree of market discipline, but it
is not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Another necessary condition is that the market should also be
capable of monitoring effectively and interpreting appropriately
the information that is already available.
</P>
<P>
"Creating the right incentive structure for profitable, yet
prudent, financial decisions is a second major policy challenge,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the role played by the international interbank
market in the Asian arena, a careful assessment of the effect of
implicit and explicit safety nets on the behavior of both
creditors and borrowers is called for.
</P>
<P>
As part of this review, consideration should be given to the
impact on market attitudes of official liquidity support for
countries in crisis.
</P>
<P>
"A review of liquidity support packages is, in any event,
necessary since the continuous growth in their size threatens to
outstrip available resources. This raises once again the
long-standing question of the appropriate balance between
financing and adjustment," he added.
</P>
<P>
The third item on the medium-term agenda should be to further
enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework.
</P>
<P>
The core principles for effective banking supervision unveiled
last year are a landmark achievement in this regard, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Work is also under way to develop an understanding on sound
practices in other areas, with a view to international adoption in
a similar way. As experience with implementing the core principles
grows, there will also be the opportunity for new lessons to be
learned and for the principles to be adapted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
It is through such processes that regulation and supervision
will continue to be kept up to date in a rapidly evolving world.
</P>
<P>
"If headway can be made in each of the three areas I have just
singled out, and if the underlying payments and legal
infrastructure can also be strengthened, a more efficient as well
as a more stable financial system can be constructed over the
medium term," Verplaetse said. "This challenge goes far beyond the
BIS, and those who regularly meet here, to the whole of the
international community."
</P>
<P>
"There are difficult steps that still need to be taken by
national legislators around the world if the resilience of our
financial system is to be further reinforced and the likelihood of
future crises reduced," he pointed out. "What ultimately remains
to be seen is whether enough political will can be mustered to do
what needs to be done."

<HEADLINE> Minister Sees Weakness in Malaysia's Internal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's internal system has
weaknesses and should be rectified particularly during the current
economic slowdown, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister
Anwar Ibrahim said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"If firm measures are necessary, we will take them. If such
measures are necessary to guarantee the strength of our financial
institutions, we will adopt these measures so that they (financial
institutions) do not become paralyzed," he was quoted by the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying in the
southeastern state of Johor.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that even though Malaysia remains firm in calling
for reforms to the international monetary system and uncertain
market conditions, it also needs to realize that not everything
that is happening in the countries of this region is the result of
an unjust financial system.
</P>
<P>
"There are also internal ills and problems that need to be
corrected. If we refuse to accept the facts just like the past
leadership of Indonesia which refused to accept, then the people
will rise and demand changes in a harsh way," he was quoted as
saying when opening the Johor UMNO (United Malays National
Organization) Convention there.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysians should be grateful that the country need
not seek help from the International Monetary Fund as the
government has already taken the necessary measures to handle the
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
In this respect Malaysia needs strength and unity among the
people in facing the economic problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should make the corrections with determination and continue
reforming the culture of our society in dealing with the question
of the economy and management," said Anwar, who is also deputy
president of the ruling UMNO.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would step up efforts to ensure
confidence particularly among investors in economic revival so
that the economy would move forward more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
"While we demand changes and reformation in the international
financial system, the nation should also defend its policies which
have served it well and also make appropriate renewals and changes
so that it does not deviate from the principle of justice," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was of the view that the international monetary system's
present form and methods favor rich nations, making it possible
for the currency trading system to be manipulated and speculation
to occur while small and developing nations have to put up with
the present regulations.
</P>
<P>
"We should not budge from our stand that part of our problems
and those of developing nations stemmed from an uncertain and
unjust financial and market system," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts New Sanctions Against Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign ministers,
meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, agreed to apply a ban on new
investments in Serbia to protest against its military action on
ethnic Albanians in its Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
"The council has today adopted a common position for a ban on
new investments in Serbia. The Commission will act rapidly to make
the necessary proposal for implementation," the 15 ministers said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
They also stated that the union "remains ready to press ahead
with other measures against Belgrade if the authorities there fail
to halt their excessive use of force and to take the steps needed
for genuine political progress."
</P>
<P>
Monday's move by the EU marks a return to a tougher stance
against the Yugoslav Federation for the actions it has taken in the
Albanian-majority province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Modern Europe will not tolerate the full might of an army
being used against civilian centers," said British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook who was chairing the European Union general
affairs council.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, European Commissioner for Foreign Affairs,
said the EU should send a strong message stating that what was
happening in Kosovo was "horrible and unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers also called on the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization to accelerate its evaluation of military
options to stop the Kosovo violence they fear may lead to another
Balkan war.
</P>
<P>
They had agreed to freeze all of Belgrade's state-held funds
abroad.
</P>
<P>
An arms embargo and a ban on the delivery of police equipment
is already in force against Slobodan Milosevic's government.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Pakistan's government accused India intelligence service of
responsibility for a time bomb that ripped through a train in
southern Pakistan just before dawn on Monday, killing 26 people.
The Indian government dismissed the charge as "preposterous."
</P>
<P>
-- Midway through the 1998 campaign, the Republican Party's
fragile, 11-seat hold on the House of Representatives may be in
jeopardy, giving Democrats the opportunity to regain some of the
ground they lost in the bloodbath of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Slobodan Miloservic of Yugoslavia agreed to
allow diplomatic observers to enter and move through the
province of Kosovo, where Serbian troops and policemen have been
attacking the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
-- El Nino has joined the continuing warming trend to break
global temperature records in each of the first five months of
1998, according to analysis by U.S. government scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Business activity in Pakistan is slowing due to
uncertainty about the impact of international sanctions
resulting from the country's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
-- A major ocean-shipping cartel will increase rates 15 percent
on shipments from the U.S. to Asia, the biggest boost since the
mid-1980s, which will affect shipping of American goods. The move
comes at a bad time for U.S. exporters, already battered by Asia's
economic woes because consumers there are buying fewer American
goods.

<HEADLINE> Chile-China Agro-Business Seminar Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A four-day seminar on investment
in agro-processing and forestry between China and Chile opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Chinese Vice-Minister of
Agriculture Wan Baorui said that both China and Chile are major
farming countries.
</P>
<P>
China is developing toward the goal of building a modern
agricultural nation which has multiple aspects and combines
production with processing and marketing, he said. Reaching that
goal will open a great vista for enhancing agricultural
cooperation between China and other countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Chile, as an export-oriented agricultural state, has
vast superiority in farm produce processing, paving the way for
mutual supplements. The current seminar provides Chinese and
Chilean agricultural entrepreneurs with an opportunity for
strengthening mutual understanding and cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jean Jacques Duhart, vice-minister of agriculture of Chile,
said China is his country's sixth largest agricultural
partner. There are many agricultural areas remaining to be tapped
for enterprises of both countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chile is optimistic about investing in agricultural projects in
China, a clear sign of confidence in the prospects of China and
the Pacific region, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, officials of the Chilean foreign investment
committee and other specialized organizations briefed 150 Chinese
entrepreneurs about agricultural and forest development in Chile,
the investment environment there and preferential terms offered by
Chilian government. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation will also
discuss agricultural development and investment policies of China
at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Chile is China's fourth largest trade partner in Latin
America with a trade volume of 977 million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had built 14 enterprises in
Chile with a total investment of 26 million U.S. dollars. The only
Chilean enterprise opened in China was Corpora Food and Beverage
Company, with an investment of 10 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Chief Warns Against NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia's speaker of the lower house
of parliament warned Monday that NATO's inclusion of former Soviet
Union countries would harm European security and prompt Moscow to
reconsider its treaty with the group.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the fourth session of the Russian-French
Parliamentary Commission in St. Petersburg, State Duma Chairman
Gennady Seleznyov expressed his apprehension over "the activity of
NATO in Europe."
</P>
<P>
NATO has decided in its first round of enlargement toward
Eastern Europe to take in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic
and intends to continue the move to include former Soviet nations
in defiance of Russia's opposition.
</P>
<P>
Moscow believes "drawing the former USSR republics into the
alliance's sphere of interests can lead to negative consequences
in Europe and a drastic revision of the Russian-NATO Treaty,"
Seleznyov said, in reference to the pact reached last year aimed
at promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The French parliament will discuss Hungary, Poland and the
Czech Republic's NATO membership in two days, an issue in which
Seleznyov urged considering Russia's concerns.
</P>
<P>
On the enlargement of the European Union, Seleznyov said Russia
welcomes the move but opposes double standards regarding the
Baltic states grouping Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, which want
to distance themselves from Russia and seek integration into the
E.U. and NATO.
</P>
<P>
For Russia itself, the Duma speaker said, it is "not prepared
yet either morally or economically to become a member of the
European community, but closer ties between the East and Europe,
Russia and Europe are irrevocable."
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary commission, established in 1995, was to
discuss at the two-day session issues of European security and
Russia's integration into the international community.

<HEADLINE> Somalia's Baidoa in Aidid's Hands Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Hussein Mohamed Aidid's men
finally regained control of the troubled town of Baidoa, 250 west
of the capital, Sunday, reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to VHF radio reports, the heaviest fighting had
occurred at the former presidential palace and the airstrip of
the town where the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) had pit
against the forces of Hussein Aidid who lost the town early
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said the corpses of 29 civilians and seven
militiamen were found in the streets of Baidoa, with six of the
dead killed as they tried to escape in a bus leaving the town
because of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Seven more of the dead bodies were identified as the
militiamen of Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The RRA spokesman, Mohamed Ail Aden Qalinle, admitted the fall
of the town to Aidid's men Monday. However, he said his forces
still control the airport of the town and Daynunay village, north
of the town, a claim denied by travelers reaching Mogadishu and
Aidid's militia commanders.
</P>
<P>
In another fierce fighting, about a hundred heavily armed
militiamen from the RRA have also stormed into the town of Bur
Hakaba, 40 Km south of Baidoa on the road to Mogadishu Sunday as
Aidid's men have retaken control of Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the town said the fighting has been the most
devastating as a lot of looting, killing of civilians and
innumerable destruction had occurred.
</P>
<P>
The town of Bur Hakaba is inhabited by the Elay sub-clan of
Rahanwein loyal to Aidid's faction.
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday afternoon, Aidid's men have been summoned to help
Bur Hakaba by the fleeing people. About 10 battle wagons and
mearly 150 infantry militiamen were dispatched to fight the RRA
in Bur Hakaba who were driven out of the town early Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The looted properties include the VHF radio of the town, the
market and several business stores, all owned by non-combatant
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Despite sporadic fighting occurring outside Baidoa Monday, the
town appears clam, but it is getting tense as tens of thousands
of people have fled the town for safety to the neighboring
relatively safer areas.
</P>
<P>
Both the towns of Baidoa and Bur Hakaba have been seriously
hit and damaged by the fighting which is said to be the most
serious since Aidid has inherited the position of his late
father, late General Mohamed Farah Aidid in August 1996.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Banks Urged to Prepare for New Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong Monday urged the country's banks to prepare for
fresh challenges and opportunities while combating adverse effects
of the regional crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Even as banks in Singapore draw lessons from the regional
crisis and address pressing short-term contingencies, they must
build on their strengths and prepare for fresh challenges and
opportunities after the crisis is over," Lee said in a speech at
the 25th anniversary dinner of the Association of Banks in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
"The right approach is to accept the risks but manage them
carefully and build up strong capital as a buffer against
adversity," he said, noting that Singapore banks "have established
a modest but growing presence in the region which will stand them
in good stead when these economies recover."
</P>
<P>
"Singapore's banking system is sound," he said, referring to
its strong capital adequacy ratios and good credit ratings and
avoidance of excessive credit growth and risk concentrations.
</P>
<P>
He conceded however that Singapore banks have been scathed by
the regional crisis, mentioning the sharp decline in bank earnings
last year and the shrinking loan demand this year.
</P>
<P>
"An early rebound in bank profits is unlikely," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
He praised the banks for having not stopped lending and
investing in the region and for seeking new growth opportunities
abroad. "If they had forgone these opportunities altogether, they
would have failed to diversify their sources of growth and been
forced to accept the constraints of the domestic economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Not diversifying gradually out of Singapore, they would have
been unable to hedge against ups and downs in the Singapore
economy itself, which no matter how skillful our economic
management can never be eliminated," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the achievements made by Singapore banks, Lee said, "High
growth figures by themselves do not prove success as a financial
center." "Rapid expansion, in the absence of proper controls and
adequate supervision, can be a recipe for disaster, as the
regional crisis has vividly illustrated."
</P>
<P>
He said the Monetary Authority of Singapore has decided to take
several steps for Singapore's banking system "to thrive and grow
in this bracing environment."
</P>
<P>
They include raising bank disclosure norms to international
standard, adopting risk-focused approach to bank examination,
lowering banks' minimum cash balance, gradually opening up the
financial sector to greater foreign competition and building up
domestic institutions to ensure the stability of the country's
banking system.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A three-week United Nations
peace-keeping operations course attended by 50 participants from
the southern African countries started in Harare Monday.
</P>
<P>
The participants are expected to be equipped with the
knowledge to serve as military observers in any part of the world
on observer missions of the United Nations, the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) or the Southern African Development Community
(SADC).
</P>
<P>
The course to entail conflict resolution was officially opened
by Tanzanian High Commissioner to Zimbabwe Alexander Muganda.
</P>
<P>
He said the prerequisite of economic development in Africa was
political stability which could only be sustained in a peaceful
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
He said peace-keeping and conflict resolution initiatives
ought to be looked upon as preventive mechanisms geared toward
the prevention of armed conflicts between neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
"In our region, our governments can only embark on economic
development and poverty alleviation programs only if there is
peace in place within and without the borders," said Muganda.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the SADC, with a total population of 192.2
million people, is emerging as a powerful economic base.

<HEADLINE> PNA Minister Injured in Clashes Near Old City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) minister was slightly injured Monday in clashes between
Jewish settlers and the protesting Palestinians in a village near
the Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred when Minister for the Jerusalem Affairs
Faisai Husseini and a group of Palestinians were protesting the
occupation of four Arab houses by Jewish extremists in the Silwan
village near the Old city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and the settlers threw stones at each other
and Husseini was hit in the head.
</P>
<P>
Some other Palestinians were also injured during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
The occupation activities of the Jewish people in Arab East
Jerusalem must be stopped and such activities could only cause
further damage to the peace process, Husseini said.
</P>
<P>
But the Jewish settlers said they had documents to prove that
their occupation of the houses were legal.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Information Advisor, Nabil
Abu Rodeineh, also voiced his strong indignation Monday at the
Jewish settlers' constant attempt to occupy the Palestinian houses
in the Old City, according to Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center.
</P>
<P>
The incident Monday dealt another blow to the long stalled
peace process, he said, adding that the occupation must come to an
end.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have been stalled since March
last year when Israel broke ground on Jewish settlement in the
Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Albania Concerned About Bloodshed in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo Monday expressed grave concern over the bloodshed in Kosovo
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Balkan Foreign Ministerial Meeting starting
Monday moring in Istanbul, Milo said that the violence in Kosovo
has resulted in deaths of innocent civilians and posed a threat to
the security of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
He said that a refugee influx, as a result of the bloody
clashes in the Yugoslav province, might bring a seriously negative
impact on peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Up to now around twenty thousand refugees have already
entered Albania, and more than five thousand have left for
Montenegro," he said.
</P>
<P>
Milo described the sufferings of ethnic Albanians living in
Kosovo as that experienced by people of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the
past.
</P>
<P>
Bloody clashes have been continuing since February in Kosovo
between the Serbian police and ethnic Albanians who demand
independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Milo called on the Balkan countries and international
community to take urgent and effective measures to end the
bleeding there.
</P>
<P>
It was noticed that Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin
Jovanovic, who also delivered a speech at the meeting, refrained
from taking up the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The current bloodshed in Kosovo also created tensions between
Albania and Yugoslavia which have long been at odds over the
status of ethnic Albanians in the province.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Meets European Parliament Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa met with a
visiting delegation of the European Parliament at his office here
Monday and briefed them on the latest developments in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed a number of issues, ranging from
the evolution of democracy and the economy in Hong Kong to the
SAR's future links with Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the development of democracy in the SAR, Tung noted that the
democratic evolutionary process is enshrined in the Basic Law,
which sets a 10-year timetable for respective elections of the
chief executive and the legislature.
</P>
<P>
"The development of democracy must comply with the timetable
set out in the Basic Law. The Basic Law is our constitution and
was written after four years' consultation and should not be
amended lightly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that Hong Kong is going through a difficult period
of economic adjustment, the chief executive noted that years of
high property prices, high wages and negative interest rates had
resulted in a bubble economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are experiencing a credit crunch which has worsened because
of the fear of an attack on the linked rate (between the Hong Kong
dollar and the U.S. dollar). Tourism and consumer spending have
also taken a downturn," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's economy needs to be corrected if we are to regain
our competitiveness," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Tung explained that because of the currency board system, Hong
Kong could not resort to monetary measures to inflate its economy.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government had foreseen difficulties ahead when drawing
up the 1998/99 budget early this year and therefore introduced tax
reductions and expenditure increases totaling 53 billion HK
dollars (6.8 billion U.S. dollars) or 4 percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"This has been done well within the principle of prudent
financial management," Tung said, adding that it would take time
for these fiscal stimuli to take effect.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive expressed optimism about Hong Kong's
future, saying its economic fundamentals remain sound and economic
development on the Chinese mainland is going well.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Europe, Tung said that during recent visits to the
continent, he was impressed by the achievements of the European
Union in its convergence on the euro and in other areas.
</P>
<P>
"This will help improve efficiency in trade," he said, adding
that Hong Kong would have to be prepared for the euro as it would
have implications on the management of Hong Kong's reserves, the
third largest in the world.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt Asked to Allocate $10m on Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has been
asked to allocate 10 Million U.S. Dollars in the 1998/99 budget
to be presented at parliament Thursday, to market the east
African country in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The 10 million Dollars sought will jump-start the economy as
early as the end of this year as the tourism infrastructure is
already in place but hampered by a poor image abroad," local
reports Monday quoted Sam Mwaura, the chairman of the Kenya
Association of Tour Operators, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) now also proposes to take over
the running of all tourist promotion offices abroad and close
inefficient ones in a bid to revamp the industry, the country's
largest foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
"We have had very little cash for marketing since KTB was
launched (two years ago) and we need a significant allocation to
make an impact abroad," said Jim Flannery, the acting chief
executive of the board.
</P>
<P>
However, the tourism players will not know if the request has
been accepted until June 11 when the budget is read, according to
the reports.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Kenya Economic Survey issued by the government in May
describes 1997 as "a poor tourism year", when incomes from the
tourism fell by 11.6 percent from 474 million Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hotel occupancy in April/May this year has dropped to 20
percent from 60 to 70 percent during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Kenya Tourism Board launched a
one-million-Dollar marketing drive in Europe, targeting an
estimated 40 million magazine readers in Switzerland, France,
Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The promotion includes a poster campaign in 15,000 spots in
Switzerland and a plan to airlift 15 travel writers and travel
agents from Europe to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to go on for another three months and incorporate a
further 50 million Shillings (703,650 Dollars ) from tourist
industry players in cash and kind," said Flannery.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mwaura stressed Kenya's marketing drive would not
be effective without an equal guarantee to security in the
country, especially at the coast where 80 percent of Kenya's
800,000 tourists visit.
</P>
<P>
"Marketing as a priority can only work when security is
assured," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Kenya recorded all-time lows in occupancy -- averaging 20
percent -- at popular coast hotels and staff layoffs placed at
more than 70,000 countrywide last year.
</P>
<P>
Layoffs in the tourism sector is expected to rise to 200,000
by August this year unless tourist arrivals improve.

<HEADLINE> Forum Held on China's First High-Speed Railway Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A group of railway experts and
government officials from China, France, Japan, Germany and Italy
attended a weekend forum on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed
railway line held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The event was part of the activities hosted by Shanghai for an
international railway equipment exhibition June 2-6.
</P>
<P>
During the forum, Chinese experts briefed participants on the
operation of the existing Beijing-Shanghai railway line, and the
necessity and significance of building a high-speed railway line
between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Foreign participants discussed the development of high-speed
railways in their respective countries and showed strong interest
in construction of a Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway line.
</P>
<P>
The projected high-speed Beijing-Shanghai railway line will run
through Tianjin Municipality and the provinces of Hebei, Shandong,
Anhui and Jiangsu and end in Shanghai. The line will be 1,300
kilometers (km) with a designed speed of 350 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed railway line will be dual-track, electrified and
will be used only for passenger traffic. The cost is expected to
be 100 billion yuan and introduce internationally advanced
technology, equipment and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
The high-speed railway line has been written into the overall
planning of railway construction in China from 1998 to 2002.
Construction will begin in 2000.
</P>
<P>
About 4,400 km of high-speed railway lines have been built in
the world, with Japan constructing the world's first high-speed
railway line in 1964.
</P>
<P>
China plans to pump 245 billion yuan into railway construction
over the next five years to extend the existing railway system by
5,340 kilometers. The nation's current operational railway mileage
stands at 66,000 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Hits 140 Yen For First Time in Seven Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit the
psychologically important level of 140 yen in Tokyo Monday for the
first time in seven years due to the sluggish Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was quoted at 140.54-57 yen at 5 p.m., up from
140.26-29 yen at 9 a.m. and 139.80-90 yen last Friday in New York.
</P>
<P>
During the day, the dollar hit a high of 140.73 yen, a level
last seen in Tokyo on June 19, 1991, when it went as high as
141.13 yen.
</P>
<P>
Verbal yen-support by Japanese government officials failed to
discourage players from buying the dollar against the yen at the
higher levels, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They said the yen is expected to continue to weaken because Japan's
economy remains sluggish, while the United States is experiencing
brisk growth.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Prompts TV Sales in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds customers are crowding
electronics shops these days in the capital city of this South
Asian nation to buy television sets, to watch the World Cup which
is slated to be kicked off in Paris in only two days.
</P>
<P>
"Demand for black and white televisions increased by three
times in recent weeks due to World Cup soccer," a shop-owner said.
</P>
<P>
People from the middle-and-low-income groups usually buy black
and white televisions, while affluent customers are looking for
big-screen color ones of famous brands.
</P>
<P>
Some importers and retailers have offered special discount on
televisions on the eve of the World Cup, ranging between 10 and 15
percent for black and white ones and 5 to 10 percent for color
ones depending on brand and size.
</P>
<P>
The buying spree of television sets might continue till the
final match of the tournament, shopkeepers said.
</P>
<P>
As loadshedding is common in the city, particularly in hot
summer, young football fans are taking power generators on a
rental basis to ensure uninterrupted entertainment.
</P>
<P>
"We are afraid of power disruption, therefore, we procured a
generator," said Mainuddin, Rafiq, Shiplu and Shoeb, who organized
a sporting club in the city with a video projector to facilitate
local people to watch the matches.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Electric Supply Authority has taken special
arrangements to ensure uninterrupted power supply during the
matches between June 10 and July 12, by asking big power
consumers, such as factories and companies, to shut down for six
hours from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. every day.
</P>
<P>
"There will be at least 13 percent production loss if we close
for six hours a day," the manager of a company said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, shops were demanded to stop business by 7 o'clock in
the evening. The sales turnover had fallen by up to 60 percent, as
"most customers prefer the evening time for shopping," shopkeepers
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's China Tour to Push Partnership, U.S. Ambassador Says (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
upcoming visit to China will serve to "further the constructive
strategic partnership" between the two countries, U.S. ambassador
to China James Sasser said here today.
</P>
<P>
There will be "more partnership" between the United States and
China in the 21st century, and this partnership will become even
stronger, said the 62-year ambassador who came to China in
February of 1996.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Sasser said that the June 25-July
3 China trip, the first by a U.S. president in almost a decade and
the first by a Democratic Party president in history, may be as
successful as that of the U.S. tour late last year by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin for this visit is based on the success of
the previous one.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visits between the two leaders will help
further the concept of strategic partnership between the most
developed country and the largest developing nation, Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
Citing this strategic partnership in the concerted efforts in
the U.N. Security Council on the control of nuclear proliferation
in South Asia and on the Korean peninsula issue, the ambassador
explained that the two countries share joint interests and work
closely on international issues.
</P>
<P>
Sasser attributed the success of the partnership to the "wisdom
of the top leaders and the friendship forged between them," and
the respect they show for each other.
</P>
<P>
This will be the longest single-country trip for Clinton in six
years, he said, adding that the president will be pleased to have
a welcoming ceremony in the square outside the eastern gate of the
Great Hall of the People, adjacent Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Sasser went on to say, Clinton and Jiang and
other Chinese leaders will discuss bilateral relations, the
expansion of bilateral economic and trade cooperation and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
The issue of how to reduce nuclear danger in South Asia and in
the whole world also will be one of the primary international
topics, he said.
</P>
<P>
When Jiang visited many U.S. cities last year, Americans saw a
"smiling and friendly" president representing the new China which
left a favorable impression, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Sasser said Clinton will bring a great number of news people
with him during the China trip and, through the media, Americans
will see "a China opened up by Deng Xiaoping, its fast growing
economy and the image of a major power in the 21st century."

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The foundation stone was laid
Monday for a new Customhouse in Kwai Chung container terminals to
facilitate cargo clearance.
</P>
<P>
"This new Customhouse will centralize most of our offices and
facilities relating to containerized cargo under one roof, and
will help speed up cargo clearance," Commissioner of Customs and
Excise Lawrence Li Shu-fai said.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, he noted, the new establishment would enable
his department to fulfil its commitment to facilitating trade.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been ranked the world's busiest container port
for six years in a row, with the bulk of the containerized cargo
handled by the existing eight terminals in Kwai Chung.
</P>
<P>
The new Customhouse in Kwai Chung, which will be 10 stories
high and have a gross floor area of 21,657 square meters, is
scheduled for completion in August 2001.
</P>
<P>
The building will accommodate a number of commands, including
the Ship Search and Cargo Command, the Marine and Land Enforcement
Command, the Dutiable Commodities Administration, the Supplies
Section and Dog Unit.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 seems to be "a very significant year for us," the
commissioner said, adding other projects would be coming on
stream shortly.
</P>
<P>
"These include our new responsibilities at the new airport at
Chek Lap Kok, which would come into operation in July. We have
already started moving there and we shall have new equipment and
facilities to enable us to ensure that the airport functions
well," Li said.
</P>

breakthroughs in such printing technologies as digital processing
systems and multimedia.
</P>
<P>
China has made progress in its printing industry with offset
lithography, digital printing and computer-aided composition
technologies widely used in printing houses at all levels,
industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, the country still has a huge untapped market
potential. According to 1996 statistics, the Chinese each bought
only six books, two magazines and 22 newspapers annually, which
leaves room for future growth.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is being jointly sponsored by China Printing
Materials Company and China International Exhibition Center.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Launch Education Savings Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is to launch an
Education Savings Scheme next year to which parents can make a
monthly contribution from the time their child enters primary
school.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the scheme here Monday, Chairman of the National
Higher Education Fund Corporation Husni Hanadziah said that if a
parent saves 100 ringgit (about 25 U.S. dollars) a month with the
scheme from the time their child enters primary school, the money
plus interest will add up to about 20,000 ringgit (about 5,000
U.S. dollars) 11 years later.
</P>
<P>
"The money can be used to finance his higher education for at
least four years," he said after attending the opening of an art
exhibition here.
</P>
<P>
Husni said there is no compulsion to save with the scheme and
the money could be withdrawn at any time or if the student did not
enter any institution of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The corporation would collaborate with a local bank to
implement the scheme nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Husni was convinced that the scheme would be welcomed by
parents who are now more committed to matters pertaining to their
children's education.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Likely to Be Convicted: Moderates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Following Sunday's first session of
the trial of Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, Iran's
moderates held the view that he is likely be convicted by the
court.
</P>
<P>
A report on the daily Iran News said on Monday that Iranian
Vice President Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari and several moderate Majlis
(Parliament) members believed that Karbaschi, a moderate
technocrat, would be found guilty but the report did not give
reasons.
</P>
<P>
The conservative bloc has so far kept silent about the court
proceedings against the close ally of President Mahammad Khatami,
who was charged with embezzlement, misappropriation of public
funds and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Khatami came to power after defeating his hardline competitor
by a landslide in the presidential election in May last
year. Karbaschi is believed to have contributed to his success by,
for one thing, helping financing his campaign.
</P>
<P>
At the court, Karbaschi rejected as "baseless" all the
corruption charges brought against him, but his self-defense was
frequently disrupted by the judge, who dismissed his allegation
that there was any prejudice against him.
</P>
<P>
The next session of the trial is scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The case has become a hot topic in the country and caused tense
political struggle between the conservatives and moderates.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, Karbaschi was detained by the conservative
judiciary and stayed in jail for 11 days before the intervention
by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wanted to keep
factional struggle under control, led to his release.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives have since vowed to remove Karbaschi's
mayorship and even demanded an impeachment of his patron, Interior
Minister Abdullah Nouri. By regulations, mayor of Tehran is
usually chosen by interior minister and then confirmed by the
supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Lari, the vice president, confirmed that Karbaschi's mayorship
has been suspended for the trial and one of his deputies is now
taking charge. But he said that no decision has been made on the
future of his position.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives also criticized the interior minister for
issuing permits to pro-Khatami gatherings in recent month, in one
case of 20 people were injured as clashes between supporters of
the rival factions broke out.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted here that Nouri will face a no-confidence vote
in the Majlis, now dominated by the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that factional struggle has entered a
critical stage as the two sides are openly trading accusations and
some conservatives are pointing their finger direct at the
moderate president.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's China Tour to Push Partnership, U.S. Ambassador Says (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During Jiang's U.S. trip, Sasser said, the two presidents
agreed to set up offices in each other's capitals to exchange
information and intensify the fight against drug trafficking and
international crimes.
</P>
<P>
The two also agreed to promote dialogues on the rule of law,
and to encourage exchanges and contacts between law professors and
workers of the two nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for problems between the two nations, he said, differences
have been talked about too much or even exaggerated, and bilateral
cooperation and exchanges have not been talked about enough.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the United States is the second largest
investor in China, and the largest market for Chinese goods. And
personnel contacts and economic and trade cooperation are on the
rise between the two nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students and scholars are now
studying in the United States, he added, and a great number of
American firms are doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the long haul, the ambassador said, leaders and persons of
insight have come to learn that mutually beneficial cooperation
between the United States and China is important for international
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
As China is becoming more powerful, it will play a greater role
in the international arena in the upcoming century and the
U.S.-China partnership will exert more impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
On his personal contribution to U.S.-China relations, Sasser
said since he assumed office two years ago as ambassador that he
has done his best to help leaders of both countries reduce
misunderstanding and to narrow cultural and social differences.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries are economically supplementary and
the two people would like to "get along well and work closely"
with each other.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to see a more-developed China and more
progress for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, he
said, adding that it also wants more bilateral cooperation in the
control of nuclear proliferation and weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.S. Congress, he said that more than 100
congressmen visited China last year and that the majority of them
had a positive reaction of the country, whose economic progress
and people's energy had left a deep impression on them.
</P>
<P>
On the transfer of U.S. missile technology to China, he said
the launching of U.S. satellites by China had been permitted by
the U.S. government and the allegation that there is no concrete
proof that these launchings violate U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
On the South Asia situation, he said India and Pakistan should
be the signatory countries of the nuclear test ban treaty and the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

<HEADLINE> BIS Considers 1997/98 Year of Good and Bad News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASLE, Switzerland, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The financial year from
April 1997 to March 1998 has been a year of both good and bad
news, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Growth in most industrial countries is included among the
positive developments, the Basle-based BIS said in its 68th annual
report.
</P>
<P>
The darker elements in the year include the failure of the
Japanese economy to respond to repeated policy initiatives, and
the fear that the financial crisis in East Asia would spread to
the whole region and affect other economies.
</P>
<P>
The growth rates in industrial countries have either remained
at high levels or are starting to build significant momentum,
within the general context of continued low inflation.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the United States economy last year was
exceptional by international as well as historical
standards. Despite the real appreciation of the dollar, the volume
of exports grew by nearly 16 percent, raising the U.S. share of
world exports to a 20-year high.
</P>
<P>
In continental Europe, the smoothness of the path of transition
to the euro has also been remarkable and welcome.
</P>
<P>
In addition, structural reforms and more disciplined policies
have generated more solid growth in Latin America, many countries
in Eastern Europe and significant parts of Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, while growth in Japan had been the
highest among major countries in 1996 and output was still
expanding briskly during the first quarter of 1997, activity
stagnated for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The crisis among trading partners elsewhere in Asia raises the
possibility of mutually reinforcing weakness in the region as a
whole," warned Alfons Verplaetse, chairman of the Board of
Directors and president of BIS.
</P>
<P>
The sharp decline in commodity and oil prices will place a
heavy burden on a number of already fragile economies, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the buoyancy of stock markets and bond markets in
industrial countries, and the strength of capital flowing into
non-Asian emerging markets, could also be described as good news.
</P>
<P>
But Verplaetse pointed out that the enthusiasm for financial
markets also raises another specter: that it may not last, and
that the economic effects of a change might be difficult to
predict and to manage.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Says Russia Passes Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin said that
Russia has overcome the worst of its financial crisis, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel, the
president said thanks to the measures taken by the Russian
government and to the outside backing, first of all from the seven
industrial countries, the peak of the crisis has basically pulled
down.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who will leave for Germany Monday on an official
visit, said foreign investors should have no reason for panic.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the present crisis was the crisis of a
financial system all over the world which Russia could not avoid.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged the government officials to exert more
efforts to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed "political support" given to Russia from leaders of
the United States, Germany, France and Britain, noting that
"Russia was not begging for money any more since this period was
over for Russia."
</P>
<P>
At the end of last month, a serious financial crisis occurred in
the Russian market. Following a series of emergent measures
adopted by the government, the financial crisis started to relax.

<HEADLINE> Brisk Housing Sales In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province, an economic
powerhouse in east China, reported a 62 percent year-on-year
increase in residential housing sales in the first four months of
this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 720,000 sq m of floor space were sold during the
period, with 640,000 sq m for home buyers.
</P>
<P>
The growing sentiment of buying houses has lifted the market
prices, bringing the average per sq m price to 1,245 yuan, 28
yuan more than that at the end of last year, according to Wang
Junmin, head of the provincial urban and rural construction
committee.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the increasing demand for housing, the provincial
government has increased investment in housing and real estates.
Statistics show that in the first four months, the provincial
government put two billion yuan in housing sector, up more than 70
percent from the year-ago period and accounting for 72 percent of
total real estate investment.
</P>
<P>
As some 7.08 million sq m of housing space is under
construction, Wang anticipated that the local housing market will
continue to be brisk this year.
</P>
<P>
A report from the provincial statistics bureau indicates that
in 1997, disposable annual income of people living at township and
above levels of the province averaged 5,191 yuan while their
per-capita living space posted at 9.5 sq.m.

<HEADLINE> Cases of Child Abuse Rise in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Stagnation of the economy and
poverty are to blame for rising cases of child abuse in Kenya, a
report by a local non-governmental organization says.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoted by the Daily Nation newspaper Monday,
estimates that Kenya has over 600,000 of the world's 100 million
abused children.
</P>
<P>
The report from the Coalition on Child Rights and Child
Protection in Kenya which brings together civil groups and
relevant governmental departments, further blames high inflation
rates and reduced family income for cruelty toward children.
</P>
<P>
The situation may worsen if the level of poverty among women
and children who form over 80 percent of Kenya's population which
reaches about 30 million, continues to rise, the report warns.
</P>
<P>
Although the Kenyan government has years ago pledged to reduce
household poverty by about 50 percent of the 1993 levels by 2000,
and reduce the severity of poverty by one-third, the battle has
not even started, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Nyanza, a densely populated province in western Kenya,
reported 4,400 cases of child abuse last year, compared with
3,001 cases in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report lists sexual exploitation, child prostitution,
child labor, physical and mental torture, neglect and abandonment
as the rampant forms of abuse in Kenya today.
</P>
<P>
It says many children lack basic needs like health, nutrition,
education and sound environment and this has pushed the majority
into difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
The situation has further been exacerbated by the HIV/AIDS
scourge that has claimed more than 1.4 million lives in the east
African country, leaving children even more vulnerable, according
to the report.

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC)
today issued its newly-drafted stipulations about the
administrative punishment on those who are responsible for
financial institutions' malpractice.
</P>
<P>
The Stipulations listed in detail various kinds of malpractice
that will face severe punishment, including financial
institutions' off-the-book operations; financial institutions'
depositing or loan-extending practices that run counter to
interest rate policies and related management regulations;
insurance companies lower charge rate or raise service fee
standard without authorization, as well as some other financial
practices which are not allowed by the law or related regulations.
</P>
<P>
The PBOC will measure the nature and responsibility of these
malpractice and accordingly make different administrative
punishment on those who are responsible.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the PBOC said that when a financial
institution's malpractice leads to capital losses or serious
consequences, its leaders will be seriously punished; when a
financial institution and its staff violate the law in their
operations, they will be referred to judicial departments.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Wine Firm Targets Youth with New Drink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A new fruit wine, Tropical Kooler,
has entered the Kenyan market, but it will have to battle a
growing problem of competition from illegal imports, illicit brew
and high taxes.
</P>
<P>
The wine, which was recently launched by Kenya Wine Agencies
Ltd. (KWAL), is targeted at young and upcoming drinkers, and
comes in orange and strawberry flavors, media here reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
KWAL believes that the wine, which has a relatively low
alcohol content of eight percent, has no close competitors.
</P>
<P>
Paul Chemng'orem, KWAL's Managing Director, said that Kooler
was launched especially in response to consumers' demand for wine
with a low alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
KWAL, a leading importer and distributor of over 400
international and local brands, has been in the wine industry for
more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Although the firm relies heavily on foreign visitors for
sales, there are indications that an increasing number of middle
and upper income Kenyans now drink wine.
</P>
<P>
However, most liquor consumers in the east African country
prefer beer because it is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Chemng'orem said Kenya has not developed a vibrant local wine
industry mainly due to the huge initial capital investment
required.
</P>
<P>
It launched its first locally manufactured wine, Papaya, in
1983, but now includes brands like Plum Rose, Milano, Kingfisher,
Celegration and Vin d'Ananas.
</P>
<P>
Papaya Dry Table Wine, the first locally manufactured grape
wine, began selling in September 1985, and won a silver medal for
quality in the prestigious Monte Selection contest in Lisbon,
Portugal in 1985.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not back
Israel with the commitment it seeks to the scope of the third
troop redeployment in the West Bank, a newspaper reported here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Haaretz daily quoted a senior U.S. official as saying that
despite the tremendous efforts exerted by the U.S. in forging an
agreement on the second redeployment, the Israelis and
Palestinians are still not on the verge of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
For the last two weeks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has been assuring his Cabinet ministers that he is
awaiting the U.S. position on the third redeployment as the key to
an overall deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A new dispute over the size of the third pullback seemed to
have prevent the sides from finalizing a deal on the second
redeployment, although Israel has reportedly accepted the
U.S. plan calling for a 13 percent withdrawal in the second
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is floating the idea of Israeli withdrawal from
another 2 percent before going into the final-status talks with
the Palestinians. The Palestinian side insisted on a sizable
third pullback and rejected the Netanyahu offer, saying such
percentage is too marginal to be accepted.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, therefore, apparently hoped that the U.S. would
commit itself to Israel on the third pullback by convincing the
Palestinians to endorse his idea.
</P>
<P>
But the unnamed U.S. official said Washington was noncommittal
on the third redeployment. "You can forget about a U.S. commitment
on the scope of a third pullback," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way. The Hebron agreement took four and a half
months. Yet this second pullback issue has taken 15 months. At
this rate, there is no way we will even get to final status," he
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed frustration with the "painfully"
incremental style of negotiations exhibited by both Israelis and
Palestinian, where progress is measured in "inches."
</P>
<P>
Signally Washington's growing impatience, he said "I can not see
how we can continue throughout the summer."
</P>
<P>
"There is no way a mediator can substitute for the two sides
talking with each other," he said, "Unless the two sides deal with
each other, there is no way there can be progress on final
status."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet discussed the redeployment issue on Sunday,
but no decision was made.
</P>
<P>
Dampening the optimism over a possible quick breakthrough in
the long-running dispute over the second redeployment, Netanyahu
told the cabinet that there was still no agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Nor was there an agreement with the U.S. on a broad outline for
the third redeployment, he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Peaceful Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem Monday called on all parties concerned to seek a peaceful
solution to the ethnic crisis in the Yugoslav province Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the Balkan foreign ministers'
meeting here, Cem said a peaceful settlement of the Kosovo issue
is of great significance to the peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia,
Romania, Turkey and the Yugoslav Federation attended the meeting
which centered on the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Russia, France, Italy, Germany, the United States
and Britain, which form the Contact Group for issues related to
the former Yugoslavia, as well as Croatia and Bosnia, took part in
the conference as observers.
</P>
<P>
"Any form of violence, excessive use of force and all forms of
terrorism have to be stopped immediately in Kosovo. It is my
government's sincere wish that talks for obtaining a durable and
effective solution to this problem start as soon as possible," Cem
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the talks should seek ways of safeguarding the
human and civil rights of all inhabitants in Kosovo, including
ethnic Albanians, Serbs, Turks as well as others.
</P>
<P>
"The recent outflow of refugees has created a tragic situation
for the masses concerned and serious problems for neighboring
countries. We must solve the problem of Kosovo before it is too
late," Cem added.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo has been worsening since February when
the Serb police took tough measures against ethnic Albanians
seeking independence from the Yugoslav Federation.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Cocoa Export Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria exported 52,583 tons of raw
cocoa beans in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 35
percent over the 34,037 tons in the same period of 1997, the
Business Concord said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting figures from the Federal Produce
Inspection Services, said that the development may have been a
result of lower processing activities in Nigeria's ailing cocoa
processing plants.
</P>
<P>
It is also seen as a sign of "good omen" for meeting the
International Cocoa Organization projection of 155,000 tons of
cocoa export for Nigeria by the close of the 1997/1998 harvest
season in May, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report by the Guardian newspaper Monday said a
London-based company, Commco International Limited, has begun
discussion with the Cocoa Exporters Association of Nigeria (CEAN)
for investment in cocoa farms.
</P>
<P>
Pius Olaiya Ayodele, president of the Ondo State chapter of
the CEAN, was quoted as saying that the proposal aims to shoot up
Nigeria's annual cocoa production from the current 120,000 to
500,000 tons by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Ondo chapter of the CEAN has begun
discussions with the state government for the lease of land for
cocoa plantation.
</P>
<P>
Cocoa was Nigeria's biggest foreign exchange earner until
earlier 1970s, when crude oil became Nigeria's number one export
product.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Introduce Death Penalty for Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Nigerian National
Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Major-General Musa Bamaiyi,
has called for the reintroduction of death penalty to curb drug
trafficking in the West African country
</P>
<P>
Bamaiyi's call came just ahead of the special session on drugs
by United Nations General Assembly, which began in New York
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop on "The drug problem and the Nigerian
media" at the weekend in Lagos, Bamaiyi said although his agency
has made progress in its fight against abuse and illicit traffic
of hard drugs, the phenomenon still posed great danger to the
populace.
</P>
<P>
He added that a serious disease requires a drastic, even
surgical remedy and that "capital punishment against drug
culprits was not too much in order to save thousands of
Nigerians and guide them to a useful existence."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria introduced death penalty for illicit traffickers in
dangerous drugs in 1985, under the administration of General
Mohammadu Buhari (1983-1985). Three persons were thus executed.
</P>
<P>
The death penalty was, however, abolished by the succeeding
government of General Ibrahim Babangida (1985-1993).
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Bamaiyi's suggestion may be
incorporated into the National Drug Control Master Plan,
developed by relevant government agencies non-governmental
organizations and professional interest groups.
</P>
<P>
The major components of the plan include adequacy and efficacy
of penal sanctions, demand reduction and control of illicit
supply, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Strike Seen to Scare Investors in Philippine Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) said
Monday that the ongoing illegal strike by its more than 600 pilots
has scared interested foreign investors into breaking off talks
for a critical equity investment in the carrier.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, PAL said the four-day-old work stoppage by
the 625-strong pilots union, the Airline Pilots Association of the
Philippines (ALPAP), is dooming what may be the flag carrier's
final chance to stave off financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
PAL said it is losing between 150 million pesos (3.8 million
U.S. dollars) and 200 million pesos (5.1 million dollars) daily in
forfeited revenues, excluding incidental costs and expenses,
pushing the cash-strapped airlines closer to the brink of
insolvency.
</P>
<P>
Even before the strike took place, PAL said it was already
reeling from the worst financial crisis in its 57-year history, as
the Asian currency turmoil and the prolonged slump in the travel
market virtually choked off its cash flow.
</P>
<P>
In the last fiscal year ending March 1998, PAL suffered a net
loss of 8.1 billion pesos (206 million dollars), its largest ever.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to stay afloat, PAL had been engaged in serious
talks with a number of foreign carriers who were looking to take a
significant equity stake in the airlines.
</P>
<P>
But the work stoppage by ALPAP, in open defiance of two
government orders, has caused investors to lose interests in PAL,
the press release said.
</P>
<P>
ALPAP said earlier it was protesting the ordered retirement of
Captain Albino Collantes, 45, in December 1997 which PAL said was
its prerogative in line with an earlier collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The union said the pilot was too young to retire, and also
accused PAL management of cutting pilots rest hours and harassing
union members.
</P>
<P>
ALPAP and PAL have been locked in dispute over the forced
retirement of Collantes over which the Department of Labor and
Employment has assumed jurisdiction. The labor department also
issued two orders to prohibit the union from aggravating PAL's
financial woes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Says Eight Percent Growth Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The 8 percent economic growth the
Chinese government wants is possible if all people work together,
Chinese Vice Premier Wu Bangguo told a forum on the economic
situation in China last month, the full text of which was
published in today's "Economic Daily".
</P>
<P>
To do so requires an 11-percent increase in the country's
industrial added value output, based on the 1997's level, he said,
and this is a little bit difficult for all of 1998, based on
industrial production in the first quarter, but not impossible.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is in charge of China's industrial production, said
that 59,000 state-owned enterprises lost 8.77 billion yuan in the
first quarter, but reported profits of 590 million yuan for the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Of 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in
China, only Heilongjiang, Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian and Shandong
provinces and the municipality of Shanghai made profits from
January to March of this year, all of them supported by a group of
large local enterprises, while 12 other provinces lost more than
500 million yuan each during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 14,000 large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises went from earnings of 3.7 billion yuan in the first
quarter of 1997 to losses of 4.25 billion yuan in the first
quarter of this year, or 48.5 percent of the total losses incurred
by state industrial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has had a wide range of measures like
increased investment, pushing consumer demand, and raising tax
rebates for a number of key exports, to ensure this year's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production and economic efficiency will gradually
take a turn for the better in the last three quarters after these
measures are implemented, Wu said.

SINGAPORE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Share prices took a hammering on
the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) lost 39.89 points to close at 1,128.57 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said shares plunged as the falling yen forced Japanese
investors to dump shares and pulled down Southeast Asian
currencies.
</P>
<P>
"The market has been under strong sustained selling pressure
for a period of time. The currencies made it worse today and the
signs continue to look bad for the economy," a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The yen, which broke the 140 to the U.S. dollar barrier,
dragged the Singapore dollar and most regional currencies down,
pulling stocks down in their wake, they added.
</P>
<P>
Total market volume fell to 109.54 million units, valued at
207.34 million Singapore dollars (121.96 million U.S. dollars).

remained unchanged.

Easyknit was the most actively traded stock as it registered a
turnover of 10.68 million units. It was followed by DBS Land which
had 8.58 million shares traded. IPC was next with 7.49 million
shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
NatBroad topped the gainers list of the day as it rose by 19.5
cents to finish at 1.00 U.S. dollar. Venture increased by 10 cents
to end at 4.44 Singapore dollars. New Toyo was up by 6 cents to
close at 0.34 Singapore dollars.

declined by 62 cents to end at 2.28 Singapore dollars. SIA F fell
by 55 cents to close at 8.35 Singapore dollars. F &AMP; N was down by

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has become
France's main trading partner in sub-Saharan Africa with trade
between the two countries almost doubling since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The sale of French products into South Africa was worth 4.7
billion Rand (about 940 million U.S. Dollars) last year, an
increase of 27 percent against the previous year, and French
market share for goods in South Africa rose four percent,
Business Day daily quoted a French Trade Commission report as
saying Monday.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is expected
to spend over 40 million U.S. Dollars in upgrading 400 health
centers and renovating hospitals across the country, Zambia Daily
Maily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Ben Chirwa, spokesman of the Central
Board of Health, as saying here Sunday that 27 million Dollars
will be used to develop the health centers while remaining 13
million Dollars will be used to renovate hospitals.
</P>
<P>
He said some hospitals like that in Kitwe has already
submitted their project proposals, while Chilenje and Matero in
Lusaka are some of the medical centers that have benefited from
the program.
</P>
<P>
In three months the board will open the Chelston and Kamwala
medical centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the health board will improve the conditions of
service for all its workers.
</P>
<P>
"We will give them better salaries, introduce rural
allowances, cater for housing and many more to encourage the
health workers operating in any area of Zambia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the speech after Hope Foundation founder, the first
lady Vera Chiluba, failed to distribute medical equipment and
drugs to Natukumo Clinic because there was neither infrastructure
nor medical personnel there.
</P>
<P>
This forced Ms Chiluba to fly back an assortment of drugs to
Mongu in Western Province where they were donated to Lewannika
General Hospital.

The blowing up of substations in the country continues unabated

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreign offices in
Vietnam has dropped from the peak period of 1994-1997 when foreign
companies flocked to the country to establish their presence,
the Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>

Many foreign representative offices have temporarily closed
down or reduced working staff. In the last five months, 30
offices have halted operations, bringing the total number of
shutdown offices to 295 nation-wide, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese trade officials attributed the drop to a saturation
of foreign companies and negative impacts from Asia's financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to vietnam's ministry of trade, of the 2,640
representative offices licensed to operate in Vietnam, 70 percent
are from the Asia-Pacific region, 23 percent from Europe and North
America and the rest from Southwest Asia and Africa, said the

<HEADLINE> Wellington Company Produces Drinking Water From Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A Wellington company said it has
made a technological breakthrough in producing clear drinking
water out of thin air, The Evening Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Watermaster Technologies said the new process involves three
stages: the machine takes in air, extracts water from it and then
purifies it by passing it through an electrical filter and a
charcoal filter.
</P>
<P>
The electrical filter destroys any bacteria while the charcoal
filter removes solid materials.
</P>
<P>
The company said the technology used in Airwell 2000, the
machine as it has been named, has worldwide applications and can
alleviate drinking water shortages anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
It said worldwide patent searches have not found anything
similar apart from simple dehumidifiers. But most dehumidifiers
do not produce purified water.
</P>
<P>
Airwell 2000 can turn out 20 liters of clear drinking water a
day from the surrounding air. It can be used in areas where water
supply is poor or where there is pollution, the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> Economic Cooperation Strengthened in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Jiangxi Province has recently
signed 440 economic-cooperation contracts with Shanghai
Municipality and provinces like Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Fujian in
east China.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to trade-bidding activities in Shanghai held by a
delegation of 1,000 members from Jiangxi Province, these contracts
cover such areas as agriculture, industry, infrastructure
facilities and the service industry, and involve investments
exceeding 5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Besides Jiangxi, other provinces in east China like Jiangsu,
Anhui, and Fujian have also held trade-bidding activities in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Comments from the "People's Daily (East China Page)" pointed
out that economic cooperation among east China's provinces had
unpredictable significance.
</P>
<P>
Shu Shengyou, governor of Jiangxi Province, said that it is
necessary to strengthen regional mutual assistance among east
China's provinces.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during 1996-1997, Jiangxi Province signed
146 contracts involving 1.24 billion yuan with Shanghai. During
the 1991-1995 period, Jiangxi and Shanghai signed 160 contracts
involving 250 million yuan.

convenient communication with Beijing and Kowloon.
</P>
<P>

the province will give preferential policies and improve the

<HEADLINE> Kaunda to Sue Zambian Govt for Wrongful Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former President and
opposition leader Kenneth Kaunda has instructed his lawyers to
sue the government for wrongful detention, Zambia's leading
independent newspaper, The Post, reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing cadres of his United National Independence Party
(UNIP) in Lusaka Saturday, Kaunda disclosed that he has asked his
lawyers to take the government to court because he had been
wrongly detained for five months for allegedly being involved in
last October's foiled military coup.
</P>
<P>
This followed a statement made last Thursday by Legal Affairs
Minister Vincent Malambo that the government has evidence against
Kaunda in the on-going treason trial although he was released by
the Lusaka High Court on June 1, which is widely believed to be a
deal brokered by South African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Malambo said that the state entered a nolle prosequi against
Kaunda only because it found it inappropriate to continue with
the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda also indicated that he has no plans to retire from
party politics immediately saying he will only leave party
politics after making UNIP a very strong party which can remove
the ruling Movement for Muti-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
"Don't force me to reveal my secrets now. I will inform you of
my intentions at the (forthcoming) congress," said Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
However, the 74-year-old former president who ruled Zambia for
27 years after its independence in 1964 declared here last
Thursday that he is seriously considering the possibility to
resign from active party politics.
</P>
<P>
This declaration surprised the members of the country's
largest opposition party which has been bogged down in a severe
inter-fighting over the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
Some of them who do not want Kaunda to step down said that his
withdrawal will spell doom for UNIP and it may disband. They have
rejected his decision and agreed to petition him so that he can
change his mind.
</P>
<P>
While others including the party's national Chairman Malimba
Masheke, who has been allegedly collaborating with Secretary
General Sebastian Zulu to oust Kaunda, said that UNIP has capable
leaders to take over the party presidency after Kaunda's
retirement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji sent a
message of congratulations Monday to the 34th Assembly of the
Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
"On the occasion of the convocation of the 34th Assembly of the
Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity
and the warm celebration by the African people of the 35th
anniversary of the founding of the Organization of African Unity,
I wish to extend, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people,
our warm congratulations to the Assembly," Zhu said in the
message.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past 35 years, the OAU, holding high the banner of
African solidarity, has fulfilled victoriously the great historic
mission of national independence and decolonization of the
continent through its unremitting efforts."

"We are glad to see that over recent years the OAU has made

Africa's development and support the efforts of the African
nations to rejuvenate their economies and explore ways of
development suited to their specific national conditions," Zhu
said.

The Chinese and African peoples enjoy a long traditional
friendship with each other, Zhu said. "China will, as always, join

<HEADLINE> Key Projects Operational In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A number of key infrastructure
projects in east China's Fujian province have gone into operation,
government sources said.
</P>
<P>
Provincial economic planners say that the southeast coastal
province is to put a total of 110 billion yuan into infrastructure
projects this year.
</P>
<P>
A polypropylene project at the Fujian Oil Refinery Corp. was
put into production at the end of May, able to produce 70,000 tons
of polypropylene a year, marking the end that Fujian did not have
any large petrochemical project.
</P>
<P>
Designed by China itself, the project costs a total of 650
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company now has an annual oil refining capacity of four
million tons and is expected to have an annual oil refining
capacity of 12 million tons when a second-phase project of the
company is completed. And at the same time, a project is planned
to produce 600,000 tons of polyethylene a year.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the two projects, Fujian will become one
of the country's major petro-chemical industrial bases, the
provincial government said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand for electronic information, the province
recently began work on a wide-band multimedia network for nine
prefectures and cities and various industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Full-swing construction has begun on a power plant, an
expressway and several other key projects.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Town Becomes Hub of E. African Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- As roads and railway networks in
east Africa collapse due to months of the heavy El Nino rains,
the western Kenyan town of Kisumu, bordering on Lake Victoria,
takes center stage in regional trade, handling ever more cargo.
</P>
<P>
Kisumu has become the hub of cargo transport in the region as
more and more traders route Tanzania and Uganda-bound shipments
through the third largest Kenyan city, the East African weekly
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A. R. Juma, an official of the Kenya Revenue Authority, was
quoted as saying that activity at the port has picked up
considerably over the past few months with ships from Uganda and
Tanzania queuing up for loading.
</P>
<P>
Long queues of wagons waiting to be loaded onto ships have
been evident in the past few weeks, with officials of the Kenya
Revenue Authority, Kenya Railways, Uganda Railways and Tanzania
Railway coordinating the activity jointly.
</P>
<P>
"It's the water hyacinth that slows down the operations of
this port (Kisumu), otherwise there is so much going on," Juma
added. The weed rampant on the world's second largest fresh water
lake causes long delays in loading and off-loading of cargo and
disrupts trades.
</P>
<P>
Wagons and containers piled up in Kenya's Indian Ocean port
Mombasa after two bridges in central Kenya were washed away on
May 16, forcing most Ugandan importers stopping transporting
goods by road.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) said the
corporation has increased the volume of Kampala-bound cargo going
through Kisumu.
</P>
<P>
"URC is using less of the Malaba line because it is more
expensive and slower than the Kisumu route," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it took a ship one day to transport cargo to Kampala
from Kisumu, consuming 6,000 liters of fuel. A train would
consume 14,000 liters of fuel and take much longer.
</P>
<P>
While ships can carry up to 22 wagons one way, trains are
limited to eight wagons per trip, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian officials said that since the main railway line in
Tanzania was washed away by floods, importers from central and
western Tanzania have had to divert their cargo to Kisumu.
</P>
<P>
"The Dar-es-Salaam route is completely useless. The railway
line was washed away long ago and the roads are simply
impassable. Kisumu is the only direct route into Tanzania. It is
the fastest and the cheapest," said a navigator of a
Tanzania-bound ship.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Citizens Urged to Boycott Illegal Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Health Minister Nkandu Luo
has urged the public to desist from obtaining medicines from
illegal dealers because they even do not understand the dosage
and often give wrong prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
Luo made the call here Sunday when she launched the pharmacy
awareness week, the theme of which is "poverty and equity access
to essential drugs", according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
She reminded the Pharmaceutical Society of Zambia (PSZ) that
they have a task to fight street vending of medicines which has
become a danger to society.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted her as saying most of the dealers
who sell and prescribe the medicines do not understand how
dangerous some of the drugs are to human being.
</P>
<P>
Luo urged the public to obtain medication after appropriate
consultation with medical experts.
</P>
<P>
She said the government's policy is to provide Zambians with
access to cost effective and quality health care.
</P>
<P>
It is impressive to see a number of pharmacies opening up in
residential areas in most towns and this has improved the
accessibility of drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
She called on PSZ to set up more pharmaceutical outlets in the
rural areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has announced a 12
million U.S. Dollars donation for the reconstruction of Nakivubo
Channel, a key drainage project in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The donation to be released soon is part of the bank's
continued support to the city council's development program aimed
at improving delivery of services in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank team leader, Gautam Sengupta, told a press
conference here over the weekend that the project, expected to
begin March 1999, mainly covers widening and deepening of the
channel as well as putting more crossing points on it.
</P>
<P>
He said there is need to have human, technical and financial
resources to effectively improve service delivery in the city.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, World Bank Resident Representative
Randolph Harris warned against mismanagement of the fund, saying
that in some cases the money could not reach the beneficiaries
due to inefficiency in financial management.

HEFEI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A new dike along the Huaihe, one of
the major rivers flowing across China's Anhui Province, went
operational recently, changing the river's flood flowing capacity
from 4,500 cubic meters per second to 6,600 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The dike is located near Hefei, Anhui's capital, and was built
in connection with the West Lake Water Storage Zone, which has a
capacity of 3 billion cubic meters of water. As many as 18,000
people had been relocated for the project, and a 12.4-kilometer
dike added.

<HEADLINE> Remote Sensing Technology Helping China Predict Earthquakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China has got its short-term
earthquake prediction up to 50 percent thanks to help from
satellite infrared remote-sensing technology.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese predicted 15 earthquakes last year, with an
accuracy rate above 50 percent, in time, location, and magnitude,
according to China Aerospace Corporation's Satellite Prediction
Research Center for Natural Disasters.
</P>
<P>
Predicting earthquakes is thought to be impossible by many
scientists, but Chinese scientists believe that the satellite
technology, when combined with other technology, can bring new
accuracy to earthquake prediction.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with thermal infrared technology now is
that clouds can interfere with the satellite detection, explains
Qiang Zuji of the prediction center, but this problem can be
overcome by the use of microwave technology and China is designing
a system of small satellites for just this purpose.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Sees Increasing Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
had signed 595 economic and technology cooperation agreements,
worth 4.1 billion yuan and 8.68 million US dollars in overseas
investment by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official says that Gansu did this to
create better economic conditions and that the cooperation
involves large investment in resource exploration, infrastructure,
high-tech industry, and township-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The projects are meant to help areas with little economic
base. One of these, the Longnan Mountain area, signed three
contracts with Shenzhen and Hong Kong for a hydro-electric power
station, an apple orchard, and Chinese medicine processing
project, involving 829 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Economic cooperation organizations are also working to get
local products on the market. Last October, at the 9th West China
Trade Fair, delegations from Pingliang, Tianshui, and Longnan in
Gansu did over 600 million yuan worth of business.

<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The size and timing of the third pullback emerged Sunday as
the last major obstacle to an agreement among Israel, the United
States and the Palestinian National Authority. Palestinian
insistence on receiving more than the 2 percent believed to have
been offered by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dampened hopes
of an early breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- An argument broke out at Israels weekly cabinet meeting
Sunday over a proposal to allow Arabs to volunteer for national
service. National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, Minister
of Agriculture and Environment Rafael Eitan and Science Minister
Michael Etan were said to oppose the proposal, stating that
opening the national service for Arabs would endanger Israel's
security.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A secret committee headed by Education Minister
Director-General Benzion Dell recommended that the education
minister activate Jewish education programs in Arab schools in
East Jerusalem. The committee said the students there are
currently taught Palestinian National Authority curriculum in
violation of the Oslo Accords. Ministry officials said the
implementation of the proposal would lead to violence in the
area.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Officials Hold Surprise Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- In a surprise move, Israeli
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat held talks on interim issues late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Monday that the meeting, held at the
official residence of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward Walker,
focused on the interim issues, including the seaport, Dahaniya
airport, and industrial zones in Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The last time these issues were discussed was two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the Americans initiated the meeting in the hope
of launching the projects once an agreement on the second Israeli
redeployment in the West Bank is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's unexpected meeting was held amid growing speculation
that Israel and the Palestinian side are close to reaching an
agreement on the second redeployment based on a U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Local Hebrew daily Haaretz disclosed last week that the latest
draft of the U.S. proposal demands that the outstanding interim
issues be implemented within 12 weeks, during which the second
redeployment would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio also quoted unconfirmed reports as saying that
Israel recently held talks with European Union (EU) officials and
agreed to give the Palestinians a seaport and a working airport.
</P>
<P>
This was part of an understanding to prevent the imposition of
EU sanctions on products originated from Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories. Israel and the EU waged a war of words last
month over EU's threat to boycott settlement products.
</P>
<P>
Despite the newly emerging optimism that an Israeli decision on
the second redeployment is nearer, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu denied Sunday at the weekly Cabinet meeting that Israel
was on the verge of reaching an agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said contacts with Washington were continuing and focusing
on the third redeployment.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Israel has accepted in principle the U.S. plan
calling for a 13 percent withdrawal in the second redeployment.
However, a new dispute over the size of the third pullback
prevented the sides from fixing an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is reportedly floating the idea of a 2 percent
pullback in the third redeployment, which has been rejected flatly
by the Palestinian side.

<HEADLINE> UAE, Oman, Qatar Ready to Help Raise Oil Prices: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Oil Minister Ali Bin
Ibrahim Al-Naimi has indicated that the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Oman and Qatar are ready to help enhance oil prices, the
Saudi Press Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Upon returning home late Sunday from a one-day visit to the
three countries, Al-Naimi said that his counterparts expressed
their countries' readiness to seek ways of stabilizing the world
oil market, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The four oil exporting countries, alongside Kuwait and Bahrain,
comprise the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a regional political
and economic alliance. The six economies are heavily reliant on
oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
Al-Naimi said that after consultations, positive results will
soon be seen. But he did not say whether the three countries have
agreed to cut their oil output.
</P>
<P>
He said that he briefed his counterparts on the talks in
Amsterdam, the Netherlands, last Thursday held between him and
oil ministers of Venezuela and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico agreed during the talks to
cut their oil output by a further 450,000 barrels per day as of
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi official said that most oil producing countries,
including the GCC member states, are striving to shore up the oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices had slumped due to weak demand in
Southeast Asian countries hit by financial turmoil and Iraq's
return to the oil market. The benchmark Brent Crude is traded at
around 14 U.S. dollars a barrel, five dollars lower than the
average price last year.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Yemen Agree to Continue Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Yemen have
agreed that their joint technical and legal border committee
continue meetings for the final demarcation of their boundary, the
Saudi Press Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Sunday when Saudi Prince and Defense
Minister Sultan Bin Abdul-Aziz met visiting Yemeni Minister of
Legal Affairs Abdullah Ahmed Ghanim and Minister of Justice Ismail
Ahmed Al-Wazeer in Saudi port city of Jeddah, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi leader said that his country hoped talks would
continue to solve the border dispute "cordially."
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni delegation arrived in Saudi Arabia a week ago on an
unannounced visit.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been locked in border disputes since
1934. The tension eased after the signing of a Memorandum of
Understanding in 1995 concerning the solution of the border issues
and bilateral ties are improving.
</P>
<P>
Border demarcation negotiations have since been conducted
through the joint committee.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Al-Aryani has voiced his
keenness to finalize the border demarcation after he took office
in May.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni government has also expressed willingness to continue
efforts to reach a just and acceptable settlement of the border
issue to "ensure security and stability in the area, strengthen
bilateral ties as well as foster social and economic relations
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
The two countries held their last round of talks in May when
Saudi Interior Minister Naif Bin Abdel Aziz sent a letter to his
Yemeni counterpart Hussain Moh'd Arab shortly after Yemeni new
cabinet was formed.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Trying To Clean Up Suzhou River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai wants to step up cleaning
up the main river in the city this year, the 120-km-long Suzhou,
to make it clean again by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Xu Kuangdi says that this has long been the wish of the
city's 13 million people, and it is expected to become one of the
city's sightseeing spots, instead of of mainly a shipping channel.
</P>
<P>
The river had an abundance of fish in the last century, back
when fishing by the riverbank was one of the ten major scenes in
Shanghai, but the river became seriously polluted as the city
developed its economy.
</P>
<P>
By the latter part of the 1980s, Shanghai began the first stage
of its Pollution Control Project and stopped 1.4 million tons of
polluted water daily.
</P>
<P>
This made a visible change but failed to change the water
quality of the river enough, because of the number of pollution
sources. So, last year, Shanghai set up a special office in charge
of river treatment, with Mayor Xu in charge, and a special
enforcement team, which has dealt with 300 tons of rubbish
floating on the river.
</P>
<P>
This giant Comprehensive Harnessing Project, which runs into
the next century, will cost 20 billion yuan, and has received
1.3 million yuan in donations from China and abroad.

<HEADLINE> HK Not to Reduce Scale of Land Sales: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Robert Pope, director of lands of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said here
Monday that the government will not reduce the scale of land sales
in spite of the current fluctuating property market.
</P>
<P>
After addressing the Guangdong-Hong Kong Valuation Seminar
1998, which is being held at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, Pope told reporters that in the first two
months of this fiscal year the land disposed by the government has
been sold at reasonable prices.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to worry that this year's income of land sales
will be lower than expected, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
He said that although some developers find it difficult to
raise funds due to the fluctuating property market, the government
has raised 10 billion HK dollars (1.15 billion U.S. dollars)
through land transactions in the first two months of this fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
"The property market has been fluctuating but all my land sales
have gone on schedule," Pope said.
</P>
<P>
The government will watch closely the impact of the property
market to the overall economy of Hong Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Lands Department is responsible for the disposal and
management of all government land and the acquisition of land for
public projects in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The department raised 72 billion HK dollars (9.23 billion
U.S. dollars) last year and it expects to raise some 60 billion HK
dollars (7.69 billion U.S. dollars) this year, Pope said.

<HEADLINE> Desertification Warnings In Northern and Northwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China's State Forestry
Administration has emphasized the need to control desertification
in northern and northwestern parts of the country by planting
grass and trees to reduce the effect of sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
Two strong sandstorms have hit the area since April, mainly in
areas with fewer trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
China suffers from serious desertification problems on 2.6
million square kilometers of land or 27.3 percent of its total
area. Annual losses from desertification are figured at 54 billion
yuan (6.5 billion US dollars), and desert areas are growing by
2,460 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Forestry specialists attribute the growth to man and to climate
changes, and say that population increases in these areas have put
pressure on land with grazing in pasture regions and deterioration
of grassland. In the Loess Plateau, planting on hillsides has
turned a large amount of arable land sandy.
</P>
<P>
Specialists point out that the delayed control of
desertification is a result of lack of investment, and although
the country has designated 21 counties for desert control, they
have only 400,000 yuan each for the sand control project.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that the state increase spending on desert control
in combination with agricultural development and poverty relief
projects.

SHANGHAI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Newspaper clipping service is now
a new business vogue in Shanghai, providing information in an
often neglected way.
</P>
<P>
Yi Yueming, head of one of 10 companies engaged in the service,

for dozens of clients.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the Shanghai Library opened the first
service of this kind, providing articles on various subjects like
finance, securities, real estate, and law for many big
enterprises, who are now its long-term customers.
</P>
<P>
Because of the wide range of information provided at low cost,
the service is being used by more companies, and some clipping
companies now offer in-depth market analyses.

<HEADLINE> Armed Burundi Refugees Harassing Tanzanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 450 Tanzanians
living in Biharamulo-West District, Kagera Region, have fled
their home over the past two months after being harassed by armed
Burundi refugees.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by the Member of Parliament for
Biharamulo-West, Anatoli Choya, who said that the refugees have
been terrorizing local residents, especially by robbing their
property.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our people have lost their property and fled their
houses for fear of being killed by armed Burundi refugees who
most of the time plunder whatever valuable belongings they find,"
The Guardian Monday quoted Choya as saying.
</P>
<P>
Choya told the paper in Morogoro over the weekend that local
authorities have been unable to control the bandits who come from
Msuhura refugee camp in the Ngara District on the border with
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a joke that some of our fellow Tanzanians have fled
their houses and have become refugees in their own country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The MP said that the district will most probably face an acute
shortage of food this year as some 50 Tanzanian households have
abandoned farms for fear of being attacked.
</P>
<P>
Choya said that it is difficult to seize the bandits because
they hid themselves very well.
</P>
<P>
Those who fled their houses are currently accommodated at a
police station nearby and a house belonging to a Norwegian-aided
project, Choya said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania plays host to around 225,000 mainly Hutu refugees who
fled Burundi's civil war, according to the United Nations High
Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR).

<HEADLINE> Forests for Sandy Higher Areas of China's Qaidam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Some early success in an unirrigated
afforestation research project for sandy areas has given some hope
for desert control workers in the Qaidam Basin in China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
The basin has an average elevation of 3,200 meters and is rich
in salt, oil, and natural gas, but its elevation and dry climate
have meant sparse vegetation and serious desertification and made
it difficult to get access to these resources.
</P>
<P>
So, local forestry personnel began a 3.73-million-yuan pilot
project in 1995 to improve sandy areas, and have added nearly 250
hectares of forests in the form of 187 forest belts, and brought
more than 330 ha of sandy areas under control.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have also started a 156-ha experimental center using
unirrigated and deep-sowing methods that has resulted in a forest
survival rate of more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The dry afforestation technique will make large-scale
improvement projects possible, they say.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets up Marine Data Center in E. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- An oceanographic database center
providing marine data and maps has started operating at Kenya's
Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The center, based at the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research
Institute, will provide scientific information also useful to
conservationists, the East African weekly newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The center will serve Tanzania, Comoros, Madagascar,
Seychelles, Mauritius, Reunion, Mozambique and Somalia, said the
report. The eight states adopted the eastern Africa action plan
on the establishment of an oceanographic center in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The plan was to enhance sustainable development and management
of the marine environment and resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
The database, known as geographical information system (GIS),
covers climate, hydrology, oceanography and coastal types and
contains details on marine flora and fauna, and on fishing.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need to develop data centers in the region
which can ensure that (information) is collected in standard
formats, is quality controlled and archived," said Ezekiel Okemw,
the regional coordinator of Mombasa Oceanographic Center.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. statistics, up to 1996 none of the countries
in eastern Africa had set up a national oceanographic data
center.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had a designated nationals agency for ocean data
management, established in 1971, but it was moribund.
</P>
<P>
However, several countries in the region have now initiated
national databases, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Leaves For Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
leaves here Monday afternoon for Germany to attend Russian-German
summit consultations.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl are expected to
discuss issues ranging from financial markets and German
investment in Russia to bilateral cooperation in the mining and
space industries.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's entourage includes Deputy Prime Minister Oleg
Sysuyev, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Economics Minister
Yakov Urinson, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Interior Minister
Sergei Stepashin, Finance Minister Mikhail Azdornov and Atomic
Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are scheduled to hold parallel meetings with
their German counterparts Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
"They will have enough work for a whole night," Itar-Tass news
agency quoted Yeltsin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Russia's largest trading partner. Bilateral trade
last year amounted to 32 billion German marks (about 17.7 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Moscow is dissatisfied with the trade structure which
features export of Russian raw materials and import of German
finished goods.
</P>
<P>
Russia is urging Germany to increase investment in
Russia. German investments, mainly in the services and trade
sectors, now account for some 11 percent of total foreign
investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will have a working breakfast with Gerhard Schroder,
speaker of Germany's upper house of parliament, Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is seen by observers as of special importance
because Schroder might become the next German chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Schroder has been nominated as the candidate for chancellor of
the Social Democratic Party, which is leading opinion polls in the
run-up to the September elections.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is scheduled to return to Moscow Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> 600,000 Zimbabweans Need Food Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 600,000 people in Zimbabwe's
south-eastern drought-stricken area need urgent food relief, The
Herald daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government has ferried over 600 tons of maize
to the area. However, food delivery is expected to last only
until the end of this month when more rail wagons are expected to
bring in grain.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to transport 12,000 bags of maize using rail
to Chriedzi district. This has improved food deliveries in the
district but the problem is far from being over.
</P>
<P>
"The government is facing a critical shortage of trucks for
the transportation of grain and the problem is being worsened by
the long distances," Masvingo Provincial Administrator Alphonse
Chikurira said in an interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to ensure that every family which has
registered gets food. One major problem we are still faced with
is where to relocate cattle to," said Chikurira.
</P>
<P>
Villagers have driven all their cattle to the banks of the
Runde river in search of grazing.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in serious pressure on the land, threatening
the area with massive land degradation and siltation of the
river. The area was hit by the third consecutive drought.

<HEADLINE> Planting Trees As A Birthday Celebration In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Xu Xiaoping, who lives in
Nanchang, the capital of east China's Jiangxi Province, planted a
China fir near the Jingjiu (Beijing-Kowloon) Railway line for his
tenth birthday this year and says he thinks it will grow as fast
and healthy as he does, and will see who is taller by the time he
finishes middle school.
</P>
<P>
Many of the children at Xu's school have decided to celebrate
their birthdays in the same way, and Xu says that this is quite
significant.
</P>
<P>
A local education department official says that they have had
this program since 1995, and that the response by local students
and their parents has been good.
</P>
<P>
The province's students have planted 1.45 million trees, 80
percent of which are along the Jingjiu Railway line, which
connects Beijing and Kowloon in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A third of the 2,000-kilometer railway line is in Jiangxi. The
Chinese Government plans to turn the railway line into a "green
corridor", and Xu says, "We should make the railway more
beautiful."

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition to Stage "Long March" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's seven-party opposition
alliance will stage a two-day "long march" to the country's
southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts beginning Tuesday to protest
against the peace treaty the government signed with the region's
tribals last December.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) would
start the march at 7 a.m. and stop at the seaport city of
Chittagong in the evening before restarting there Wednesday
morning towards Khagrachhari, one of the three hill districts, a
press release reaching here Monday said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Sunday, BNP Chairperson and leader of the
Opposition in Parliament Khaleda Zia said that if her party
returned to power, it would amend the "unconstitutional"
provisions in the accord.
</P>
<P>
"We also favor peace accord...but the one signed (between the
government and the tribals) contains some unconstitutional
provisions which require amendment," she said.
</P>
<P>
While the BNP alleged that the government was obstructing
preparations for the "long march", Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
pledged Monday that her government would not obstruct the "long
march," as "we believe in democracy."
</P>
<P>
The opposition has fiercely attacked the treaty since it was
signed in December 1997, accusing it of "violating the
Constitution" and "ignoring the interest of the nation."
</P>
<P>
The seven-party alliance includes the BNP, the Jammat-e-Islami,
the Jatiya Party, the Democratic League, the National Democratic
Party, the Progressive Nationalist Party and the Democratic
Nationalist Alliance.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Cozy Nest for the Old in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- It's a rainy morning in Kowloon,
Hong Kong. The melodies of "Glory, Glory, Alleluia!" played by an
organ and a violin are heard from the entrance of a hillside
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-one-year-old T.W. Chan and his friend are enjoying the
duet they played, once and again, in the first-floor lounge at the
beginning of a new day in their comfort lives after retirement.
</P>
<P>
Nearby, some others are reading newspapers and magazines,
watching TV, chatting with each other or simply relaxing in the
sofa, in an atmosphere of neighborhood harmony.
</P>
<P>
This scene is pretty usual in the first-ever house for senior
citizens prepared by the government of Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The seven-story, 197-room apartment building was built
specially for the old people who can hardly afford the housing
expenses after retirement. Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
officiated the opening of the apartment on May 9.
</P>
<P>
Over 150 residents have moved in since January 16, 1998. Most
of them, aged between 60 and 83, are living alone and all on their
own.
</P>
<P>
With transparent roofs, the lodgers can enjoy the sunshine
without walking out of the building. Looking out from the
balconies is the scenic hills of Lam Tin, Kowloon. Right adjacent
to the well-equipped building is a shop of the city's largest
department store, Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
Along the walkways which circle the rooms on each floor are
clean and tidy public sitting and dining areas and laundry rooms,
as well as private kitchens and bathrooms allocated to each
resident. There are also activity rooms where some paintings of
the residents are displayed.
</P>
<P>
It is very cheap to rent such apartments, said Mr. Chan, who
used to be a teacher. It costs some 730 HK dollars (about 94
U.S. dollars) a month to rent a room here, about one-third of
renting a similar apartment in ordinary apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
In Mr. Chan's room, there is a double-deck bed, a desk, an
organ, a stereo and a television set. Almost all corners of the
music lover's room are filled with books and cassette tapes.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chow Min and Ms. Chan Siu Fong, two of the three welfare
assistants working in the apartment, said they feel happy to work
here.
</P>
<P>
The welfare assistants sometimes organize activities to welcome
new comers or entertain the lodgers. An old lady said the
assistants "are warm-hearted and treat us very well."
</P>
<P>
From time to time, some volunteer workers join the welfare
assistants to help the old people.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chow said the HKSAR government has planned to open over
3,000 such apartment rooms for the old people in the future.

WUHAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A crowd of farmers gathered on the
banks of a reservoir in the city of Zaoyang in China's Hubei
Province recently to witness the maiden flight of a sightseeing
plane that twelve of their fellow villagers bought.
</P>
<P>
This bold move came from Liu Changbi, after several visits to
tourist sites at the nearby town of Xiongji.
</P>
<P>
So, he got together with eleven of the villagers, raised more
than 300,000 yuan, and bought a seaplane from an institute
belonging to the China Aerospace Corp.
</P>
<P>
The village used to be a poor mountainous place but that is now
changing as farmers there began to shift their gaze to tourism.

<HEADLINE> Tax Income From Macao Casinos Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Tax income from Macao casinos rose 22
percent in 1997 over the previous year mainly due to a tax rate
increase, the Macao Daily News reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Macao casinos handed over some six billion patacas (about 750
million U.S. dollars) of tax last year, up 22 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly because of the rise in tax rate from 30
percent of gross income to 31.8 percent. The increase was decided
in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
The share of casino tax income has played an increasing role in
the government's revenue as Macao has been hit by an economic
slow-down since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Macao Tourism and Amusement Company (STDM),
which monopolizes all casinos in Macao, launched Asia's first
football lottery on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Ho, managing director of STDM, said last Friday at a
launching ceremony that he expected a turnover of up to one
billion patacas (about 125 million U.S. dollars) during the
upcoming 98' World Cup in France alone.

<P>
HEFEI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province in east China is
raising more than a billion yuan (about 120 million US dollars)
annually in various ways for facilities to fight floods, according
to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
This agricultural province on the lower reaches of the Yangtze
River has been plagued by floods since the 1990s. As much as 1.75
billion yuan has been raised for 6 water resource projects in the
Huaihe River Valley and about 200 million cubic meters of soil and
stone moved.
</P>
<P>
In the Yangtze River Valley, flood control facilities on the
Wuwei, Tongma, Yuxihe, and Wuhu have been built or improved and 60
percent of the 3 billion yuan in financing for agricultural
development has been allocated for water facilities.
</P>
<P>
The province has a new way to raise money. The provincial
capital city of Hefei plans to raise 100 million yuan for water
projects during the Ninth Five-year Plan period (1996-2000) and
the local government has put 5 million yuan into the Chuhe River
treatment project, for which local people raised 22.5 million yuan
themselves.

<HEADLINE> China Needs to Rely on Consumers Credit to Boost Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- While commodities are in
oversupply, many Chinese consumers are lacking money to buy what
they want to buy.
</P>
<P>
In view of the Chinese economists, the way to solve this
dilemma is to develop consumers' credit, which is seriously
lacking in the country.
</P>
<P>
The achievement of China's eight percent growth of Gross
Domestic Products(GDP) this year will largely depend on the
thriving of the consumers' market, the economists argue.
</P>
<P>
After years of economic boom, China is now at a stage of
consumption structure escalation, featuring more urban people
planning to buy cars and homes and more farmers in need of
electrical appliances.
</P>
<P>
However, while more credit loans are injected into the
production sector, the consumption credit is still considered
backward in China.
</P>
<P>
As a result, when ordinary wage-earners want to buy some
money-consuming items, they find it difficult to afford it all at
once, and have to save money for sometime before buying.
</P>
<P>
The economists thus suggested efforts be made to accelerate the
introduction of buyer's credit.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers to Pave Way for E. African Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A committee of legislators from
the national assemblies of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania is to be
formed in preparation for the establishment of an East African
Legislative Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a two-day meeting attended by the
speakers of the three assemblies in Arusha, a northern Tanzanian
town where the East African Cooperation (EAC) Secretariat is
based, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 19 lawmakers have agreed that the composition of the
committee should be determined by the speakers taking into
consideration the different parliamentary interest groups in
their countries.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the composition, functions, powers and
privileges, proceedings and budget of the proposed assembly, as
well as the proposed draft treaty which should be approved by the
presidents of the three states in November.
</P>
<P>
For effective representation, they said, the proposed assembly
should have 45 members who appoint the Speaker, Clerk and other
officers.
</P>
<P>
The meeting proposed that each country choose 15 lawmakers,
which should reflect the composition of each national parliament,
including gender and other special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
The assembly will be able to discuss any matters pertaining to
EAC and liaise with the national legislatures on matters
affecting the regional community.
</P>
<P>
The would-be candidate should not be a minister or head of
department in any of the three countries. They should also not be
employees of the EAC or the East African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the person elected Speaker of the East
African Assembly should cease to be a member of parliament in his
own country and should serve in office for five years.

<HEADLINE> OAU Meeting Overshadowed by Ethiopia-Eritrea Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- African ministers ended a
four-day meeting here Sunday night to set stage for their heads of
state and government to plan the future of the world's poorest
continent at a summit.
</P>
<P>
But with escalation of armed conflict between Ethiopia and
Eritrea, the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) had to call two special sessions to take care of the
hot issue.
</P>
<P>
Along with the reported escalating armed conflict at the Horn
of Africa, the two countries staged heated diplomatic wars at the
international conference center here.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of both countries called emergency press
conferences even when the ministerial meeting was underway.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia charged that Eritrean fighter planes bombed its
northern border town of Mekelle Friday and Saturday, killing more
than 40 civilians, including school children, and wounding about
150.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea denied the accusation, claiming that the airport in
the southern outskirts of its capital Asmara was bombed and one of
Ethiopian planes on the bombing mission was gunned down, with the
pilot captured.
</P>
<P>
To handle the situation, the ministerial meeting adopted a
resolution at midnight Friday, urging the two to end all
hostilities "at the same time and simultaneously."
</P>
<P>
But it has proved to be of little use when bombing and killing
resumed Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
It is mostly because of the worsening situation that the
meeting was extended by a whole day to close down only on Sunday
night so as to have more time to consider the issue, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
Despite the interruptions caused by the escalating conflict,
the Council of Ministers has basically fulfilled its targets set
for its 68th Ordinary Session.
</P>
<P>
After careful consideration, the councillors adopted in the
past four days more than 30 resolutions, which highlight what
African countries would plan to do to promote peace and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
All the resolutions will be submitted to the three-day 34th OAU
summit, scheduled to open on Monday, for further deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The coming summit is expected to give due attention to the
Ethiopia-Eritrea conflict, a critical issue whose solution would
have important bearing on peace and stability in Africa at a time
when progress has been made in the settlement of crises in
Liberia, Sierra Leone and other parts of Africa.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, how to establish a continental peacekeeping
force is expected to become one of the major points for discussion
at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Economic issues will also be a major topic at the summit as
encouraging growth has appeared in the continent in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
After being mired in almost two decades of economic crises,
Africa has obtained considerable progress, with the growth
rate up from one percent in 1990 to five percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The outlook is so optimistic that observers say that
Africa is potentially at the point of a takeoff.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the momentum in development, however,
there are a lot of problems for Africa to deal with.
</P>
<P>
Beside enjoying peace and stability, African countries have to
follow suitable economic policies and reduce their heavy debt
burden.
</P>
<P>
While trying to enhance the effectiveness of the Central Organ
of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution, OAU members also have to ensure a sound
performance of the African Economic Community (AEC), established
last year for continental economic integration.
</P>
<P>
Social problems, including food supply, child labor, refugees,
returnees and displaced persons and education, should also be duly
coped with.
</P>
<P>
Now that resolutions on these issues have been adopted at the
Council of Ministers meeting, the next thing is for African
leaders to make final decisions to realize their political will
and bring into the the new millennium an Africa of peace, unity,
democracy and development.

KUWAIT CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Spotlight of Saudi Arabia media
is falling on the World Cup soccer finals as the competition is
drawing near, a local newspaper available here Monday reported.
</P>
<P>
Elaborate preparations have been made by the Ministry of

<HEADLINE> Demand For Domestic Workers on Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The demand for domestic helpers
paid on an hourly base is on the rise in major Chinese cities, a
survey by an information company under the State Statistics Bureau
indicated.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that over two million families in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shenyang, and Qingdao--the
seven cities surveyed, have hired the hourly-paid domestic workers,
accounting for 24.7 percent of the total households.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that neighborhood service offices in the
seven cities now can provide the hourly-paid jobs to about 600,000
people, and that about 350,000 more hands are still needed to
cater to growing need.
</P>
<P>
The service is popular because, compared with the full-time
domestic workers, the hourly paid workers can provide flexible
services according to the need of their employers while do not
need their employers to provide accommodation, the survey
said.

ROME, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The stopping of mutual air raid
between Ethiopia and Eritrea is a good sign for Italy which is
closely following the deteriorating situation there, said Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In Italian central city Bologna, Prodi told ANSA news agency

Italy, the colonial master of both countries between 1936 and

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Increase Rubber Block Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to increase rubber
block export over the next five years to meet rising demand from
the United States and Europe, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Chakarn Saengruksawong, director of the
Rubber Research Institute, as saying that the export growth target
will rise from 600,000 tons per year, or 20 percent of the present
production, to 30 percent over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The United States is currently Thailand's main overseas market
for rubber block, Chakarn said.
</P>
<P>
Thai rubber block captured 32 percent of the U.S. market in
1997 as competition from Malaysia and Indonesia declined due to
lower production and exports, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expected to export 1.9 million tons of natural
rubber this year while Malaysia and Indonesia are expected to
export one million and 1.6 million tons respectively.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Issue Domestic Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The first lot of Thailand's 500
billion baht (11.9 billion U.S. dollars) domestic bonds will be
issued by the end of this month, inaugurating the restructuring of
liabilities of the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF).
</P>
<P>
The first lot of 50 billion baht (1.19 billion dollars) bond
issue will have a maturity of one year, and will be placed with
local and overseas financial institutions, the Bangkok Post Monday
quoted Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Leeahtam as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that the bonds will be issued by the
Finance Ministry for sale to the FIDF, which will then resell the
instruments into the market.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry will be the issuer of the bonds in order
to restructure the FIDF's debt from short-term to long-term.
</P>
<P>
The government estimates that FIDF has run up losses of 500
billion baht (11.9 billion dollars) from its support of ailing
banks and finance companies over the past year.
</P>
<P>
An executive decree passed last month authorizes the issue of
up to 500 billion baht worth of domestic bonds to restructure
short-term liabilities of FIDF into long-term obligations, saving
costs on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Pisit said funds raised from the bond sale will be used by
FIDF to repay maturing short-term debts.
</P>
<P>
The first lot of the bonds was designed to test the market and
allow the authorities to choose a one-year maturity to avoid
excessive costs for the government.
</P>
<P>
Pisit said once the market stabilizes, the ministry will issue
long-term bonds of five, ten or 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He refused to tell the exact rates of the bonds, but said that
with liquidity tight, the ministry is likely to accept high
interest rates for the first lot.

<P>
OUAGADOUGOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The 68th Ordinary Session of
the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) ended here midnight Sunday after a one-day delay.
</P>
<P>
Delegations from the 53 OAU member states adopted more than 30
resolutions which highlight what the African countries plan to do
to promote peace and economic development in the world's poorest
continent.
</P>
<P>
All the resolutions will be submitted to a three-day OAU
summit, scheduled to open Monday morning, for further deliberation.
</P>
<P>
One resolution, which becomes the focus of attention at the
International Conference Center here, came out of a special
session called on Friday night, urging for an immediate end to all
hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The special session was held after reports of mutual air
attacks between the two countries Friday morning, when Ethiopia
accused Eritrea of wounding five civilians.
</P>
<P>
A number of resolutions adopted by the Council of Ministers
meeting touched on political crises in Rwanda, Somalia, Angola,
the Comoros and Burundi after the delivery of reports on the
issues by OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
Delegates agreed to enhance the effectiveness of the Central
Organ of the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution in a bid to bring lasting peace to the entire continent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed the financial situation and
structural reform of the 53-member continental organization, while
appealing for international assistance to the national re-building
of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
As at the previous sessions, the Council of Ministers also
adopted resolutions in support of Palestine and Libya, calling for
an early solution to the crises they face with Israel and Britain
and the United States respectively.
</P>
<P>
Food supply, child labor, refugees, returnees and displaced
persons, education, human rights and other social problems were
among issues discussed at the four-day session, chaired by Burkina
Faso Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouedraogo.
</P>
<P>
Ouedraogo, replacing Executive Chairman Jakaya Kikwete,
Tanzanian foreign minister, will remain in office for two
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, the delegates also had heated
discussions over Africa's seats in the anticipated expanded United
Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, the Council of Ministers has decided to
submit its draft resolution on the charter of the African Economic
Community to the 34th summit for the heads of state and government
to finalize.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, however, could not spend much time on economic
issues because of the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea, OAU
Spokesman Pascal Gayana told reporters at a news briefing after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
But the heads of state and government will make it up at the
coming summit, he added.

<HEADLINE> Skoda Reports Sharp Drop in Sales in Five Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Czech Republic's major car maker
Skoda said Sunday that its domestic sales in the first five months
this year registered a sharp drop of 15.1 percent to 35,000 units.
</P>
<P>
That the company would find no way to realize its sales goal
this year is a foregone conclusion, according to a senior Skoda
sales manager.
</P>
<P>
The manager attributed the decreased sales to the country's
recent unstable political situation and economic depression,
which, he said had resulted in Czech people's lower income in real
terms and weaker purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Facing serious situation in the home market, Skoda is trying
its best to explore overseas market.
</P>
<P>
It plans to increase by more than 30 percent its export to
Germany, Italy and Austria within the following six months.
</P>
<P>
It also sees a bright prospect in the Chinese market and plans
to resume its suspended car trade with China.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Skoda lived a golden time with a record output of
357,000 units, up 35.9 percent from the previous year, and sales
also increased by 28.8 percent to 336,000 units.

The canal is only one of a number of water conservation
projects here, the largest of which is in a canyon in the Kunlun
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The 1.4-billion-yuan (168 million US dollars) construction
project is part of the Ninth Five-Year-Plan (1995-2000). When it
is completed in three years, it will be able to irrigate a
20,000-hectare area.
</P>
<P>
"A cubic meter of water from this expensive project will cost
three yuan, a very high price, but we are more concerned with what
the social returns the project will bring to this area," says Wang
Shijiang, who is in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
Wang says that the central government is providing most of the
money for this important poverty-relief project, with water
conservation being the key to fighting desertification and getting
rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The increased amount of water has already helped the oasis grow
24,666 hectares in the past three years, 14,666 hectares of that
in farmland.
</P>
<P>
Water also allowed 100,000 hectares of trees to be planted in
woods, along roads, and in courtyards. The central and regional
governments are setting aside 400 million yuan annually for other
developments in Hotan.
</P>
<P>
The "three-dimentional agriculture" is one of these,
emphasizing the link between grains, vegetables, and fruits to
save farmland and make the oasis beautiful.
</P>
<P>
A local winery purchases grapes, pomegranates, and roses from
farmers to produce fruity wines, which are sold in other parts of
China, thanks to the Tarim Railway that crosses the desert.
</P>
<P>
Local officials are also placing hopes on oil exploration, from
the heart of the desert to the Kunlun Mountains, and one well
drilled last autumn shows great oil and gas potential.
</P>
<P>
In the view of Chinese economists, the Hotan oasis is a land
full of hope, and they say that the thousand-year-old silk
industry, the new gardening, the winery, and the oil potential
provide strong support for local people in their struggle against
the desert.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Adopts New Measures to Curb Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, will strictly curb
the exhaust of motor-bikes and prohibit the use of plastic bags, a
leading official for environmental protection in the city said
today.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will force the installation of exhaust
purifiers on 400,000 motor-bikes, urge residents and shopping
malls to use paper bags instead of plastic ones and expand the
network for supplying liquefied natural gas to shops and
residences, said Gan Haizhang, head of the local environmental
protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bureau will release daily air quality reports
to the public beginning this month, said Gan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city government adopted regulations on reducing
pollution from motor vehicles and plastic bags. The amount of lead
in the air declined by 61 percent in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
After the beginning of the ban on horns on motor vehicles, the
noise index in old districts such as Yuexiu, Liwan, Dongshan and
Haizhu decreased greatly, Gan said.
</P>
<P>
The city also called on the general public to care more about
the environment they live in through reporting the daily air
quality. Guangzhou issued weekly air-quality reports last year.

CHENGDU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A sick and hungry panda was
recently saved from drowning in China's Sichuan Province, thanks
to a group of farmers.
</P>
<P>
The panda was moving along the waters of a turbulent river when
the peasants saw her. To keep the panda from falling in the river,
one of them, Yang Yanfang, ran up and grabbed the panda. The two
rolled down the slope before Yang caught a tree branch, just a few
meters above the rushing waters.
</P>
<P>
Other peasants immediately came down and grabbed the panda and
Yang, whose arms were bleeding as a result of the tussle with the
panda.
</P>
<P>
The animal was sent to the county forestry bureau for medical
treatment and after it recovered, was returned to the Labahe
Nature Reserve.
</P>
<P>
This was the second lucky panda to be saved by peasants this

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan scored 24
points and Toni Kukoc added 16 on Sunday as the Chicago Bulls
routed the Utah Jazz 96-54 in Game 3 of the NBA Finals, holding
the Jazz to the fewest points in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls, who lead the best-of-seven series 2-1, will enjoy
two more home-court advantaged games, with Game 4 arranged on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest margin for a team ever has won in the NBA
Finals history. With this heavy blow, the Jazz looked completely
smashed in confidence and seemed unable to match the Bulls at the
United Center where the Bulls have a record of 35 wins against
four losses.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody had a good time out there," Jordan said. "We came
out and played hard. We put the effort and intensity in and as a
result we could relax a little in the fourth quarter."
</P>
<P>
Utah's 54 points broke the NBA record of 55 set earlier this
season by the Indian Pacers and was 17 fewer than the Finals
record of 71 by Syracuse in 1955.
</P>
<P>
"I'm somewhat embarrassed for NBA basketball, for our guys
to come out and have no fight at all," Utah coach Jerry Sloan
said. "They got all the loose balls and all the rebounds."
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone, who had a shooting 14-for-41 over the previous two
games, entered the game like a diffrent man, shot in all his first
four jumpers plus a pair of driving to basket along with his 22
points.
</P>
<P>
But the rest of the team only contributed 13-for-59 shooting,
with Howard Eisley 0-6, Bryon Russell and Greg Ostertag 1-for-7
each.
</P>
<P>
the Jazz made frequent pass errors and had 26 turnovers in the
games. Malone and John Stockton combined to make 12 turnovers to
hand in Chicago 22 points. The first half ended at 49-31 in favor
of the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
The second half was an entire lopsided affair with the Bulls
ran away quickly to increase the lead by 23 points five minutes
into the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the final eight minutes, with the first line-up of the both
sides rested on bench, the Bulls reserves humiliated their
counterparts with 30-5 run to wind up the game.

<HEADLINE> Thai Defense Ministry Troubled by Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign debts have become a major
headache for the Defense Ministry of Thailand, which has already
been hard-pressed by budget cuts over the past year, the Bangkok
Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry now has 5 billion baht (119 million U.S.
dollars) in foreign debts which mature this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It still has no idea how to pay these debts, since the
ministry has already had its budget cut back to the bone, the
newspaper quoted a ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces received a budget of 75 billion baht (1.79
billion dollars) in fiscal 1998, forcing expenditure cuts of up to
16 billion baht (380 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Cuts for the Defense Ministry have been particularly harsh, as
the government has directed scarce funds to key investments to
build a social safety net and develop the country's industrial
base.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has set aside 2 billion baht (47.6
million dollars) to help deal with increased state debt stemming
from the depreciation of the baht. About half is expected to be
used for the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The maturing foreign debt is actually about 15 billion baht
(357 million dollars), but 10 billion baht (238 million dollar)
has been successfully rolled over, leaving 5 billion baht (119
million dollars) of obligations due by September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Used Nerve Gas to Kill Defectors in Vietnam War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The military of the United
States used nerve gas to kill defectors during the
Vietnam war, U.S. media said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Adm. Thomas Moorer, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff was quoted as saying that sarin nerve gas was used in 1970
in a secret raid into Laos, according to a joint report of Cable
News Networks (CNN) and Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
Other military officials who participated in the operation said
their job was to kill defectors from the U.S. troops. Robert
Buskirk, a platoon leader in the operation, was quoted as
saying: "It wasn't about bringing them back. It was to kill them."
</P>
<P>
Some of the military officials were quoted as saying that the
sarin gas was dropped on more than 20 missions in Laos and then
North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Moorer said the national security team of President Richard
Nixon approved the use of the nerve gas and the CIA was also
partially responsible for the operation. He was now speaking out
for "his respect for history."
</P>
<P>
The report, a result of a eight-month investigation with 200
people interviewed, was published in the latest edition of the
Time magazine.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archaelologists Are Not Looking for Genghis Khan's Grave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Cultural affairs officials in
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region say that archaeologists
have no plans to look for the secret burial place of Genghis Khan,
ancient Mongol ruler.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors that China would use state-of-the-art
technology like photography from space to look for the grave of
the Mongolian strategist and founder of the Mongol regime in the
early 13th century.
</P>
<P>
According to Su Jun, section chief of the region's culture
department, they have never been told to do this by the central
culture department, and that their primary task is to protect and
rescue cultural relics and historic sites rather than get involved
in archaeological digs, which usually take place at major
infrastructure construction sites.
</P>
<P>
The director of the Genghis Khan Mausoleum Research Institute,
Sareldai, says that excavating the grave of Genghis Khan would be
an act of disrespect for Mongolian customs or tradition, and that
what should be sought is Genghis Khan's enterprising spirit and
his courage, not his remains or buried treasures.
</P>
<P>
Historical reports say that Genghis Khan, once conqueror of
much of the Eurasia, died of illness in 1227 in Liupanshan, in
today's Gansu Province, and was buried in secret by his generals
according to Mongol tradition. Mongol studies specialists around
the world have never agreed on where he had been buried. Some says
it might be in Mongolia, others say it should have been in China,
in his mausoleum in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Yang Dorj, a Mongolian scholar, says that the myth that Genghis
Khan and his successors -- the Yuan Dynasty emperors -- would have
no graves left behind is an old one. Yong said he believes it is
deeply rooted in the burial customs of Mongols.

<HEADLINE> Western Chinese Battle Desert Invasion (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Taklimakan Desert continues to
move towards the Kunlun Mountains in the southern part of China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,, after engulfing several cities
on the old Silk Road, but in recent years, it's met with strong
resistance from farmers in the oasis city of Hotan.
</P>
<P>
People there still have to shake the dust off their clothes
before entering silk workshops, but they displayed unique wisdom
and courage in their fight against poverty and desertification,
according to Trine M. Lund-Jensen, assistant representative of the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP), who visited Hotan
recently, and said that it is likely the diligent people can get
rid of poverty in two to three years.
</P>
<P>
The Hotan oasis has a mere tenth of a hectare per capita of
arable land and is one of China's poorest areas. The situation got
worse in the 20 years up to 1995 when 20,000 hectares of oasis was
swallowed up by desert.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the people of Hotan have never given up in their
struggle against nature, and in recent years, have built water
conservation facilities, developed three-dimentional agriculture,
and turned deserts into orchards in an effort to change this
impoverished land.
</P>
<P>
The snow of the Kunlun Mountains feeds the rivers that run
through the desolate desert, where a group of a thousand bare-foot
farmers are working to stop seepage in the Happiness Canal,
carefully cementing up the cracks.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, in the past several decades,
Hotan's farmers have devoted about a third of their labor to water
conservation projects, and the 36-kilometer Happiness Canal has a
26-kilometer section in the desert. Before the seepage controls,
about fifty pairs of hands were needed to stop the leaks during
irrigation.

<P>
BERLIN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia took a 9-points halftime lead
and lost the gold medal final 71-65 Sunday to the United States
who recaptured the title at the Women's World Basketball
Championship.
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth time for the Americans to win the world
title in the tournament. The team, which placed third at last
championship, took the previous titles in 1953, 1954, 1979, 1986
and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Center Lisa Leslie led four Americans in double-figures with 20
points. She also grabbed 12 rebounds. Elisha Milton hit 13 and
Ruthie Bolton 11 including three 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
The game tied 63-63 on Russian Svetlana Antipova's lay-up with
1:29 remaining. The United States, however, fired a last charge
headed by Bolton's third three-points and Daw Staley got three
free-throws to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
Russia opened with a 7-2 lead and extended to 16-8 five minutes
into the game.
</P>
<P>
The United States closed the gap with a 6-0 run for 14-16 but
Russia answered with a 13-6 spurt for 29-20 with 6:30 to play in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
Though trailing at halftime 28-37 but the Americans managed to
equal the score 41-41 with a 13-4 run paced by Leslie's six points
with 12 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
Russia went ahead as Zassoulska scored six points in a row and
Routkovska tossed in two free throws for 49-46 to keep a marginal
edge until Bolton's second three-pointer with 1:45 left.
</P>
<P>
"We decided this final only in the closing stages with two
three-pointers," U.S. coach Nell Fortner said.
</P>
<P>
Nata Zasslulskaia scored 20 points for Russia, who
disqualified for last tournament in Australia, and Irin
Routkovskaja hit 14 with Elena Baranova 13. Both Routkovskaja and
Baranova also pulled down 9 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
"This was a really great final," said the Russian coach Evgueny
Gomelsky. "To keep the Americans at a 28 points distance in the
first half was a great achievement of our defense. My players
obviously got more tired in the second half."
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian girls received another honour after the
final game when Baranova was announced to be elected as the Most
Valuable Player of the world championship for women by journalists
(including Xinhua News Agency of China) from 14 countries covering

<HEADLINE> Italian Planes Evacuate 351 Foreigner out of Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Two planes of the Italian air force
flew 351 foreigners, mostly women and children, out of Eritrean
capital Asmara overnight following last Saturday's bombings of the
city by the Ethiopian planes.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation took place during the 13 hours of safe flying
time granted by the Ethiopian government. Two Italian air force
C-130 planes shuttled between Asmara and Eritrea's neighboring
Djibouti, carrying Italians and 114 people of other nationalities
to safety. The Italians are expected to return home on a specially
commissioned Alitalia fight later.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Ministry said that all Italians requested
evacuation had left Asmara by 06:00 a.m. local time Sunday, the end
of an agreed suspension of hostilities between Ethiopia and
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Two C-130s are standing by in Djibouti for emergency evacuation
of the remaining 600 or so Italians if situation further
deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian planes bombed Asmara airport last Saturday for the
third times in two days, persuading some foreign residents there
to leave. "We knew about the skirmishes on the border, but we
didn't think it would come to an all-out war," one evacuee
said. But last Saturday's bombing at the airport "left no room for
doubt."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian bombing last Saturday is said to be a retaliation for
Friday's bombing by Eritrean planes of the northern Ethiopian city
Mekele, which caused dozens of people dead and a hundred injured.
</P>
<P>
Border clashes between Ethiopia and Eritrea have been
escalating for weeks. The two countries are fighting over a 400-
square-kilometer piece of border land near Mekele.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 U.S. scientists,
business leaders, environmentalists and federal officials will
gather this week in Monterey, California, for the country's first
National Ocean Conference.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and cabinet
secretaries will attend the Thursday-Friday conference aimed at
identifying ocean problems, from overfishing to toxic pollution,
and seeking new policies to solve them.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy and environment are inextricably linked to the
ocean. More than one-half of Americans live within 80 kilometers
of the coastline. By 2010, that number is expected to reach 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one-third of the country's GDP is produced in the
coastal zone. Nearly 40 percent of new commercial development and
46 percent of new residential development are built near the
coasts. Nearly 85 percent of all tourist revenues come from
coastal states.
</P>
<P>
But the country has no national strategy for protecting and
sustaining its ocean resources.
</P>
<P>
One of the most critical problems is polluted runoff from storm
drains and other sources, which are wrecking aquatic life.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, there have been 19,000 beach closures
nationwide because of sewage spills. And overfishing is also a big
problem. Of 727 major marine species in U.S. coastal waters, the
status of only 38 percent is known.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Economy on Threshold of Depression, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- An economic guru said Indonesia's
economy is on the threshold of a depression and suggested that
small and medium-scale businesses be reinvigorated, reported The
Jakarta Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Reinvigorating these businesses is most urgent and imperative
now to rescue our economy," said Sumitro Djojohadikusumo here over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-scale businesses were the back-bone of the
country's economy in terms of productive employment, real income
and foreign exchange generation.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should lobby strongly the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to immediately allocate between 3 billion and
5 billion U.S. dollars out of its sponsored 43-billion-U.S.-dollar
bailout fund into a trust fund to extend credits at concessional
interest rates to small and medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
If the IMF does not agree on such an allocation, he said, the
government should allocate that fund from its international
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Sumitro warned that the nation could plunge into
a prolonged depression if economic and political reforms were not
implemented speedily, firmly and consistently.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Central Bureau of Statistics recently predicted a
total negative gross domestic product growth of over 10 percent
for this year and inflation exceeding 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
"My own prediction is a contraction of between 10 and 15
percent and inflation minimally at 100 percent," Sumitro said.
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old guru was a minister in the late 1960s and
1970s. He said he had actually decided to retire from economic
policy debates unless an emergency situation arose.
</P>
<P>
"The present crisis is a call of duty for me to speak my mind,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President B.J. Habibie told reporters over the
weekend that Indonesia would stick to an IMF reform program.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Law Enforcement Officers Increase in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Full-time state and local law
enforcement officers increased by more than 19 percent between
1992 and 1996, with a larger percentage of uniformed officers
patroling that nation's streets, the Justice Department said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A Bureau of Justice Statistics report said the number of law
enforcement officers grew during the four-year period by more than
68,000 to reach 423,000.
</P>
<P>
Of those officers, 64 percent were uniformed personnel whose
regular duties included responding to calls for service, compared
with 59 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of community policing applauded the increase as
evidence that a crime bill to put more police on the streets and
in partnership with neighborhoods is working.
</P>
<P>
"Not only has there been a huge increase in the number of men
and women working in law enforcement, but local agencies are
committing a larger percentage of sworn officers to patrol
functions and community policing activities," said Joseph E.
Brann, director of the Office of Community Oriented Policing
Services (COPS). The COPS program has funded more than 75,000
additional officers and deputies since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat who sponsored the
crime bill which produced the COPS program, linked increases in
police officers on the streets with decreases in recorded violent
crimes.
</P>
<P>
In November, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that
violent crimes against Americans had fallen 10 percent in 1996
from the previous year, hitting the lowest level since the survey
began 23 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that the total number of full-time state
and local officers with arrest powers increased by 59,000 since
1992 to total 663,535 in 1996. Of the full-time sworn officers, 15
percent were assigned to investigative duties.
</P>
<P>
New York City's Police Department, the largest law enforcement
agency in the country, employed 36,813 full-time officers in 1996.

troops to Albania and the Republic of Macedonia in order to
prevent the escalating Kosovo conflict from spilling over to the
neighboring region.

pressure on Belgrade must also be shored up militarily," said
Kinkel in a statement issued in Bonn Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister also stressed that in case of a
NATO military presence in Albania and Macedonia, Russia should
also be involved in the operations.
</P>

Kinkel on Sunday also called on the U.N. Security Council to
urge the withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo and to deal with

recently.
