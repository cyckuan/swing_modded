<HEADLINE> Workshop on Policy Analysis Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A five-day workshop on policy
analysis and strategic management of public sector reforms
started here today with a call for governments to understand
problems in their context before formulating policies.
</P>
<P>
The workshop seeks to identify ways of improving coordination
between the ministries of finance and public service in policy
formulation and implementation, enable participants to understand
their situations in the context of regional and global trends and
improve policy formulation and management in a rapidly changing
global environment.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 participants drawn from the Southern African
Development Community region are attending the workshop.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper at the workshop, South Africa's Northwest
Province Director General of Administration Job Mokgoro said
there is need for public sector managers to decide which
dimensions of the problem are most important when developing
policies.
</P>
<P>
He said many developing countries continue to face economic
problems while their challenges are compounded by every
diminishing resources which make it difficult for state
departments to implement policy reforms.
</P>
<P>
He stressed, ''there is deterioration of prioritization of
development programs and projects yet implementing policy reforms
requires a comprehensive approach and not quick fixes.''

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Environment
Minister Yeo Cheow Tong will attend the 7th ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Ministerial Meeting on the Environment in
Jakarta, Indonesia on Tuesday, the Ministry of the Environment
said today.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the worsening haze pollution problem
will top the agenda of the meeting to be hosted by Indonesia's
State Minister of Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ministry of Environment said the meeting,
held once every three years, would also discuss international
environment conventions and long-term environmental quality goals
for the ASEAN, which now groups Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
Singapore, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will discuss environmental issues of common
interest and concern to the region, which will include
transboundary haze pollution, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, haze caused by forest fires and land cleaning
fires in Indonesia has worsened in the past two days while
Malaysia has declared the heavy haze, which has reached very
unhealthy level in the country, a national disaster.

<HEADLINE> French PM Agrees on Privatization in Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin today said he does not oppose privatizing state enterprises
if it is the only way to protect France's national interests.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde, Jospin said he would
not in principle reject the disengagement of the state from public
enterprises to become a "minority stock holder."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the public listing of state
enterprises' stocks will be guided "by industrial strategy" and
not "in the name of an ideological priority."
</P>
<P>
The government, the Socialist premier said, will only maintain
public enterprises which "exercise its activity with a mission of
public service in a non-competitive field."
</P>
<P>
In some industries, "it could be absolutely indispensable to
establish powerful groups by renewing alliances (with other
European groups)," he noted.
</P>
<P>
France is seeking to build pan-European defense and aeronautics
groups with private German and British groups to compete with
dominant U.S. groups.
</P>
<P>
The public listing of stocks of state enterprises, such as the
defense electronics giant Thompson CSF and the aerospace group
Aerospatiale, is expected.
</P>
<P>
Like most continental European countries, France has maintained
state control over railway and city transport and energy
industries.
</P>
<P>
The government has lately opened part of the telecommunication
market by selling 20 percent stocks of the state monopoly France
Telecom.
</P>
<P>
In his latest statement, Jospin also mentioned air transport
services as a possible area for privatization.
</P>
<P>
But a dispute over whether to privatize Air France between the
government and the company's management led to the recent
resignation of Christian Blanc, president of the national
carrier.

<HEADLINE> German Central Bank Raises Fears about Rate Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell today to
its lowest level against the German mark in more than two months
as the German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer fanned
speculations that the bank might raise German interest rates in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of insurers in the western German city of
Wiesbaden, Tietmeyer said it is "theoretically possible" that
Germany might raise key interest rates ahead of May next year when
the European Union is due to make the decision on which countries
would be able to join the planned single currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
After his remarks the dollar sank to 1.7645 marks at Monday's
fixing in Frankfurt, compared with 1.7829 marks on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Money traders said that Tietmeyer had unleashed additional
pressure on the markets which had already been alerted by the
announcement of the German Federal Statistics Office on Monday
that Germany's wholesale prices increased sharply by 3.3 percent
in August after a 2.0 percent increase in July.

<HEADLINE> US Business Economists See Stable Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economy is likely to
grow at an average quarterly rate of 2.4 percent over the next
four quarters, a survey by the U.S. National Association For
Business Economics (NABE) said today.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three professional economic forecasters of the NABE
predicted that the U.S. output of goods and services will rise 3.4
percent this year, reflecting the sizzling 4.9 percent rate of the
January-March quarter, and 2.3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
The results of the latest poll were released at the
organization's annual meeting in New Orleans today and made
available in the U.S. capital.
</P>
<P>
The business economists also predicted that inflation will
remain tame, rising just 2.2 percent this year and 2.8 percent in
1998. The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose 3.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
They also expect to see an interest rate increase to insure
against an acceleration of inflation late this year although top
economic forecasters are confident the economy will not exceed the
speed limit set by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told the U.S. Congress earlier this
Summer that the U.S. economy's performance was "exceptional," with
low unemployment and low inflation. He said the central bank
expected growth to range between 3 percent and 3.25 percent this
year and between 2 percent and 2.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is predicting rises of 3.5 percent
in 1997 and 2 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressional Budget Office also sees 3.4 percent
growth this year and 2.1 percent next year.

<HEADLINE>   France Reduces Public Deficit by Billions in One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- France's public deficit was
down to 258.8 billion francs (about 43 billion U.S. dollars) by
the end of July, 13.8 billion francs (2.3 billion dollars) less
than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the public deficit was only 202.3 billion francs (33.6
billion dollars) by the end of June, said the French Ministry of
Finance, which did not explain why the deficit rose by 50 billion
francs in July.
</P>
<P>
State income increased by 2.7 percent last month as compared to
July 1996, more than the 2.6 percent increase predicted by the
1997 budget law passed under the former right-wing government.
</P>
<P>
The newly imposed 15 percent corporate tax increase had brought
the state 82.6 billion francs (12.1 billion dollars) more of state
income by June as compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
This year's state expenditure by the end of July increased to
950.8 billion francs (158 billion dollars), a 0.5 percent rise
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary spendings in civil and military fields decreased by
1.8 percent and 3.7 percent, while investments in both fields fell
by 13.1 percent and 8.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Water Conference Opens in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Second Southern African
Conference on Water Environment started here today with a theme
of "Water Security: Guarding Resources Against Pollution and
Drought".
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference will underscore the need to utilize
and manage water resources in a sustainable manner.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the British government, embodies
the 5th Exhibition of Water and Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 companies and institutions are represented at
the conference with more than 50 coming from Europe, the United
States and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda are river basin management, water
conversation, ground water, water economics, demand and pollution
control and private sector participation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Minister of Rural Resources and Water Development
Jyce Mururu said at the opening ceremony that the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) still has a lot to do in
terms of infrastructure development and management of scarce
water resources for sustainable development to be achieved in the
region.
</P>
<P>
She said the conference was being held against the background
of the lack of development, scarce water resources and growing
population pressures in the rural areas, which has raised the
demand for water especially in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
"The scarcity of water has created economic, political,
social, technical and managerial problems," the minister
stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to Mururu, traumatic droughts in the region raised
the need for regional leaders to put water issues in the
forefront as they have impact on almost very aspect of
development.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the SADC protocol on shared water course
systems, she said, would greatly enhance collaborations between
countries in the region on matters of water utilization and
management.
</P>
<P>
The protocol signed in 1995 is expected to become operational
this year.

<HEADLINE> Intel to Enhance PCs with Video Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. the world's
leading semiconductor maker, is stepping up efforts to get home
personal-computer users hooked on video.
</P>
<P>
The company announced today that the product, called the Create
and Share Camera Pack, is an easy-to-use, all-in-one PC
communications, photo and video editing package that plugs into
Pentium processor-based high-performance PCs. At a price of a few
hundred U.S. dollars, the package includes a video camera and
image-processing hardware that can be used as a video phone. It
also offers a variety of software for sending images over the
Internet or turning snapshots into greeting cards or calendars.
</P>
<P>
Though hardly a new concept, Intel's move exemplifies its
determination to promote new uses of personal computers that
require powerful chips, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Intel began selling video-phone products in 1994, and consumers
have generally found them to be too expensive and too poor in
visual quality. For one thing, video uses more data than can be
easily fed through a typical phone line. Because of delays and
compression techniques, images often looked jerky, cartoon-like
and blurry.
</P>
<P>
Faster computers, using chips such as Intel's Pentium MMX and
Pentium II microprocessors, are now better at compressing and
playing video images, according to experts of the company.
</P>
<P>
A company manager predicted that sales of video phone cameras
will triple to 1 million this year, and sales of software and
hardware will grow to 10 million U.S. dollars by 1999.

<HEADLINE> France Asks Israel to Step Up Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- France today asked Israel to
"go further" in making peace with the Palestinians, and the
Israeli army to "proceed significant redeployments" in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage the Israeli government to go further, to present
other concrete measures and then give back the form to the peace
process," said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman appealed to Israeli authorities to impose a
complete freeze on Jewish housing projects in Arab lands, stop
seizing Arab lands and destroying the Arabs' houses, stop
confiscating identity cards of Palestinians, and stop other
"unilateral acts" which could twist the results of the final talks
on the status of the Palestinian autonomous territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel decided Sunday to lift step by step its blockade of the
Palestinian territories, give back some tax fund to Palestinians
and veto a new housing project in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"These small steps should be followed up by the relaunch of a
real peace process which needs to be dynamic, needs a vision for
the future, a confidence established that we appeal from our
heart," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He was echoing an earlier comment by French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine on Radio Europe 1 today, in which the minister said
the Israeli decisions made Sunday were "small steps" and that his
severe criticism of Israel last Friday was an "appeal from his
heart."
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented attack upon Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu last Friday, Vedrine accused Israel of adopting a
"catastrophic policy" toward Palestinians, which had driven the
latter to the "unprecedented level of exasperation and despair."
</P>
<P>
"The status quo is not defensible. One should go out of the
present vicious circle which gives terrorism the right of veto to
the peace process," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Palestinian authorities to fight terrorism,
but stressed that Israel should take "necessary measures to
appease tension."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman praised U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright for her peace mission in the Middle East last week, and
said that France and its European partners are willing to join the
U.S. efforts and to help implement all intermediary peace
agreements between Israel and Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Razali Calls for Real Efforts for UN Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Razali Ismail,
President of the 51st General Assembly of the United Nations,
today called on member states to unite and make real efforts for
the on-going reforms and strengthening of the world body.
</P>
<P>
In a closing address, Razali said that U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan's reform package put forward in mid-July "deserves our
full and expeditious attention without being casualty to
politics."
</P>
<P>
"The task of strengthening the UN will depend in large part on
the UN's ability to adapt to change, beyond creeping incremental
adjustments," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the UN "will not be strengthened if reform
only concentrate on cost-effectiveness, efficiency and better
coordination," adding that such objectives alone would divert
attention from the UN's real functions and Charter
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"If the UN is to survive, it has to transform itself from an
organization serving only the interests of states to one serving
the interests of peoples living in an interdependent and global
society," Razali pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The 51st session of the UN General Assembly will close after
its final meeting on Monday. The 52nd annual session is going to
open on Tuesday with its focus on overhauling the UN machinery.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who came to office on January 1, 1997, has since been
making reform efforts to enable the world body to better confront
the challenges of the new millenium.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that the leaders will come to the Assembly
convinced that the most important issue before them is reform,"
the Secretary-General told a recent press conference.

<HEADLINE> UK Primary Teachers to Be Retrained over Literacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- All of Britain's primary
school teachers will be retrained by local authority instructors
in order to grasp government methods for teaching reading and
writing, according to a government report today.
</P>
<P>
The report, the Implementation of the National Literacy
Strategy, by the government's Literacy Task Force said that
standards of teaching were "unacceptably haphazard" and that
failed teaching methods lay at the heart of children's literacy
problems.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, which will be overseen by 200 new
government-funded literacy consultants, all primary school
teachers will receive several days training over the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is reported that nearly 40,000 primary school
headteachers and governors are to be given intensive management
training next year to implement and monitor the drive to improve
literacy standards.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Byers, the school standards minister, heralded the
measures as "a practical agenda for action". However, teacher
unions are sceptical about government claims that these measures
will help raise standards.

<HEADLINE> Razali Criticizes Blind Unilateralism in UN Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The President of the
51st session of the United Nations General Assembly, Razali
Ismail, Monday criticized "blind unilateralism" in paying the dues
to the world body.
</P>
<P>
"Blind unilateralism will be the undoing of the UN," Razali
warned in a closing address to the 51st session.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 51st session had made remarkable achievements
in advancing the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and
reforming the organization.
</P>
<P>
"The most disappointing and perhaps the most crucial piece of
unfinished business of the 51st session is the continuing
stalemate over the issue of payment of arrears and of restoring
fiscal stability to the organization," the President pinted out.
</P>
<P>
He said that financial crippling of the U.N. continued to
obstruct the momentum for reform.
</P>
<P>
"Arguments about complicated legislative procedures, attaching
arbitrary conditions to payments and using the media to cast a
different version do not reduce what is simple a solemn treaty
obligation," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and observers believed that Razali was implying
the United States for its tough conditions to the payments of its
arrears reportedly more than 1.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A reduction in U.S. dues is one of the conditions the
Republican-controlled U.S. Congress has set for paying the
arrears.
</P>
<P>
But most other U.N. members, including Washington's allies,
resent the placing of any conditions on payments they say the
United States is treaty-bound to make.

<HEADLINE> Kidnapped WFP Aid Worker Released in Somali </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The abduction of Idiris
Mohamed Osman, an aid worker from the World Food Program (WFP) in
the Somali capital ended peacefully Sunday night after the
intervention of community elders and officials from WFP.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Salah Garad Omar, a Somali official from the WFP who
was flown from Nairobi for the release efforts, said with the
help of the elders, the abduction of Osman ended without the
payment of any kind of ransom.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about those who kidnapped Osman, Garad blamed
militiamen loyal to the local non-governmental organization
(NGO), Green Hope, for being behind the abduction.
</P>
<P>
According to Garad, Osman was abducted so as to settle
differences among the Green Hope officials who maintained a
relationship with WFP.
</P>
<P>
"They thought Osman could solve their problem in that way," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Osman, who was kidnapped three days ago in South Mogadishu,
looked healthy but humbly dressed with a scarf round his neck,
and said he was treated fairly well.
</P>
<P>
Speaking briefly to the press at the WFP office in South
Mogadishu this morning, Osman said despite the deprived freedom,
he was fed well and faced no torture in the house near K-4 of
South Mogadishu where he was kept out of sight.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his agency's latest activities, Osman said WFP
was supplying dry food to the famine and drought stricken regions
of Bay, Bakol and Lower Jubba, where convoys of dry food rations
were distributed to the poor.
</P>
<P>
The agency has also been paying for work rations to teachers
and voluntary health workers in the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the faction led by Hussein Mohamed Aidid who
controls south Mogadishu, has also condemned the abduction of
Osman, warning that no more such activities will be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has had no effective government since president
Mohamed Siad Barre was toppled in 1991, and the Horn of African
country is divided between a range of armed factions.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Qanyare Afrah, interior secretary for Hussein Aidid,
said today that they have arranged new strong forces to combat
the crimes being committed in the streets of Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Barclays Evolves New Unit Trust Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) - Barclays bank is evolving a new
strategy for its 6 billion pounds (8 billion US dollars) unit
trust business, according to an announcement by the bank here
today.
</P>
<P>
On September 29, the bank will retitle its unit trust operation
Barclays Funds Limited and introduce its new management.
</P>
<P>
The unit trust industry is overrun by product proliferation
and, from September 29, Barclays Funds Limited is introducing a
new simplified fund range called Barclays Investment Portfolios to
be available through Barclays branches and the Bank's own
salesforce.
</P>
<P>
The range will include an income fund, a fund of funds focused
on Growth and a balanced fund of funds for income and growth.
</P>
<P>
The bank was previously committed to selling its funds through
its 1,200 branches and is the biggest unit trust manager among the
high-street clearers.
</P>
<P>
The move confirms the growing role of IFAs - independent
salesmen typically working for commission - in distributing the
products of financial services companies.
</P>
<P>
The UK's 22,000 IFAs have boosted their share of sales of both
unit trusts and life and pensions policies in recent year.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Time said: "Their success has confounded
widespread predictions that many would be forced out of business
by competition from banks, such as Barclays."

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada wants to create a
permanent high-seas enforcement program designed to conserve
Atlantic fish stocks, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
This will top Canada's agenda this week at a meeting of an
international fishing organization.
</P>
<P>
Canada hopes a permanent agreement will be in place to ensure
there are observers on every fishing vessel and satellite tracking
of a percentage of fleets to prevent overfishing, said the
Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
</P>
<P>
Other issues to be decided at the week-long meeting include
establishing quotas for the 12 fish stocks that are found beyond
Canada's 200-nautical-mile limit, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) members
carried out a two-year pilot project after the turbot war between
Canada and the EU in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Since the project began, the number of infractions detected by
Canadian inspectors has decreased by over two-thirds.

<HEADLINE> GCC Urges U.S. to Revive Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states concluded their two-day
meeting today, calling on the United States to play its leading
role in putting the Middle East peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
In their final communique issued after the 64th ministerial
meeting, concluded in southern Saudi resort city of Abha, the
foreign ministers said they followed up with concern the
deadlocked Middle East peace process and the deterioration of
living conditions in the occupied Arab territories, according to
reports from Abha by Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the ministers made it clear to the
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright whom they met Sunday
before starting the meeting that they hope the U.S. help push the
peace process back to its normal track.
</P>
<P>
They said the GCC's continued support to the peace process
was conditional to the Israeli government's commitment to the
agreements it signed with the Arab states.
</P>
<P>
They called on Israel to remain committed to the
land-for-peace principle, U.N. resolutions and withdrawal from the
occupied Syrian Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Regarding GCC's relations with Iran, the communique said that
the ministers discussed the Gulf-Iranian ties and hoped that the
coming phase would witness confidence building measures for
realizing regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
It said the GCC countries underlined its unwavering stance to
forge good ties with Iran that hinge on good neighborly ties,
mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs of other
states.
</P>
<P>
The ministers referred in particular to the "positive
statements" of the new Iranian President Mohammad Khatami who
said that his country would open a new page in relations with the
Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministers underlined in the communique their
support to the UAE' sovereignty over the three Islands of Abu
Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs which are currently occupied by
Iran.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also called on Iraq to implement all U.N. Security
Council resolutions related to its 1990 aggression of
Kuwait. "This is the only way for lifting the sanctions imposed
by the Security Council on Iraq," they said.
</P>
<P>
As to the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal which allows Iraq to sell
2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to purchase
medicine and food for the Iraqi people suffering under the U.N.
sanctions, the ministers welcomed the U.N. speedy approval for the
second six months in June.
</P>
<P>
They also underscored the need to safeguard Iraq's
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
On their internal process to the unification of customs
tariffs, the ministers expressed content with the steps already
taken by the Products Classification Committee which has so far
finalized the classification of almost 94.5 percent of the listed
products needed for the final stage of unification.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Praises Albright's Visit as Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said today that U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's commitment to the peace process will
help move it forward.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the statement after a "very significant and
positive" meeting with President Hosni Mubarak in Egypt's
Mediterranean city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he and Mubarak assessed the results of Albright's
first tour in the region since she took office early this year and
all other issues related to the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Albright's visit created a new fact that is more positive than
the previous period," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Albright had clearly adhered to all principles
adopted by the Madrid peace conference including the "land for
peace" principle as well as U.N. resolutions 242 and 338.
</P>
<P>
The top American diplomat urged Israel to refrain from taking
unilateral actions, namely confiscation of Arab lands, expansion
of Jewish settlements, demolition of Palestinian houses and
withholding of tax revenues, said the PNA leader.
</P>
<P>
"She also underlined the U.S. government's commitment to the
peace process and the Oslo agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright visited the Palestinian self-rule area and Egypt
during her multi-leg trip to the Mideast that began on September
10.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat criticized the Israeli government for
obstructing the peace process and refusing to implement the
agreements it signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to safeguard the outcome
of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on Palestinian self-rule in
the interim period signed in Washington in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that Israel faithfully implements the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements signed under the American and
European guardianship," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he informed Mubarak of the situation in the
Palestinian self-rule areas under the Israeli punitive measures
imposed in the wake of a series of suicide bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's meeting were Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa, Mubarak's political adviser Osama el-Baz, Secretary
General of the Palestine Liberation Organization Executive
Committee Mahmoud Abbas, PNA Local Government Minister Saeb
Erekat, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on today's meeting between Arafat and Mubarak, PNA
Minister of Higher Education Hanan Ashrawi said it will help come
up with a unified Arab discourse in the face of future
developments in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi threw cold water on the agreed meeting between
Palestinian and Israeli officials in Washington, which is seen as
a "minor step" achieved by Albright's shuttle diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
"The coming Washington talks will be dedicated to finding means
to resume peace talks without actually delving into vital issues
in the negotiations themselves," she said.
</P>
<P>
Now that Albright proved unable to make any changes in the
Israeli mentality, Ashrawi cautioned, the causes of crisis in the
Mideast region continue to exist.
</P>
<P>
Albright announced last Friday that senior advisors of Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet in
Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this month, Arafat's assistant Abbas will hold
talks in New York with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy on
means to move forward the Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks stalled in March over a new
Jewish settlement project in traditional Arab East Jerusalem,
which the Palestinians want as their future capital. The string of
suicide bombings in Jerusalem since end of July has fueled the
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Reiterates Desire to Develop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has expressed his country's desire to develop relations
with Iraq, asserting Turkey's firm policy of safeguarding Iraq's
independence and territorial Integrity.
</P>
<P>
This statement is incorporated in a verbal message from Demirel
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, conveyed by the visiting
Turkish presidential envoy Anwar Oyman, who is also Turkey's
deputy foreign minister, at his meeting today with Ezza Ibrahim,
vice president of the Iraqi Revolution Command Council.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, who arrived in Baghdad on Sunday evening, asserted
during the meeting the importance of enhancing and upgrading
relations between Iraq and Turkey to meet the expectations of the
two Muslim peoples, the Iraqi news Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed matters of mutual concern as well as
their genuine desire to serve the common interests of the two
countries, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources here, the Turkish envoy is
expected to discuss with officials of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry
the developments of the abnormal situation in north Iraq,
promotion of trade relations within the framework of the
oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the U.N., as well as other
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has called upon the Turkish government to
reconsider its relations with Iraq, particularly with regard to
Turkish policy towards north Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey launched a cross-border military operation in northern
Iraq on May 14 to attack the military bases of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) of Turkey, who has been fought a
13-year separatist war to establish an independent state in
southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Drops in Botswana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has witnessed
a decline in its inflation rate for three successive months and
the lowest increase in the cost of living index for almost eight
years, the country's Central Statistics Office reported today.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year inflation has dropped from 8.9 percent in July to
8.5 percent in August, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Index for the cost of living rose by only 0.2 percent, the
lowest monthly increase since November 1989.
</P>
<P>
At the end of August, the index stood at 106.8 percent, up
from 106.6 in July. The base is 100 as in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The small increase in the cost of living index is attributed
to price reductions in petrol and diesel.
</P>
<P>
The petrol price dropped by eight Thebe (about two cents) per
liter and diesel by four Thebe (about one cent). These changes
have resulted in a drop in the fuel and power sub-index by 1.1
percent.

LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in
Europe all made solid gains and ended strongly today, boosted by
Wall Street's surge Friday and its strong opening on Monday.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market ended 54.7 points or 1.13
percent higher at 4,902.9, strengthened by a strong performance on
Wall Street and gilts.
</P>
<P>
However, trading volumes were thin as some investors were
sidelined ahead of economic pointers due out this week. Meanwhile,
market sentiment was dominated by doubts over how robust Wall
Street's rise was.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index of German shares on the Frankfurt market,
which ends before Wall Street opens, ended 34.68 points weaker at
3,820.13 after Bundesbank chief Hans Tietmeyer helped to fuel rate
hike speculation.
</P>
<P>
Tietmeyer hinted at an increase following stronger-than-
expected wholesale prices data.
</P>
<P>
However, in post-bourse electronic trading the IBIS DAX index
rose in line with Wall Street and was also helped by the dollar's
recovery. The index closed 72.92 points higher at 3,869.53.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse also ended sharply higher, with the CAC-40
index up 64.55 points at 2,898.62, after the Bank of France said
it was leaving its key intervention rate unchanged at 3.1 percent.

LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government
announced today that it will cancel up to 132 million pounds
(about 212 million U.S. dollars) in debts owed by some poor
Commonwealth countries.
</P>
<P>
Britain's International Development Secretary Clare Short said
in a statement issued here today that she hoped Britain's move
would encourage other donor countries to consider new initiatives
to ease the burden of the world's poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries who are committed to poverty elimination
are in part hampered by their debt burden. We want to support
these countries in their efforts to improve the lives of poor
people," she said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Short stressed that this program would depend on the
country "pursuing good government, encouraging transparency, and
applying economic policies which benefit the poor and encourage
sustainable economic development."
</P>
<P>
Countries including most Caribbean nations and African states
are likely to benefit from the new drive.

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has decided to allow 93
Iranian citizens living in the United States to come to visit
Shiite Muslim holy shrines in Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Tourism Authority has authorized the granting of
entry visas to 93 Iranian passport holders, INA said.
</P>
<P>
They are the first batch of overseas Iranians permitted to
enter Iraq for pilgrimage under an instruction by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Shiites and Sunnis are the two major factions of Islam. Iran is
the only Shiite-dominated country in the region but the most
important Shiite shrines are in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war from 1980-88 and are
still at odds with each other.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has recently decided to allow Iranian
expatriates to visit Iraq through the Qadesia checkpoint on the
Iraqi-Jordanian border and El-walid checkpoint on the Iraqi-Syrian
border.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Baghdad invitation for Iranian pilgrims to visit
holy shrines in Iraq was brushed off by Tehran, which insisted
that negotiations be conducted first to make proper arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriot Leaders to Discuss Security: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will meet soon to
discuss security issues, a top U.S. official announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright was quoted by
Cyprus News Agency as speaking at Larnaca Airport, where she was
on a quick stop-over from Lebanon on her way back to Washington,
that both Clerides and Denktash have informed the U.S. of "their
willingness to meet soon to discuss security issues".
</P>
<P>
Albright described the development as "a substantial step",
that would help reduce tension and improve the overall atmosphere
for serious negotiations to tackle the core issues of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
"Today's agreement represents a significant step in the right
direction," Albright said, adding that it "symbolizes the same
spirit to settle differences peacefully and not through the
threat of force", citing as a similar example the agreement
reached between the leaderships of Greece and Turkey in Madrid
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed the commitment of President Bill clinton to
a resolution of the Cyprus problem, citing the appointment of
Richard Holbrooke as Presidential envoy for Cyprus as "concrete
manifestation of the American commitment to use all resources
at our disposal to help the people of Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
The date of the Clerides-Denktash meeting has not been set
yet, according to the U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the U.S. looks forward to the further reduction
of tensions through the talks that herself, Ambassador Holbrooke,
Assistant Secretary Marc Grossman and U.S. special coordinator for
Cyprus Thomas Miller, will be consulting next week in New York
with officials from the region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Coordinator Miller also left here this evening after a
four-day visit to the island during which he discussed the
Cyprus problem with President Clerides and Denktash. He also had
meetings with U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus, Gustave
Feissel and other foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Miller's tour in the region, which also took him to
Ankara and Athens, was aimed at making preparations for a
visit to the region by U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus
Holbrooke, scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkey sent troops and took
over the northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Several EU Members Insist on Institutional Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Several member states of the
European Union (EU), including France, here today insisted on the
necessity of an institutional reform of the EU before its planned
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
"There should be absolutely an institutional reform before the
expansion," French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said at a
council meeting of the 15 EU foreign ministers held in Brussels
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He added that France did not want to see an enlarged Europe
which however could not function normally.
</P>
<P>
At the Amsterdam EU summit held last June, the leaders of the
15 EU member nations failed to reach an accord on the EU's
institutional reform but decided to postpone the issue until the
first wave of eastward expansion which could happen at the latest
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
France, Italy and Belgium demanded a rapid institutional reform
in a declaration issued at the meeting Monday. The declaration
will be submitted to the other member states on the occasion of
the signature on October 2 in Amsterdam of the adopted treaty at
the Amsterdam summit in June.
</P>
<P>
The three countries note in the declaration that the Amsterdam
treaty did not respond to the necessity of "substantial progress"
regarding the reinforcement of the EU institutions.
</P>
<P>
They also said in the declaration that "such a reinforcement is
an indispensable condition of the conclusion of the first round of
accession talks" scheduled to start at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, if it is only signed by the three countries,
will be annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty. Austria and Luxembourg,
which are for the EU's institutional reform, are also expected to
sign the declaration.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the European institutions will deal with the
redefinition of the composition of the European Commission and the
extension of vote to qualified majority on sensitive subjects like
justice and internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Germany is reportedly opposed to the reform, particularly on
the extension of vote to qualified majority on issues such as
immigration.

<HEADLINE> Highest Inflation Hits Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The highest inflation rate
since 1993/94 financial year has hit Uganda due to drought which
has caused country-wide famine and a rise in food prices,
reported local daily "The Monitor" today.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's inflation which had been contained at single-digit
level for a long period of time, shot to a high of 11.8 percent
in May this year and was recorded at 10.1 percent by June before
it slightly dropped to 9.6 percent and 8.9 percent for July and
August respectively.
</P>
<P>
The above position, described as the worst in two years by a
senior economist at the Ministry of Finance last week, doubled
the inflation level recorded during the same period in the
1995/96 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The end of June 1993/94 financial year saw inflation at 16.1
percent, while a low of 3.4 percent was recorded for June 1995
and 5.4 percent for June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The economist said, "The current 8.9 inflation rate isn't
something to smile about" as the targeted and acceptable
inflation level for the economy should be at 5 percent a year.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Expresses Opposition over Settlers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today expressed his opposition to Jewish
settlers' move into an Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The settlers' move was not good for Israel, Netanyahu said at
a news conference. His remark came after 15 settlers moved into
two houses in Ras Amud, a mostly Arab neighborhood, Sunday night.
Their presence sparked a violent Palestinian protest.
</P>
<P>
"We believe what is happening in Ras Amud is not good for
Jerusalem, not good for the state of Israel," Netanyahu said,
adding that all policies relating to the Jerusalem issue should
be guided by the government instead of by private initiatives.
</P>
<P>
He said while he respected the property rights of
individuals, the Ras Amud issue was very sensitive and should be
dealt with by the government only. "We think, on sensitive
issues, we should be the ones who are making decisions," he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu failed to announce what actions the government
would take against the three settler families. He said he could
only act within the law, implying he might seek legal means to
handle this thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai expressed surprise
over the settlers' motives by moving into Ras Amud. Appearing
before the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, he said the latest incident could be exploited by
those who wanted to ignite the already tense situation.
</P>
<P>
A heavy presence of Israeli police in the Ras Amud was
deployed to prevent possible outbreak of widespread Palestinian
protests and violence. Still, some Palestinian youths threw
stones at the buildings housing the 15 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority's (PNA) Minister for Jerusalem
Affairs Faisal Husseini, who visited the site this morning,
demanded the Israeli government act to remove the settlers. He
warned about the explosion of the situation if the settlers
remain living in the mostly Arab neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there will be a decision, but not to take now and
this moment," he said, implying that the Palestinians could
choose violence to counter the provocation by Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli opposition leaders tightened their pressure
on the government to remove the settlers from Ras Amud.
</P>
<P>
Labor leader Ehud Barak said that if he were the prime
minister, he would have consulted with security and judicial
officials to find a proper way to evict the settlers. He warned
that the new settlement would create a serious danger to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid held Netanyahu responsible for the
incident, echoing the media reports that Netanyahu knew about
the settlers' plan before they moved into Ras Amud. He added
that he was waiting for a strong reaction from the United States
to oppose the settlers' action.
</P>
<P>
The settlers took the action after a committee of the Interior
Ministry cleared the last legal barrier for a go-ahead of the Ras
Amud housing project, in which U.S. millionaire developer Irving
Moscowitz plans to build 70 housing units for the Jews.
</P>
<P>
In the light of the current tension between Israel and the
PNA, the Israeli government is expected to halt the Ras Amud
project at the stage. Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein has
been asked to study the legal possibility of blocking the
project by invoking state security and public order.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Benefits From IMF's Debt-Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will benefit
from a debt-relief initiative of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the country's Finance Minister
Tomas Salomao said today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement over the debt-relief issue was a result of
Mozambique's commitment to meet three conditions to be eligible
under the world's highly-indebted poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The criteria were that Mozambique was defined as a poor
country and its foreign debt of nearly six billion U.S. Dollars
was unmanageable, said Salomao.
</P>
<P>
The third condition was good performance shown by President
Joaquim Chissano's administration to introduce and implement
structural adjustment programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The most visible results of these efforts were a sharp decline
in the inflation rate and an impressive stability of the
Mozambican currency, the Metical, Salomao said.
</P>
<P>
Creditors had recognized Mozambique's debt burden was a severe
obstacle to the development of the southern African nation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, debt payments take up about one-third of the
country's revenue, while debt service runs at 30 percent of its
yearly export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is carrying out a major reconstruction plan
following 17 years of civil war, which killed at least one
million people and destroyed basic infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Asked to Clarify Stand on Monarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has been asked to clarify his stand on the issue whether
the country should cut its ties with the British monarchy.
</P>
<P>
John Aimers, head of the Monarchy League of Canada, wrote to
Chretien, demanding to known on whose behalf Industry Minister
John Manley was speaking when he called for an end to British
queen's role in Canadian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is also asked to clarify his own position on the
monarchy, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister Manley said last week that it is probably time for
Canadians to say good-bye to the British monarchy.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Chretien's office ruled out any possibility of
looking at a constitutional change relating to the monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Aimers stressed that if Chretien doesn't respond, his
organization will have to take further actions.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the monarchy issue is only a blip on a
busy screen of national issues that need to be dealt with, and is
likely to be ignored by most Canadians.
</P>
<P>
However, Minister Manley's public views may indicate that the
monarchy is falling into disfavor with traditional supporters
here in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The British monarchy belongs in the past. "We are a mature
nation and it is time that we accept sole responsibility for our
country's future," a reader wrote in a local newspaper.

<HEADLINE> EU Foreign Ministers Discuss Expansion Name List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the
15 EU (European Union) member states here today discussed the name
list of the countries which could be invited to talks on the EU's
first wave of eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the ministers met to have in-depth
talks on the Agenda 2000 policy blueprint unveiled in July by the
EU's executive body, the European Commission, which picked up only
half of the 10 eastern European applicants as suitable countries
to participate in the accession talks scheduled for early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The five countries, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovenia and Estonia, are expected to join Cyprus in for talks for
the EU's most ambitious expansion yet.
</P>
<P>
The five others -- Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria -- were deemed as inadequate in their preparations for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
Voicing concerns about creating a new curtain between east and
west, Sweden, Denmark and Italy, favor opening talks with the 10
countries at the same time. But a final decision waits to be made
until an EU summit in Luxembourg in December.
</P>
<P>
EU sources were quoted as saying that foreign ministers were
also likely to condemn Belarus for failing to launch political
reforms and to suspend EU participation in talks between the
government of President Aleksander Lukashenko and his opponents.

<HEADLINE> France Backs Mediation by Arab League in Comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its
support to the forthcoming mediation by the Arab League in the
Indian Ocean island nation of Comoros, which is in the midst of a
crisis between the central government and two separatist islands
of Anjouan and Moheli.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of Cooperation Charles Josselin said that
France keeps a "diplomatic posture" in the on-going conflict in
the Comoros, and does not want to get involved in the
"institutional debate" of the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
"There is a fact, which is the Islamic Federal Republic of the
Comoros and it is up to all the Comorans to find a solution,"
said Josselin at a press conference on French aid to Comoros.
</P>
<P>
An envoy of the Arab League, Mohammad al-Khazindar, will begin
his mediation for the Comoros on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He will first pay a visit to the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) to seek a coordinated position with it in looking for a
political solution to the crisis, said an Arab League spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The mediation of the OAU has marked the steps, and a new
mission will be conducted by the Arab League. We cannot but
support it,"said Josselin.
</P>
<P>
He said that France will provide an aid to Anjouan and Moheli,
but France alone cannot help the whole archipelago realize what he
called "an ambitious plan of development."
</P>
<P>
"France is ready to participate, with other financial backers,
in particular Europeans, in such a plan of development, without
that such and such part of the archipelago have the impression of
being forgotten," he said.
</P>
<P>
Josselin also said that France is maintaining contact with both
President Abdoulkarim Taki and the separatist government of
"Political-Administrative Coordination of Anjouan."
</P>
<P>
Anjouan and Moheli declared "independence" in early August. A
government military intervention in Anjouan last month resulted in
a fiasco.

<HEADLINE> Weld Gives up Fight for US Ambassadorship to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today agreed to accept the resigning of William Weld, his
nominee for ambassador to Mexico from the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Weld, the moderate Republican nominated by Clinton to be U.S.
ambassador to Mexico in July, announced today that he abandoned
his fight for the post after conservative Sen. Jesse Helms refused
to hold a confirmation hearing on his nomination.
</P>
<P>
In a White House news conference, Weld said, "I asked President
Clinton to withdraw my name... so I can go back to New England,
where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask
it to do its duty."
</P>
<P>
Weld, who resigned from the governorship of Massachusetts last
month, said he would have been nominated if a confirmation hearing
had not been blocked by Helms, the conservative North Carolina
senator he derisively called "that man."
</P>
<P>
Helms, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
refused to reconsider the nomination at a special meeting of the
committee last week.
</P>
<P>
The nomination needs to be first approved before it goes to a
full Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
Weld praised Clinton for fighting on his behalf. "The president
has stood tree-tops tall on this entire matter," Weld said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pressured to Keep Troops in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States was
pressured today to agree to keep its troops in Bosnia beyond next
July in order to guarantee the fragile peace process in the
ethnically-split country.
</P>
<P>
Both Britain and Denmark indicated at a council meeting of EU
foreign ministers held Monday in Brussels that they would like the
U.S. to extend its military presence in Bosnia following the first
post-war municipal elections there at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has reportedly promised the U.S.
Congress to withdraw the NATO-led stabilization force (SFOR) from
the multi-ethnic country next Summer.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said that it would be very
difficult for international forces to leave next year when asked
whether he would support such a move by the United States.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that Britain would only stay on in Bosnia if
the U.S. remained, too. "We need the U.S. presence for our
presence to be safe," Mr. Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Peterson, the current
chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), said he favored extending the military presence of
the U.S. in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Denmark intended to be involved
"continuously" if there were an extended international presence in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He added that without the presence of SFOR, composed by around
37,000 soldiers, the municipal elections would not have been
feasible.
</P>
<P>
Robert Frowick, head of the Bosnia mission of the OSCE,
reportedly said Sunday in Sarajevo that it was totally essential
to have an international military presence in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Cook expressed the hope Monday that the words of Mr.
Frowick as an American would "carry weight in Washington". France
has also earlier made clear that it would not stay if the U.S.
troops left Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Georgia Sign Friendship Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Georgia today
signed a friendship and cooperation agreement with visiting
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnaze hailing the pact as "the
beginning of a new era in relations between the two countries and
their peoples."
</P>
<P>
The pact was signed after Prime Minister Costas Simitis held
talks with Shevardnaze, focusing on bilateral relations, Balkan
issues and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The two men agreed that relations between neighboring countries
should be governed by international law, international treaties
and resolution of problems be guided by United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Simitis regarded the
visit by Shevardnaze to Greece as an indication that Greek foreign
policy had yet another "pole", that of the Black sea and the
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Greek-Georgian relations had become steadily stronger over the
past five years, he said, stressing that Athens intended to expand
its ties with Georgia, especially in the trade sector.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Shevardnaze said that his talks with Greek
leaders had focused on sectors which held promise for future
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He spoke specifically of the telecommunications and transport
sectors, as well as possibilities of cooperation in ship-building,
farming and banking.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnaze, who arrived here today for a three-day official
visit to Greece, had also held talks with his Greek counterpart
Costis Stephanopoulos today.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, the Georgian president will also meet
with some other Greek officials and will be awarded the Onassis
Foundation's prize for international understanding and social
achievement.

<HEADLINE> Paris Establishes Card Index on Jewish Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The French capital Paris has
been authorized to establish a card index on all the real estate
properties robbed from Jews during the Vichy collaboration period
of early 1940s, Paris Mayor Jean Tiberi said today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has signed a decree allowing Paris
to set up the index which is aimed at "verifying the origins of
property and possible robbing that the owners of the properties
could have been subjected to," said Tiberi.
</P>
<P>
The decree only covers the Paris area of Prefecture of Seine
where many Jews were robbed of their properties and sent to
Germany to get killed during World War II.
</P>
<P>
A state advisor Noel Chahid Nourai, who is president of the
Council of Patrimony Charged with the Inventory and Filing of
1,389 apartments in the Paris region, had advised the creation of
the card index.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Municipality was accused last year by journalist
Brigitte Vital-Durand of maintaining many flats which were
originally robbed from Jews during World War II, especially in the
Medieval Marais district of Paris where many Jews live.
</P>
<P>
At the demand of Tiberi, Nourai set up a commission of experts
consisting of representative members of the Jewish community, the
members of the association of former deportees who survived German
concentration camps, historians, jurists, and representatives of
state institutions.
</P>
<P>
According to the French law, the establishment of a card index
on properties of an ethnic minority in France needs the approval
of the government.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Crack Down on Fraud in Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Monday ordered an immediate moratorium on new home health
care providers to allow new regulations to be implemented and to
prevent "fly-by-night providers" from abusing Medicare.
</P>
<P>
In a speech before the Service Employees International Union,
Clinton detailed efforts to put fraudulent providers of
home-health care out of Medicare -- the nation's health care for
the elderly. Currently, Medicare enrolls up to 100 new home health
care agencies a year, the fastest growing part of the system.
</P>
<P>
"First we're going to keep scam and ripoff artists from getting
into the Medicare system in the first place," Clinton said. "These
kind of practices amount to a fraud tax on all the taxpayers of
the country. For those of you who work in health care, they cost
public confidence in the work that you do."
</P>
<P>
During the moratorium, Medicare will enlist no new home-health
care providers, Clinton said. Federal regulators will develop
tougher rules designed to weed out dishonest providers, such as
requiring that they post surety bonds of at least 50,000 dollars,
have a minimum number of patients before enrolling Medicare
patients and submit detailed information on all of the businesses
they own.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Medicare has halted new home health care
providers. The program spends 18 billion dollars a year on home
health care, up from 2.5 billion dollars just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)
will re-enroll home-health care agencies every three years.
Independent audits will be part of that re-enrollment process, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
HCFA will also double the number of audits of home-health care
agencies and increase the number of claims reviews by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a report to Congress last July, government auditors told
Congress that 14 cents of every dollar spent by Medicare was lost
to instances of fraud, abuse or simple error. Home-health care
agencies accounted for 16 percent of overpayments, the report
found.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Warns of Looming Humanitarian Crisis in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) today warned that a humanitarian crisis is imminent
in Sierra Leone unless steps are taken to combat malnutrition and
diseases in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Tony Bloomberg, UNICEF's representative in Sierra Leone, was
quoted by the press as saying in London that regional embargo on
the country should be lifted to allow supplies to be shipped in
from neighboring Guinea or Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we need a proper cross-border operation to prevent a
humanitarian crisis. What we want to avoid is malnutrition and
lots of dying children," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
formally approved sanctions and blockade on Sierra Leone on
August 30 to force out the military government led by Major
Johnny Kromah, which seized power from elected President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah in a coup on May 25.

<HEADLINE> Debris of Missing German, U.S. Army Planes Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Aircraft debris have been found
some 250 kilometers off the Namibian coast two days after a German
and a U.S. military planes went missing in the area over the South
Atlantic, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
German media quoted Namibian air traffic control authorities as
saying on Monday that a Namibian ship had spotted about 20 pieces
of debris, including half a aircraft seat, a piece of a cabin door
and German papers, 255 kilometers northwest of Walvis Bay in
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The German Defence Ministry today also said that a large pool
of oil had been discovered in a nearby area which could be the
crash site of the German aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The German army plane, a Tupolev 154 with 24 people on board,
and a U.S. C-141 transport plane with nine crew members and
passengers went missing at the same time in the South Atlantic
area late Saturday. It was feared that they might have collided in
mid-air.
</P>
<P>
German Defence Ministry spokesman Hans-Dieter Wichter confirmed
that neither of the two missing military planes had been equipped
with collision warning systems. The TU-154 also did not have a
black box to record flight data.
</P>
<P>
The air traffic control authorities of Namibia said Monday that
they had not been informed of the exact landing time and flight
route of the German plane which was due to make a stopover in the
Namibian capital city of Windhoek en route to Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
German navy officials, however, noted that the German plane's
flight plan had already been approved by all relevant authorities.
</P>
<P>
A huge air and see rescue operations are currently underway to
search for wreckage and possible survivors. However, until Monday
evening no survivors or bodies had been found.

<HEADLINE> Pregnant Zambian Students Allowed to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Girls who have been expelled
from schools or colleges in Zambia this year for being pregnant
will be allowed to take the exams to continue their study,
Education Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye said here today.
</P>
<P>
Those girls who wish to continue their study after delivering
their babies will allowed to do so, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while opening the national symposium on
girls' education and taking to national scale of the Program for
the Advancement of Girls Education (PAGE).
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye said the government has taken deliberate affirmative
action in favor of girls and that from this year selections to
grades 8 and 10 will be on an equal basis and will no longer be
in favor of boys.
</P>
<P>
At university level from this year, 25 percent of the state
bursars will go to female students while the remaining 75 percent
will be competed for equally by both female and male students, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"At the level of administration, I want to see more females in
positions of leadership and decision making in the Ministry of
Education," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
"This is important as we can only succeed in the
implementation of our policies in the education of girl-child if
women are represented at all decision making levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, according to Syamujaye, three women were
appointed deputy permanent secretaries at his ministry.
</P>
<P>
He urged the symposium to address the strong misconception
that a woman's place is in the kitchen and that a woman should be
subservient to man as this largely influences the decision when
it comes to girls' education prospects.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the PAGE program to national scale has been made
possible by the Norwegian government which contributed three
million U.S. Dollars to the program.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Premiers Agree to Hold National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Nine of Canada's provincial
premiers has agreed to a framework for public consultations on
national unity, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
After an 11-hour negotiation behind closed doors in Calgary on
Sunday, the premiers came out with guidelines to govern public
consultations, which will initiate this fall and try to wrap up by
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The consultation will result in resolutions, which each
provincial legislature can then pass as a goodwill gesture before
a Quebec election, expected as early as next Spring.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the process may eventually lead to
constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
Yet, they stressed that this can't be accomplished until there
is a federalist government in the French-speaking province of
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Quebec's separatist Premier Lucien Bouchard did not attend the
meeting, which was supposed to last two days but wrapped up in
one.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines recognize Quebec's "unique character", but
insist that all provinces and citizens are equal in Canada.
</P>
<P>
"In Canada's federal system, where respect for diversity and
equality underlies unity, the unique character of Quebec society,
including its French-speaking majority, its culture and its
tradition of civil law, is fundamental to the well-being of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, the legislature and government of Quebec have a
role to protect and develop the unique character of Quebec society
within Canada," the guidelines said.
</P>
<P>
The premier also agreed to a first ministers conference in
November or December on non-constitutional issues such as social
policy, health care and youth employment.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien praised the premiers
today for renewing a call to recognize Quebec's unique
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to congratulate them for their responsible
leadership," Chretien told reporters today.
</P>
<P>
However, the Quebec government dismissed the initiative as less
than the province was offered in the failed Meech Lake and
Charlottetown constitutional accords.
</P>
<P>
"They are even burying the concept of distinct society. Now
they only talk about a vague 'unique character of Quebec'," said
Jacques Brassard, Quebec minister of intergovernmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
The proposals don't satisfy any of Quebec's traditional
demands, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Varsity Stages New Conduct Code for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Authorities of the Lagos State
University (LASU) have rolled out a new code of conduct for
students, banning consumption and use of all alcoholic beverage
and liquor on campus.
</P>
<P>
According to the new LASU code of conduct, any student caught
using or consuming alcoholic beverages or liquor would be
dismissed from the university.
</P>
<P>
A statement containing the code of conduct said the university
authorities would resist any interference on matters of
discipline from whatever quarter.
</P>
<P>
The new rules also re-stated the ban of all secret cults and
confraternities, saying that any student found to be a member,
sponsor or patron of such organizations would be summarily
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
"The possession, carrying or use of arms and dangerous weapons
by students on the campus is, henceforth, banned if any student
found to possess, carry or use such weapons shall be dismissed,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"All students' religious activities, including drumming and
singing, should be restricted to the chapel or Mosque area," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The rules and regulations come at a time of renewed cult
violence at the neighboring University of Lagos, where two
students lost their livers two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Institutions of higher learning in Nigeria have become hotbeds
of cult-related violence since the early 1990s, and authorities
have vowed to curb trend, but with little or no results, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
LASU, established in 1984 with a student intake of 300, now
has 15,000 students.

<HEADLINE> Eleven Million Go Hungry Annually in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- As many as 11 million
Americans go hungry every year, of which two million suffer sever
hunger, according to an Agricultural Department study being
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study defined hunger as not having enough food. Severe
hunger would be when children in the household experience physical
feelings of hunger.
</P>
<P>
The figure did not include an estimated 600,000 homeless
people, according to the study obtained by USA Today.
</P>
<P>
The study is being released as the Agriculture Department
convenes a summit to discuss how to save some of the 96 billion
pounds of food wasted every year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government is reining in the growth of the 22
billion-a-year food stamp program. The move could increase the
ranks of the hungry.
</P>
<P>
Of the nation's 100 million households, about 88 percent have
enough quality food, another eight percent sometimes cannot afford
to eat healthful food, and four percent go hungry at some point
during the year, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The most serious form of hunger, in which children as well as
adults don't have enough to eat, is experienced by about 800,000
households or two million people.
</P>
<P>
The report found hunger is more common in households headed by
women, those with young children, among blacks and Hispanics and
in cities.
</P>
<P>
Today's summit is expected to discuss how to save excess food
for the poor. They are targeting restaurants, hotels,
manufacturers and retail stores that throw food away when it is no
longer fresh enough to sell or when they prepare more than they
need.

<HEADLINE> EU Rich Members Hope to Share Bill More Fairly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
rich members today complained that their contribution to the EU
budget was too heavy and they held out hope that the bill would be
shared more fairly.
</P>
<P>
"Correcting the distribution of contributions to the Union's
budget is an essential part of the future of the EU budget,"
Swedish Foreign minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen said at a meeting of EU
foreign ministers held Monday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
voiced the same view to his counterparts at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the historic Agenda 2000 blueprint unveiled in July by
the European Commission, the EU's executive body, the ceiling of
EU members' contributions would stay at 1.27 percent of gross
domestic product between 2000 and 2006.
</P>
<P>
However, Spain and Portugal indicated at the meeting that it
was far from enough. Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes even
said that he did not intend to lose a cent for his country in the
EU's most ambitious eastward expansion yet scheduled for early
next century.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the moment to make threats, but it's clear the
Spanish government would not accept that enlargement is to the
detriment of the southern countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
British sources said that London would stick to its own rebate
from the EU budget, which was hard won by former Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
But southern countries, including Spain, Portugal and Greece,
are not expected to give up EU funds used to help the economic and
agricultural sectors of their poorer regions.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President to Talk with Denktash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides
will enter a U.S.-proposed dialogue with Turkish Cypriot Leader
Rauf Denktash on security issues, Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
"President Clerides today accepted the proposal by U.S. special
coordinator for Cyprus, Thomas Miller, to start a dialogue with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, in Nicosia, under the
auspices of U.N. resident representative Gustave Feissel,"
Kasoulides said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
The two are to discuss all issues concerning security, without
any pre-conditions or a set agenda, Kasoulides added.
</P>
<P>
"It was proposed that all issues mentioned in recent U.N.
resolution on Cyprus that concern armed forces, armaments and
measures to reduce tension along the demarcation line, should as a
first step be discussed within the framework of a program for the
complete demilitarization of Cyprus," Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Clerides will enter the dialogue
with "a constructive spirit and willingness to promote the
aforesaid goals."
</P>
<P>
The proposed Clerides-Denktash meeting was first announced
earlier today by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who
stopped over in Cyprus on her way back to Washington after a trip
to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Observers here described the proposed meeting as a positive
step toward a Cyprus settlement after the failure of two rounds of
direct talks between the leaders of the two communities in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed on the east Mediterranean island and took
over the northern third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the island as a bi-communal, bi-zonal
federation through peace talks, but no tangible results have so
far been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Political Parties Urged to Ensure Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Women's Movement of
Zambia today urged the political parties to co-exist to ensure
that peace prevails in the country, reported the official Zambia
News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference of the Women's Movement of
Zambia held here, Evelyn Chibesa, chairperson of the
organization's co-ordination committee, said that the movement
was concerned with the deteriorating state of peace throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
She cited the unabated rivalry between the ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) headed by President Frederick chiluba
and the opposition parties which launched a nationwide
disobedience after the 1996 general elections and other kinds of
violence as some of the events that undoubtedly impede the
country's development.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, corruption and riots have been reportedly
increasing in the country and even police officers have been
accused of committing crimes such as robbery and thefts.
</P>
<P>
The women leader appealed to the leaders of all political
parties to uphold their commitments to peace and to desist from
the "divide-and-rule" tactics.
</P>
<P>
Peace is a necessary ingredient in the development of the
country which all organizations, groups, political leaders and
citizens should actively promote and nurture, said Chibesa.
</P>
<P>
She challenged the Zambian women to be in the fore front of
talking and practizing peace.
</P>
<P>
"In this role, you are instruments for peace and have a duty
to influence your husbands toward positive thinkings," she said.
</P>
<P>
Chibesa also appealed to youths to be responsible citizens and
cautioned them against being manipulated and used as
"instruments" of destruction in the country by "selfish"
politicians.

<HEADLINE> More Gold Mine Closures Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's gold producers
will have to close more mines and some companies may go out of
business because of the weak gold price, said a report today.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Canada's gold giant Barrick Gold Corp. said it was
closing half of its 10 mines because of the low gold price.
</P>
<P>
Barrick becomes the first major gold producer to announce mine
closings, and other companies will have to follow suit, according
to today's Globe and Mail newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 22 percent of the world's gold mines have
operating costs above the current gold price of around 324 U.S.
dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
If the price of gold drops closer to 300 dollars an ounce,
nearly one-third of the world's mines will not be economical, the
paper quoted industry consultant Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd.
of London as saying.
</P>
<P>
Here in Canada, Bob Buchan, chief executive officer of Kinross
Gold Corp. of Toronto, believes the industry has hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
Yet, he also expects more mine closures and some companies to
go out of business altogether.
</P>
<P>
On world markets, the gold price has dropped 18 percent over
the last year, largely because of selling by central banks that no
longer view bullion as a critical part of their monetary strategy.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, central banks sold 220 tons of
gold, compared with 72 tons in the same period last year,
according to Gold Fields.
</P>
<P>
The only glimmer of hope for producers is the record demand for
gold for jewelry-making in several Middle Eastern countries and
India.
</P>
<P>
But that demand won't solve the problem of the central banks,
which still have a huge supply of gold and could keep the market
depressed for years, the paper said.

WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States grounded
its stealth fighters today after one of the craft crashed during
an air show in Maryland Sunday and investigations started on the
losses of three military aircraft over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
An Air Force F-117A "Nighthawk" crashed on the skirts of
Baltimore Sunday; a Navy F-A-18 Hornet crashed in Oman and its
pilot was killed; and an Air Force C-141 transport is presumed
lost after a potential mid-air collision with a German military
plane off the coast of Africa.

<P>
Searching was underway for the nine crewmen aboard the U.S.
C-141 Starlifter cargo plane, which was returning to Ascension
Island from Namibia. No wreckage or survivors have been found.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech F-117 crashed during an air show at Middle River,
Maryland, setting two houses on fire and injuring six people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 49th Fighter Wing in New Mexico, home base for
all 53 F-117A fighters, suspended routine flights as a
precautionary measure through today.

The Navy is investigating the crash of the F-A-18 during a
routine training mission about 75 miles (126 km) northeast of the
southern Omani port of Raysut.

<HEADLINE> Wage Gap Expands Between US Men, Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- After nearly two decades
of a narrowing wage gap between men and women in the U.S., it's
now widening again, The New York Times Reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that labor statistics show median weekly
earnings for full-time working women in the country are just under
75 percent of the men's median, down from 77 percent four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Some labor economists have suggested that the gender gap may
have something to do with welfare reform unleashing a flood of
unskilled women on the job market.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts say it is more likely that the numbers reflect
changes in the makeup of the workforce, overall economic trends,
or statistical flukes, than any real reversal of women's workplace
status.
</P>
<P>
But many people warn that it is far too soon to say with any
certainty just what, if anything, the earnings data predict.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1993, U.S. women's median earnings rose from 62
percent of men's to 77 percent. And in the early 1990s, the
narrowing gap was widely trumpeted as evidence of women's greater
opportunities, greater education, and greater work experience --
trends that were predicted to continue indefinitely, edging women
ever closer to pay equity.

<HEADLINE> Govt Willing to Talk with Opposition: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government said
here today it is willing to have dialogue with opposition parties
if they do not set pre-conditions for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Godfrey Miyanda said just talking about
dialogue is not enough and there must be a genuine commitment and
practical steps should be taken to resolve disagreement.
</P>
<P>
He told visiting parliamentarians from the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association (CPA) Britain branch that his country
is capable of solving its own internal political problems without
foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda accused opposition parties of always lobbying for
foreign intervention in the political deadlocks in the country
when a solution can be found internally.
</P>
<P>
The vice president noted that Zambia's ruling party is always
ready for dialogue but adding that the party will not hold talks
if the opposition parties put forth pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's democratic system has been misrepresented in the
foreign press because some opposition party leaders have reported
false and exaggerated information outside the country, he
complained.
</P>
<P>
Miyanda assured the Commonwealth delegation that the
government is committed to the preservation and nurturing of
democratic institutions the Zambian people help to put in place.

<HEADLINE> IMF Okays Third Annual Loan for Bolivia Under ESAF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today announced the approval of the third annual loan
for Bolivia in an amount of about 46 million U.S. dollars under
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF also agreed on an extension of the loan's period
through September 1998 in a bid to support the government's
economic and reform program for 1997 and 1998. The loan will be
disbursed in two equal semiannual installments, the first of which
is available immediately.
</P>
<P>
The economic program for 1997 is designed to reduce inflation
to 7 percent and achieve a GDP growth of 5 percent. There is
likely to be a widening of the external current account deficit to
7.5 percent of GDP in 1997 from 5.1 percent in 1996 due to imports
of intermediate and capital goods rise significantly owing to
investment by capitalized enterprises and the construction of a
gas pipeline to Brazil. Excluding these imports, the deficit would
remain at 2.4 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payment and improve their growth
prospects. The loans carry an interest rate of 0.5 percent and are
repayable over 10 years, with a 5.5 year grace period.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia joined the IMF in December 1945. Its quota is about 171
million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals about 239 million dollars.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican police has
uncovered and destroyed nearly 12,000 illegal firearms since
1995, a police source said today.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Raul Frela said nearly 8,000 hand grenades
and about 14,000 land mines were uncovered and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 8,000 ammunition clips, 378 boxes of
assorted munitions and more than 124,000 rounds of loose
ammunition were also destroyed.
</P>
<P>
An unspecified quantity of explosives, military communication
radios and other materials were also uncovered, Frela noted.
</P>
<P>
Most of the weapons were found in the central province of
Zambezia, he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican and South African police were reportedly
cooperating to dismantle arms hidden during 17 years of civil
war. The hostilities ended with the signing of a peace accord
between the government and the former rebel movement Renamo in
Italy in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Antwerp Stages International Jewelry Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Below-par economic
performance has left its imprint on the 15th international jewelry
trade fair which was being held at Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
Yet exhibition manager Karen Renders today told reporters that
though the size of the annual event shrank as far as the number of
exhibitors was concerned, the three-day show could be described as
grown in the sense of the quantity of quality products.
</P>
<P>
A total of 135 exhibitors showcased their products on 7,500
square meters of floor space. Most exhibitors were from the
Benelux, or Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. But precious
stone carvers and diamond cutters also came from Germany, Italy,
France, Cyprus and as far as from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Renders said that the trade fair was expected to grow in future
as the list of participating countries expanded to include
countries on other continents which are key jewelry designers and
manufacturers, such as Sri Lanka which is an Asian country rich in
precious stones.
</P>
<P>
Exhibition goers, mostly professionals in the trade, spotted
out a couple of new trends, some still in the bud and others in
full resurrection.
</P>
<P>
Color stones, especially bigger ones, are being used more and
more in jewelry making and decoration. So is platinum, or white
gold, the use of which, like stainless steel, is on the rise
again.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition stand was devoted specially to medal titanium
which has so far been closely linked with aerospace industry for
its extremely light weight and extraordinary strength.
</P>
<P>
Apart from rings, ear-rings and bracelets, titanium is also
used to make ear-ring pins for its 100-percent anti-allergy
characteristic.
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Delaide, who won the Jewel Award '97 today, told the
press that visitors were fascinated by artistic presentations via
indigenous yet creative designs. The Antwerp designer won the
trophy last year as well.
</P>
<P>
The three-day trade fair will end Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Accuses U.S. of Undermining Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique has accused
the United States of attempting to undermine efforts to draw up
an international treaty banning anti-personal land-mines.
</P>
<P>
The accusation was made today in the country's capital Maputo
by demonstrators belonging to a group called the Campaign Against
Land-mines outside the U.S embassy, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The group said in a statement that the U.S. government has
abandoned its earlier position to distance itself from
preparations for a ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
It said instead, Washington is proposing a number of
alterations to the draft text at a conference taking place in
Oslo, the Norwegian capital which is aimed at drawing up the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The group fears the alterations will drastically weaken the
treaty, expected to be signed in December in the Canadian capital
of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is among the countries seriously affected by land
mines planted during the 17 years of civil war, which ended in a
peace accord in October 1992.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Start With Unionists' Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) - The multi-party peace talks on
Northern Ireland started today in Belfast with the absence of
pro-British unionists from the talks.
</P>
<P>
The first plenary of the peace talks was adjourned shortly
after it started while the chairman of the negotiations, former
U.S. senator George Michell, tried to persuade the unionists to
take part.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) said it would not quit the
talks following the admittance of Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
However, UUP leader David Trimble said his party wanted talks
with Mitchell and British government minister Paul Murphy to
discuss "the format of any substantive talks and the handling of
the outstanding procedural issues."
</P>
<P>
Trimble said that his party, which represents 60 percent
Protestant majority that wants to stay British, would attend the
talks "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The UUP's absence from today's talks was prompted by an IRA
statement last week which said the guerrillas could not endorse
ground rules drawn up by Mitchell on voting rights and the
disarming of guerrilla groups during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland issued a joint statement early today to
persuade the unionists into joining the peace talks.

GENEVA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Federal Council
(government) said today that the suspension of a Swiss special
fund caused by the absence of three Jewish members was a
"deplorable" incident.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Swiss government praised members from the
World Jewish Restitution Organization and asked them to have their
suggestions ready by December 25 to resume the work of the special
fund for holocaust victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, three Jewish members announced that they would
not attend the second meeting of the fund's seven-member direction
today. At least six direction members should be present when any
decision is made, according to its rules. The fund's work was
brought to a halt by the absence.
</P>
<P>
At its first meeting last July, the direction decided to raise
17 million Swiss francs (about 11 million US dollars) for the
fund.

<HEADLINE> Monarchy to Remain in Canada for Now: Chretien </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said today that he has enough on his plate and doesn't
want to be dragged into the monarchy debate now.
</P>
<P>
Chretien has been asked to clarify his stand on the issue
whether the country should cut its ties with the British monarchy.
</P>
<P>
"I have enough with the separatists of Quebec. I don't want to
have problems with the monarchists of Canada at this time," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
John Aimers, head of the Monarchy League of Canada, wrote to
Chretien, demanding that he be known on whose behalf Industry
Minister John Manley was speaking when he called for an end to the
British queen's role in Canadian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chretien is also asked to clarify his own position on the
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Minister Manley told a Vancouver newspaper last week that it is
probably time for Canadians to say good-bye to the British
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that Manley is a "very candid" man and, like
other ministers, has some freedom to express his views.
</P>
<P>
To abolish the monarchy in Canada, it would need the consensus
of all the provinces and the House of Commons, Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
Following Chretien's response, Aimers said that while he
accepts Chretien's position, the prime minister should have given
a positive affirmation of support of the British monarchy.

<HEADLINE> W. European Car Sales Reach 9.4m So Far This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- New car sales in western
Europe rose by 3.1 percent to reach 9.37 million in the first
eight months of this year, according to figures released today by
the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The figures were higher than expected and prompted
manufacturers to raise their 2.3 percent forecasts for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The association said that sales in Italy jumped by 35 percent
in the first eight months and almost 44 percent in August alone as
the Italian government introduced an incentive program in January.
</P>
<P>
Sales in Spain also remained buoyant due to the changes in
vehicle excise taxes, with a rise of almost 12 percent so far this
year and a year-on-year increase of 17.6 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
Strong UK sales also boosted the European total. The main
reason for the country's 6.3 percent sales rise in the first eight
months was the introduction of the new registration prefix last
month.
</P>
<P>
However, sales on the French market were not so buoyant, with a
fall of 22.1 percent in the year to August and a drop of more than
29 percent last month, undermined by the termination of the
government's incentive program last September.
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen group continued to dominate western Europe's
market, with General Motors overtaking Fiat to regain second place
overall among manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese and South Korean car makers continued to
gain ground, with their sales both increased by more than 10
percent, more than three times the increase in the total market.

<HEADLINE> Key to Socialist Legal State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- It is of vital importance for
the government organs to exercise power in accordance with the
laws in the process of building China into a socialist legal
state, a delegate said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaoyang, a delegate
to the ongoing 15th National Party Congress, told Xinhua that
only when the government departments and officials perform their
duties in accordance with laws, can they expect people to
abide by laws in their life and work.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, deputy director of the Commission of the Legislative
Affairs of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), said that the powers of the government departments
are given by the people and, therefore, the powers could only be
used to serve the people.
</P>
<P>
"Governing by law, in my views, means that power is decided by
law and not by the enforcer. The exercise of power, thus far,
should be decided by the legal procedures and not by the
enforcer's will," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin pointed out in his report to the opening session of
the congress that "the smooth progress of the undertakings of the
Party and the state invitably requires that there must be laws to
go by, that the laws must be observed and strictly enforced, and
that law-breakers must be prosecuted."
</P>
<P>
Qiao held that the above-mentioned principles have been
advocated for 18 years and the principle of "there must be laws to
go by" has been better observed.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, NPC and its Standing Committee,
China's highest law-making body, have promulgated 321 laws and
regulations since China began reforms and opening-up, and 119 of
them were put into effect after the 14th National Party Congress
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State Council, the country's highest governing
body, has issued 770 sets of regulations in the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to 5,000-odd regulations formulated by
governments, which are empowered to do so, and 30,000 regulations
and rules issued by the central ministries, a socialist legal
system with the Constitution as the cornerstone has taken shape,"
Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that problems still exist in the "laws must be
observed and strictly enforced." The biggest obstacle for the
building of a socialist legal state is "some do not perform their
duties according to the law."
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for this is that the law-making and law
enforcing departments in the past paid little attention to how to
enforce the power, which is the most effective measure to prevent
power abuse.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the unhealthy style of work and local
protectionism are among the others that affect the strict
enforcement of laws. "It is impossible to require the people to
abide by law while the executive departments and their staff do
not observe the laws," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
According to Qiao, in order to carry out the principle "there
must be laws to go by, the NPC and its Standing Committee in
recent years put equal emphasis on law-making and supervision on
law enforcement and made ten more inspections nationwide on the
execution of dozens of laws.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the current five-yearly Party congress, Jiang
also put forward the new concrete measures in this regard, such as
"instituting a system of responsibility for law enforcement and a
system of assessment and examination."
</P>
<P>
Qiao emphasized that the issue to perform the duties according
to the law should be treated as a political issue which is closely
connected with the credibility of the Party and the state.
</P>
<P>
He said that if a government department does not perform their
duties according to the law, it is just like a person does not
keep his promise.

<P>
On how to ensure government functionaries to handle
administrative affairs in accordance with the law, Gu Angran,
director of the Commission of Legislative Affairs under the
National Preple's Congress Standing Committee, said that they must
act in accordance with the law in exercising the administrative
power.
</P>
<P>
The legalization of administrative management requires a
complete set of laws in this respect, a unified procedural law and
a system to supervise law enforcement. At present, some laws have
been formulated and others are still on the drawing board, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Administrative institutions and their functionaries are subject
to the supervision of judicial departments as well as their
self-supervision. The administrative procedural law has been
adopted for this purpose, he said.
</P>
<P>
All citizens, legal persons and organizations have the right to
acquire compensations if they suffer losses as a result of
administrative acts which violate laws. Hence, the state has
promulgated the compensation law, he added.
</P>
<P>
These laws have ensured that the administrative institutions
and their functionaries observe laws and perform their public
duties according to law.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the progress in the work of legal aid, Xiao Yang
said the system of legal aid is an important part of China's
judicial system and a major step to improving the social security
system so as to guarantee the rights and interests of the poor,
the weak and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
It has played a big role in promoting economic and social
reforms, practicing judicature fairly, easing social
contradictions and maintaining social stability, Xiao added.
</P>
<P>
Since the system was built in 1994, over 60 legal aid organs
have been set up at various levels, handling more than 5,000
cases, he added.
</P>
<P>
On working out laws on the market economy, Gu Angran said the
establishment of the socialist market economy must be protected by
a full-fledged legal system.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the NPC and its Standing Committee has adopted
a series of laws to standardize market operation and market order,
strengthen macro-economic control and improve social security, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the NPC legislation plans, China will formulate laws on
contracts, property rights, management of state assets,
securities, trust, anti-monopoly and pricing, some of which have
been submitted to the NPC Standing Committee for examination and
approval, Gu said.

<P>
Of those who backed the new cabinet, 32 percent or the largest
proportion, said they supported the cabinet because there were no
others appropriate for the positions.
</P>
<P>
Of those who disapproved of the new cabinet, 37 percent, the

cases, involving millions of yuan, she said. The grafters and
bribers nowadays employ advanced techniques, which are hard to
discover. Some of the cases involve quite many people and many
provinces or cities, she added.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu said that the anti-corruption drive will continue
with the support of the Party Central committee and the main
targets are Party and government leading organs, judicial
departments and economic administrations and leading officials at
and above the county level.
</P>
<P>
Liu expressed her belief that more effective measures will be
taken to curb corruption along with the continued reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of an open financial system, for instance,
will help prevent leading officials from corruption," she said.
</P>
<P>
CCDI committees at all levels handled over 630,000 cases from
1993 through last March, she said, adding that the same number of
Party members were punished, and over 20,000 of them were leading
officials at and above the county level.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Party would lose the
support and confidence of the people if corruption is not
effectively checked, an official of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection (CCDI) stressed.
</P>
<P>
Liu Liying, 65, a delegate to the ongoing Party congress,
quoted Jiang Zemin as saying that "the fight against corruption is
a grave political struggle vital to the very existence of the
Party and the state."
</P>
<P>
The CCDI and its subdivisions across the country are Party
organs responsible for investigating Party members' violations of
law, she said.
</P>
<P>
The job of discipline inspection is becoming increasingly
challenging as the economic restructuring in the country deepens,
Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the course of introducing shareholding system, it is
unavoidable that corruption may crop up, she said.
</P>
<P>
Liu was one of the leading judges in bringing Jiang Qing, one
of the members of the "Gang of Four" up for trial in 1980.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, she was one of those in charge of the illegal
fund-raising scandal that involved a total of 3.2 billion yuan.
The case helped provide important clues to the case of former vice
mayor of Beijing Wang Baosen and former Beijing Party secretary
Chen Xitong who was expelled from the Party about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the characteristics of the cases these years in
which Party members were involved, Liu said that she met greater
difficulties because the cases are becoming increasingly
complicated.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Democracy, Legal System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China has made a big stride
in improving socialist democracy since it pursued a policy of
reform and opening to the outside world in the late 1970s,
especially since the 14th Party congress held in 1992.
</P>
<P>
This has laid a solid foundation for building a socialist
country ruled by law, said some law-makers at a press conference
held by the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) here today.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, minister of justice, said progress has been made in
developing and legalizing socialist democracy since the start of
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has worked hard to building a legal system to
guarantee improved legislation, fair judicature, strict
enforcement of laws and extensive publicity of law knowledge among
ordinary people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The country is marching toward the goal that there must be laws
to go by, that the laws must be observed and strictly enforced,
and that law-breakers must be prosecuted, he added.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on human rights in judicial affairs,
Xiao said that the personality, personal safety, lawful property
and rights to defense, lodging complaints and providing
information against offenders -- rights which have not been
deprived of or restricted according to law -- will not be
infringed upon in China.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Prison Management, approved by the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, sets strict and
detailed requirements for policemen. Those who violate the law
will be subjected to administrative and judicial punishment, he
said.

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Diplomats in Oslo trying to draft a treaty banning land
mines had little enthusiasm for Washington's lastest proposal,

emboldened by their success in recruiting support.
</P>
<P>
-- William Weld pulled the plug today on his nomination as
Ambassador to Mexico, saying he realized that pressing his case
might jeopardize the Clinton administration's relationship with
Republicans on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was pessimistic as she
wrapped up her week-long Middle East tour, saying the situation
there was "worse than I thought."
</P>
<P>
-- Scientists at John' Hopkins University found in their
research that young broccoli seedlings are chock full of a
natural compound that helps prevent cancer in animals.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Japan's latest program to deregulate its financial markets
hasn't gone into effect yet, but there is already an early
winner: the U.S. computer industry.
</P>
<P>
-- Boeing said it will miss one-third of this month's
deliveries as it strains to keep up with the biggest commercial

<HEADLINE> Liaoning To Step Up Reform of State Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The key to get Liaoning
Province's state firms out of debt in three years is to implement
the guidelines set in Jiang Zemin's report to the Party Congress
on reform of state firms, the governor of the province, Wen
Shizhen said here today.
</P>
<P>
As a major traditional base, Liaoning is home to 1400 large
state-owned enterprises, or one third of China's total. These
enterprises boast 360 billion yuan in fixed assets, said Wen, who
is attending the five-yearly Party congress which opened on
September 12.
</P>
<P>
With Chinese economy shifting from a planned economy to a
socialist market economy, some 50-60 percent of the enterprises
were making losses, though things have taken a turn for the better
in the recent few years as a result of bold experiments.
</P>
<P>
There still exist a lot of difficulties as well as potentials
and hopes in bringing state-owned enterprises out of debt, said
Wen.
</P>
<P>
By now, the province has worked out ways of managing state
firms well and all state firms are working hard to get themselves
out of debt. He said the on-going Party congress has charted a
right track for the future development of the state sector.
</P>
<P>
To realize the above target, the province has adopted effective
measures to take diversified forms of public ownership. Efforts
are being made to manage well large state firms while adopting a
flexible policy toward small ones and to invigorate state firms by
ways of merger, reorganization and readjustment.
</P>
<P>
According to the governor, the province has decided to
establish by the end of the century ten enterprise groups each
with an annual sales volume of 10 billion yuan, 20 groups each
with 5-9.9 billion yuan and 30 enterprise groups each with 2-4.9
billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> 2 Kidnapping Suspects Killed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Two kidnapping suspects were
killed and three others wounded today in a Manila suburb by police
who successfully rescued a Chinese-Filipino businessman from the
hands of his abductors.
</P>
<P>
Police said a total of six gangmen were arrested during the
daring operation conducted in Laguna, 60 kilometers east of
Manila, early this morning.
</P>
<P>
They said Ruiz Saez-Co, 30, was rescued after being held for
eight days by the suspects who initially asked for 40 million
pesos (13 million U.S. dollars) in ransom.
</P>
<P>
Kidnap-for-ransom syndicates, mainly targeting rich
Chinese-Filipino businessmen, have been running rampant in the
archipelago country for years.
</P>
<P>
According to police statistics, there were 59 abductions
involving 94 victims during the first nine months of this year, a
sharp rise from the 23 cases recorded in the whole of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and its law enforcement agencies have been
sharply criticized for its failure to curb kidnappings, which have
already taken a toll on the economy by scaring away potential
investors.

<HEADLINE> Young Theorist On Deng Xiaoping Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A young theorist attending
the on-going 15th National Party Congress said the decision of
establishing Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding ideology of the
Party will exert a great impact on China's future development.
</P>
<P>
"The banner is often deemed in China as an inspiring ideology,"
Li Zhongjie, a professor at the Party School of the CPC Central
Committee, said at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee proposes that the Party, at its 15th
Congress, establish Deng Xiaoping Theory as its guilding
ideology by writing it into its Constitution is of "far-reaching
significance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the CPC Central Committee decided to put Deng
Xiaoping theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
as the Party's guiding ideology and arm the whole Party with it at
the 14th National Party Congress in 1992. This theory of Deng's
was enriched at the current congress, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the primary stage of socialism, Li said that
during this period, people, cherished great enthusiasm and grand
ideal, used to set a fairly high goal.
</P>
<P>
"They often neglect the actual conditions and difficulties
ahead and think that it will soon enter the higher stage of
socialism, committing a mistake of overleaping the phase of social
development," he added.
</P>
<P>
"However, haste makes waste," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The second and third generations of the central leadership
stated, after twists and turns stated at the 13th National Party
Congress in 1987 that China is still in the primary stage of
socialism, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of stressing this, he said, is to firmly grasp the
basic contradictions in this stage and adhere to taking the
economic construction as the central task. All Party policies
should be based on this, he added.

<HEADLINE> Congress Delegates From Rural Areas Praise Jiang's Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A female delegate from
Fengyang County, where China's rural economic reform was
initiated, said here today that Jiang Zemin's call of holding high
the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory has given her assurance
of and encouragement for further economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, farmers in Fengyang County in east China's Anhui
Province cast away the form of People's Commune, a nationwide
form of production for decades, and experimented with the
household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked
to output. before long, this method was spread in rural areas
across China.
</P>
<P>
"In the years of practicing People's Commune, all villagers,
each of whom had an annual average income of not more than 100
yuan, lived in thatched huts. One third of the villagers went out
for begging," said the 41-year-old Wang Yinping, who is attending
the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Fundamental changes have taken place in Fengyang County
during the 18-year reform and opening to the outside world, she
added.
</P>
<P>
To date, over 95 percent of farmers live in brick-and-tile
houses and some in multi-story buildings. The annual per capita
income of farmers in Fengyang rose to 1,800 yuan last year. All
school-age children have been admitted into school, said Wang,
who is secretary of the Xiquan Village Party Branch in Fengyang.
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago when she was elected Party secretary,
the annual income of local farmers averaged 200 yuan. After
taking up her post, she led farmers to build a dozen of rural
factories and raised farmers' income to more than 3,000 yuan,
turning a poor village into a prosperous one, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin stressed in his report to the current Party
Congress that the Party will continue to stick to its fundamental
policies in rural areas, deepen rural reforms and increase
farmers' income by promoting economic development.
</P>
<P>
"This has made us farmers be at ease. We will further
emancipate the mind, optimize agricultural structure, develop
rural industry and promote the industrial management of
agriculture so as to contribute our bit to putting an end to the
backwardness of rural areas," she said.

<P>
A recent survey revealed that galleries can be found in 80
percent of Shanghai's shopping malls, including famous ones such

both their popularity and business by adding galleries which
attract an increasing number of steady consumers. They also note
that galleries also help to enhance the shopping environment
and polish the image of a mall.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Yam, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), has been named the
Central Banker of the Year by the Euromoney magazine, the HKMA
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Each year, Euromoney's editors select from among the world's
central bankers the best central banker of the year and announce
the result in its September issue at the time of the World
Bank/International Monetary Fund annual meetings.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said, Yam has "successfully steered Hong Kong
through what was billed as the most tumultuous year in its
history," referring to the handover in the mid-year and the recent
regional currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"He has striven to build Hong Kong's domestic debt market
through the introduction of a government yield-curve, has built
the Exchange Fund, and has introduced Asia's most sophisticated
interbank real-time gross settlement system. His latest project
is to create a mortgage corporation along the lines of Fannie Mae
in the U.S.," said Euromoney.
</P>
<P>
"I am very honored to have been offered this award by
Euromoney," said Yam. "The credit is due not to me but to all my
dedicated colleagues at the HKMA."
</P>
<P>
An award presentation ceremony will be held here on September
22.
</P>
<P>
Yam started his civil service career in Hong Kong as a
statistician in 1971 and was appointed to the current post in
1993.
</P>
<P>
He was involved in the creation of Hong Kong's linked exchange
rate system in 1983 and is responsible for many of the reform
measures introduced since then to strengthen Hong Kong's monetary
system and develop Hong Kong's debt market. These measures have
contributed to monetary stability in Hong Kong and its development
as an international financial center, according to the HKMA, the
de facto central bank in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Yam was named the Best Asian Central Banker in 1996 by
Euromoney and in 1995 he was given the Banker of the Year Award by
the Hong Kong Institute of Bankers.

<HEADLINE> Syria Calls for New US Policy of Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Syrian official newspapers
today called on the United States to adopt a new policy to support
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syrian newspapers Teshreen and Al-Thawara made the call
following the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's first
visit to the region since taking office early this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. should assess the outcome of Albright's visit, what
she has heard and seen, and the hardline stance of Israel toward
the peace process, the Teshreen newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Such an assessment is supposed to lead to a new U.S. policy
supporting those who want peace and rebuking those who obstruct it
at a critical stage of the peace process deadlocked by the
practices of Israel, it added.
</P>
<P>
The paper affirmed what Syria had made it clear to Albright
that it adheres to the Mideast peacemaking and is ready to
establish a fair and overall peace based on the resolutions of the
United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Thawara newspaper expressed the hope that Albright's
first Mideast tour would mark a new stage in which the U.S. is to
play a fairer role in persuading Israel to take the right course
toward achieving peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The paper maintained that it is the U.S. that can exert
pressures effectively on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to refrain from persisting in his hardline positions that portend
the most disastrous consequences to the peace process.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is supporting the establishment of
an international criminal court to try war criminals and
instigators of genocide, a SADC official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The position was announced here today by the director of the
human rights lawyers association for southern Africa, Vinodh
Jaichand.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC representatives had met in Pretoria at the
weekend to formulate a regional position in response to a draft
statute drawn up by the International Law Commission outlining
proposals to establish a permanent international criminal court
within the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The new court would replace the ed hoc tribunal set up by the
U.N. Security Council to investigate atrocities and crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Jaichand said the idea of an international criminal court had
been bandied about for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The SADC had adopted principles of consensus which would be
put forward as a declaration at U.N. meetings in Sicily in
November and New York in December.
</P>
<P>
The court may be established within two years if it was not
"politically scuttled or delayed", Jaichand said.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member SADC was formed in 1992 with an aim at
promoting regional economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans to Africa Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The nature of World Bank loans
to Africa has been blamed for huge debt burden on African
countries, The Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
A financial consultant was quoted as saying that the World
Bank did not release loans to the benefiting countries on time,
and most of the time, interest would have started accruing on the
loans ahead of the release.
</P>
<P>
"The bank is in a position to lend four billion U.S. Dollars a
year to sub-Saharan Africa, but surprisingly at the end of each
fiscal year, the bank group usually has outstanding millions of
dollars waiting to be disbursed," said Mazi Emmanuel Ivi,
chairman of Target International Ltd.
</P>
<P>
This means "that the commitments are there but the draw-down
is not there," added Ivi, who spoke at a recent IMF/World Bank
pre-yearly general meeting briefing in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
According to him, no African countries, including those that
have completely embraced the structural adjustment program and
those that are yet to do so, have really achieved accelerated and
sustainable economic growth and development.
</P>
<P>
Despite the assurances give by the bank, most African leaders
still believed that Africa "is very uncomfortable with its (World
Bank) policies," because its loans posed a bigger debt burden to
Africa than any of the other highly indebted continents, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Another investment consultant, Hebert Orji, alleged that loans
approved by World Bank for African countries were being paid into
big banks like Citibank, Manhattan Bank to mention but a few,
while the countries they were meant for did not get to know that
the loans had been disbursed.
</P>
<P>
He said the funds might even be in these banks for a period of
two months generating interest for them as a result of lack of
communication between the World Bank and the benefiting
countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel's CPI Rises Slowly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel's consumer price
index (CPI) rose a lower-than-expected 0.4 percent to 152.3
points in August, compared with 151.7 points in July, Israeli
Central Statistics Bureau announced today.
</P>
<P>
The index was offset by a seasonal drop in the prices of
clothing and shoes, while its moderate appreciation was
attributed primarily to price increases in food and farm produce.
</P>
<P>
The prices of food and farm produce rose by 1.2 percent and
5.1 percent respectively last month, while those of clothing and
shoes dropped by 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the slow rise of the index is due to the
slowdown in the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, rather than the
decision of the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates last month.
</P>
<P>
"Experience shows that when the dollar depreciates, the index
goes up, and when it appreciates, the index goes down," said
Doron Tsur, head of research at Sahar Securities.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates go up and down, but we have had a roughly 10
percent rate of inflation for the past four years," he said.
</P>
<P>
After cutting interest rates by 1.2 percent in June, the Bank
of Israel raised the rate by 0.7 percent to 13.4 percent last
month due to inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Develops New Vaccines for Animal, Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at Nigeria's
National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) have developed
three new vaccines to check rising bacteria induced animal and
human diseases.
</P>
<P>
The development followed the discovery in the institute's
earlier research that some vaccines produced for some infected
animals were later found to cure chronic diseases in humans,
according to Nvri Abubakar Lamorde.
</P>
<P>
The three vaccines are named black-quarter blaxy and
gasgagerine (BBG), hanta-vac and vomac-b, The Business Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
While the BBG is a three-in-one vaccine used for both cattle
and ruminants, the hanta-vac cures water-borne diseases which
infect animals through the lungs and the vomac-b is an
enterotaemil (a type of diarrhoea) for ruminants, Lamorde said.
</P>
<P>
He said the vaccines were in the final stage of field trials
after which they would be commercially produced.
</P>
<P>
According to Mathias Agba, head of bacteria vaccine
production, human beings contract the diseases after the
consumption of infected cattle or ruminants.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some vaccines earlier developed to cure skin
diseases in animals were used on human beings and found to be
effective, having cured some skin infections suffered for many
years.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the demand for bacteria vaccines is on the
rise and over 16 million doses of them were produced last year in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The demand for vaccines was quite high in spite of
competition from imported vaccines, said Oheari Marcus, head of
viral vaccine production division.
</P>
<P>
Marcus said that poultry vaccines accounted for about 90
percent of the total vaccine output and over 36 million doses of
poultry, dog, cat and cattle viral vaccines were produced in the
last few years.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- One of the first members of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) was 104-year-old Tan Tiandu,
who is one of the most valuable witnesses to the Party's
vicissitudes in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Tan was born in Gaoming County in south China's Guangdong
province, in April, 1893, and took part in the "May 4th Movement"
in 1919 and activities for the establishment of the CPC in the
1920s. He became a founding member of the CPC on July 1, 1921.
</P>
<P>
"Before the Second Congress in 1922, the Party had only 195
members, but the figure has grown to 58 million at the time when
we are holding the 15th National Congress of the Party," the old
man commented.
</P>
<P>
Tan had been arrested four times and imprisoned five by the
Kuomintang before new China was founded in 1949, but he never lost
faith in the Party.
</P>
<P>
Tan's wife Ou Mengjue is also an old communist. They lost their
two children in the old days and he says, "I hope young people,
especially young CPC members, can treasure today's happy life that
was created by revolutionary forerunners, and can carry the
communist cause through to the end."
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the CPC leadership will grow stronger
generation by generation.

XI'AN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Imported technology has helped
agricultural development on the infertile and dry land of China's
Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province is one of the beneficiaries. For the past five
years, it has imported agricultural technology from abroad and has
sent 3,800 people to be trained in foreign countries, bringing
direct economic returns worth around 500 million yuan (60 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The province is especially interested in technology for crop
breeding, seed selection, increasing output, and dry land grain,
oil-bearing crops, cotton, and apple production, local agronomists
say.
</P>
<P>
It has bought some 50 types of high-quality apple to increase
the competitiveness of Shaanxi's apples on the domestic and
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Jingyang Township has built a vegetable-growing base by using
imported covering materials and greenhouse technology. The
vegetable farm sells over 500,000 yuan of vegetable daily.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress Protecting the Ozone Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China has scored remarkable
achievements in protecting the ozone layer over the past 10 years
by eliminating over 20,000 tons of ozone depleting substances
(ODS).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's press conference marking the Third
International Ozone Layer Protection Day, leading officials from
the National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa) said that
China's work to protect the ozone layer have been greatly
strengthened since the establishment of the national leading group
on ozone layer protection in 1992. The leading group is comprised
of officials from 18 ministries, including Nepa.
</P>
<P>
The leading group drafted the National Program for Phasing Out
Ozone Depleting Substances In China and wide-ranging related
strategies for eight sectors, including the chemical and household
refrigerator manufacturing industries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has adopted measures to control the
protection and use of ODS and encourage enterprises to use ODS
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
China signed the "Vienna Convention for the Protection of
the Ozone Layer" and the "London Amendment of the Montreal
Protocol on Substances Which Deplete the Ozone Layer" in 1989 and
1991, and has since received a 150 million US dollars foreign
grant to phase out ODS.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Shelves Government, Private Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
today announced the postponement of some government and private
projects financed by commercial banks in a bid to enforce economic
stability following the rupiah depreciation against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Mar'ie Muhammad said at the parliament that
the projects to be postponed was valued at 38.92 trillion rupiah
(2,900 rupiah equals one U.S. dollar) or 24.1 percent of the
161.78 trillion rupiah projects financed by state-run enterprises
and private firms.
</P>
<P>
The government will also reschedule some projects which are
worth 62.69 trillion rupiah or 38.7 percent of the total projects
planed for the 1997-98 fiscal year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, most of the projects to be postponed
are items in mining, energy, oil and transportation fields as well
as some projects with a high import content.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said the purpose of the move is to reduce the country's
current account deficit which has reached 9.8 billion U.S. dollars
or 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The move is the follow up of the government's reform package
announced on September 3 to prevent the current currency crisis
from plunging into an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's rupiah, like other regional currencies, has come
under fierce speculative attacks following de factor devaluation
of the Thai baht and the Philippine peso in July. The rupiah has
fallen more than 10 percent in the past month and nearly 25
percent since January this year.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Lists Conditions for Aid Supplies to S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The West African Peace-keeping
Force (ECOMOG) carrying out embargo on Sierra Leone has announced
requests for humanitarian supplies to the country.
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies wishing to export humanitarian supplies must
first convince ECOMOG on the nature of the items as well as
provide information about where they would be delivered within
the country.
</P>
<P>
The information should include detailed description of the
items, quantity to be transported, mode of transportation, date
of delivery, the point of entry and the final destination.
</P>
<P>
The conditions are contained in a memorandum to the United
Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) given by ECOMOG force Commander
Major-General Victor Malu Monday.
</P>
<P>
The conditions are listed amid reports by international aid
agencies that the deteriorating situation in embargoed Sierra
Leone may worsen the poor malnutrition rate which was as high as
10 percent before the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Unicef's representative in Guinea, Tony Bloomberg even warned
Monday a crisis was imminent if urgent steps were not taken to
combat malnutrition and diseases in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Bloomberg said that the regional embargo on that country
should be lifted to allow supplies to be shipped in from
neighbouring Guinea or Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there is a breakdown of all government
structures and the banking system in Sierra Leone since coupists
ousted the legitimate government of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the purchasing power of Sierra Leoneans has been
greatly reduced and many of them do not have access to health
care.
</P>
<P>
The embargo imposed on Sierra Leone was approved by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) last month as
a means to force out the military junta led by Major Johnny
Kromah.
</P>
<P>
To enforce the embargo, ECOMOG has warned earlier that it will
attack any violators but humanitarian relief goods will be
allowed to enter Sierra Leone after the inspection and
approvement of it.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG jet fighter has attacked ships entering the port in
Freetown accused of trying to unload arms amid rice and other
goods.
</P>
<P>
The air raid of ECOMOG invited gunfire from the Sierra Leonan
army deployed to the port after the attack.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of fire has reportedly forced thousands of local
residents to flee from the port area, intensifying the situation
there.
</P>
<P>
The tense situation in Sierra Leone also led to continued
strikes from teachers of this country who have asked for the
payment of salary arrears and improvement in security.
</P>
<P>
The junta managed to pay some of the country's 18,000 teachers
in June, but many have salary arrears dating back to the civilian
regime of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

Moi, 74 and in power since 1978, was officially nominated as the
sole presidential candidate of his ruling Kenya African National
Union (KANU) for the impending multi-party general election.
</P>
<P>
The one-day KANU Special National Delegates Conference,
attended by more than 5,000 people from the all eight provinces

unanimously with jubilant chanting this morning.
</P>
<P>
Following the approval, Moi said he was very happy to accept
the nomination, vowing to strengthen KANU and maintain the
country in peace and stability.

<P>
"KANU will continue to pursue objectives which are for the
good of this country," he said. Moi became a KANU member 42 years

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Bracing for Clashes With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli army is bracing
for a possible guerrilla war with Palestinian fighters that
could be triggered by the deterioration in the political
situation, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted military sources as saying that the army
has prepared operational plans, and regular and reserve units
are receiving special training to be ready for future
skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
Based on the lesson learned from the bloodshed last September,
special police units have been set up and special protective
equipments have been purchased, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The sources warned of an outbreak of guerrilla warfare and an
escalation in the uses of weapons in the Palestinian territories
if the current deadlock in the peace process continues and
mistrust between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) increases.
</P>
<P>
They added that the PNA has also beefed up their security
forces and is maintaining a state of alert, fearing that Israeli
security forces might enter Palestinian self-rule areas to
capture so-called terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian residents in the territories have been instructed
how to respond to Israeli troops if they reenter the Palestinian
cities.
</P>
<P>
Following the July 30 twin suicide bombings in Jerusalem's
Mahane Yehuda market launched by the Islamic Resistant Movement
(Hamas), Israeli Cabinet approved sending troops into Palestinian
areas to capture Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Since the September 4 triple bombings in Jerusalem's Ben
Yehuda mall, Israel has carried out a sweep of Hamas activists
in areas under its control, nabbing about 250 of them.
</P>
<P>
The recent visit by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright here failed to break the prolonged deadlock
in the peace process. Although Israel took some good-will
gestures by releasing more frozen tax revenues and easing the
internal closure of the territories, the general closure remains
in effect.
</P>
<P>
And in a provocative step, three Jewish settler families
moved Sunday night into two houses in East Jerusalem's Ras Amud
Arab neighborhood, sparking strong Palestinian protests and
rioting.
</P>
<P>
Due to the sensitivity of the Jerusalem issue, the latest
incident could trigger widespread Palestinian violence that will
threaten to scuttle the moribund peace process.

MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Roberto de Ocampo said here today that the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) meeting to be held in Hong Kong would help curb the
currency woes sweeping Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo, head of the country's delegation to the meeting on
September 21, said the delegates will discuss how to solve the
currency crisis that has been hitting not only the Philippines,
but also the other members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) since early July.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN finance ministers will see whether there is anything
they can do in concert to address the prevailing currency problems
in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also call for the early implementation of
the World Bank's "emergency fund" to enable member economies to
stem the tide when short-term financial assistance is badly
needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the meeting is expected to provide ASEAN member
economies with the means to best guard against the deterioration
of their economies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, de Ocampo said that the Philippine government
remains committed to maintaining a sound economy, even as a slower
growth rate will be seen this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists believed that the financial meltdown in the region
will accelerate the downward spiral of the country's economy,
which slowed down to 5.9 percent in the first half of the year
compared with the 7.5 percent registered in the same period last
year.

URUMQI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The UN Development Program

Road, according to Arthur N. Holcombe, UNDP representative to
China.
</P>
<P>
Holcombe made the remark at a recent forum here on economic and
trade co-operation between China and five Central Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The second Eurasian Continental Railway, which runs more than
10,000 km from China to Europe, and which is known as the new Silk
Road, was opened to traffic in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will arrange regional projects in the next five to ten
years to solve trade problems between China and the Central Asian
countries, such as lowering transport costs on the railway and
shortening the time for transported goods to cross borders.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP plans to provide technical aid for developing frontier
trade, industrial investment, poverty relief, and environmental
protection. The organization will send experts in mid-October to
do preparatory work for projects, Holcombe said.
</P>
<P>
Countries along the line have great potential for
co-operation. At Horgas, on the Chinese side, business people from
Zhejiang province in the east do 120 million US dollars worth of
business annually.

<HEADLINE> Multimedia Asia '97 Conference Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Multimedia Asia '97
Conference and Exhibition opened here today with a call for the
setting up of a virtual forum -- the Virtual commonwealth of
Nations -- to formulate a new global framework for information age
governance and towards nurturing a global civil society.
</P>
<P>
The call was made today by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad when he opened the four-day conference-cum-exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the widening gap between the information poor and
the information rich society pointed to the need for a new
framework of governance where the concerns of distributive justice
existed alongside a free market system for the digital economy.
</P>
<P>
"The information age, the new basis for power, wealth and
influence, will be knowledged. No one has the monopoly of
knowledge and wisdom, meaning no one can have all the power,
wealth and influence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the virtual commonwealth of nations, multimedia
technology such as videophony and teleconferencing could be used
as a means to communicate and discuss issues of concern and
problems with each other.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), as
Malaysia's investment for the future, using the concept of smart
partnership, was an invitation for the world community to together
shape a common future.
</P>
<P>
"We invite collaboration instead of confrontation, enrichment
instead of exploitation, sharing instead of grabbing. These should
remain the watchwords, these should provide the basis towards
evolving a just and equitable global society," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Multimedia Asia '97 with the theme "Moving MSC From Vision
to Reality; Benchmarking Smart Solution " is an annual gathering
of experts and investors to discuss on the MSC programs.

<HEADLINE> China Technically Prepared for Damming of Major River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Some crucial technical
problems that would affect the blocking of the Yangtze River at
the Three Gorges in early November have been solved through
extensive studies.
</P>
<P>
Lu Youmei, General Manager of the China Yangtze River Three
Gorges Project Development Corp. which is responsible for building
the Three Gorges Dam, told reporters that they are technically
prepared for stopping the river in early November.
</P>
<P>
Chinese engineers plan to build two parallel earth-and-stone
cofferdams on the main stream to allow workers to build a dam and
electric power stations in between the two.
</P>
<P>
A number of technical problems like possible collapse or
leaking of the cofferdams have been fully studied because the main
dam will stop the Yangtze at the Three Gorges where the water is
60 m deep and flows at a speed of 14,000 cu m per second.
</P>
<P>
The problems in damming have been solved over the past
decade. Since the 1980s, engineers have made many models and
simulations for tests and have decided to put in 600,700 cu.m. of
stone to keep the depth to 30 m in the middle of the cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
A great number of equipment has been imported to stop possible
leaks. Engineers have also developed a computer-controlled command
system which can follow the process of damming and predict
problems that may crop up in construction work.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Water Conservation Committee has worked out a
detailed dam plan through careful study of the Gezhouba Water
Control Project and projects in foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Two Central American Countries' Move on Taiwan Issue Appreciated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- China appreciated the move of
Guatemala and Dominica of not signing the motion which proposed to
discuss in the United Nations the issue of Taiwan's "return" to
the UN.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cui Tiankai made the remarks at a
weekly press conference here today while asked to comment on the
two countries' move.
</P>
<P>
The move of these two central American countries demonstrated
that Taiwan authorities' activities of separating the country has
become increasingly unpopular, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that other countries this year signing
the relevant motion will also not support Taiwan authorities'
activities of creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in
the world by quitting signing the motion and adhering to the UN
charter and relevant resolutions of the UN General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
China attached great importance to its ties with all UN
members, including those that have not yet established diplomatic
relations with it, and would like to develop friendly and
cooperative ties with all countries on the basis of the Five
Principles of the Peaceful Co-Existence, the spokesman said.

<P>
WEIHAI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Health and education
authorities in the city of Weihai in east China's Shandong
province have asked tobacco retailors not to sell cigarettes to
anyone below the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
They asked department stores, grocery stores, and street
peddlers to comply with the order and put up reminders saying "No
Cigarettes Sold to Minors" nearby.
</P>
<P>
They also urged adults not to let their children buy cigarettes
for themselves or for other people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Huangpu District of Shanghai, China's largest
municipality, adopted similar measures recently in order to halt
the increase in smoking among young people, according to
Shanghai's "Xinmin Evening News".
</P>
<P>
China has laws on advertising, tobacco, and prohibiting
cigarette sales related to youth. but tobacco products are still
available for young people because of lax law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
A giant tobacco industry and about 320 million smokers make
China the largest tobacco producer and consumer in the world. One
survey has shown that Chinese males take their first puff at the
age of 20, compared with 23 in 1986.
</P>
<P>
And smoking among the people aged 15-25 rose faster than among
other age groups, according to the survey of the Chinese Academy
of Preventive Medicine last year.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Egyptian Presidents Hold talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today held talks with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria which is
expected to focus on cementing ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Demirel arrived in Alexandria this morning for an one-day visit
to Egypt aimed at enhancing relations with the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem, was greeted by Mubarak at the airport.
</P>
<P>
The recent developments in the Mideast peace process,
increasing bilateral economic cooperation and Arab-Turkish ties
will top today's talks, Demirel told the Al Ahram newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said earlier that the Mubarak-Demirel
talks would discuss means to increase their trade volume to one
billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Demirel is also expected to brief Mubarak on the situation in
northern Iraq and the growing Turko-Israeli military cooperation
that will lead to joint naval maneuvers in eastern Mediterranean
in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
The planned Israeli-Turko-U.S. maneuvers provoked outcries from
Arab countries, especially Syria which sees itself as the target
of the Turkish-Israeli military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was among the most vocal critics of the war games,
which have raised concern, notably in Syria and Iran. Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said earlier that they "sent a
negative message toward the Arab countries."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Turkish summit, which was originally set for May,
was postponed in the wake of the planned naval war games.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic-language daily Monday, Demirel
denied that the alliance with Israel is targeted against
Syria. "If it were so, we would not have needed cooperation with
Israel or any other state to pressure Syria," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clarifying the truth on the joint maneuvers, he said that they
were exaggerated by the Arab world beyond reality.
</P>
<P>
"We will see shortly that they are no more than exercises for
humanitarian goals, namely personnel rescue and search for the
missing," Demirel said, reiterating that they are open for Arab
countries to take part.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the exercises, Demirel also tried to justify the
large-scale Turkish incursion into northern Iraq in May, saying
that Turkey respects Iraq's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Turkish military presence in the north has one
objective: wiping out bases and hideouts of the outlawed Kurdish
Worker's Party (PKK)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, in a bid to downplay the impact of the maneuvers on
Ankara-Arab ties, has repeatedly stated that the exercises were
not directed against any country.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Loses 170m Dollars on Hyacinth Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua)-- Uganda is losing 170 billions
shillings (about 170 million U.S. dollars ) per year due to the
water hyacinth, reported the local daily, The Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State for Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
Fisheries Kibirige Sebunya was quoted as attributing the spread
of the weed to sientists and policy makers who he said have
remained indecisive and disunited on the methods of eradicating
the water hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on whether to use chemicals to eliminate the
widespread weeds have lasted for years but without reaching any
agreement among scientists and departments concerned in Uganda's
government.
</P>
<P>
The weeds have now strangled 90 percent of the shoreline of
rivers and lakes, a stretch of about 2,000km.
</P>
<P>
The weeds are covering all bays of Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga,
River Nile in Uganda and, to a small extent, Lake Albert.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 tons of the weeds were cleaned by hyacinth
harvesters last March at the Owen Falls dam of the country's sole
hydro-electric power station.
</P>
<P>
However another 300,000 tons of the weeds have since then
grown up again at the dam site.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan today
attempted to narrow their differences on evolving a mechanism to
address the vexed Kashmir issue as the two countries formally
began the third round of foreign secretary level talks here, Press
Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said that the first session of the talks were
exploratory in nature with the two delegations reviewing the
progress made since the second round held in Islamabad last June.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Secretary K. Raghunath and his Pakistan
counterpart Shamshad Ahmad, who arrived here on Monday, led their
respective delegations at the talks which will last until
September 18.
</P>
<P>
In a brief informal meeting on Monday, both foreign secretaries
expressed their confidence that their formal talks would mark the
beginning of a process towards the realization of cooperative and
mutually beneficial relations.
</P>
<P>
They also reiterated their firm commitment to sustaining
bilateral dialogue and give concrete shape to the mechanism for
dealing with outstanding issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to PTI, the June 23 joint statement issued by the
foreign secretaries of the two countries after their second round
of talks in Islamabad formed the basis of preliminary discussions
because the two sides had varying interpretations of the
statement.
</P>
<P>
While Pakistan maintained that the two sides had agreed in
Islamabad to set up a joint working group on Kashmir, India has
firmly contended that the issues relating to Kashmir and peace and
security were to be directly addressed at the level of foreign
secretaries.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French parliament deputies today began to study the draft law
on creating 350,000 jobs for the youth in public enterprises, which
was presented by the Minister of Employment Martine Aubry. Rightwing
opposition deputies are asking whether these ``emergency'' jobs can
last long, can compete with those of private enterprises, or really
answer the need for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
-- Some Jewish settlers, backed by dozens of Jewish activists,
moved into the heart of a Palestinian neighborhood in Jerusalem only
two steps from Mount of Olives. This challenge addressed to the
United States, which took place one day after U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright left the Mideast, jeopardized the hope of a
detente between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- After the United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
completed her first tour of the Mideast, Israel and the Palestinians
seem to be on the way of making concessions to each other. Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that he was encouraged by
the ``primary positive steps'' taken by Palestinians in fighting
terrorism, released part of the Palestinian fund ``frozen'' by
Israel after the latest terrorist attacks in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
-- The Greenpeace movement and the leaders of the nuclear factory
of Cape Hague in France are engaged in another round of arms
wrestling after the ecologists discovered some nuclear stocks in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Environment Dominique Voynet said that these
stocks do not pose a threat to local environment and promised to
send a new inspection team today to investigate.

<HEADLINE> Australia Creates Information Economy Portfolio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard today announced the creation of Information Economy
portfolio in a bid to promote the country's information technology
industry.
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Minister Richard Alston, who was awarded
today the new Information Economy portfolio, said "the government
will ensure that all Australians, from all walks of life and
wherever they live, are well positioned to benefit from the
tremendous opportunities presented by the 'Information Age'."
</P>
<P>
Following his visit to the United States earlier this year,
Howard has talked a lot about the role the information technology
industry has played in the U.S. economy, which is characterized by
fast economic growth rates, a low jobless rate and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
Australia has been troubled a high jobless rate, which has
increased to 8.7 percent in recent months, and low economic growth
rates for quite a few years.
</P>
<P>
Alston said experience in the U.S. showed this area offered
one of the greatest potentials for job growth.
</P>
<P>
"In coming years, the information economy will be a key driver
of jobs growth, and not just for jobs directly linked to
computers, but in more traditional areas such as electricians,
receptionists, security guards, builders, truck drivers and a host
of others," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Information Economy will be a key driver to achieving
dramatic increases in social and economic prosperity into the 21st
century," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Australia was well-placed to take advantage of the
opportunities arising from the new information economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have one of the most rapid take-ups of new technologies, a
well-educated workforce, one of the most competitive
telecommunications regimes and a world-class telecommunications
infrastructure, a stable political and economic environment ...
geographically close to and in the same time zones as the
Asia-Pacific," the minister explained.

CAIRO, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Middle East businesses have been urged to increase
their share in the 30 billion U.S. dollars spent annually on
procurement of goods and services by different United Nations
agencies and international development banks.
</P>
<P>
Edward de Broe-Ferguson, chairman of the British speciality
program management firm, Tamarisk, said here Monday that the
businesses in the region currently share less than one percent of
the procurement by those organizations.
</P>
<P>
Delivering speech at the Amman Chamber of Industry, he added
that the U.N. Intra Agency Procurement Services Office had
expressed a desire to have more Middle East companies as its
regular suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Broe-Ferguson said Tamarisk has in the past two years
organized conferences annually aimed at expanding the number of
Middle East suppliers to the U.N. by increasing awareness of the
procedures needed to tender for U.N. contracts.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Two commercial banks of Saudi Arabia, the United
Saudi Commercial Bank and Saudi Cairo Bank announced last weekend
that they had merged into one, named the Saudi United Bank,
according to reports of Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The merger deal has brought the new bank up to the third
largest one in the kingdom with a capital of 653.3 million
U.S. dollars and an asset of 8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, a major share holder of the bank,
became the first board chairman of the Saudi United Bank.
</P>
<P>
He bought large shares of the United Saudi Commercial Bank in
1988 and took in 33.4 percent of the shares of the Saudi Cairo
Bank in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The largest bank in Saudi Arabia is Al-Ahli Bank with a capital
of 1.6 billion dollars and the second is Al-Riyadh Bank with a
capital of 1.06 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Gas reserves in the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states are expected to rise from the present 20 trillion to
28.7 trillion cubic meters in the next few years, Yusif Abdullah,
director of the GCC oil and gas secretariat has said.
</P>
<P>
GCC's gas reserves will account for 20.5 percent of the current
140 trillion proven reserves of the world, he was quoted as saying
in the latest issue of the Oil and Arab Cooperation magazine.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, GCC's reserves increased by 115 percent to reach about
20 trillion cubic meters from the reserves of 9.8 trillion cubic
meters in 1986, which had a share of 14.3 percent of the world
proven reserves.
</P>
<P>
GCC shares recently 4.6 percent of the gas sold in the world
market. During the last decade, GCC's gas production rose by 7.5
percent annually, Abdullah said, estimating that gas consumption
grew in the last few years by 7.6 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
GCC, established in 1981, groups Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and Qatar, which also have 48
percent of the world proven oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issa Al-Mazidi has
predicted a high global oil demand for the last quarter of this
year in view of the fall in petroleum reserves of industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
Quoted in today's Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam in an interview,
the minister said that the world oil demand for the period is
likely to reach 76 million barrels per day, more than three
percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
He said he has information that "the petroleum reserves in a
number of industrial states and the United States fell during the
past three months."
</P>
<P>
The industrialized states would feed their reserves "as they
usually do every winter, thus resulting in the increase of
demand," Al-Mazidi said.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the prices would strengthen in the last quarter,
but saying they would not reach the level for the same period of
1996 when prices soared to nearly 23 U.S. dollars in the world
market.

<HEADLINE> Party Congress as seen by Ordinary Chinese (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- At a meeting on Saturday
evening in east China, Wu Renbao, Party secretary of Huaxi
village, is telling villagers about the guidelines of Comrade
Jiang Zemin's speech at the opening of the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
"No changes have been made in the Party guidelines and
policies," he tells the 1,000 people gathered in Huaxi Village in
Jiangyin city of Jiangsu province, "If there were changes, they
were to emancipate our minds and deepen the reforms. The changes
are to make things better and better."
</P>
<P>
The village's most rapid development has come since the 14th
Party Congress in 1992. What it has earned in the past five years
is equal to what it earned in the entire 30-year period before the
Congress. Its collective assets have gone from 500 million yuan
(60 million US dollars) in 1992 to 1.2 billion yuan (145 million
U.S. dollars) now.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the villagers shared their ideas about Jiang's report
with the others, saying that they saw new economic opportunities
coming from the Congress and agreeing that Huaxi must look for
chances. They say that they will build their area into an even
more beautiful paradise for farmers.
</P>
<P>
At a job information center in Shanghai, a middle-aged woman
named Bao Cuiying is job hunting in front of a computer. "The
issue of reform and development of the state-owned enterprises
discussed by the Congress has long been expected," she said,
noting she was glad to hear that Comrade Jiang called for positive
and practical steps to be taken to protect laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China will follow up on its re-employment project by
offering job training and more employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"What Comrade Jiang said in the report is what we care most
about," Bao said.

<P>
Hu Kangzhen, a longtime employee of the Anshan Iron and Steel
Company, one of China's largest iron and steel complexes, shared
the idea of new reforms of the state-owned enterprises by relying
on the working class, in Jiang's report.
</P>
<P>
"The factory is the workers' home. To implement Jiang Zemin's
ideas is to use our own hands to revive our company without asking
for help or assistance from the state," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qianjiang, another employee of the company, said that
since the beginning of the 15th Congress on September 12, daily
iron smelting capacity at the iron works has been 22,250 tons, a
record. Noting that workers all came to work early and left late
because, he said "we know very well that the development of the
company is related to the personal involvement of every worker."
</P>
<P>
Qiaodun Brewery in Zhejiang province's Wenzhou is the city's
first company to experiment with the share-holding system. The
venture was first established in 1985 by 81 farmers. Wu Zuzhong,
its director, was elected by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
When the venture proved to be a great success in the late
1980s, the city began to let more ventures become share-holders.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he had discussed Comrade Jiang's speech with the
workers and, "since the Party central committee has confirmed the
share-holding enterprises, we will run our venture better without
worrying about a change in policies."
</P>
<P>
Li Shanfen, deputy manager of Shanghai's China No.1 Pencil
Company Ltd., said that Jiang's report was a scientific
elaboration of the share-holding system, a form of organizing
capital.
</P>
<P>
Li cited the share-holding system as an effective way to
develop state-owned enterprises, and said her company became a
share-holding company in 1992 and its total assets have risen
10-fold over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress has become a hot topic on
campuses, too. Huang Yingyi, a senior student of prestigious
Qinghua University, told reporters that she and her roommates all
talked the congress deep into the night over the past few days.

<P>
Huang, who is from the city of Changde in central-south China's
Hunan province, saw during the summer vacation that people back
home were trying to deal with the difficulties they faced. "It's
good that Comrade Jiang has clarified the ambiguities in the
share-holding system in his report," she said, noting that her
worker parents could understand the system better and relax a
little bit.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Qi, also at Qinghua, still remembers the slogan calling
for young people to devote themselves to the country's
prosperity. It become popular among Qinghua students in the spring
of 1979 when China had just launched its reform and opening-up
drive. Although it's old, it's not out of date, she said.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping opened up the path for building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. Jiang Zemin made clear that China would
hold the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory high, and under
these circumstances, Jiao believes that revitalizing China will
work if everyone takes part.
</P>
<P>
Wenzhou, in east China, is known as the cradle of business
talent. Where there's a market, there are people from Wenzhou;
Where there is no market, people from Wenzhou will make one. The
city's seven million urban and rural residents have over 45
billion yuan (5.4 billion U.S. dollars) deposited in the
bank. Foreign currency deposits amount to 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Li Yuesheng, director of a switch plant in Wenzhou, said
that he found both markets and opportunities for his factory in
Jiang's speech.
</P>
<P>
"The economic system reform, which will continue after the
Congress, will promote economic growth," Li said, adding, "Jiang
said that the ownership structure will be adjusted and perfected,
and this will be a very good chance for us."
</P>
<P>
As a private entrepreneur, Li is not afraid to extend his
business. What he worries most about is whether the country's
policy will be changed or not.
</P>
<P>
"Once the status and role of the private businesses are
recognized, we'll make an all-out effort to transform the city's
power network and bring benefits to society," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Diary of Party Congress Delegates (Sept. 16) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- (At Xinhua's request, some
delegates to the current 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) write what they see, discuss and think during
the congress in the form of a diary, which we think will provide
outsiders with some information about this major event. The
following diary, the sixth of its kind, was written by Tian Peifa,
principal of a poor village school in southwest China's Guizhou
Province. -- Ed.)
</P>
<P>
I almost jumped to joy when Comrade Jiang Zemin said in his
report delivered at the opening session of the 15th National Party
Congress that China will give priority to education in its
development strategy.
</P>
<P>
In the evening of September 12, the day the Party congress
opened, we congress delegates were invited to visit Tian'anmen
Rostrum. The glittering lights in Tian'anmen Square and smiling
faces of visitors reminded me of the children and teachers in my
village school. How I wished they could have come with me to see
the picturesque scene in the country's capital city.
</P>
<P>
At that thought, I bought each teacher a souvenir coin bearing
the logo of Tian'anmen Rostrum to encourage them to work harder
for the Party so that they could come to visit Beijing.
</P>
<P>
My county is situated at the foot of the Wuling Mountain,
northeast Guizhou Province. Bordering Hunan and Chongqing, my
county, inhabited by 560,000-odd people, many of whom are of the
Miao ethnic group, is one of the country's poorest counties.
</P>
<P>
The town where I come from has only one junior middle school
built in the 1970s. Only 100 out of every 400 to 500 primary
school graduates can continue their study in the middle school.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate more children to continue their study, the
county and township governments tried hard to raise funds for
education.
</P>
<P>
In Dapeng Village, Niulang Town, where I have been working,
villagers raised 70,000 yuan for the construction of a primary
school. Early this year, the county and town governments set aside
another 160,000 yuan to build a middle school. The county
government has decided to build another modern high school for
people of ethnic minorities. I'm excited at the thought. My home
village is hopeful although it is still poor.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Expected to Rise in 1997-98 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Limited supply and increased
demand were expected to spur the eastern market indicator for wool
up almost 9 percent to an average 483 U.S. cents a clean kilogram
over the 1997-98 fiscal year beginning July 1, the official chief
commodity forecaster said here today.
</P>
<P>
The latest forecast in the September quarterly commodity
publication of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics (ABARE) is well up from the 650 Australian cents (469
U.S. cents)/kg prediction of the June quarter.
</P>
<P>
ABARE noted the eastern market indicator was likely to fall
from current levels.
</P>
<P>
"The higher average price is expected to result from increased
demand for raw wool, a lower Australian dollar and little change
in the quantity of Australian wool supplied to the market," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The average price was tipped to have a 75 percent chance of
being in the 458-519 U.S. cents/kg range, reflecting market
uncertainty and fluctuating factors influencing supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
The western market indicator was forecast to rise 7.5 percent
to 444 U.S. cents, up from the 600 Australian cent (433 U.S.
cents) prediction of the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said Australian shorn wool production should reach
650,000 tons in 1997-98, as increased sales from private stocks
were offset by lower Wool International sales.
</P>
<P>
Despite increased competition from cotton and synthetics, raw
wool demand was anticipated to rise slightly due to rebuilding of
pipeline stocks and improved retail demand in key wool consuming
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fine wool exports were expected to rise, especially to Italy
and China.
</P>
<P>
In China, overall stocks at some stages in the processing
pipeline were high, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Raw wool demand could pick up as stocks ran down, probably
leading to total wool use remaining unchanged in China on 1996-97
levels, it said.
</P>
<P>
Raw wool demand in Japan was expected to continue to improve as
restocking continued.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 300 people have
been killed, 60,000 displaced in the district of Kasese in
western Uganda, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing the records of local councils in the district, The New
Vision said that more than 200 people have been murdered since
last November when the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels
invaded into the district from former Zaire. Other 80 people have
been killed in ADF raids on the villages in the district.
</P>
<P>
Moses Otwiili, an officer of the criminal investigation
department in the district, noted that the records are not
complete, with many murder cases not recorded.
</P>
<P>
Bamusede Bwambale, a local council official in the district,
told a gathering Sunday that there are some 60,000 displaced
people in the district.
</P>
<P>
"Families are starving almost to death and in some areas
children are dying," he said.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a rebel group haunting in Kasese district which has
some 350 members now, a recent official report said.
</P>
<P>
It invaded Uganda from former Zaire last November with its
1,500 fighters. Recent reports indicated that some of its
remnants are trying to seek a hideout in east Congo under the
circumstance of renewed fighting in the area between the
government troops and some rebels here.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges Diplomats to Attract Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (xinhua) -- zambia has urged its
diplomats abroad to attract foreign investors who will come and
expand the production base in Zambia, a financial weekly paper
published here reported today.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a team of Zambian diplomats who have been accredited
to various countries as trade commissioners, Mwansa Musonda,
Executive Director of the Export Board of Zambia, called on the
diplomats to source more foreign investors who will invest
heavily in export production in the country so that enough stocks
can be produced for the export market.
</P>
<P>
"Please help us source more production oriented investors who
will come and increase our exports so that we can meet the rising
demand in foreign markets," said Musonda.
</P>
<P>
He intimated that there are ready markets for almost all
products exported from Zambia although the volumes needed to be
increased according to demand.
</P>
<P>
Musonda singled out the agricultural sector which he said has
enormous potential for expansion since the country has vast
arable land and easily accessible water for commercial
production.
</P>
<P>
The agro-processing sub-sector is another area with immense
potential for increased earnings because of the value added to
the end product, Musonda said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the diplomats will work tirelessly in their
countries of accreditation to woo more foreign direct investors
into Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Moves to Protect Ozone Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will soon pass a law
to regulate the importation of secondhand fridges and compressors
with chloro-floro carbon (CFC) refrigerants gases which have been
responsible for the depletion of ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Environment Minister William
Harrington as saying here Monday that "the task ahead of us calls
for behavioral change in terms of industrial production
techniques, the need to ensure importation and purchase of
friendly items like CFC-free fridges, refraining from acquiring
secondhand fridges and fridge components while using CFC
refrigerants."
</P>
<P>
He said the government has raised alarm at the large
quantities of refrigerators which are environmentally unfriendly
being dumped in Zambia from European countries.
</P>
<P>
The trend of importing environmentally unfriendly technology
and chemicals must come to an end, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia is a signatory to the U.N. Montreal Protocol
which restricts use of chlorine- and bromide-containing chemicals
and Zambia should abide by the rules.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that since the problem of ozone layer
depletion has become a real threat to the environment, animals
and human beings, it is inevitable that there are concerted
efforts in fighting against the trend.
</P>
<P>
Harrington called for total cooperation from the entrepreneurs
and industries concerned if the government's efforts to
contribute to the preservation of ozone layer are to be realized.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan-born Party Delegate Impressed by China's Changes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Today is the Mid-Autumn
Festival, a traditional Chinese festival for family reunions. Lin
Mingyue, a CPC delegate, who was born in Taiwan and educated in
the United States, tells her story.
</P>
<P>
Lin, who returned to China 17 years ago, was impressed that her
motherland has become stronger and stronger day by day and she is
proud of her participation in bringing about such changes.
</P>
<P>
Lin returned to China with her husband and son in 1980 when
many Chinese youth were fighting to get an American visa. "It's my
emotion and confidence in China that prompted me to return to my
motherland," said Lin.
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Deng Xiaoping's visit to the United States stirred a
China boom in the US. Lin was then confident that China, which
began reforms and opening-up, would become stronger in several
years to come and the cause of the peaceful reunification of the
motherland would be surely achieved.
</P>
<P>
In December 1979, Lin and her husband, Fan Zengsheng, applied
for a visa with the Chinese Embassy in the United States although
each of them had a secured job in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we returned to Shanghai, we applied with the local
government to give up my son's American nationality and join the
Chinese nationality," Lin recalled.
</P>
<P>
"But unexpectedly, the government official who received us
advised us not to do so, saying that it would be more convenient
for him to visit our relatives in the United States and Taiwan
later with his American visa," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Though it is a trifle, it moved very much. this showed the
government's care about and confidence in us Taiwan compatriots,"
she added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Expresses Desire in Joining APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga today expressed her country's interest in
joining the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga, who arrived here on Monday on a four-day visit,
voiced the desire during her meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad here today, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi said at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Badawi said that on this point, Mahathir told the Sri
Lankan president that there was no decision to expand the
membership (of APEC) at this time but when the time came Malaysia
would give its support to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga told Mahathir that Sri Lanka would propose that
Malaysia be included in the Group of 24 (G24) since there was a
vacancy, Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two leaders also touched on other
international issues including promoting closer ties between ASEAN
(the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), of which Malaysia is
a member, and the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), of which Sri Lanka is a member.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that on human right issues, Mahathir explained
Malaysia's view and the Sri Lankan president agreed there was
ground to review the declaration on human rights made by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"This means that there is support from Sri Lanka in the
matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also discussed with the Sri Lankan president the share
and financial market.
</P>
<P>
Badawi said that Mahathir explained how manipulation of
currency had caused hardships to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral issues, both leaders agreed to enhance bilateral
ties, including expanding cooperation in the fields of economy,
investment, training and information technology.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has sought Malaysia's cooperation to train its
officers in line with its move to reform its Civil Service and
Malaysia was prepared to provide such training.

<P>
After Lin settled down in Shanghai, she started making
preparations for an information center in Shanghai Port Authority.
She has since then served as director and senior engineer of the
center which employs more than 50 people.
</P>
<P>
Lin's engagement with the Chinese Communist Party dated back to
June 30, 1981, when she and her husband were invited to a party
marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of the CPC sponsored by
the Shanghai Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
"The celebrations were solemn," she recalled. Later, she
attended lectures about the goals and obligations of the CPC and
carefully studied the Party Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"I was especially touched by the fine moral character and
dedication of the Party members of my center. And a year later, my
husband and I handed in our applications to join the Party," she
said.
</P>
<P>
In March 1985, Lin was admitted into the Party and several
months later, her husband, now deputy head of Shanghai Port
Authority, also joined the Party.
</P>
<P>
Lin owed her success in career to her good luck, excellent
opportunity and her own dedication to work. "I'm lucky that my
bosses have attached great importance to science and technology
and know how to judge and use people," she said, adding that
China's reforms and opening-up have provided her a chance to
give full play to her talent.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, Lin and her husband were often sent
abroad for public missions. "I was the head almost in every
mission or study and I have the final say in some negotiations,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Lin went back to the United States with her husband
and son to join their family members in the States. She was told
later that the Taiwan authorities had tried several times to
persuade her to go back to work in Taiwan through her younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, her father died in Taiwan. And Lin went back to Taiwan
where she had left for more than 20 years. But her husband's entry
was rejected by the Taiwan authorities because of his position,
and for this, she still feels regretful today.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Oil Minister Predicts Higher World Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issa
Al-Mazidi has predicted a high global oil demand for the last
quarter of this year in view of the fall in petroleum reserves of
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Quoted in today's Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam in an interview,
the minister said that the world oil demand for the period is
likely to reach 76 million barrels per day, more than three
percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
He said he has information that "the petroleum reserves in a
number of industrial states and the United States fell during the
past three months."
</P>
<P>
The industrialized states would feed their reserves "as they
usually do every winter, thus resulting in the increase of
demand," Al-Mazidi said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "this situation will result in maintaining the
current prices this month and the following month."
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have remained strong despite the return of
U.N. sanction-hit Iraq to the market and a slackening in seasonal
demand in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of 1997, the price of OPEC's
basket of seven crudes averaged around 18.9 U.S. dollars per
barrel, one of their highest levels in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the prices would strengthen in the last quarter,
but saying they would not reach the level for the same period of
1996 when prices soared to nearly 23 U.S. dollars in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Al-Mazidi noted "the Iraqi petroleum sold on the
market affects prices" marginally.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal which came into effect last
December, the U.N. allows Baghdad to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil in six months to buy food and medicine badly needed
sanction-ridden Iraq. The deal has been renewed for another six
months.

<HEADLINE> 10 Dengue Cases Confirmed in Delhi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The total number of dengue
patients in the Indian capital of New Delhi has increased to 10 as
two more confirmed cases being reported in a major government
hospital, The Hindustan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kiran Dambalkar, chief medical officer of the Delhi Dengue
Control Cell, said the All India Institute of Medical Sciences
(AIIMS) has confirmed that two Delhi residents, a 19-year-old girl
and a 28-year-old man, were suffering dengue.
</P>
<P>
According to the Dengue Control Cell, the number of suspected
dengue cases in the capital is 70.
</P>
<P>
The doctors are reportedly sending all fever cases for testing
because the local authorities have threatened to prosecute doctors
who do not report dengue patients.
</P>
<P>
The dengue virus is transmitted into the human body by the bite
of the aedes mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
An epidemic of the disease in New Delhi last year claimed
nearly 300 lives.

<P>
ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel left here today for Egypt on an one-day working visit
aimed at expanding bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the press before his departure, Demirel said that
he will discuss with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak means of
further enhancing cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that they will also exchange views over the latest
development in the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish leader declined to say whether he will explain to
his Egyptian counterpart the Israeli-Turkish-U.S. joint naval
maneuvers scheduled to start on November 16 in the eastern
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here, however, believed that the joint
naval war games are the top priority on Demirel's agenda.
</P>
<P>
The planned tripartite exercise had triggered strong
criticism among Egypt and other Arab nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Demirel called off a planned visit to Egypt in May due to
alleged technical reasons. At that time, Turkey was accused by
some Arab nations, including Egypt, of violating Iraq's
sovereignty when Ankara launched a massive cross-border military
strike agaisnt the outlawed Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) in
northern Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, China's largest
special economic zone (SEZ), has set new goals for further
development as encouraged by the report Jiang Zemin delivered to
the on-going Party congress.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Wang Xiaofeng, deputy governor of
the southernmost Chinese island province, said that Hainan will
step up the re-organization of state sector and transformation
through shareholding so as to improve economic performance of the
state sector.
</P>
<P>
Wang said Hainan has been hit by fund shortage, which Wang
deemed as a superficial factor in its economic development. The
key reason for this, he said, is the poor quality in economic
operations.
</P>
<P>
According to the deputy governor, the province, which was a
paradise of speculations in early 1990s, had gone out of "bubble
economy". Though its economic growth has slowed down, the quality
has greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of the construction sector in GDP has dropped.
More multinational companies have flocked to Hainan with more
foreign investment diverted from real estate to industrial
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
After five years of structural readjustment, he said,
Hainan has full capacities for large scale development. The
province has become one of the best provinces with surplus
power output, most condensed highway system and best telecom
facilities, he said.

<HEADLINE> Delegates Stress Importance of Party Building (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Currently, the number of Party members who joined the Party
before the founding of new China in 1949 only accounts for a
little over two percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a large number of young and middled-aged
people have joined the Party. It is estimated that the number of
leading officials of the prefectural level under the age of 40
have exceeded 1,300, while those of the county level also below 40
is approaching 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The participation of young cadres in the leading bodies has
improved the age pattern of the leadership. So far, the
overwhelming majority of those young cadres have proved to be
competent for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
"But the younger generation of cadres should be fully aware
that they lack experience of revolutionary struggles and have not
be thoroughly tempered through rigorous tests," Zhang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He called for effective measures to solve some outstanding
problems concerning ideology and work styles of Party members,
especially leading officials above the county-level.
</P>
<P>
The delegates fully supported the idea that overall Party
building demands each Party member make himself more revolutionary
through his own efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We should be aware of our tasks in the new historical period
and conscientiously keep in full agreement with the Central Party
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core," said Wu Yi, minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- To advance the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics in an all-round
way to the 21st century, it is essential to uphold, strengthen and
improve the leadership of the Party and do well in Party building.
</P>
<P>
This is the general view shared by the delegates to the
on-going 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Party building is one of the most heated topics at the congress
which opened here on September 12.
</P>
<P>
Now that the Party is leading the Chinese people in building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the question of what kind

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on US to Change Policy Toward Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's official English daily
Tehran Times today called on the United States to change its
attitude toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
An editorial carried by the newspaper said "it is time the
U.S. reconsidered its policy toward Iran to pave way for Iran to
reassess its U.S. policy."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that it is the first time since
Iranian-U.S. relations were cut off in 1980 that an Iranian
foreign minister says that Tehran is ready to negotiate with the
United States under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said at a press conference
Monday that "we believe the Americans are not sincere in their
stated desire to talk to us. We are for understanding and
negotiations, but will do so if there is mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the paper said, the United States must change its
attitude toward Iran. "If Washington fulfills the conditions
that Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi enumerated in his press
conference, its attitude toward Iran will automatically change."
</P>
<P>
The paper urged the United States to take a few steps to
prove its sincerity in negotiation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
-- Stop accusations against Iran for seeking nuclear weapons,
opposing peace process in the Middle East and violating human
rights;
</P>
<P>
-- Release Iran's assets frozen by the United States after
the Islamic revolution in 1979;
</P>
<P>
-- Lift economic sanctions on Iran.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dairy, Beef Exports Expected to Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The value of Australia's
dairy product exports is expected to rise 17 percent this year to
a record of just under 2 billion Australian dollars (1.44 billion
US dollars), an official forecaster said today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE) today attributed the increase in the value of dairy
exports to the expected growth in the world dairy product prices.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has forecast a 17.3 percent increase in the value of
dairy product exports, on last year's exports, to 1.998 billion
Australian dollars (1.442 billion US dollars) for 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
"Reflecting the expected growth in the world dairy prices,
Australia's returns from exporting butter, cheese and milk powder
are forecast to increase by 3 percent in 1997," ABARE said in its
September quarter commodity publication.
</P>
<P>
Butter exports are expected to increase 9 percent in value to
113 million US dollars, cheese exports by 9.3 percent to 212
million US dollars, whole milk powder by 7.5 percent to 103
million US dollars and skim milk powder by 8.1 percent to 173
million US dollars, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
ABARE today also predicted Australian lamb prices were set to
decline 5 percent to 149 US cents a kilogram, mainly due to higher
production.
</P>
<P>
Dry conditions were expected to result in continued high
slaughtering of sheep and cattle over 1997-98, it explained.
</P>
<P>
It said depreciation of the Australian dollar and tightening of
feeder cattle supply in the United States were expected to boost
beef prices.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian saleyard indicator price for beef is forecast
to increase by 13 US cents a kilogram to average 122 US cents a
kilogram in 1997-98," the current financial year beginning July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Live cattle exports, sourced mainly from northern Australia
for Southeast Asia markets, were expected to jump about 8 percent
in 1997-98 to a record 930,000 head.
</P>
<P>
Australian beef exports to Japan were only expected to
increase 3 percent in 1997-98 due to higher US exports of grainfed
beef, favored by importers, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Beef exports to the US, Indonesia and the Philippines were
forecast to rise by 5 percent, 7.5 percent and 7.5 percent,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Turkish-U.S. War Games to Start November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The controversial
Israeli-Turkish-U.S. joint naval maneuvers are to start on
November 16 off the Israeli coast in the eastern Mediterranean,
local newspaper Turkish Daily News said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted reliable military officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, as saying that warships belonging to the
three countries are expected to gather at the Israeli port of
Haifa on November 14 and 15.
</P>
<P>
The joint military exercises will end on November 23,
according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite war games are aimed at improving cooperation
among the three navies in search-and-rescue operations, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish military delegation will visit Israel next month to
make specific arrangements for the exercises, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Although earlier statements said that the war games are open to
other countries, the military officials declined to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
The planned maneuvers had prompted severe criticism from some
Arab nations, which accused Turkey, also a Muslim country, of
betraying the interests of the Muslim world by siding with Arab's
political rival of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been trying to assure its Arab neighbors that the
tripartite exercises are not directed against any other country,
saying it is "a search-and-rescue operation" devoid of any
strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
"We think that the reactions which emerged are probably based
on the fact that the real objectives of the exercises are not well
understood," a Turkish Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed two defense and military agreements with Israel
last year to allow, among other things, both countries' planes to
train in each other's airspace.

<HEADLINE> Price Rise Down in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region
reported a drop in the retail price increase to 3.9 percent in
July from 5.2 percent earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the retail price index and cost of living
index dropped 3.1 and 2.2 percentage points, respectively, on a
year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The price of food, cigarettes, beverage and drinks, Chinese and
Western medicines, machinery, and electronic products dropped a
great deal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the drop in price increase to the good
economic conditions and the declining inflation rate, since 85
percent of the region's supplies are brought in from other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The adequate supplies have also played a role in bringing down
prices, they noted.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wheat Output to Fall to 16.2 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia was poised to
produce a wheat crop of just 16.2 million tons in the 1997-98
fiscal year (beginning July 1, 1997), about 3 million tons less
than hoped for in March, the Australian government's chief
commodity forecaster said today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics
(ABARE)' forecast in its September quarter commodity publication
was unchanged on its Crop Report estimate released earlier this
month, which blamed widespread dry conditions for the wheat drop.
</P>
<P>
Wheat exports are tipped to reap 2.486 billion Australian
dollars (1.794 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997-98, down from the
2.509 billion Australian dollar (1.811 billion dollars) estimate
of the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The pool return for Australian standard white wheat in the
current fiscal year was still expected to reach about 140 U.S.
dollars, down 3.61 U.S. dollars a ton from last year's return.
</P>
<P>
ABARE said the main world indicator price, the U.S. hard red
winter wheat, was forecast to average between 148 U.S. dollars and
180 U.S. dollars a ton in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The most likely outcome was for prices to average 5 percent
lower than last year at 170 U.S. dollars a ton, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Despite large wheat crops in China, the U.S. and Europe, lower
production in Australia, Canada and Argentina was expected to
result in slightly lower world production in 1997-98 of 575
million tons, it said.
</P>
<P>
Australia achieved a record 23.6 million tons in wheat
production in 1996-97, the previous fiscal year ending June 30,
1997.
</P>
<P>
ABARE today sharply revised downwards the amount of rice
expected to be produced in Australia over 1997-98, citing static
world prices and substantially lower water allocations expected in
the state of rice-producing New South Wales for the unspecified
fall.
</P>
<P>
In its June quarter forecasts, it believed rice production
would remain at 1.4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
It said good returns and abundant water supplies should enable
Australia to produce a record 403,000 hectares in cotton planting
in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
"Assuming average seasonal conditions and average yields, a
harvest of 606,000 tons of lint is forecast for 1997-98 (up 5.2
percent from 1996-97)," the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also said Australia's sugar production and exports
are both expected to rise this year following falls in production
in other major sugar producing areas.
</P>
<P>
Sugar production is expected to rise 3.3 percent from 5.4
million tons in 1996-97 to 5.6 million tons this year in Australia
and the country's sugar exports are forecast to rise over 5
percent in 1997-98 valued at 1.15 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Reform To Be Expedited (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The on-going 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China has made a theoretical
breakthrough in the nature and role of shareholding system, which
is to accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the industrial circles shared the view: the
Congress has gone beyond the scope that the public sector of the
economy not only comprises the state- and collectively-owned
sectors, but also the state- and collectively-owned elements in
the sector of mixed ownership. It is a form of capital
organization of modern enterprises, which is favorable for
separating ownership from management and raising the efficiency of
the operation of enterprises and capital.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Ruimin, general manager of the Haier Group in Qingdao,
Shandong Province, said the theory on public ownership in Jiang
Zemin's report made at the opening session of the 15th Party
Congress will help to broaden our vision on China's enterprise
reform, serving as a strategic program document guiding the reform of
state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
After the conclusion of the 15th party Congress, the process in
which large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises will be
turned into corporations will be accelerated, said another
delegate.
</P>
<P>
Liu Haiyan, a manager of Beijing-based Yanshan Petro-chemical
Corporation, said the global competition of national strength is
mainly reflected among large enterprises and enterprise groups.
The introduction of the shareholding system will help to enhance
the strength of state-owned firms by raising funds through forming
enterprise groups.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Plans Crackdown on Border Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
planned a crackdown on smuggling to protect the domestic market
from being gutted by contraband that posed a threat to the
national economy, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
It will be a well-coordinated drive, to be launched shortly,
said a senior security official, adding that a coordination team
comprising various agencies like the National Security
Intelligence, police and customs is under consideration.
</P>
<P>
To control illegal cross border trade, the government is also
taking step to revive the joint checkpoints of various
law-enforcing agencies which were folded up in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken several other steps to strengthen the
anti-smuggling drive, including raising 15 new Border Out Posts
(BOPs), constitution of a committee to amend the anti-smuggling
laws, setting up central information cell in the capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to police the 4,427 kilometer border with 496
BOPs manned by about 14 personnel each to cover 8 to 10 kilometers
between two posts," said the official of Bangladesh Rifles, the
border security force of this India-surround country.
</P>
<P>
In this case, anti-smuggling mission could attain its goal by
mobilizing people's cooperation, amending anti-smuggling laws and
increasing security forces, he viewed.
</P>
<P>
People living in the border areas are involved in the smuggling
profession due to unemployment problem, but, on the other hand,
people in those areas also help provide information about
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"Without information it is very difficult to seize or recover
three major items -- gold, heroin and firearms," said the security
official.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Rifles recovered smuggled goods worth about 1.56
billion taka (about 35.5 million U.S. dollars) in 1995 and about
1.21 billion taka (27.5 million dollars) in 1996. And in the
current year, until August, it stood at 890 million taka (20.2
million dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's residents have
found some 60,000 ancient bricks since last October and turned
them in for a wall-restoration project.
</P>
<P>
Beijing used to have a wall around it that was put up during
the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Most of the wall was pulled down in
the 1960s as a result of massive urban expansion.
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's residents still regret the damages done to
the renowned historic site, which would have become a tourist
spot, so they began a campaign to turn in any old bricks they
found lying scattered about the city.
</P>
<P>
The activity has involved tens of thousands of residents,
including some foreigners working in the city. An exhibition of
the co-operative endeavor is being held to encourage people to
return the relics protection, "Beijing Daily" reports.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Hopes to Strengthen Cooperation With World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valern
Pustovoitenko said today that Ukraine hopes to enhance cooperation
with the World Bank in energy, the coal industry and agricultural
reforms, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko told Johannes Linn, visiting vice president of
the World Bank, that due to the present inability of Ukrainians to
make utility payments, Ukraine cannot raise energy prices as
required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine ranks sixth among the 10 main debtors of the World
Bank, from which it has received 989.6 million U.S. dollars in
loans and 220 million dollars in cash deposits.
</P>
<P>
Linn said the World Bank will allocate 500 million dollars in
loans to Ukraine before the end of this year as soon as both sides
reach agreements on a series of cooperation programs.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that within the past five years, the
World Bank has promised funding for more than 30 projects in
Ukraine, and the total amount of loans will eventually reach 5
billion dollars, including 1.5 billion dollars on eight projects
under construction.
</P>

Linn, who arrived here today, also met with Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma on structural reforms of the country's energy
sector.

NEW DELHI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the
train accident in India's Madhya Pradesh has gone up to 81 as more
bodies were recovered in rescue operations on Monday, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, unofficial sources put the death toll at about 100.

<P>
Five coaches of an express train fell from a bridge on Hansdeo
river in Bislaspur district, Madhya Pradesh on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Indian Railway Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Monday that
the accident could have been averted if the train driver had been
given timely information about track repair at the accident site.
</P>
<P>
He said the track repair near the site violated instructions
that no such work should be carried out after 5:00 p.m. The
accident occurred at about 6:50 p.m.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Advertising Industry Faces Negative Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's advertising
industry will most likely face its first year of negative growth
this year, according to industry sources.
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown and the government's belt-tightening
policy have hit many companies hard, forcing them to slash costs,
including advertising budgets.
</P>
<P>
The industry has set a target of six percent growth for this
year, but the growth could be minus, the Nation newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Last year's growth was on the back of rising media costs.
However, this year the severe macro-economic problems have caused
most media operators to lower their fees to attract buyers and
offer discount packages, such as "buy one, get one free."
</P>
<P>
This situation will certainly not bring about industry growth,
but only dampen expansion.
</P>
<P>
The negative growth view is shared by Rangsan Panpimanmas, an
associate media director of Prakit and FCB PLC.
</P>
<P>
Rangran said the present uncertainty makes it difficult to gain
a clear picture of the economic situation. There is no sign of
political stability and it is difficult to forecast the outcome
for the last quarter, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Re-talks About Canal Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's plan to build a
canal cross the Kra Isthmus, the narrowest point in southern
Thailand, is emerging again as the navy recently voiced its
support to it.
</P>
<P>
Thai navy commander Adm. Vijitr Chamnarnkarn Monday expressed
his support for Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's idea to
revive the plan and build the canal in Ranong province to link the
Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea.
</P>
<P>
The canal would provide a short-cut for shipping and help save
the state budget since Thai navy ships will no longer go round
Singapore when they want to travel from the Gulf of Thailand to
the Andaman Sea, Vijitr said.
</P>
<P>
The navy chief shrugged off fears that the canal would affect
national security, saying it would not generate problems like the
Suez and the Panama canals.
</P>
<P>
The canal would instead facilitate Thailand to deploy its
forces to protect its territorial waters, he was quoted as saying
by local newspapers.

DHAKA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh on Monday kicked off
a month-long anti-rat campaign, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi State Minister for Information ABU Sayeed
inaugurated the rat elimination drive at a function organized by
the Agricultural Extension Directorate.

Speaking on the occasion, the state minister described rats as

rodents destroy thousands of tons of grains every year, spread
diseases and damage daily usables and preserved items.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 1.4 million Bangladeshi farmers, students and people
from other strata killed some three million rats. As a result,
about 22,000 tons of rice were saved, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
Widespread public awareness is the main pre-requisite for
making the rat elimination drive a success, Sayeed stressed.
</P>
<P>
The state minister urged scientists to find easy and cheap
rat-killing methods.

ROME, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Italy today issued a
new bill of 500,000 lire, the equivalent of some 290 U.S. dollars
and five times the value of Italy's previously largest banknote.
</P>
<P>
The 500,000 lire bill, which bears a self-portrait of the
Italian Renaissance artist Raphael and two other paintings by him,
was presented by Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in the central
Italian city of Urbino, the artist's home town.
</P>
<P>
The Italian central bank printed 30 million of the new bills,
which will reach the public Tuesday and are expected to reduce the
total number of bills in circulation by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new bank note immediately incurred criticism and doubts, as
Italians have worried that issuing new bills will result in much
inflation, before Italy adopts the European single currency in
1999, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The local press said people were also concerned that the
currency is so big in face value that it might bring about
inconvenience in use.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai economic ministers have
turned down a plan to set up a 30 billion baht (833 million U.S.
dollars) fund to rescue the ailing property sector through the
government-owned National Housing Authority (NHA).
</P>
<P>
At their routine council meeting on Monday, the economic
ministers believed that the plan, proposed by the Interior
Ministry, would violate a condition signed with the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), according to the nation today.
</P>
<P>
One of the conditions imposed by the IMF is that the public
sector cannot buy or assist private sector businesses.
</P>
<P>
The proposed fund was designed for October 1, with a plan to
buy houses and buildings from property developers for resale to
low-income earners.
</P>
<P>
The NHA has been ordered to discuss the matter further with
Deputy Prime Minister Virabongsa Ramangura and Finance Minister
Thanong Bidaya and to report the conclusion back to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's property sector has been in an ailing condition for
about four years. As a result, commercial banks and finance firms
are ridden with huge amounts of bad loans owned by developers.

</P>
<P>
Election organizers in Bosnia had said the two-day municipal
elections over the weekend had been conducted without serious
violence and had attracted a high voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular press briefing, State Department
spokesman James Foley said that the elections proves that the
U.S. policy of "carrots and sticks" towards Bosnia is "starting
to pay off."
</P>
<P>
He said that "tough sanctions" will be implemented in event of
non-compliance with the results of the elections held last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The threatened sanctions include denial of reconstruction aid
to municipalities that do not implement election results and
denial of travel privileges for officials who thwart the results,
added the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully determined to make full use of the tools
available to the international community to see that the aims of
Dayton (Agreement) are brought to fruition," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
province plans to speed up road construction to make all major
cities accessible in a three-hour ride from Hangzhou, the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Acting Governor Chai Songyue told a group of reporters from
Taiwan Province recently that the road-building program is open to
foreign investment in a number of ways like joint ventures,
co-operative firms, wholly-overseas owned companies, BOT
(Building-Operation-Transfer), and stock purchase.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has been one of the fastest developing provinces in
the country. In 1996, it ranked fifth with a GDP of 415 billion
yuan, which was up from 12th in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic development has resulted in traffic
bottlenecks, however. Since 1990, over 10 billion yuan has been
put into road-building. Over 4,000 km of highways have been built,
bringing the total figure to 34,000 km.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo
Expressway Joint Stock Co. Ltd. was listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and sold a third of its shares for 460 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The acting governor said that the Hong Kong listing has been a
good experience for the province in diversifying fund-raising
methods.

<HEADLINE> New Wharf to Ease Yangon Water Transport Congestion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 16 (Xinhua) -- A newly built wharf at Yangon
Port in Myanmar's capital will help ease water transport
congestion, said today's official paper The New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The 220-meter-long wharf, which was put into service Monday,
can handle three coastal passenger vessels, five cargo boats and
four sea-going ships at one time.
</P>
<P>
The wharf is capable of handling 100,000 tons of cargo yearly
and over 80,000 passengers can be transported.
</P>
<P>
Yangon Port, Myanmar's main gateway to the world, was built
before the Second World War, and it now handles 90 percent of the
country's exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar began practicing a market-oriented economy in the
late 1980s, the volume of export and import has increased sharply.
Seaborne trade passing through the ports of Myanmar was seven
million tons in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending March, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
To promote freight transport, a new 17-wharf Myanmar
international port -- Thilawa Port -- is being built near Yangon
with investments from three foreign firms.

<HEADLINE> Thai Foreign Reserves at 25.9 Bln Dollars in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's foreign exchange
reserves have dropped to 25.9 billion U.S. dollars by August 29,
the Bank of Thailand said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure included 1.6 billion dollars in credits recently
drawn from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Thai central
bank was quoted as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The bank earlier announced that the country's foreign reserves
stood at 27.9 billion dollars as of August 14, which meant the
reserves could have decreased by 3.6 billion dollars if without
the IMF aid.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decline in reserves was largely attributed to
the maturing of those currency forward contracts in late August.
</P>
<P>
The contracts were signed in mid-May this year when the central
bank moved to counter-attack speculations against the baht, they
added.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank last month said Thailand's forward
obligations totaled 23.4 billion dollars over the coming 12 months
starting on August 19, including 14.8 billion offshore.

BEIJING, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal
Government has announced a ban on outdoor stands that broil food,
in a bid to reduce air pollution and clean up the environment.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants are also prohibited from cooking outdoors to
attract more customers, and those that specialize in roasted,
fried, or broiled foods need to have a hood with a fan and an air
filter system to reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came last Monday from the Beijing Urban
Environment Management Office, the Municipal Administration for
Industry and Commerce, and the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Outdoor food stalls have been a common sight on Beijing streets
now for many years, and most of the vendors do not have the
necessary permits and cannot guarantee the hygiene of the food or
their equipment. Some even put their stands along roads, blocking
traffic, and increasing the risk from accidents.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Businessmen Less Optimistic About Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Filipino businessmen have
become less optimistic about the country's economic prospects due
to the financial turmoil sweeping Southeast Asia and the political
uncertainties arising from charter change movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Business World reported today that a third
of 115 businessmen surveyed by the influential Makati Business
Club expected the gross national product (GNP) this year to be
worse compared with the impressive 6.8 percent registered last
year.
</P>
<P>
This was a sharp turnaround from the results of a survey the
club made in January, in which 78.2 percent of the businessmen
projected this year's growth rate to be higher with nobody
anticipating it to be worse than 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This reflects the least optimism in the economy dating back to
July 1994," said a statement released by the club, whose members
are mostly top executives of big enterprises in the country.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since President Fidel Ramos took power in
1992, the growth of GNP, the value of goods and services including
income from abroad, slowed down in the first half of this year to
5.9 percent from 7.5 percent in the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many blamed the slowdown on both the region-wide currency
meltdown and the political instability posed by the proposed
amendments to the 1987 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The business community has complained that the Ramos
administration has talked too much about Charter changes instead
of the development of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos still keeps open his option whether he would
run again when his term ends next year, prompting opponents of
charter change moves to call a mass rally on September 21.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The Andean Community (AC) is
looking forward to strengthening ties with other trade blocs and
integrating itself into the global trade system, said an official
of the trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
AC Secretary-General Sebastian Alegrett told the press that the
Lima-based trade bloc, which groups Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru and Venezuela, sees it as a priority to step up free trade
negotiations with other hemispheric trading blocs and move toward
the goal of setting up a Free Trade Area of Americas (FTAA) by
2005.
</P>
<P>
"We have been loyal to the criteria of `open regionalism', so
we are looking forward to becoming related with Mercosur, the
Caribbean and Central America, to which we already have started to
approach," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Andean countries are strengthening their economy to
prepare for the creation of a free trade zone in the Western
Hemisphere, which is under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
He called for a quicker integration of the AC and the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur) which groups Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay with Chile and Bolivia being its associate members.
</P>
<P>
He said that the negotiations between the AC and Mercosur on
the rules governing their free trade talks have been successful,
he said, adding that talks will resume Tuesday on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
Alegrett said the signing of the Group of Three (G-3) Accord by
Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico was a success of the Andean
Community.
</P>
<P>
He said the AC will also move to enhance ties with the United
States and Europe on trade and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nuclear Power Plant to Produce Tritium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission agreed for the first time today to allow its
Watts Bar nuclear power plant to produce tritium, a nuclear bomb
material through a commercial reactor, a move which critics say
will end its long-standing policy to bar civilian nuclear power
plants from making weapons.
</P>
<P>
The test could begin within weeks, the Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) will receive 7.5 million
U.S. dollars from the Department of Energy for the Watts Bar test,
which is intended to demonstrate that a commercial light-water
reactor can produce tritium, a radioactive hydrogen isotope,
without affecting its operation.
</P>
<P>
"Our own country is saying, `North Korea doesn't produce this
tritium product'. Why are we doing it in our own country?" said
John Noel from the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition.
</P>
<P>
Ralph Hutchison of the Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance
and Michelle Neal-Conlon of the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform
Coalition have sent a letter to TVA Chairman Craven Crowell
opposing the test.
</P>
<P>
"The separation of civilian and military nuclear power is a
cornerstone of U.S. international nonproliferation policy, which
will suddenly and completely vanish," they wrote.
</P>
<P>
"When the Watts Bar nuclear power plant loads tritium-producing
rods into its operating core, it becomes, to put it bluntly, a
bomb plant," they said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government shut down its heavy-water reactors at the
Savannah River site in South Carolina in 1988 and no new tritium
has been produced for weapons since then.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Department of Energy is under a presidential
directive to find a new source for tritium by 2005 to support the
nation's nuclear arsenal, the AP report said.

<HEADLINE> NGO: Ukraine Becoming Europe's Dumping Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine is facing the risk of
becoming Europe's dumping ground for toxic waste due to the lack
of control over transit shipments across its territory, Yury
Samiylenko, leader of a Ukrainian environmental protection
organization warned today.
</P>
<P>
Toxic and chemical wastes have been pouring into the country
under the cover of transit shipments. He accused the Ministry for
Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety of turning a blind eye
to such shipments.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from Samilylenko's non-governmental Ukrainian Green
Peace show that foreign wastes dumped in the country have reached
25 billion tons, of which more than 4 billion tons are categorized
as toxic. If divided by the area of Ukraine, this will make up
40,000 tons of foreign rubbish per square meter.
</P>
<P>
Samiylenko said that nobody wants to clean up the waste inside
the Ukrainian borders and no one is investigating the source of
the waste.
</P>
<P>
He also cast doubt over the behavior of Ukrainian customs
officials, saying that "Customs officials are experienced in
seizing smuggled alcohol and tobacco, but why should they give the
green light to foreign garbage?"

SHANGHAI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Xu Weijun, a college
graduate who works as a bank clerk, often spends weekends
and public holidays travelling, and explains, "Working with

</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Shanghai's citizens are doing like Miss
Xu and taking some time out of their busy schedules to travel.
</P>
<P>
Travel has become a fad. In 1996, on average Shanghai families
spent 527 yuan (63 US dollars) on travel and entertainment, 2.6
times the 1992 figure.
</P>
<P>
Local travel agencies say that more Shanghai people are
travelling by themselves rather than joining a tour group. More of
them are going longer distances, travelling by air, and their
food, lodging, and transport expectations are rising as well.
</P>
<P>
While the classic sights of nearby Jiangsu and Zhejiang
provinces, like the cities of Suzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo, have
always been popular with Shanghai residents, a growing number of
people are going farther away to places like Hainan Island, Mohe
in northernmost Heilongjiang Province, or to Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tours to Southeast Asia, Hongkong, and Macao have also become a
favored choice of people who are better-off.

today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The China National Biological Products Corp (CNBPC) attached to
the Ministry of Health, in co-operation with Shanghai Medical
University and foreign research centers, has already begun
researching into the new vaccine, said Jiang Huanbo, president of
the CNBPC.
</P>
<P>
He said their research is well underway, and he hoped for a
breakthrough in hepatitis B control in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Ministry of Health suggest that about ten percent
of the Chinese population carry hepatitis B virus, which is
transmitted through infected blood.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health began hepatitis B vaccine research in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Through expanded immunization, about 90 percent of urban
children are given hepatitis B vaccination immediately after
birth. The program has reduced the incidence rate of hepatitis B to
below one percent among children in urban areas. The immunization
rate among rural children has also increased.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 enterprises and institutions manufacture some 200
varieties of bio-pharmaceuticals in China, Jiang said.

</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina`s economy is expected to grow 5.8
percent and the public deficit might decrease from 4.5 billion
this year to 3.4 billion dollars in 1998, said Roque Fernandez,
the minister of economy and public works.
</P>
<P>
According to a budgetary report Fernandez will submit to

growth in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
He added that the inflation rate will post a 1.8 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Nicaragua's largest sugar mill, San Antonio
Chichilapa sugar mill, may lose more than 5 million U.S. dollars
this season due to the climatic phenomenon of "El Nino", said the
sugar company's vice manager, Joaquin Zavala.
</P>
<P>
Its output for 1997-98 harvest time is expected to reach 4
million quintals of sugar, he said. Due to damage caused by
droughts, the mill may suffer a loss of 10 percent of the expected
output, he added.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil`s state-owned oil company Petrobras

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Netherlands Expected to Decline in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed
people in the Netherlands will drop to 400,000 in 1998 thanks to
improved economic performances, a Dutch government press list
reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobs in the country will have grown by 465,000
during the term of the present government, which ends in May next
year, says Dutch News Monitor, a selected list of government press
releases.
</P>
<P>
The number of full-time jobs fluctuates around the 3.7 million
mark, while the number of part-time jobs has grown to 1.8 million,
according to the news list.
</P>
<P>
There are also some 700,000 people in the Netherlands, mostly
young workers, who are content with temporary work.
</P>
<P>
However, the aging of the workforce and the growth in the
number of people over 65 -- from more than two million in 1996 to
an estimated four million in 2040 -- will stand out as a thorny
issue in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Senna Trial to Re-start in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The trial over the death of
Brazilian Aryton Senna will be reopened in Imola, Italy on
Tuesday, with six men facing manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
The accused were team owner Frank Williams, technical director
Patrick Head and chief designer Adrian Newey, along with three
race officials at the 1994 San Marino race.
</P>
<P>
State prosecutor Maurizio Passarini said that Senna's modified
steering column failed as the triple world champion took the
Tamburello curve which smashed his car into a concrete wall at
high speed.
</P>
<P>
Passarini was to recall former Italian Formula One driver
Michele Alboreto to the witness box.
</P>
<P>
In a previous court appearace, Alboreto said he had not noticed
Senna making any particular correcting movements of the wheel,
which might indicate a steering column failure.
</P>
<P>
However, Passarini has since reportedly shown Alboreto a
better-defined tape of the same images, supplied by the sport's
ruling International Automobile Federation (FIA).
</P>
<P>
After watching these pictures, Alboreto was believed to have
revised his opinion and noticed Senna make a clearer sideways
movement at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
All six denied the charges which have a maximum sentence of
five years, the first ever to be levelled against a Formula One
team.

<HEADLINE> Pele Proposes Cleaning Up Sports in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Former world soccer star
Pele, now sports minister of Brazil, presented his contraversial
bill to Brazil's Congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bill aimed at cleaning up the Brazilian domestic soccer and
was facing a long and uncertain journey through Congress.
</P>
<P>
Pele's proposals have angered FIFA's Brazilian president Joao
Havelange. Havelange warned in August that if the bill was
approved Brazil would run the risk of being expelled from next
year's World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
Pele's proposals were to reduce the power of the Brazilian
Football Confeferation (CBF) and to turn soccer clubs into private
firms subject to strict financial laws.
</P>
<P>
The law would also tighten up refereeing, bypassing the CBF
which has been widely criticised for its handling of an alleged
referee-buying scandal earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The whole of Brazilian society is ashamed of what is going on
in sport, especially in soccer," said Pele.

<HEADLINE> Ghana, Spain Enter Semis at Under-17 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Reigning champion Ghana nipped
Oman 4-1 and Spain routed Egypt 2-1 on Monday, both securing their
semifinal berths at the seventh Under-17 World Championship in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Played in the Mediterranean city of Port Said, twice champion
Ghana displayed its superiority in physique and tactical skills
over Oman, the African fourth-ranked team in the previous U-17
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
The first half saw Ghana achieve a 2-0 advantage, including an
own goal from Omani Mahfoudh Sabir Al Mukhaini who scored his own
net in the 24th minute when he tried to clear a shot amid a
tangled fight.
</P>
<P>
In the 41st minute, Michael Coffie scored the second for Ghana
from a pass above the top of the penalty box, catching the Omani
goalie lying on the ground too late to save.
</P>
<P>
Oman fought back to score in the 57th minute with a clever
header by Salah Al-Amari.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Ghana's attacks showed no sign of recess and finally
sealed the game 4-1 with two more powerful kicks by Afriyie Owusu
and Quaye Awule in the 79th and 88th minutes.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Ghana sailed to the semifinals to meet Spain that
defeated Egypt in the fourth quarterfinal match played in the Suez
Canal city of Ismailia.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian eleven seemed determined to tread their line
cautiously at the outset while Spain, the 1991 U-17 World Cup
runner-up, concentrated more on avoiding rash moves.
</P>
<P>
In the 27th minute, Spain opened the account with a furious
start from the left which resulted in a clean kick into the net
before the Egyptians could hardly hurry up for their defense.
</P>
<P>
The hosts stepped up their tempo of offense and equalized three
minutes later as Ahmed Belel and Mohamed Abou el-Ela converted a
well-crafted pass into a powerful shot.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw more fierce attacks on both sides until
Juan Camacho scored the winner for Spain in the 65th minute.
Afterwards, the Egyptians were almost to make even but a kick hit
the post and rebounded out.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was thus kicked out of the championship that started on
September 4.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, runner-up at the U-17 World Cup, will play Germany in
Ismailia in the first semifinal on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Booming Xinjiang Border Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The Border Trade Market in
Horgos, a border town in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, is filled with business people and shoppers
bargaining in the Chinese, Uygur, Russian and Kazak languages.
</P>
<P>
Merchants from Russia and a number of Central Asian nations
fill bags, some of which are two meters long, with Chinese
cosmetics, clothing and other daily-use items.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned scenarios are a daily occurrence in the
market which is located in close proximity with the border of
Kazakstan. Ten years ago, Horgos was heavily fortified with
armed soldiers closely monitoring their counterpart's movements on
the other side of the borders.
</P>
<P>
The Horgos market, which covers 120,000 sq m and was built at a
cost of 70 million yuan, is only one of a dozen border markets
which have emerged along Xinjiang's 5,000 km of border with seven
Central Asian countries, Mongolia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the central government decided to open Yining, Tacheng
and Bole, as well as the regional capital city of Urumqi to
foreign traders, and later opened 12 border ports of entry,
including Horgos, Alataw and Paketu.
</P>
<P>
Border trade, which was nonexistant for decades due to
political reasons, has witnessed a new upsurge.
</P>
<P>
The markets have attracted numerous business people from
China's inland and coastal areas, as well as from neighboring
countries. Some 15,000 traders from the Commonwealth of
Independent States visited the Horgos market in the the first five
months this year alone.
</P>
<P>
One Kazak woman said she was unable to remember how many times
she had visited the market. She pointed to a bag filled with
children's shoes and said: "I can sell them for 1,000 US dollars
in just one week and earn 1,000 dollars."
</P>
<P>
Booming border trade has provided greatly increased local
revenues for Xinjiang's border areas which cover 10 prefectures and
33 counties and cities.
</P>
<P>
Official sources report that Xinjiang handled border trade
totaling 700 million US dollars in 1996 alone. Many local people
achieved prosperity from their participation in border trade and
related businesses.
</P>
<P>
The highway transport business has also flourished in
the area, with over 20 cargo and passenger transport routes
currently linking Xinjiang border towns with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Local economists note that the business corridor along the
border area is expected to become one of the most active market
belts in the world by early next century.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Australian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- An aggressive campaign to improve literacy in the early
school years was launched by the Australian government yesterday,
shackling 420 million U.S. dollars in national grants to the
states to the reduction of illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Australia will urgently send a team of experts to Papua New
Guinea to assess the plight of drought-stricken villagers in the
Highlands and other areas, and how best to help them. About
700,000 people in the country are reportedly suffering from a
widespread drought, part of worldwide El Nino effects.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Leaders from Pacific island states threatened by rising
ocean levels are warning Australia's strong opposition to binding
gas emission reduction levels could provoke regional protests as
strong as those against France over its nuclear testing. The
leaders are meeting ahead of Australian Prime Minister John
Howard's arrival in the Cook Islands tomorrow for an annual
regional forum.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- A surge in tax revenue from strong wages growth will give
the Australian federal government a 2.8 billion U.S. dollar budget
"war chest" to help sell its tax-reform package in the lead-up to
the next election late next year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Carpet Export Slides Down in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's export of
carpet, one major export item of the country, decreased by 6.5
percent in August this year compared with the corresponding month
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Carpet Manufacturers and
Exporters' Association, the total carpet export during the month
of August was to the tune of 11.62 million U.S. dollars whereas it
was 12.43 million dollars in August last year.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was termed by exporters as a result of withdrawal
of 47 percent rebate on the carpet exports by the government, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Pakistan's carpet export declined by 51
percent in June and 36 percent in July this year compared with the
corresponding months in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, export of textile, another major export item of
Pakistan, also showed a decline of around 51 million dollars in
August compared with the same period in 1996, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
However, the export of ready-made garments went up 2.4 percent
and cotton bags up 17.74 percent while synthetic fabrics
registered an increase of 6.35 percent in the month of August 1997
compared with the corresponding month in 1996, according to the
sources.

<HEADLINE> Cash Offer to HK Medalists at National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Medal winners of the Hong
Kong team at the forthcoming Eighth National Games of China will
be awarded cash incentives, it was learned here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The incentives are offered by the Sports Aid Committee of the
Hong Kong Sports Development Board (SDB) and matched by
locally-incorporated Hang Seng Bank on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
</P>
<P>
An individual event gold medalist of the games will be able to
walk away with a hefty sum of 300,000 HK dollars (38,462
U.S. dollars), while silver medal and bronze medal winners will
collect 150,000 HK dollars (19,230 U.S. dollars) and 60,000 HK
dollars (7,692 U.S. dollars) respectively, according to Andrew Ma,
SDB chief executive.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed cash awards for a gold medal winning team
which will pocket 420,000 HK dollars (53,846 U.S. dollars). A sum
of 240,000 HK dollars (30,769 U.S. dollars) will be offered to a
team silver medal and 120,000 HK dollars (15,385 U.S. dollars) to
a team bronze.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Hang Seng Bank joins the SDB in
offering cash incentives to outstanding Hong Kong athletes at
major games, said Ma. The bank had contributed more than 1 million
HK dollars (128,205 U.S. dollars) through the 1996 Olympics and
Paralympics Incentive Scheme.
</P>
<P>
The cash incentives, first introduced by the SDB in 1994 for
the Asian Games, have since been extended to cover the Olympics,
Paralympics, East Asian Games and World Universiade.
</P>
<P>
The National Games will be the sixth major games where cash
incentives are on offer.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the National Games for the first time, the
post-handover Hong Kong will be represented by a contingent of
262, including 169 athletes taking part in 20 sports.
</P>
<P>
The National Games, to be held in Shanghai, will feature more
than 13,000 athletes from 46 teams.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The New York stock market
turned down today, pressured by a selloff in technology shares.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.83 points to 7,721.14,
erasing the nearly 52-point gain in the earlier session.
Broad-market indexes also weakened late in the day.
</P>
<P>
An announcement of a three-month delay in the launching of
Microsoft's Windows 98 software triggered a selloff at the market.
</P>
<P>
The steep fall in Microsoft shares ignited the late-day
decline, and other major technology stocks soon followed,
including Intel, IBM and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues still outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 467.47 million
shares, down from 543.35 million Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 4.14 at 919.77, the
NYSE composite index fell 0.70 at 482.60 and the American Stock
Exchange composite index rose 2.35 to 674.66.

<HEADLINE> Germany Can Make Grade for Joining Euro: Ifo Institute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 15 (Xinhua) -- A leading German economic
institute today said that it saw increasing chances for Germany to
cut its 1997 budget deficit to 3 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP) to make the grade for joining the planned single
European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic report released today, the Munich-based
Ifo institute revised its projections of the 1997 German budget
deficit from 3.3 percent of GDP estimated earlier to 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that the latest projection was based on the latest
economic figures released by the German Federal Statistics Office,
according to which Germany had managed to bring down its budget
deficit from 3.5 percent of GDP in 1996 to 3.1 percent for the
first half of this year and had achieved an economic growth of 2.0
percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In order to make sure its place in the Euro club, Germany
should spur further economic upswing, increase tax revenues in the
second half of 1997 and maintain its budget consolidation efforts,
the Ifo said.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Ifo institute today also publicized a survey
participated by about 450 economic experts worldwide showing that
the international economic climate had been improving in general.
</P>
<P>
While the German and Japanese economies were heating up a
little bit, the U.S. and British economies would probably expect a
slight weakening, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The Ifo survey also predicted that the U.S. dollar would remain
strong in the next six months, profiting from the widespread
uncertainty over the stability of the planned common European
currency.

LONDON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain today pledged more aid
for Montserrat, stressing its commitment to the future of the
Caribbean island ravaged by volcano eruptions.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the island's Chief Minister David Brandt,
Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed that Britain should build a new
airstrip for the island and provide a soft loan to enable its
government to avert a crisis for people buying their own homes.
</P>
<P>
Britain has so far announced a package of emergency aid worth
41.5 million pounds (66.5 million U.S. dollars), including a 6.5

<HEADLINE> Parti Quebecois to Push for Sovereignty: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Parti Quebecois
should focus more on separation now that the other nine provinces
failed to recognize Quebec's uniqueness, a top Quebec official
said today.
</P>
<P>
The unity proposal from the premiers' unity meeting doesn't
offer Quebec any new powers to protect its language or culture,
said Jacques Brassard, Quebec minister of intergovernmental
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nine of Canada's provincial leaders agreed at their Calgary
meeting to hold consultations on the recognition of Quebec's
"unique character" and stressed the principle of equality of all
Canadians.
</P>
<P>
"It's a step backwards," Brassard said, adding that the meeting
offers less than the failed Meech Lake and Charlottetown
constitutional accords.
</P>
<P>
"I think the sovereignty movement has to get back into gear
again," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The consultations, which will be likely to start this fall and
finish by Christmas, are designed as a goodwill gesture to Quebec
from the English-speaking provinces.
</P>
<P>
They are also aimed at helping Daniel Johnson, leader of
Quebec's Liberal Party, who will face off against Premier Lucien
Bouchard, leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) Weld Gives Up Fight for US Ambassadorship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today agreed to accept the withdrawal of William Weld, his
nominee for ambassador to Mexico, from the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Weld, the moderate Republican nominated by Clinton to be U.S.
ambassador to Mexico in July, announced today that he abandoned
his fight for the post after conservative Sen. Jesse Helms refused
to hold a confirmation hearing on his nomination.
</P>
<P>
At a White House news conference, Weld said, "I asked President
Clinton to withdraw my name... so I can go back to New England,
where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask
it to do its duty."
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Clinton said he accepted Weld's decision with
"great disappointment."
</P>
<P>
"The American people have not been well served in this
process.... The treatment my nominee received reflects a
divisiveness that does not serve the American people," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said that a new nominee
would not be named soon. The selection process "is back at the
starting point now."
</P>
<P>
Weld, who resigned from the governorship of Massachusetts last
month, said he would have been nominated if a confirmation hearing
had not been blocked by Helms, the conservative North Carolina
senator he derisively called "that man."
</P>
<P>
Helms, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
refused to reconsider the nomination at a special meeting of the
committee last week.
</P>
<P>
The nomination needs to be first approved before it goes to
a full Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
Weld praised Clinton for fighting on his behalf. "The president
has stood tree-tops tall on this entire matter," Weld said.
</P>
<P>
Weld called Washington "a funny town" and accused Helms of
criticizing him "as though shot from guns."

<HEADLINE> Annan Welcomes Efforts To Elimination of Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today welcomed the efforts towards elimination of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
In a massage to the International Conference on "Central Asia
-- Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone," being held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan,
from September 14 to 16, Annan said, "The idea of establishing
nuclear-weapon-free zones around the world had gained momentum.
The principle of denuclearization had been applied successfully in
Latin America and Caribbean, where earlier this year the Treaty of
Tlatelolco celebrated its 30th anniversary; in the South Pacific,
with the Treaty of Rarotongo; in South-east Asia, with the treaty
of Bangkok; and with the Treaty of Pelindaba covering all of
Africa."
</P>
<P>
"More than 100 United Nations member states are parties to
these agreements. With Antarctica included, they form a
nuclear-weapon-free mantle over a vast, densely populated area of
the southern hemisphere," said the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
"The elimination of nuclear weapons, a goal shared by all
humanity, is a feasible long-rang objective. The Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) represents the single
most important effort of the international community in this
direction. The indefinite extension of the NPT, and last year's
adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of the
comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, have strengthened
considerably the nuclear non-proliferation regime," said the
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"Still, uncertainties and serious challenges remain, in both
the nuclear and conventional fields, and a new international
security agenda must be agreed that take account of our rapidly
changing world," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: World Economy Still in Low Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Growth in the world
economy will again continue to be too slow to make a significant
dent in poverty in the south and unemployment in the north, the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) says.
</P>
<P>
In its annual Trade and Development Report 1997 released today,
the UNCTAD said that despite success in reducing inflation almost
everywhere, expectations of faster growth have so far not been
fulfilled. Since 1990, the world economy has been growing slower
than in the previous decade, and the outlook is for a continuation
of slow growth.
</P>
<P>
Despite somewhat slower growth, Asia continued to perform well
in 1996. Although little change is expected for the region in
1997, restrictive policies intended to safeguard external balances
in a number of these countries have introduced an element of
uncertainty into short-term regional prospects, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The economic recovery continued in Africa in 1996. It also
became more widespread, extending to a number of least developed
countries. At 3.9 percent, the overall growth rate was the second
fastest in the world economy, lagging only behind Asia.
</P>
<P>
In 11 countries, growth reached or surpassed 6 percent and in
further 28, it ranged from 3 to 6 percent. This should be seen
against the target of an average real growth rate of at least 6
percent per annum for the decade, set in 1991 by the United
Nations in its New Agenda for the Development of Africa, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said Latin America has recovered from the depressed
conditions of the post-Mexican crisis, but its growth remained at
a modest 3.3 percent in 1996. The recovery had been primarily due
to the upturn in Argentina and Mexico. However, in many countries
the recovery has sucked in imports at an even faster pace than in
1995; the growth of import volume for the region in 1996 was 9.5
percent, almost double that in the previous year. As a
consequence, the region's dependence on capital inflows is
unabated. Reconciling external equilibrium and competitive
exchange rates with growth and price stability still remains the
main challenge for most Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
In Central and Eastern Europe, the strong growth performance in
1995 has not been carries over to 1996, dropping back 1.6
percentage points to 4 percent per annum. Despite quite fast
growth in 1996, prospects in the Czech Republic have dimmed.
Economic conditions worsened considerably in Romania and Bulgaria.
Contrary to earlier expectations, output continued to decline in
Ukraine and the Russian Federation, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that despite its strong performance relative to
other countries in the north, the United States average growth
rate during the decade remains below that achieved in the 1980s.
Moreover, until this year, average wages fell in almost every year
of the recovery. Productivity gains have been captured by profits
which have been reached at levels unseen since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The report also said prospects for Western Europe are currently
surrounded by uncertainty. The average growth rate again fell in
1996 to 1.5 percent. In some other countries, slow growth and high
employment have remained a problem. Current restrictive fiscal
policies to achieve the targets set for the third phase of
European Monetary Union render difficult the adoption of
counter-cyclical policies capable of stimulating growth and
fighting unemployment.

<HEADLINE> US Shifting Position on Landmines Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States, making
a reversal in its stand on landmines, agreed today to sign a
global treaty banning anti-personnel landmines, but on conditions,
including the use of the weapon on the Korean Peninsula for nine
years.
</P>
<P>
"We have come forward with a compromise proposal, which is
being discussed now among a number of delegations in Oslo," State
Department spokesman James Foley told reporters at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The United States decided that we could drop our proposed
exception for Korea and we would resolve our security concerns, in
Korea and elsewhere, through a time-bound deferral period long
enough to meet our needs: nine years, that is," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States at first was intent on boycotting the Oslo
conference on anti-personnel landmines. But it later decided to
attend the meeting in an attempt to push for an exemption for the
Korean Peninsula for the use of the weapon.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official said the nine-year phase-in period "would
give us, in the estimation of the military and others, an adequate
opportunity to develop alternatives" to anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
Another official said the "deferral period" would permit the
United States to deploy self-destructing "smart" anti-personnel
mines that are positioned near anti-tank mines.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States was also seeking "two absolutely
critical modifications in the current draft text of the treaty"
banning the anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
The first is a "reversion... on treaty withdrawal."
</P>
<P>
"We would need to include a clause (in the draft text), a
clause that would allow countries to withdraw from the treaty if
they or their allies are victims of aggression," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the current treaty text "does not allow signers to
withdraw during a conflict, while other arms control treaties,
such as the Chemical Weapons Treaty, do not restrict the right to
withdraw."
</P>
<P>
The second is "to revise the current draft text definition of
anti-handling devices, to avoid banning U.S. anti-tank munitions,"
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Patrick Leahy, who had led the fight in
Congress for a global ban on landmines, said the concession that
the Clinton administration had made was not enough.
</P>
<P>
"This looks like the same old exceptions wrapped in new
packaging," he said. "To get to the finish line, U.S. negotiators
are going to need more than cosmetic changes in our position. They
will require fresh thinking, and time is running out."
</P>
<P>
Jody Williams, who is attending the Oslo conference on behalf
of the international campaign to ban landmines, also was critical
of the U.S. conditions for its signing of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"If successful, this last-ditch effort by the U.S. would gut
the treaty," he said. "It would be a document fatally flawed by
a... gaping loophole and a lengthy, deadly delay."
