<HEADLINE> Some Seek Study on Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Three innocent men freed from death row in Illinois. A mentally  
ill convict spared in Virginia. Questions of racial bias in 
Nebraska's justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	The death penalty is accepted and practiced more than ever in  
America, yet growing doubts about how it is applied have prompted a 
small movement of state lawmakers calling for a moratorium on 
executions to study whether the system is working fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	In at least 11 states this year, bills to halt or abolish  
capital punishment have been considered, and many have gone further 
than in the past. In addition, four states -- Michigan, Maine, 
Massachusetts and Iowa -- soundly rejected bills that would have 
established capital punishment. Thirty-eight states have adopted 
the death penalty, most recently New York (1995) and Kansas (1994). 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend over the past 20 years has been more states with the  
death penalty, more crimes eligible, more executions,'' said 
Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information 
Center, a Washington-based group critical of how capital punishment 
is applied. ``These are the first steps in the other direction. 
It's too early to tell whether this is a large trend away from the 
death penalty, but it's different than other years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislative scrutiny, however, doesn't appear to represent  
weakening support for capital punishment. Seventy-one percent of 
Americans favored the death penalty in a February Gallup poll. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vast majority of Americans support the death penalty, and  
that support crosses all racial, religious and other conventional 
lines,'' said Paul Cassell, a University of Utah law professor who 
represented the families of some of the Oklahoma City bombing 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors may be prompting lawmakers to re-examine capital  
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska's unicameral Legislature voted for a two-year stop to  
executions and some state leaders voiced concerns that Indian and 
black defendants are more likely to be sentenced to die than 
whites. The measure was vetoed by the governor Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Illinois, the House passed a non-binding resolution for a  
six-month moratorium amid fear an innocent man could die. The state 
exonerated convicted murderer Ronald Jones this month, the third 
person freed from Illinois' death row this year, and the 12th since 
1987. Several were freed after investigations by students at 
Northwestern University. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma and Louisiana have also freed inmates from death row  
this year after evidence emerged they were innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, crime is down nationwide, perhaps softening calls  
to get tough as a means of deterrence. And a strong appeal by Pope 
John Paul II to do away with the death sentence may have 
reverberated with religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The plea prompted Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, a strong death  
penalty proponent, to commute the sentence of a convicted killer 
scheduled to die during the pope's January visit to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are beginning to look beyond the political speak of  
being tough on crime,'' said Walter H. White, Jr., chairman of the 
American Bar Association's section on individual rights and 
responsibilities. ``There is significant progress in the fact that 
people are debating the moratorium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA in 1997 called for a temporary halt to executions, and  
this year the United Nations followed with a proposal for a 
worldwide moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace of U.S. executions, however, is on the rise, pushed by  
laws passed earlier this decade that limit appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-six people have been put to death nationwide this year,  
and Texas and Louisiana each have an execution scheduled Tuesday. 
The country is on pace to top 100 executions this year for the 
first time since the Supreme Court ended a four-year nationwide ban 
on capital punishment in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn Lammi of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation said  
the moratorium movement does not represent a groundswell of 
opposition to capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it just exhibits that the small number of activists  
who have been pushing this argument have been successful in 
convincing people in power in some states to pursue it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, several death penalty supporters have recently  
voiced concerns about the use of capital punishment, at least in 
specific instances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nebraska moratorium drive was led in part by state Sen.  
Kermit Brashear, a conservative supporter of the death penalty who 
said he wants to make sure the punishment is applied fairly. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, Gov. Jim Gilmore commuted the death sentence of a  
mentally ill man earlier this month after not intervening in 21 
executions since he took office in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And last year, Christian Coalition leader Pat Robertson lobbied  
against the execution in Texas of Karla Faye Tucker, a white 
born-again Christian woman convicted of a gruesome pickax-murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the moratorium drive say they're surprised by the  
support generated in the two years since the ABA endorsed the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the start of a movement that will look at a death  
penalty moratorium as a viable option,'' said Tony Banout, 
co-director of the Moratorium Now project at the liberal Quixote 
Center in Hyattsville, Md. ``We are just looking at the 
beginning.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins Sprint Double Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- For Maurice Greene, nothing changed much in  
the Prefontaine Classic, not even the strong wind, as he swept the 
sprint double for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing changed much for Marion Jones and Michael Johnson either  
as they won their specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 25th Prefontaine Classic Sunday again produced another  
outstanding mile, with 10 runners breaking the four-minute barrier, 
led by Kenya's Noah Ngeny. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100 meters and the 1997  
world champion, won the 100 in 9.84 seconds, a time that equaled 
Canadian Donovan Bailey's world record but was negated by a wind of 
7.83 mph, well over the allowable of 4.473 for record purposes. The 
clocking has been bettered only six other times. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty minutes later, Greene won the 200 in 20.06, a time that  
would have broken the meet record of 20.15 by Johnson in 1995, if 
not for the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, with slightly less wind, Greene ran even faster,  
winning the 100 in 9.79 and the 200 in 19.88. Still it was over the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this track loves me, and I love this track,'' Greene  
said. ``I love this city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene's love affair with Eugene and the University of Oregon's  
Hayward Field will continue next month at the USA Championships, 
the qualifying meet for the World Championships. He is expected to 
face Johnson in a 200 showdown. 
</P>
<P>
	As world champion in the 100, Greene does not have to qualify in  
that event. Neither does Johnson in the 400, since he also is the 
world champion. Thus, both will concentrate on the 200 for the 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 200 was a little challenging,'' Greene said after his  
magnificent double that excited the crowd of 12,247. ``I was winded 
after the 100. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm in good enough shape where I can go back-to-back.''  
</P>
<P>
	Greene said he was not frustrated at losing his shot at records  
because of the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the wind God,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 400 eight times, beat  
world No. 2 Mark Richardson of Britain by nearly 10 meters at 
44.51, matching his best time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind was blowing hard down the backstretch, so running a  
good time today was pretty much impossible,'' said Johnson, who 
thought he was in shape to break 44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, track and field's woman athlete of the year for the past  
two years, was competing for the first time in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	But she won the 200 by about nine meters in 21.81, the fastest  
time in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go through the season undefeated because I've yet to  
do that,'' said Jones, who lost only once last year, in her final 
competition of the season, in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	While the near-capacity crowd roared its approval for the  
sprinters, it saved its loudest cheers for the men's milers. 
</P>
<P>
	The milers went through a quarter-mile meters in 56:00, then the  
20-year-old Ngeny took the field through a 1:56.02 half-mile and 
was timed at 2:54.9 for three-quarters, before pulling away down 
the final straightway and winning at 3:52.09, fastest in the world 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Kevin Sullivan, the former Michigan star, finished  
second at 3:53.70, and Adam Goucher, the 1999 national indoor 3,000 
champion and 1998 NCAA 5,000 winner for Colorado, was third at 
3:54.17. It was his career best and the best by an American this 
year. Americans Karl Paranya, fifth at 3:54.83, and Steve Holman, 
eighth at 3:55.13, also cracked the four-minute barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wade, who came into the meet as the world leader in the  
110 hurdles, lowered his best time to 13.12. Reggie Torian, the 
runner-up at 13.17, also went under Wade's previous leading time of 
13.22. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-event program produced three other 1999 American leaders.  
</P>
<P>
	Regina Jacobs, a seven-time national champion, won the women's  
1,500 meters at 4:07.90. Lance Deal, the American record-holder in 
the hammer throw, won at 261 feet, 2 inches, and Bob Kennedy, the 
American record-holder at 5,000 meters, finished third at 13:18.83, 
behind Kenya's Luke Kipkosgei (13:17.15) and Mexico's Pablo Olmedo 
(13:18.21). 
</P>
<P>
	There were two other surprises, as Lawrence Johnson, the former  
American record-holder in the pole vault, beat current 
record-holder Jeff Hartwig, 18-8 1-4 to 18-4 1-2, and Andy Bloom, 
the former NCAA shot put and discus champion from Wake Forest, beat 
1999 world leader John Godina, 220-0 to 217-8.

<HEADLINE> Ewing Shrugs Off Pain To Help Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Patrick Ewing grabbed the last-second  
airball and cradled it in his long arms, a victory over the Indiana 
Pacers secured, another step toward the one goal that has eluded 
him -- an NBA championship -- taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing's knees were covered by braces and pads and his painful  
left Achilles' tendon was wrapped as well. His left shoulder was 
sore, so was his right quadriceps and he's been dealing with a 
strained rib cage muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any other body part could hurt him. I don't  
think there are any left,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after the game, Ewing's ordeal was evident. He wore an  
ice bag on his right knee and then checked a timer to see when it 
was OK to bring his submerged left leg out of a bucket of ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm all banged up,'' Ewing said after a courageous 40-minute  
performance Sunday. He scored 16 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to 
help the Knicks beat the Pacers 93-90 in the opening game of the 
Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing hit four free throws in the final minute and he also made  
a key defensive play late in the game, running out at Reggie Miller 
and causing him to hurry and miss a 3-pointer that could have given 
Indiana the lead in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick has seen that play 200 times and he knew it was  
coming. Injury or not, his understanding of the game of basketball 
is good. It was a good hedge on his part,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's satisfying, basically, to win. A lot of people have been  
doubting us. We just seem to keep fighting to do what we have to to 
stay alive,'' Ewing said following New York's sixth straight 
playoff victory, a club record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to do it bad and when you want to do it that bad, you  
step up the best way you can and try to get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates have marveled at the 36-year-old's ability to deal  
with pain. Nearly a week had passed since the Knicks swept the 
Atlanta Hawks in the second round and that gave him some needed 
rehab time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can see him wince in pain and for him to come out and down  
the stretch give us what he gave us, it's unspeakable,'' Knicks 
guard Allan Houston said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to hit those big free throws, you can't say enough  
what he's been giving us throughout the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Kurt Thomas agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just to have to look at him and say he's a warrior, a  
leader,'' said Thomas, who contributed eight points, eight rebounds 
and some good defense on Pacers center Rik Smits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick's doing whatever it takes to get out there on the  
floor.''

<HEADLINE> Hingis Happy Williams Sisters Gone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Martina Hingis was not looking forward to playing  
either of the two Williams sisters in the French Open. To ensure 
success in her draw, Hingis lit a candle at the Sacre Coeur church 
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	After Venus Williams lost Sunday to qualifier Barbara Schwartz,  
Hingis said it had been a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the candle I lit at Sacre Coeur helped,'' she said.  
``(In the church) you have to pay how much you want, then you can 
take a big candle or a small one,'' said a smiling Hingis. ``I took 
the middle.''

	SPORTS FANS: Tennis players look to other sports for  
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	One player, Marcelo Fillipini, showed an interest the French  
Rugby league final on Saturday at the Stade de France. The 
Uruguayan player had to cancel, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Against his expectations, Fillipini made it to the fourth round  
of the men's draw. Fillipini thought a good night sleep was more 
important than the rugby final. 
</P>
<P>
	Soccer has proven a more popular sport than rugby in the tennis  
crowd. About a hundred players requested tickets for the Parc des 
Princes soccer stadium to see the last match of the French first 
division between Paris Saint-Germain and Bordeaux. Unfortunately 
for the tennis players, the stadium was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SCHOOL'S OUT: For some people it's hard to believe 20-year-old  
Barbara Schwartz is doing so well. At a time when women players 
start earlier and earlier, late developers are rare. Especially if 
you take time off to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian who took out No. 5-seeded Venus Williams Sunday  
said she had more time to practice this year because she had 
finished school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was very important for me, because now I have  
something else besides tennis,'' said Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's also good because now I can concentrate on tennis,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the extra work paid off when she came back after  
facing three match points to defeat Williams.

like to watch tennis.

	On Saturday, Zinedine Zidane, the playmaker for Italian power  
Juventus and the French national team, sneaked a peek at the play 
on Suzanne Lenglen court from the photographers' pit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm duly impressed by the speed and the power of the  
strokes,'' he said. ``I was happy to see some of the games from the 
photographers pit, because there I could really see the 
trajectory.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A street child was killed and an  
American tourist injured in a drive-by shooting in Rio's Copacabana 
district early Sunday, police said.

	Ivan Gordon, 22, from Texas, was hit in the thigh by a stray  
bullet but was not seriously injured, said detective Paulo

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's oldest opposition party has voted to  
adopt a presidential primary for the July 2000 elections, following 
in the footsteps of the governing Institutional Revolutionary 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 6,000 delegates at a national assembly for the center-right  
National Action Party voted late Saturday to hold a national 
primary open to members and registered ``sympathizers'' of the 
party. The election was expected to be held in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came less than two weeks after the governing party,  
known as the PRI, voted to hold its first national primary, ending 
a tradition where the outgoing president selects the party's 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1939, the National Action Party struggled for decades  
against rigged elections and a system stacked in favor of the PRI 
until winning its first governorship in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The party, whose main strength is among businessmen, middle  
class and religiously inclined voters, has taken advantage of 
democratic reforms in Mexico and now governs Baja California, 
Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, Jalisco, Guanajuato and Nuevo Leon.

<HEADLINE> One Race Down, One to Go for Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- One race, no problem for Tony Stewart's  
quest for auto racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to become the first driver to complete the Indianapolis  
500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in the same day, Stewart accomplished the 
first part of his goal with ease. He finished ninth in a day where 
several of the top racers were knocked out by crashes and engine 
blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the easiest race, though. After starting in the eighth  
row, he had trouble with his car for much of the day, though he 
managed to stay in the top 10 for almost the entire race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good job, buddy. Thanks for hanging in there,'' crew chief  
Larry Curry said as the race ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after, Stewart sprinted for the helicopter that took him  
to the Indianapolis airport, where The Home Depot, his sponsor, had 
its private jet waiting for the 50-minute flight to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a 50-minute flight to North Carolina, and then he's got  
another helicopter ride to Lowe's Motor Speedway. He'll start in 
the 27th spot in the Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the long day, Stewart looked loose and relaxed Sunday  
morning. When he walked to his race car, his crew handed him two 
helmets and told him to pick one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eenie, meenie, minie, mo,'' Stewart said as his crew laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	After three years in the Indy Racing league, Stewart switched to  
NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit and has done better than anyone 
expected. He's had five top-10 finishes in his first 12 races, and 
his won one pole. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 28-year-old Indiana native didn't want to give up his  
chance to win at Indy. Even if it meant driving 1,100 miles in less 
than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``A beautiful sunny day like this, I suppose people could figure  
out better things to do than drive 1,100 miles,'' he said. ``But 
I'm looking forward to doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti was the first to do the double in 1994, but he  
crashed in the Coca-Cola 600 and didn't finish the race. Robby 
Gordon's attempt in 1997 was rained out in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has been shuttling back and forth between Indy and  
Concord the past two weeks, and he arrived in Indianapolis late 
Saturday after two days of practice in North Carolina. He slept in 
his motor coach at the speedway, and he and fiancee Krista Dwyer 
arrived at his garage about 9:25 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked onto the track, there were loud cheers from the  
crowd. People dashed in front of him to get pictures, and several 
drivers stopped to wish him luck. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Nelson, caught up to his son, gave him a bear hug  
and told him to have a good day. Not a problem, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good,'' he said. ``I'm ready to get the day  
started and get this part of it over.''

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Enter Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Still elated from their successful  
work outside, Discovery's astronauts swung open the hatches of the 
international space station tonight and floated into the chilly but 
brightly lighted outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	They were the first visitors in six months.  
</P>
<P>
	``Make yourself at home,'' radioed Mission Control.  
</P>
<P>
	Before the seven shuttle astronauts began opening the doors,  
flight controllers warned it would be 57 degrees in the first 
module, the American-made Unity. 
</P>
<P>
	``You might want to bring a sweater,'' Mission Control advised.  
</P>
<P>
	They had to pass through six hatches to get all the way in, a  
drawn-out affair that took more than two hours because of the need 
to equalize the pressure in the various compartments. Mission 
Control helped by turning on the lights ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
	American Tamara Jernigan and Russian Valery Tokarev led the way.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely delighted to be aboard,'' Jernigan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts will spend the next three days making  
repairs and deliveries to the 240-mile-high station, vacant since 
another shuttle crew joined the first two components in orbit back 
in December. The work is bigger and far more tedious than what they 
did earlier Sunday during the second-longest spacewalk ever -- 
rigging cranes and other tools to the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the jobs awaiting them inside: pulling up the floor to  
replace electrical meters on Russian batteries that aren't charging 
properly, trying to fix a broken U.S. communication system, and 
installing mufflers to reduce the noise inside the Russian-built 
module, Zarya. 
</P>
<P>
	They got started on the repairs within minutes of entering the  
space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the  
multitude of problems coming so soon after the space station's 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``In high-tech like this, you're going to have that happen,''  
Mission Control's Milt Heflin explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle astronauts have until Thursday to unload 3,600  
pounds of spare parts, computers, water and clothes for the men who 
are due to move in next March. 
</P>
<P>
	During Saturday night's spacewalk, Jernigan and Dr. Daniel Barry  
lugged 700 pounds of gear from the shuttle to the station. A pair 
of 5-foot cranes took up most of the load. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they spent eight hours outside the seven-story-plus  
complex -- 1 1/2 hours longer than planned -- the excursion ended too 
soon for their taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be telling me we're almost done?'' Barry asked when  
it came time to go back in Sunday morning. His next word summed it 
all up: ``Wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their spacewalk was just 34 minutes shy of NASA's all-time  
record, an 8 1/2-hour walk back in 1992 in which three astronauts 
grabbed a runaway satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Jernigan and Barry fell behind when they had to struggle with  
tight screws holding down the Russian-built crane in Discovery's 
cargo bay. Then a camera jammed while they were photographing the 
space station, and they had to get a spare. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the pair were finally back in Discovery's repressurizing  
air lock, Jernigan had trouble connecting her spacesuit to the 
shuttle life-support system. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the snags, Jernigan and Barry accomplished all their  
major chores. About the only thing left undone was a test of NASA's 
newly installed crane; it eventually will be used to haul large 
items around the orbiting outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	``There simply wasn't enough time,'' said Mike Hess, who managed  
the spacewalk from Mission Control. ``We're going to have to rely 
on the fact that we did extensive ground testing before launch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because only two pieces of the Russian crane were installed, a  
test on that unit wasn't needed. The remaining parts, which weren't 
ready for Discovery's flight, will go up on the next shuttle visit 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the fourth spacewalk on the international space station  
since it was launched in pieces late last year. Altogether, shuttle 
astronauts have spent 29 hours working on the station's exterior, 
mostly back in December. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA estimates 158 more spacewalks, totaling more than 1,000  
hours, will be needed over the next five years to build and 
maintain the station.

<HEADLINE> New Plane Features Safety Parachute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DULUTH, Minn. (AP) -- Alan Klapmeier almost died in 1984 when his  
small plane collided with another in flight, killing the other 
pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Popov narrowly escaped death in 1977 when a piece broke  
off his hang glider, sending it plummeting 500 feet into a lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they got over their harrowing experiences, Klapmeier and  
Popov began to wonder: Why should flying small crafts be so 
dangerous? 
</P>
<P>
	Years after the two men met and began pursuing safer  
alternatives, they believe they have the answer in the Cirrus SR20, 
the first new general aviation plane in almost 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The SR20 comes with the ultimate safety feature: a parachute  
capable of floating the plane to the ground if catastrophe strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little airplanes have not been built with crashworthiness in  
mind,'' Klapmeier said. ``Ours is the first to accept that 
airplanes will crash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cirrus Design, based in Duluth, spent $55 million developing the  
SR20, its first product that isn't a kit plane. The company is 
hoping the investment will give it a sizable share of the $5.9 
billion spent annually on general aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	Klapmeier is Cirrus' president. The parachute is supplied by  
Popov's company, Ballistic Recovery Systems of South St. Paul, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Parachutes on planes aren't a new idea. BRS has sold more than  
14,000 parachutes to pilots who install them on their ultralight 
aircrafts, gliders, kit-built planes and Cessna 150s. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they aren't universally endorsed. Some aviation experts  
believe pilots will hesitate to open the parachutes, which are 
likely to save the passengers but certain to mean the airplane's 
ruin. 
</P>
<P>
	Cirrus, founded in 1984 as a kit-plane maker, says it wants to  
change the way people think and feel about flying in small planes. 
Company officials tout the SR20 as faster, sleeker, more 
comfortable, better-looking and safer than just about any other. 
</P>
<P>
	The company already has more than 290 orders.  
</P>
<P>
	``People are very interested in this airplane,'' said Warren  
Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots 
Association, which represents about 345,000 pilots in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the crash of an SR20 test plane in late March, Cirrus  
was sticking to its plan to start delivering planes to customers by 
late spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash, which killed the pilot, is under  
investigation. The plane was not equipped with a parachute because 
it wasn't available at the time. The company has since tested 
another airplane off the production line without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The SR20 is made of composites of fiberglass and epoxy resin  
that allow a more aerodynamic shape than aluminum planes, thus 
increasing airspeed. The SR20 cruises at 160 knots, compared with 
about 120 to 135 knots for other small planes in its category. Its 
maximum flying height is 16,000 feet; its maximum range is 800 
nautical miles. A minimum standard model costs $171,300. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-passenger plane's interior is modeled after the BMW 500  
luxury car series. A fully equipped SR20 has a cellular phone, 
stereo, plush leather seats, and a roomier cabin than typical small 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's designers say the SR20 will be easier to fly than  
older planes. 
</P>
<P>
	The dashboard has a 10-inch monitor that displays information  
the pilot would otherwise have to determine from dozens of gauges 
and dials. A single lever controls the throttle and propeller, 
which for anyone who drives a car is roughly equivalent to having 
an automatic tranmission instead of a manual. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best part is landing it. It almost lands itself. You just  
line it up over the runway and it settles down, kind of like 
landing a Buick,'' said Bill Saunders, president of an automotive 
market research firm in Troy, Mich., who expects his SR20 to be 
delivered in August or September. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing a plane for improved safety hasn't been as easy as it  
seems. The general aviation industry has always believed that 
pilots -- not planes -- should be responsible for their own and their 
passengers' safety. Cirrus' competitors have no plans to place 
parachutes in their planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not have parachutes on our planes and we have no plans  
to add them,'' said Jan McIntire, spokeswoman for Cessna Aircraft 
Company of Wichita, Kan., the world's largest builder of small 
commercial aviation planes. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lancair, a Bend, Ore., company, that also makes small planes,  
officials don't believe a parachute really makes a plane safer, 
general manager Bob Fair said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you going to pull it? Because once you pull it, the  
aircraft is destroyed,'' Fair said. ``Once you pull it, you have no 
control over the aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popov scoffs at the idea that a pilot wouldn't pull the  
parachute after, say, a midair collision, a heart attack or engine 
failure at 15,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the most profound nonsense I've ever heard,'' he said.  
``You're a human being and you're flying a mechanical device. One 
or the other is going to fail at some time. If you have passengers, 
your obligation is to provide as much safety as you possibly can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders, who plans to fly his SR20 between his home and  
vacation homes in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and northern Michigan with 
his wife and two daughters, said he would have no problem releasing 
the parachute. 
</P>
<P>
	``I paid $180,000 for my plane, but I guess your life is worth a  
lot more than that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The parachute has been tested in flight eight times and Cirrus  
pronounced the tests a success, although in each one the pilot 
released the parachute and resumed flight without sailing all the 
way to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	To measure the plane's crashworthiness, engineers dropped the  
plane from 10 feet, which simulated impact of about 17 miles per 
hour with a deployed parachute. 
</P>
<P>
	The wing and cabin stayed intact, which Cirrus officials said  
proved a pilot and passengers would survive a crash. But the plane 
couldn't be re-used for another flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Cirrus, a private company, won't release financial data. But  
company officials say they will break even on development costs 
within two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they're likely to become very successful,'' said  
Al Lange, vice president of Green Tree Financial's Aircraft Group, 
which provides financing to pilots who buy their own planes. 
``Their growth is only limited by their ability to attract 
additional investment capital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cirrus is not limiting its sales and investment efforts to the  
United States. About 60 of the pre-ordered planes are being 
delivered to overseas customers; the company has sales 
representatives on six continents.

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- More pit crews could be wearing helmets in  
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	A pit row accident in the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday could speed  
the development of helmets being designed and tested by Bell Auto 
Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Six CART racing teams are using that prototype now, and Bell  
planned to have helmets available to other teams later this year. 
Company officials said Sunday they will work to get the helmets 
ready sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's general manager, J. Kendall Merrill, said the helmets  
will be free for any racing teams that want them. 
</P>
<P>
                             *--------	 
</P>
<P>
	IT'S MY TURN: During Kenny Brack's post-race news conference,  
the Swedish driver was asked if he felt happier for himself or 
car-owner A.J. Foyt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy for both of us,'' the blond-haired Brack said,  
glancing at Foyt to his right. Foyt said nothing, and Brack paused 
for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably more happy for myself,'' Brack admitted, as Foyt  
started chuckling. ``Because he's won it four times already.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *--------	 
</P>
<P>
	ENGINE CHANGING: The three cars powered by the Nissan Infiniti  
engines ended the day the same way -- spewing smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure of the engine, which has never won in the Indy  
Racing League, took defending champion Eddie Cheever out of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheever was running third on the 139th lap when his car started  
smoking and he stopped on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it went, it just went,'' Cheever said of the Nissan  
engine, which was used by only three of the 33 drivers in the 
field. None of the three finished the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The engine started smoking really bad, and I just turned it  
off,'' veteran driver Roberto Guerrero said after his Nissan engine 
failed on Lap 105. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Jeret Schroeder -- the third Infiniti driver -- suffered  
the same fate. The other 30 cars in the field used Oldsmobile 
Aurora engines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The engine is incredibly strong,'' said Cheever, the only top  
contender using it. ``We still need to work on its reliability.'' 
</P>
<P>

	NEW TRADITIONS: Hot rod and motorcycle buff Jay Leno took a ride  
on the famed Speedway -- in the driver's seat of the 2000 Chevrolet 
Monte Carlo pace car. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Tonight Show'' host drove the pace lap to start the race  
before someone took over to handle those duties during caution 
situations the rest of Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just like driving down the L.A. expressway,'' Leno  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leno had to follow war heros and the latest military  
technology during prerace festivities with a Memorial Day tone. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of servicemen who earned the Medal of Honor, the United  
States' highest distinction for military valor, spun an honorary 
lap around the 2.5-mile track. 
</P>
<P>
	A B-2 Stealth bomber buzzed the track's observation tower  
moments later. The bat-shaped jet drew roars and wows from the 
crowd and racing teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Evangelist Billy Graham, who will lead one of his famed crusades  
in Indianapolis next weekend, offered the prerace prayer. 
</P>
<P>
	``May each driver and team not only be at the peak of the skill,  
but may each be at their moral and spiritual best,'' Graham said. 
``Give everyone a sense of fair play and good sportsmanship and 
protect them from injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	MAYBE NEXT YEAR: Jeff Ward is making progress.  
</P>
<P>
	He was second, just six seconds behind winner Kenny Brack, his  
best finish in three tries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get this race one day,'' Ward said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ward was third as the rookie of the year in 1997 and 13th last  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted this one bad,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SLIP SLIDING: The car was not handling well, but Steve Knapp  
tried to push it to a planned pit stop -- just seven laps away. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's rookie of the year didn't make it. The 35-year-old  
driver lost control, slid sideways and slammed into the Turn 2 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was a little bit loose and he was trying to drive  
through it to get to the pit stop,'' team owner Bob Hancher said.

<HEADLINE> Two killed in Alaskan Raft Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENALI NATIONAL PARK, Alaska (AP) -- Two women were thrown from a  
raft and drowned near Denali National Park and nine other people 
who tried to rescue them were treated for hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, both 75, were in a raft with five people on a 13-mile  
scenic tour of the Nenana River on Saturday night, said state 
Trooper Bill Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit a swell in the water and then went into a whirlpool.  
The raft was literally just sucked down,'' Tyler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were the only ones thrown from the raft.  
</P>
<P>
	Two other rafts came around a bend in the river, saw the victims  
in the water and tried to help. By the time troopers arrived, 18 
people were wet and cold as they waited on the riverbank. The 
temperature was about 38 degrees. Nine were treated for mild 
hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were identified as Eloise Hubbard of Doraville, Ga.  
and Doris North of Decatur, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour company, Alaska Raft Adventure, suspended operations  
and was investigating the accident, said manager Bob Seney. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company hasn't had an accident in the 10 years it's  
been offering tours of the river, which forms the eastern boundary 
of the park. Everyone was wearing insulated suits and flotation 
devices, he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Burn in Southeast, West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLOR, Fla. (AP) -- A 40,000-acre wildfire in north Florida  
burned through portions of the Okefenokee swamp and hopped the 
Florida-Georgia line. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, firefighters braved snakes, scorpions and old  
mine shafts to fight an 11,000-acre fire moving through Joshua Tree 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	More firefighters joined exhausted crews Sunday battling two  
large Arizona wildfires threatening ranchers and the endangered 
desert tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
	In far northwestern Arizona, a lightning-sparked fire grew from  
650 acres Saturday to 10,000 acres by nightfall and continued 
moving north on Sunday, Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman Bette 
Arial said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusts up to 50 mph helped spread the fire in an area  
between the Arizona-Utah line and Grand Canyon National Park on 
land controlled by the federal Bureau of Land Management. The area 
is known as the Arizona Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lightning wildfire on federal and state land some 80  
miles west of Phoenix near Wenden had burned 5,800 acres as of 
Sunday. The area is home to the endangered desert tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia fire raged into an area south of the small town of  
Fargo, which lies about eight miles north of the Florida line, said 
Gene Madden, spokesman for the Florida Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of agencies from both states and the federal government  
are involved in fighting the fire, including the Georgia Division 
of Forestry, the U.S. Forest service and a house of local fire and 
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The California blaze, the largest in the 794,000-acre park's  
history, was 50 percent contained. Though flames were moving west, 
they remained well within the park, said Capt. Jim Wilkins of the 
San Bernardino County Fire Department.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Back in Cardinals Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mark McGwire was back on his feet Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire returned to the St. Louis Cardinals lineup for a night  
game against the Chicago Cubs after being hospitalized 36 hours for 
treatment of a staph infection in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got it in time,'' McGwire said. ``If I didn't go to the  
hospital, they said it could've been really bad. You don't mess 
with a staph infection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The infection started in a soft corn in his right foot and  
worked its way up to the lymph nodes near his right groin. McGwire 
had cut a hole in his shoe to alleviate pressure on the corn so he 
could play Friday but was examined by the Cubs medical staff after 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed Saturday's game and the Cardinals said McGwire was in  
his hotel, keeping his foot elevated. Actually, he was at the 
hospital watching the game on television and getting antibiotics 
intravenously every eight hours. He spent two nights at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like I wanted to go. I didn't want to miss the  
game,'' said McGwire, who is tied with Fernando Tatis for the team 
lead in homers with 14. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has played in 45 of the Cardinals 47 games, said he  
will continue to take oral antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't inhibit me from playing baseball,'' McGwire said of  
the corn. ``I had a serious staph infection that had to be taken 
care of intravenously and not orally. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't do what they said, it could've been scary,'' he  
said. ``The infection is what they're treating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals trainer Barry Weinberg said McGwire has been bothered  
by the corn on his feet for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happens every baseball season. It goes with the anthem,''  
Weinberg joked. ``As soon as he hears the anthem, it starts.''

<HEADLINE> Some To Be Fired Over China Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson on Sunday said he would fire department officials for 
failing to act on signs China was stealing secrets from a U.S. 
nuclear weapons lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismissals and demotions could come as early as this week, after  
Richardson receives an internal report on security lapses at the 
Los Alamos lab in New Mexico that may have contributed to China's 
thefts of U.S. nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were communications breakdowns. There were incompetent  
acts, security was not considered important,'' Richardson said on 
NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Fox News Sunday,'' he cited ``individuals at the Department  
of Energy and the labs that, in my judgment, did not do their 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the fallout continued from last week's release of a  
special House committee's report on China's 20-year campaign to 
steal America's nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department's counterintelligence chief said Congress  
responded slowly to FBI warnings China was stealing U.S. nuclear 
secrets from the federal labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate intelligence committee chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby,  
called the remarks ``out of bounds'' and said Congress acted 
appropriately. A Democratic colleague said ``a game of blame'' 
accomplished little. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Curran, a veteran FBI official who now directs the Energy  
Department's counterintelligence office, said the FBI in 1997 gave 
Shelby ``very, very significant proposals'' with 26 recommendations 
on improving security at the national labs. ``And I never heard 
anything since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curran, on ABC's ``This Week,'' said the department later  
adopted those recommendations, but ``it would have been nice to 
have a head start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby, appearing later on the same show, said Curran was ``out  
of bounds in some areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said that in 1996, the Senate intelligence committee,  
then under Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., did respond to 
counterintelligence problems at the labs and provided additional 
money. Shelby, R-Ala., said the Energy Department ignored the 
committee's advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, a Democrat from New Jersey who has been  
strongly critical of the administration's handling of the spy case, 
said Curran's comments were ``entirely inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not proper, he said, for Curran ``to engage in a game of  
blame between the Congress and the executive branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also urged an end to ``scapegoating, looking for  
heads to roll'' and a renewed focus on increased security. 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed with Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chief author of  
the report on China's thefts of U.S. nuclear secrets, that Chinese 
espionage was serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the People's Republic of China stole information  
about the seven major warheads in the current American nuclear 
arsenal as well as the neutron bomb, and the thefts ``almost 
certainly continue to the present.'' China has said the spying 
charge was ``groundless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the Chinese got information on three U.S.  
nuclear warheads but there is no hard evidence China has used that 
information to modernize or deploy nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox agreed it is unclear what the Chinese are doing with the  
American technology, but ``diminishing the problem, saying it's 
really not that bad, is actually an obstacle to fixing the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also stressed that the Energy counterintelligence has  
already put in place 85 percent of the measures recommended to stop 
future attempts at espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox disagreed with that assessment, saying that since the people  
who have penetrated the labs over many years have not been 
apprehended, ``we have to presume they are still there.''

<HEADLINE> Bowerman Steps Down From Nike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Bill Bowerman, the 88-year-old former Oregon  
track coach who invented the modern running shoe, stopped chatting 
for a moment to watch the final turn of the women's 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Regina Jacobs won Sunday's race at the 25th annual Prefontaine  
Classic, and she did it on shoes far more advanced than the 
primitive sole Bowerman tinkered with using his wife's waffle iron. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning the 1,500, Jacobs paused during her victory lap  
and smiled up at the thin, frail man, watching from the balcony 
overlooking the track. Then, as if to acknowledge his 
contributions, she gave him a thumbs up. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowerman, who coached at Oregon from 1949-72, began  
experimenting with different cushions and layers of material to 
give his runners an edge. In the late 1960s, he pressed foam rubber 
into the waffle iron, and the modern distance-running sole was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, took the concept and  
formed Nike, the multibillion-dollar shoe and apparel company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't think of anybody that's made a bigger contribution to  
the history of this sport than Bill Bowerman,'' said Knight, who 
ran at Oregon in the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowerman officially retired Sunday from the board of directors  
at Nike, a post he's held since 1968. With Knight at his side, 
Bowerman was presented with a plaque and a standing ovation from 
the Hayward Field crowd of 12,247. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot more people here than there used to be,''  
Bowerman said, wearing a brown cowboy hat and dark sunglasses. ``To 
get people out here on a windy day like this shows you just how 
special this meet has become.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowerman's most famous athlete was the event's namesake -- Steve  
Prefontaine, the brash, mustachioed prodigy who inspired a 
generation of distance runners. Prefontaine died in a car crash in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowerman refused to take much credit for building Oregon into a  
national track power, and Eugene into a mecca for the sport. He 
said his predecessor, Bill Hayward, took charge at the notoriously 
rain-drenched school, separating the ``swimmers from the 
sunbathers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a great teacher,'' Bowerman said of Hayward, who coached  
from 1904-47. ``He's the fellow who established the idea that track 
and field can be run in a so-called wet atmosphere, and if you 
don't like the wet, don't come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said Bowerman's coaching style served both of them well  
as co-founders of Nike. 
</P>
<P>
	``Above all, I think he considered himself a professor of  
competitive responses,'' Knight said. ``Those are lessons you learn 
for all of life.''

<HEADLINE> Sun Country Set To Take On Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A former charter flight service will try to  
take on industry heavyweight Northwest Airlines beginning Tuesday 
by launching daily scheduled service to 11 cities from the Twin 
Cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Country Airlines is tiny compared to Eagan-based Northwest,  
which controls 80 percent of the seats in the Twin Cities market 
and operates nearly 500 flights each day from Minneapolis-St. Paul 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Country has spent millions of dollars on new technology and  
marketing to prepare for the challenge. But some analysts remain 
unconvinced Sun Country can compete and believe the low fares to 
such destinations as Seattle, New York and Los Angeles could be 
short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	New air carriers have had trouble in the Twin Cities market.  
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's aggressive tactics are one reason, along with  
travelers' reluctance to part with the frequent flier miles and 
bountiful schedule offered by the big airline, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sun Country just isn't allowed to make any mistakes starting  
out. They've got to find a very special niche and serve it 
extremely well,'' said Darryl Jenkins, a professor at George 
Washington University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest has long maintained that Sun Country has siphoned off  
price-sensitive customers with its charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider them to be an even bigger competitive threat,''  
said Northwest spokesman Jon Austin. ``They've chosen to enter 10 
of the largest cities we serve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Country owner Bill La Macchia Sr. said he believes in his  
business plan, which projects a profit for Sun Country this year. 
His management team, which includes company president Bill La 
Macchia Jr., will look at the numbers monthly, make changes as 
needed, and -- worst-case scenario -- find other uses for the 
airplanes if things don't go well here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's telling me that this thing is going to bleed,'' La  
Macchia Sr. said from his Milwaukee office, where he oversees Mark 
Travel Corp. and other business interests that helped him buy Sun 
Country in 1997. ``These people don't know what our business plan 
really is. They can't see inside our peoples' heads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, other airline heads, such as Roger Ferguson, president of  
Des Moines, Iowa-based Access Air, were skeptical. His strategy is 
to avoid major carriers or risk being trampled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Northwest believes in Nikita Khruschev's concept  
of peaceful coexistence,'' said Scott Hamilton, who watches the 
industry as editor of Commercial Aviation Report based in Redmond, 
Wash. ``Northwest's more of a nuclear first strike kind of 
competitor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department sued American Airlines this month  
alleging American undercut discount carrier Vanguard Airlines. 
Northwest has been accused of the same behavior by Reno Air and 
Kiwi, both of which made fleeting attempts to cut into Northwest's 
Twin Cities market share. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jenkins' research suggests new airlines fail because of poor  
planning, bad cash flow and lousy management more often than from 
competition or even predatory tactics from major airlines.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Strike Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- With a strike deadline within hours, and a  
walkout called a certainty without an agreement, the Teamsters 
union and new-car haulers remained far apart today on major issues 
for a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have made it very clear to management that their  
unacceptable demands to hire part-time workers, to cut pay for new 
employees and to use Mexican trucks would all trigger a strike,'' 
Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators, who began their talks in February, were working  
against a 12:01 a.m. EDT Tuesday deadline to reach a contract 
agreement for the 12,800 union truckers with the 17-company 
National Automobile Transporters Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The union could target one or all of the companies that contract  
with automakers to transport new cars to dealerships from assembly 
plants, ports and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Duchesne, a spokesman for the association, said Sunday  
the two sides had made some progress on equipment and safety 
matters, but there were still ``substantial differences on the 
major issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those include Teamster objections to industry proposals to give  
entry-level workers lower salaries and use part-time workers and 
Mexican truckers, and union demands for better pensions and health 
care and higher wage increases than management is offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies are flush with money because of the productivity  
of our drivers, so there will be no better opportunity to get a 
fair slice of the economic pie,'' said Hoffa, Teamsters president 
since March. 
</P>
<P>
	The car haulers say their drivers are the highest-paid truckers  
at $68,000 a year on average, and contend that labor costs are 
rising faster than what the companies can charge automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides met separately Sunday afternoon to consider  
proposals put forth in earlier talks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Gives Hillary Bit of Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sequestered in their vacation home on a  
Florida nature preserve, President Clinton gave his wife, Hillary, 
one bit of advice about the Senate race she is considering: ``You 
have to know, you need to know, why you want the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the first lady has yet to decide whether to seek  
the seat being vacated by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. But 
he said he would support her wholeheartedly if she did run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever she's for, I'm for,'' Clinton told reporters Sunday  
as Air Force One flew back to Washington. When asked whether the 
family would take another vacation later this summer in New York 
state, he said, ``I'll go wherever she wants to go. From now on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is barred by the Constitution from serving a third term,  
but he said, ``If I could run again, I would. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm not unhappy about it. I'm actually looking forward to  
being a person again. ... I never had a day in my life where I was 
unhappy. I always knew what I wanted to do, I was happy doing it, 
and every day was good to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had not decided what he'll do when leaves the White  
House in 2001, ``but I've got a lot of ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In talking to his wife about the Senate, Clinton said, ``I gave  
her probably the advice I gave everybody: You have to know, you 
need to know, why you want the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be able to tell somebody in 30 seconds, you have  
to be able to tell somebody in five minutes, you have to be able to 
give a 30-minute talk,'' he said. ``I got elected president because 
I knew, I had a very good idea what I wanted to do, and I think 
it's very important. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that consultants, and the polls, all that stuff, it's  
all very important. But the most important thing is that you know 
why you want to serve. It makes the effort of the campaign worth 
it, and it makes the risk of losing bearable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 15 candid minutes, Clinton discussed an array of topics,  
from the various animals he saw at the White Oak Plantation in 
Yulee, Fla., to the new Nigerian president and polishing up his 
golf game with three young pros who work at White Oak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the best round of my life the other day. I had a 75,''  
Clinton said, then quickly added that his young instructors let him 
take a ``mulligan,'' or a do-over shot. But as good as his score 
was, he said, the others shot 66, 67 and 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Clinton said he enjoyed the five-day vacation, and  
didn't miss the scrutiny of the Washington press corps, ``but don't 
take that in a negative way.'' He said he took delight in feeding 
pine cones to eight black rhinos, who ate them ``for roughage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the president bounced up and down to playfully  
simulate the effect of riding on the bumpy, unpaved road that led 
up to White Oak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons capped their five-day vacation Sunday by  
participating in an annual retreat by the Progressive Foundation, a 
branch of the Democratic Leadership Council. This year's topic was 
``The Politics of the Third Way,'' a term moderate Democrats have 
coined for Clinton's blend of restrained economic policies and 
liberal social agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation said the retreat, which was closed to the press,  
focused on the challenges the third way faces ``in this country and 
worldwide,'' defining the philosophy as the embodiment of ``equal 
opportunity for all, special privilege for none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to one attendee, Mrs. Clinton offered no hint at a  
morning meeting about her Senate decision. But a longtime adviser 
to the first lady said the longer she waits to make an official 
move, the more likely it was that she would run. Otherwise, other 
potential Democratic candidates would be cheated of time. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step would be forming an exploratory committee in July  
to cover the costs of unofficial campaigning in New York. A bid for 
the seat in 2000 likely will cost $15 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	James Carville, who managed the president's 1992 campaign, said  
Sunday on CNN's ``Late Edition'' that he expects Mrs. Clinton to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything I know and conversations I've had with any number  
of people, the first lady included, indicates to me that this is 
something that she really wants to do,'' Carville said. ``I expect 
her to mount a heck of an effective campaign ... And I expect her 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One concern has been how Mrs. Clinton would handle the increased  
scrutiny she would come under once she was the candidate, and not 
just the candidate's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Sunday in The New York Times Magazine,  
the first lady said she was prepared for such scrutiny given the 
pressures the Clintons have weathered from the Whitewater 
investigation through the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has crossed my mind. But the possibility of partisan or  
political attacks does not serve as a deterrent,'' she said. ``That 
is not anything that would prevent me, after having been through 
what we've been through, from deciding to run for office.''

<HEADLINE> WWII POW Remembers Who Saved Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RINDGE, N.H. (AP) -- Ralph Lavoie remembers just how close he  
came -- twice -- to being among those honored as America's war dead. 
And he remembers a buddy who defied a German guard to keep him 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	First, as a gunner on a B-17 bomber, Lavoie barely had time to  
parachute out of his falling plane before it crashed in December 
1943. 
</P>
<P>
	Then for 14 months, he faced the fear of death as a prisoner of  
war at Stalag 17-B in Austria, the camp that inspired a movie of 
the same name and the television comedy ``Hogan's Heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard stories that Hitler said: `Kill all the prisoners,'  
and we waited for it to happen,'' the 78-year-old Lavoie said last 
week. ``There always was the constant threat that the Germans would 
say, `Why are we feeding these guys?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, cancer claimed the man Lavoie and other POWs picked  
to be their camp leader -- a man they credit with keeping them 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	He was Kenneth Joseph Kurtenbach of Waterloo, Iowa, a sergeant  
also shot down on a bombing run. Kurtenbach, known as Kurt, helped 
organize the POWs, was their confidant and their representative to 
the Germans. He was also a savior the night Lavoie and fellow POW 
Jim Proakis tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	A hail of gunfire stopped them, killing Proakis and wounding  
Lavoie. A German soldier, noticing Lavoie had survived, shot him in 
the shoulder, neck, ribs and cheek. Lavoie rolled on the ground, 
trying to dodge the bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole object was to kill us both, then in the morning, at  
roll call, bring the boys out and say, `This is what happens. You 
try to escape, you die,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``Kurt and the boys were at the end of the compound,  
fighting with the Germans to let him come down and see if either of 
us was alive,'' Lavoie said. ``One German hit him in the mouth with 
a rifle butt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Kurtenbach came down with a stretcher and helped  
carry Lavoie to an aid station. It was an act that Lavoie believes 
saved his life, though Kurtenbach had already earned the admiration 
of fellow POWs by then. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was only 19 and I saw him stand up to German generals,''  
Lavoie said. ``Because of his forcing them to do as much as he 
could get them to do to improve conditions, we survived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lavoie is one of the organizers of an effort to spread the word  
about Kurtenbach's bravery and let former colleagues know of his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the hero of the story,'' Lavoie said. ``I'm proud to  
be part of it, but Kurt is the hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the decades after the war, Kurtenbach's homes in Iowa and  
Tucson, Ariz., saw a constant parade of POW visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``His POW buddies were always his greatest admirers,'' said  
Kurtenbach's widow, Myrtle, in a telephone interview. ``Those 
people were so close. The fact that he never lost any connection 
with most of them during the rest of their lives is amazing to 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her husband didn't consider himself special, though he  
appreciated his buddies' admiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt that being elected ... kept him sane and gave him more  
to do while in the camp, which made it easier for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband didn't talk much with his children about his war  
exploits, who have come to know them from the aging POWs who now 
gather often to reminisce, Mrs. Kurtenbach said. But her husband 
began a written narrative of his experiences last year, and ``told 
me to make sure I got it out and gave it to the kids,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Schilling Is Complete Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Curt Schilling has a long way to go before  
approaching the exploits of ``Old Hoss'' Radbourn, who pitched 73 
complete games in 1884. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, in this era of five-inning starters and career-ending arm  
injuries, Schilling's five straight complete games are nothing 
short of amazing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Phillies ace lived up to his menacing aura yet  
again Friday night with a four-hit shutout for his fifth 
consecutive complete game. He has six this season, not only leading 
the majors individually but surpassing every other team in both 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we have no intention of ever letting him go,''  
Phillies manager Terry Francona said. ``That's why teams are 
clamoring for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling (8-2) did more than pitch his first shutout of the  
season and 13th of his career in the Phillies' 2-0 victory over 
Colorado. He did so by blowing away Larry Walker, Dante Bichette 
and Vinny Castilla with pitches approaching 100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	And he did so less than a week after the worst ninth-inning  
collapse of his career. Last Sunday in New York, Schilling 
inexplicably squandered a 4-0 lead in a 5-4 loss to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Seemingly addicted to big-game pressure, Schilling needs little  
to get motivated. The memory of that crushing defeat was more than 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it motivated me,'' said Schilling, who struck out nine  
and walked one. ``How could it not? To lose a game like that all by 
yourself is tough. It was a tough five days for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a tougher nine innings for the Rockies.  
</P>
<P>
	After walking No. 8 hitter Chris Petersen to load the bases with  
two outs in the second, Schilling retired 22 of the last 24 batters 
and capped it with a ninth inning that showed his true zeal for 
finishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling struck out Walker, second in the NL with a .373  
average, on a 96 mph fastball. After throwing in the 92-93 mph 
range for the first eight innings, he engaged Bichette in a battle 
of pure power. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a ton left,'' Schilling said. ``I reached back for a  
lot. I threw him everything I had, and they were some of the best 
pitches I threw all night. Five or six times, I felt like I was 
going to get him but he kept getting the bat on the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bichette fouled off seven of Schilling's first 12 pitches before  
going down swinging on a 98 mph heater. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a horse, man,'' Bichette said. ``Just a horse.''  
</P>
<P>
	After Bichette's marathon, Schilling quickly disposed of  
Castilla on three pitches. The last one was a nasty 93 mph 
splitter, his 135th pitch of the game. On the Phillies' bench, Paul 
Byrd said, ``I thought we were going to the World Series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd, who spent time on the Atlanta staff with Greg Maddux and  
Tom Glavine, tried to compare Schilling's ninth inning to a 
different kind of dominance enjoyed by his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like Mark McGwire vs. Tony Gwynn,'' Byrd said. ``When  
McGwire hits a ball, it's something that other people can't do. 
Maddux is a great pitcher, and Glavine is a great pitcher. But 
Schilling did something in the ninth inning that no one else can 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the days of knickers and mitten-like gloves, pitchers  
finished just about every game they started. Radbourn completed all 
73 of his starts in 1884. At a time when home runs were almost as 
unheard of as helmet cams, the ``Hoss'' had a 60-12 record and 1.38 
ERA 
</P>
<P>
	Heck, Babe Ruth led the American League with 35 complete games  
for Boston in 1917. Walter Johnson completed 36 of 37 starts in 
1911. 
</P>
<P>
	In the modern era, the Phillies' Robin Roberts pitched 28  
straight complete games in 1953 and finished the season with 33. 
Steve Carlton's career-high was 30 in 1972, that awesome season in 
which he had 27 of the Phillies' 59 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	How times have changed. Schilling led the NL with 15 complete  
games last season, and Baltimore's Scott Erickson led the AL with 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know that I run into a lot more guys that have a smile on  
their face when get pulled after six innings winning 4-1 than guys 
that are angry,'' Schilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other pitchers this decade have pitched five  
consecutive complete games. Pat Hentgen did it for Toronto in 1996 
en route to a Cy Young Award. Philadelphia's Tommy Greene did it in 
1993 en route to a sore arm that derailed his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Arm injuries are rampant. Cubs right-hander Kerry Wood is out  
for the year after major elbow surgery. Last week, Tampa Bay's Tony 
Saunders became the latest in a disturbing string of left-handed 
pitchers who have mysteriously broken their arms throwing a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Schilling, the ``Iron Horse'' of the mound, had shoulder  
surgery in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he keeps on pitching, and finishing what he started.

<HEADLINE> Crew Chief Hit by Car Leaving Pit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The best news for Robby McGehee wasn't that  
he ran with the leaders on Sunday during much of his first Indy 500 
and finished the race in fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
	It was that his chief mechanic will get to hear all about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Fried of Mentor, Ohio, who is also McGehee's right front  
tire man, was directing the car out of the pit in lap No. 12 when 
Jimmy Kite's car hit him from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident was triggered when Kite, the youngest driver in the  
race at 23, was hit by Johnny Unser, whose brakes failed as he 
entered the pit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fried flipped into the air and landed on his face, sending blood  
pouring from his nose and mouth. He was admitted to Methodist 
Hospital in critical condition with head and chest injuries, but 
doctors said his vital signs had stabilized and he was responding 
to commands. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision disabled Kite's steering, preventing him from  
avoiding Fried. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was on the brakes as hard as I could. There's nothing you  
could do with broken steering,'' Kite said. ``I feel bad right now. 
There's nothing you could do. It's the most helpless feeling I've 
ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No crew member has been killed at Indy since 1973, when Armando  
Tehran, a mechanic for driver Swede Savage, was struck by a fire 
truck speeding from the pits to the scene of a crash that fatally 
injured Savage. 
</P>
<P>
	McGehee, who finished fifth after starting 27th, said it was  
hard to run not knowing his crew chief's condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of the way through the race, the 25-year-old rookie  
from Chesterfield, Mo., heard that Fried had regained 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing that could happen was when they came on (his  
two-way radio) and told me that he was awake and giving a thumbs 
up,'' McGehee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Car owner Dave Conti, who said Fried is like a brother to him,  
recalled seeing him covered in blood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really scared,'' Conti said.  
</P>
<P>
	Janet McGehee spent much of the race crying as she watched her  
son from his pit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept asking about Steve the whole time,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The crew dedicated the race to Fried. Conti went to the hospital  
when the race ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Race fan Steve Peterson of Prospect Heights, Ill., saw the  
accident from his seat in the infield bleachers near McGehee's pit 
and said it was unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kite had nowhere to go,'' Peterson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Another pit accident later in the race knocked out Greg Ray, who  
had just inherited the lead when Arie Luyendyk crashed in the third 
turn. Ray dashed into the pits for a quick refueling but ran into 
Mark Dismore. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray took off his steering wheel and slammed it on top of his  
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just makes you want to cry,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	While obviously upset by Fried's injury, McGehee said running  
the race was ``the highest point of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were there at the end and that's what I've been saying that  
we were trying to do all week, and we're here,'' McGehee said.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Strike Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The Teamsters and new car haulers were  
still far apart Sunday on major issues such as pay for new workers 
and pensions as a strike deadline loomed early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters President James P. Hoffa said the union was ready to  
strike when its current contract expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have made it very clear to management that their  
unacceptable demands to hire part-time workers, to cut pay for new 
employees, and to use Mexican trucks would all trigger a strike,'' 
Hoffa said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations began in February between the Teamsters,  
representing 12,800 workers in the contract dispute, and the 
National Automobile Transporters Association, which is made up of 
17 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The union could target one or all of the companies that contract  
with automakers to move new cars to dealers from assembly plants, 
ports and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Duchesne, a spokesman for the association, said the two  
sides had made some progress on equipment and safety matters, but 
there were still ``substantial differences on the major issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those include union objections to industry proposals to give  
entry-level workers lower salaries and use part-time workers and 
Mexican truckers, and union demands for better pensions and health 
care and higher wage increases than management is offering. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies are flush with money because of the productivity  
of our drivers so there will be no better opportunity to get a fair 
slice of the economic pie,'' said Hoffa, who took over the 
Teamsters in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The car haulers say the Teamsters are the highest-paid truckers  
at $68,000 on average, and contend that labor costs are rising 
faster than what the hauling companies can charge automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides met separately Sunday afternoon to consider  
proposals put forth in earlier talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchesne said he expected the talks to continue well into the  
night Monday.

<HEADLINE> Italy: Murdoch Welcome in TV Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italy's communication minister said Sunday he  
welcomed Australian-born media magnate Rupert Murdoch's minority 
entry to the country's Pay-TV market, saying, ``In Italy, there's 
room for all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia SpA signed a deal Saturday to sell 65 percent of  
its digital pay-TV unit, Stream, to a group of companies including 
Murdoch's News Corp., for $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. will take a 35 percent stake, Italy's Cecchi Gori  
group 18 percent, and SDS, a company formed by four Italian soccer 
clubs, 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch has been trying to gain entry to Italy's pay-TV field  
for some time, setting off protests by some in government and media 
about feared foreign control of sports, information and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``In an essential service like television, in Italy, there's  
room for all,'' as long as the service overall remains essentially 
Italian, Communications Minister Salvatore Cardinale said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Murdoch enters within a group that's predominantly national,''  
Cardinale stressed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Communications Undersecretary Vincenzo Vita said  
Murdoch was welcome as long as he showed ``rigorous respect for 
Italian rules and laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's signing ratified a deal announced in April. Olivetti  
SpA's successful takeover of Telecom Italia delayed the sale 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	Stream is Italy's second-largest digital TV operator, with an  
estimated 120,000 subscribers. The number is expected to increase 
since the platform now will also offer popular soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
	Stream already has the encoded broadcast rights for games played  
by the Fiorentina, Lazio, Parma and Roma soccer clubs from 1999 to 
2005.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Jr. Has Mediocre Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- The best thing you could say about the  
NASCAR Winston Cup debut of Dale Earnhardt Jr. is he finished. 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old son of seven-time circuit champion Dale  
Earnhardt stole his father's thunder in qualifying by starting 
eighth in the Coca-Cola 600, but was never a factor Sunday night in 
the longest race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Earnhardt finished 16th after going a lap down after  
78 laps of 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we first started the race our car was terribly loose I  
was just trying to get out of the way from everybody and not make a 
fool of myself,'' said Earnhardt Jr. ``I was surprised what those 
guys can do with those cars and how well they drive them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt Jr. sought out his father for approval after the race.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `You did good and stayed out of trouble,''' Earnhardt  
Jr. said. ``I wanted to know he was happy as a car owner and a 
father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The younger Earnhardt said he had always dreamed of running on  
the Winston Cup circuit, but admitted he had some nerves from the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was almost like dragging a dog to the bathtub,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the estimated 200,000 fans in attendance who wanted to  
see some side-by-side racing between the younger Earnhardt and his 
father -- The Intimidator -- left Lowe's Motor Speedway disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver known as Little E had demonstrated his potential to  
be one of the sport's next superstars on the Busch Grand National 
circuit, prompting Anheuser-Busch to sign on as his Winston Cup 
sponsor, committing more than $10 million a year through its 
Budweiser brand. 
</P>
<P>
	The young Earnhardt said a 600-mile race was quite a bit  
different than a 300-mile Busch race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe how many green stops we had,'' he said.  
``We don't see that many green-flag stops in the Busch series. 
That's something new for me to run 120 laps consecutively without a 
caution or a breather or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt Jr. got off to a rough start in his biggest race to  
date. He showed his inexperience -- or nervousness -- when he 
couldn't find his pit on his first stop on lap 63. 
</P>
<P>
	He slowed and was ready to pull into an area 20 pits shy of his  
own, but then proceeded to his area at the end of the frontstretch, 
wasting precious seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	That mistake moved the young Earnhardt even further back in the  
field. By lap 10 he was already 16th -- losing eight positions -- 
while his father had moved up to ninth after starting 15th. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wasn't thinking,'' he said of the botched pit stop.  
``We had some difficulty there and my spotter was directing me to 
Steve Park's pit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On lap 78, Earnhardt Jr. went a lap down when he was passed  
heading into turn 3 by eventual winner Jeff Burton. Earnhardt then 
spent the rest of the race trying to get back on the lead lap, 
which he failed to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his high-profile son, the elder Earnhardt was virtually  
unknown outside the region when he showed up on Charlotte's 
1 1/2-mile, high-banked trioval in 1975, starting 33rd and finishing 
22nd. 
</P>
<P>
	And dad showed his youngster he still has something left,  
finishing a strong sixth Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt Jr. said after the race he needs to get in better  
shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, my (fitness) program is calling a pizza joint and  
drinking a Budweiser,'' he said, joking. ``But my daddy is right, I 
need to be on the treadmill and working out.''

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya-Trinidad Gets Green Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The monetary dispute in the camp of  
IBF champion Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad was resolved Sunday, giving 
the green light to the Sept. 18 date for a welterweight unification 
with WBC champion Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything turned out as we wished. In the end, we will  
present the match that all the world wants to see,'' promoter Don 
King said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Felix Trinidad Sr., the fighter's father and manager, was not as  
happy with Sunday's deal, which gives Trinidad $8.5 million and 
King $2 million. In addition, King is to pay Trinidad $300,000 for 
training costs and both men get an additional $4 each for every 
pay-per-view customer over 850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly I could have negotiated a better contract ... but it's  
the match that all the world wants to see and the time has come. 
It's past time for Tito to confront Oscar De La Hoya and knock him 
out to show for real who is the best,'' Trinidad Sr. said after 6 1/2 
hours of negotiations Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is a little-known fighter from Puerto Rico with an  
impressive 35-0 record that he upheld Saturday night with his 30th 
knockout, this one of Colombia's Hugo Pineda on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya is 31-0 with 22 knockouts and will earn $15 million  
from the Sept. 18 fight at Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the initial deal, Trinidad was to get $8 million and King  
$2 million. Trinidad's camp had been squabbling over an additional 
$500,000 agreed to by De La Hoya's promoter Bob Arum. Trinidad Sr. 
was holding out in clear expectation of a record number of 
pay-per-view customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad was confident after Saturday's fight.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was an important triumph on the way to my greatest  
challenge,'' he said. ``This was a way for me to demonstrate to (De 
La Hoya) I'm ready for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad had lost 18 pounds over two months to qualify for his  
division, weighing in at 147 pounds Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya hurt his hand when he defended his title May 24  
against Oba Carr, but after finding it was only sprained said he 
would have time to recuperate before getting into training to face 
Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get it on,'' De La Hoya said. ``It will be the fight of  
the century.''

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush To Crow About Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush saw the Legislature approve  
tax cuts worth about $1.85 billion Sunday, less than he asked for 
but enough to claim bragging rights in a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	While the final plan was about $800 million less than Bush  
wanted -- and just over one-fourth the $6.4 billion budget surplus 
lawmakers had to work with -- the governor called them 
``substantial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a little early to predict victory for all of us,  
but I do think that when it's all said and done, the Legislature 
has responded for what's best for Texas,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers were to adjourn Monday. Bush is headed to Iowa and New  
Hampshire in mid-June, and several more states later in the month, 
as his presidential ``exploratory'' efforts pick up steam. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a Republican primary, taxes are a great issue. It'll kill  
you or make you. He's golden on taxes,'' said Bill Miller, a Texas 
political consultant who has worked for Democrats and Republicans. 
``He's got bragging rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said Bush ducked difficult issues and left it to  
lawmakers to hammer out everything from teacher pay to children's 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to sit on the fence about everything there is and see  
which way the wind's blowing,'' said Texas Democratic Party chair 
Molly Beth Malcolm. ``A leader takes a stand on tough issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues that will be scrutinized as Bush begins to sound  
out a presidential effort in the coming weeks: 
</P>
<P>
	--Democrats and Republicans approved his proposals to require  
parental notification before minors can get an abortion, jail 
juveniles caught with guns and begin deregulation of the electric 
utility industry. 
</P>
<P>
	--His biggest defeat was failure to get taxpayer-funded vouchers  
to pay private school tuition. His brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, has 
approval for vouchers in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	--Critics beat up the Texas governor over the Legislature's  
refusal to toughen the state hate crimes law or require background 
checks on buyers at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sat out those fights. He said ``all crime is hate'' but  
left the debate to lawmakers; he said he favored background checks 
but called it a federal matter. 
</P>
<P>
	While he took heat, the death of those bills in legislative  
committees kept Bush from having to sign or veto them. That spared 
him the possible wrath of voters on either side of two politically 
contentious issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call him Governor beat-around-the-Bush,'' Mrs. Malcolm said.  
``It's rhetoric vs. reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time and again, Democrats accused Bush of putting his  
presidential ambitions first. 
</P>
<P>
	They accused him of putting too much emphasis on corporate tax  
relief; pushing property tax cuts that benefit only some Texans 
rather than broad sales tax cuts for all; failing to demand 
stronger environmental measures; and being stingy toward the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're either going to care more about the voters in New  
Hampshire or Iowa, or we're going to care more about the school 
children of Texas,'' Rep. Domingo Garcia of Dallas complained 
during a debate pitting property tax cuts against funding for 
smaller school classes.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Finish Lengthy Spacewalk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- In the second-longest spacewalk  
ever, Discovery's astronauts rigged cranes and other tools to the 
international space station Sunday, then turned to the bigger work 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of seven planned to enter the space station Sunday  
night for three days of repairs and deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the jobs awaiting them inside the station, vacant for the  
last six months: pulling up the floor to replace electrical meters 
on Russian batteries that aren't charging properly, trying to fix a 
broken U.S. communication system, and installing mufflers to reduce 
the noise inside the Russian-built module. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the  
multitude of problems coming so soon after the space station's 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``In high-tech like this, you're going to have that happen,''  
Mission Control's Milt Heflin explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle astronauts have until Thursday to unload 3,600  
pounds of spare parts, computers, water and clothes for the men who 
are due to move in next March. 
</P>
<P>
	During Saturday night's spacewalk, Tamara Jernigan and Dr.  
Daniel Barry lugged 700 pounds of gear from the shuttle to the 
station. A pair of 5-foot cranes took up most of the load. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they spent eight hours outside the seven-story-plus  
complex -- 1 1/2 hours longer than planned -- the excursion ended too 
soon for their taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be telling me we're almost done?'' Barry asked when  
it came time to go back in Sunday morning. His next word summed it 
all up: ``Wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their spacewalk was just 34 minutes shy of NASA's all-time  
record, an 8 1/2-hour walk back in 1992 in which three astronauts 
grabbed a runaway satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry and Jernigan fell behind when they had to struggle with  
tight screws holding down the Russian-built crane in Discovery's 
cargo bay. Then a camera jammed while they were photographing the 
space station, and they had to get a spare. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the pair were finally back in Discovery's repressurizing  
air lock, Jernigan had trouble connecting her lifeline to the 
shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the snags, Barry and Jernigan accomplished all their  
major chores. About the only thing left undone was a test of NASA's 
newly installed crane; it eventually will be used to haul large 
items around the orbiting outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	``There simply wasn't enough time,'' said Mike Hess, who managed  
the spacewalk from Mission Control. ``We're going to have to rely 
on the fact that we did extensive ground testing before launch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because only two pieces of the Russian crane were installed, a  
test on that unit wasn't needed. The remaining parts, which weren't 
ready for Discovery's flight, will go up on the next shuttle visit 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the fourth spacewalk on the international space station  
since it was launched in pieces late last year. Altogether, shuttle 
astronauts have spent 29 hours working on the station's exterior, 
mostly back in December. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA estimates 158 more spacewalks, totaling more than 1,000  
hours, will be needed over the next five years to build and 
maintain the station.

<HEADLINE> San Jose Chinatown Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Archaeologists have unearthed evidence  
of a turn-of-the-century Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
	City records, newspaper accounts and fire insurance maps  
suggested the existence of a Chinese community in the area, but no 
traces had been found until the excavations. The site was 
discovered as crews prepared for construction on a freeway 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Excavations began in April but were kept secret from the public  
to prevent looting. By Friday, the site was covered by dirt again 
after artifacts were removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The excavation project revealed brick foundations of buildings,  
asphalt streets and a then-state-of-the-art sewer system. 
</P>

	The community was known as Woolen Mills Chinatown, an

<P>
	There were 15 brick-front stores, a barbershop, two restaurants,  
two temples, an opera-theater, a laundry, a warehouse, a pair of 
outdoor cooking pits and wood frame tenements. They lived there 
from 1887 to 1902 until a fire destroyed most of the buildings.

<HEADLINE> Group Says World Hotter, Stormier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world is getting hotter and Mother Nature  
madder, sperm counts are sinking in the United States and Europe, 
and the use of wind power is soaring, a millennium-ending snapshot 
of global trends finds. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwatch Institute's annual eclectic compilation of facts and  
figures, ``Vital Signs 1999,'' offers a little something for 
everyone making predictions about where the planet and its 
inhabitants are headed in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
	An assessment by Worldwatch president Lester Brown in the report  
released Saturday is that the latest data underscore big problems, 
with the average global temperature, weather-related damage and 
people displaced by storms all going ``off the charts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The earth registered a record annual average temperature of  
14.57 degrees Celsius (58.23 degrees Fahrenheit). The cost of 
damage from storms was up ``a staggering 53 percent'' to $92 
billion for 1998. And 300 million people were driven from their 
homes by storms and flooding -- a statistic that researchers pulled 
together for the first time this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said in an interview that much of the data is positive,  
however, including a continued strong growth in the use of wind 
power, up an average of 22 percent a year over the last decade; 
increases in solar cell usage, up 16 percent a year; and rapidly 
growing cross-cultural communications over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Internet users has been increasing by about 50  
percent a year since 1995 and reached an estimated 147 million 
people. The most rapid hooking up of new users is occurring in 
surprising places: an eightfold increase in Nigeria last year, a 
quadrupling in Namibia, while the rest of Africa saw only modest 
growth. The regional leader in new Internet hookups is Latin 
America, which almost doubled the number of host computers last 
year, Worldwatch said. 
</P>
<P>
	``How we think about mobility and how we think about development  
are beginning to change,'' Brown said. For instance, he said, the 
Internet brings the content of the world's museums and libraries to 
people around the globe, and Internet commerce is exploding. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwatch, a nongovernment research group funded by grants and  
sales of its publications, has been compiling ``Vital Signs'' for 
eight years and adds new categories each year. Among new subjects 
this year is the look at dropping sperm counts in industrial 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to environmental pollutants as a possible cause, the  
report cites a 50 percent decline in male sperm counts among those 
studied since the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
	The data are gleaned from a variety of studies in the United  
States and Europe -- 61 since 1938 -- and offer no comparison with 
Third World sperm counts. It also makes no attempt to provide a 
demographic cross-section of males. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional study of sperm counts is under way in four U.S.  
cities, four European cities and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring a mixed bag of trends, other data cited in the  
Worldwatch study includes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Global economic growth slows and world trade declines as  
spending on advertising and fast-food consumption go up. 
</P>
<P>
	--Production of automobiles and bicycles declines as world air  
travel soars. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of wars is up as U.N. peacekeeping expenditures and  
nuclear arsenals decline. 
</P>
<P>
	--World population swells and life expectancy is up as new AIDS  
cases continue to set records. 
</P>
<P>
	--Grain harvest and meat production slow as the use of irrigation  
expands. 
</P>
<P>
	--Burning of fossil fuels and nuclear power generation decline as  
wind power and solar cell production grow by double digits.

<HEADLINE> Handicapped Help Build Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Chris Wright's new home won't only be  
handicapped-accessible, it will be handicapped-built. 
</P>
<P>
	People who are blind, deaf, mute and mentally impaired will join  
others in wheelchairs, on crutches and with debilitating diseases 
this week to build a house for Wright, a paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
	The house is a project of Habitat for Humanity, the  
Georgia-based organization that builds low-cost homes for the 
needy. Partners in the work include Ability magazine and BellSouth, 
which aided in the design. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors say the project is the first time handicapped people  
have built a home for a handicapped person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just overjoyed. I thank God,'' said Wright, 37, paralyzed  
from the waist down because of transverse myelitis, a neurological 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the workers will arrive at the job site in west  
Birmingham on Monday. Demetrius Jackson got an early start last 
week laying the footings and concrete-block foundation for the 
three-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blind will be painting. There's a one-legged guy who's  
supposed to be doing the plumbing work,'' said Jackson, a former 
professional football player who was disabled by a stroke in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright was a robust painter when his right foot began going numb  
in the summer of 1991. The numbness spread, and by September of 
that year he couldn't walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright currently lives with an older sister and his mother, a  
dialysis patient he cares for. The old house has wide doorways, 
making it easier for him to maneuver his wheelchair, but it lacks 
other features that make life easier for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Counters in the new house will be designed so a wheelchair can  
fit under them. Wright's wheelchair will fit in the shower, and the 
carpet will be short so tires will roll easier. There will be an 
intercom system and a carport for Wright's van, which he drives 
with hand controls. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright already has built up ``sweat equity'' in the home by  
helping assemble the walls, which will be trucked to the site and 
erected by others in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who receives disability benefits, will purchase the home  
for $40,000 using an interest-free loan from Habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright could be living in the house in a matter of days. Later  
this year, he plans to marry fiance Diana Hopkins and move her in, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to get married last year, but we didn't have  
anywhere to live,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Jackson Misses Key Shots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Jackson was feeling no panic over  
Indiana's loss in the opening game of the Eastern Conference finals 
with New York, 93-90 setback that came as he missed two key shots 
over the final 31 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The first miss came from the free throw line with the score tied  
88-88. Antonio Davis was called for a loose ball foul on the miss, 
sending Patrick Ewing to the free throw line where he hit two foul 
shots to put the Knicks ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, with New York holding a 93-90 lead and the Pacers filling  
the court with potential 3-point shooters, Jackson tossed up an 
airball as time expired. His foot was close to the line as he shot, 
but whether it was a 2- or 3-point attempt became moot when it 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't meant to be,'' said Jackson, who had predicted  
an Indiana victory in the best-of-7 series before it began. ``We 
made mistakes, missed shots, missed foul shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss ended a 12-game playoff winning streak for Indiana at  
Market Square Arena, a run that included three over Chicago in the 
conference finals last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were playing zone. Spree (Latrell Sprewell) was playing  
center field and Allan (Houston) was all over me. Mark had a decent 
look at it. It really didn't matter who took it, we had a lot of 
guys out there who could have hit that shot,'' said Reggie Miller, 
who led Indiana with 19 points and also missed a key 3-pointer in 
the final minute that would have given Indiana the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to get a 3 up,'' Jackson said. ``It didn't go in,  
but I can live with the look. I missed some chippies, missed some 
easy ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 is Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we played hard, no question about that. We've just  
got to continue to keep on working, we'll be fine,'' Jackson said. 
``There's no panic in this lockerroom. Give them credit, they won 
game one. ... We didn't get the job done early on. They played 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The misses in the final minutes took the luster off Jackson's  
play against the Knicks, a team he won rookie of the year honors 
for and played with for five years. In 31 minutes, Jackson had 11 
assists, seven rebounds and one turnover while scoring six points 
on 1-of-8 shooting from the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won the ballgame. We're not going to win every game,''  
Jackson said. ``We're a veteran team, no panic here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana lost despite outrebounding the Knicks 41-39 and  
outshooting them from the field. A key difference was behind the 
3-point line and fast-break points. New York was 6-of-12 and 
Indiana just 3-of-9 from behind the arc and the Knicks had a 22-8 
advantage in fast-break points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll look forward to Tuesday. We still feel we're going to  
win it,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	To do that, Indiana will also look for a stronger performance  
from center Rik Smits, who was 4-of-12 from the field and played 
only 26 minutes before fouling out with 7:38 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some open looks, but they just didn't fall. Two or three  
looks I did get, I was double-teamed and another one I missed,'' 
said Smits, who finished with 12 points.

<HEADLINE> Venus Didn't Do Her Homework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Next time she faces an obscure player at a Grand  
Slam, Venus Williams might consider a little homework. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams admitted she didn't do that with Barbara Schwartz. Now  
the 125th-ranked Austrian is in the quarterfinals and Williams is 
out the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who lost 2-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-3, said she had never seen  
Schwartz play and knew virtually nothing about her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was occupied playing my own matches,'' said Williams, seeded  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether she should have tried to learn something of her  
opponent, Williams said: ``It's a possibility, but it didn't 
happen. What can I say? 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't really know who exactly I was playing. I didn't watch  
the draw so much, so I didn't really know,'' she said. ``I mean 
what's the difference? You go out there and compete, you play the 
ball, you play the point. I have to be prepared with my game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Martina Hingis said it's ``dangerous'' not to know  
much about an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it came out that way, I guess,'' she said. ``I just  
don't go into a match not knowing what is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No. 2 Lindsay Davenport said she always tries to get information  
on the strengths and weaknesses of her opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the round of 16, you can't take anybody lightly,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz shouldn't have been such an unknown quantity.  
</P>
<P>
	True, the 20-year-old Austrian was still at school last year.  
But she won a set against Steffi Graf at the Australian Open this 
year and was one of the biggest first-round surprises at this 
year's French by beating 13th-seeded Dominique van Roost. 
</P>
<P>
	She downed Nathalie Dechy, another top 30 player, in the third  
round. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was a huge blow to Williams, who like her sister Serena  
was supremely confident of winning her first Grand Slam at Roland 
Garros. 
</P>
<P>
	She was brilliant coming into the tournament, having won 21 of  
her last 22 matches and consecutive clay-court titles at the German 
and Italian opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had three match points against Schwartz in the second  
set, but suddenly began to struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz, serving at 5-6, 0-40, won five straight points. At  
that stage, Williams was still upbeat, saying she thought 
```tiebreak, I am going to win this match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then everything unraveled.  
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly, before I knew it, it was the third set,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the tiebreaker, Williams hit a forehand into the net to give  
Schwartz the set. In the third, Schwartz broke three times. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first Grand Slam that I haven't got to the  
quarterfinals. That's kind of odd,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis admitted she was relieved Williams lost.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is very surprising that Barbara beat Venus,'' she said.  
``I'm happy about that result, that I don't have to play Venus. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the draw with both of them on my side I thought, I  
am really going to have to work if I want to win this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Williams wasn't too despondent at her loss.  
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, when I lose a match I really beat myself. But this  
time I really think she came out and played well.''

<HEADLINE> Man Leaves Inner City to Ivy League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cedric Jennings has known two very different  
lives: the violence and fear of this city's roughest, poorest 
neighborhoods and the privileged, ivy-covered walls of Brown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Where he goes after graduating Monday from Brown remains an open  
question. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live in two worlds,'' says Jennings, 21. ``I have to turn  
the way I address people on and off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This tall, self-assured young man, plucked from obscurity to be  
the hero of a Pulitzer Prize-winning series in The Wall Street 
Journal and a subsequent book by author Ron Suskind, now looks 
forward to a new adventure -- possibly working in advertising or the 
music industry, perhaps in California. 
</P>
<P>
	He appreciates the praise he has received from Washington's  
mayor for his long journey from a rough place. But it is not enough 
to persuade him to return to a city where the memories are not that 
great. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were always ducking bullets,'' Jennings said of his  
childhood in southeast Washington, just a few miles from Capitol 
but a universe removed. 
</P>
<P>
	School was no safe haven. ``There were a lot of fights,'' he  
said. ``I can remember the blood drop trail on the way to school 
after someone was stabbed. It still haunts me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In some ways, journeying home from Brown has become almost as  
difficult as going to college for the first time four years ago, 
even though Jennings says he enjoys visiting his mother, who still 
lives here. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people at home consider me a smart person,  
but they don't care about that as long as I'm down to earth,'' 
Jennings says. 
</P>
<P>
	Suskind shadowed Jennings during part of his high school and  
college years to tell the story of an ``undercover honors student'' 
at an urban school where being smart makes you a target of bullies. 
</P>
<P>
	The reporter says he was surprised to hear how often people told  
the youngster to remain humble. When Suskind first approached a 
school administrator about interviewing Jennings, the school 
official said the honors student ``has got a quick tongue and is 
too proud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such comments used to bother Jennings, but they do not seem to  
anymore. ``Since when is being proud of academic success a crime?'' 
he asks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodging bullets and fists and getting Ivy League school grades  
is no small feat for a kid from Jennings' neighborhood, said 
Suskind, who lives in a manicured part of Northwest Washington. 
``We really are two cities, but maybe we don't have to be,'' 
Suskind said. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the way the city's new mayor, Anthony Williams, says he  
sees things, too. He pointed to Jennings' story during his 
inaugural address as all that is good about Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cedric's tenacious struggle to achieve acceptance to Brown  
University shows you everything you need to know about our 
community's passionate, ingrained hope in the unseen,'' Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the mayor gave that kind of speech to young people, he might  
inspire more of them to make something of their lives, Suskind 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A chemistry teacher at Ballou served as Jennings' principal male  
role model because his father was in and out of prison on drug 
charges. His mother, Barbara Jennings, raised him by herself. 
</P>
<P>
	As with many other experiences, Jennings used it in his academic  
pursuits, writing his senior thesis on the role fathers play in the 
academic success of boys in inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings says he is not misunderstood at Brown, unlike his high  
school days. 
</P>
<P>
	But college was an adjustment. In his freshman year, Jennings  
fell behind other students who had gone to better high schools. 
Eventually, his falling grades prompted him to seek tutoring, which 
helped. But he wishes the university had provided remedial classes 
and more emotional support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jennings expects to graduate with a 3.4 grade point average  
and a major in education with an emphasis on math. He turned down 
an offer from a leading investment banking firm in hopes of finding 
something in advertising or music. 
</P>
<P>
	He volunteers at a city school in Providence, R.I., Brown's  
home, and says one day he would like to turn his energy toward 
teaching. Jennings also enjoys talking with other young people 
about the book and finds it ironic he has gone from being a misfit 
to a role model. 
</P>
<P>
	Readers may have worried about him as they turned the pages of  
Suskind's book, ``A Hope in the Unseen: An American Odyssey from 
the Inner City to the Ivy League,'' but there seems little cause 
for concern now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not only hopeful, I'm more empowered,'' said Jennings.  
``I'm more assured that I'm going to be OK.''

<HEADLINE>  Fusion 2, Mutiny 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Fusion, behind goals by  
Diego Serna and Henry Gutierrez, snapped a five-game losing streak 
tonight with a 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay (5-5, 9 points) had its five-game winning streak  
snapped as it suffered its first loss since acquiring Carlos 
Valderrama from the Fusion on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The win moved the Fusion (4-8, 8 points) into a three-way tie  
with New England and New York/New Jersey for fourth place in Major 
League Soccer's Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama received an ovation from Fusion fans during pregame  
introductions. He was booed, though, in the 37th minute after 
receiving a yellow card for blatantly elbowing Serna as the two 
went for a ball near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna opened the scoring in the 22nd minute, when he headed a  
Gutierrez cross past Mutiny goalkeeper Andy Kirk. The goal gave the 
Fusion its first lead in a game since a 1-0 win over Kansas City on 
April 24.

<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Fusion, behind goals by  
Diego Serna and Henry Gutierrez, snapped a five-game losing streak 
tonight with a 2-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Mutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay (5-5, 9 points) had its five-game winning streak  
snapped as it suffered its first loss since acquiring Carlos 
Valderrama from the Fusion on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	The win moved the Fusion (4-8, 8 points) into a three-way tie  
with New England and New York/New Jersey for fourth place in Major 
League Soccer's Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Valderrama received an ovation from Fusion fans during pregame  
introductions. He was booed, though, in the 37th minute after 
receiving a yellow card for blatantly elbowing Serna as the two 
went for a ball near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna opened the scoring in the 22nd minute, when he headed a  
Gutierrez cross past Mutiny goalkeeper Andy Kirk. The goal gave the 
Fusion its first lead in a game since a 1-0 win over Kansas City on 
April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna now has scored a goal in four straight games and has seven  
on the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez gave the Fusion a 2-0 lead in the 56th minute with a  
penalty kick goal. Referee Brian Hall awarded the penalty after 
Tampa Bay defender Dominic Kinnear fouled Fusion forward Mickey 
Trotman as he jumped for a Serna cross.

Steve Ralston cross. The goal, Valderrama's first with the Mutiny,

<HEADLINE> Victim's Family Sues Speedway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- An attorney for the family of one of  
three spectators killed during a race at Lowe's Motor Speedway has 
filed a lawsuit against the track's owners, the Indy Racing League 
and track president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed Friday in Mecklenburg Superior Court by  
Robert Beauchamp, an attorney representing the estate of Dexter 
Mobley. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobley, 41, and two other fans died when a wheel and other  
debris flew into the stands after a crash during the VisionAire 500 
on May 1. Eight others were injured in the grandstand of the track 
in neighboring Concord. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims the defendants contributed to the deaths by  
allowing Indy cars to race on the high-banked, 1 1/2-mile oval, and by 
failing to erect higher catch fences around the track, The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the accident, Speedway Motorsports Inc. (SMI),  
which owns Lowe's and three other tracks that stage IRL races, 
decided to raise catch fences from 15 feet to 21 feet. The IRL cars 
began using tethers -- designed to keep the wheel and suspension 
parts attached to the cars in the event of a crash -- on Sunday in 
the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleges that SMI and the IRL were negligent for failing  
to require the tethers prior to the May 1 race. The suit also 
claims that SMI, the IRL and Wheeler failed to notify fans of the 
``potential lethal risks'' associated with flying debris. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident came less than a year after three fans were killed  
during a CART race at Michigan Speedway. The family of one of those 
victims filed a lawsuit against that track. Last December, a judge 
ruled the family could not seek punitive damages against the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to the attorneys in Michigan, and we've agreed to  
put the whole industry on trial,'' Beauchamp said. ``Between 
Michigan and the VisionAire 500, why didn't they do anything to 
improve safety? Six people shouldn't have to die to change 
something.''

<HEADLINE>  Sir Bear Springs Upset in Met Mile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Last fall, Sir Bear gave 62-year-old trainer  
Ralph Ziadie his first Grade I victory when he upset Coronado's 
Quest to win the Cigar Mile at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday, the 6-year-old gelding returned to New York and,  
overlooked at 6-1, gave Ziadie his second Grade I victory, charging 
from off the pace to take the $500,000 Metropolitan Handicap at 
Belmont Park by 1 3/4 lengths over longshot Crafty Friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Gold, another longshot with odds of 10-1, was third,  
followed by favored Affirmed Success, Lord Grillo, the 3-year-old 
Cat Thief, Lil's Lad and Rock and Roll. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse never gets any respect,'' said an emotional Ziadie,  
who is based at Calder racetrack in Florida. ``Any Grade I race 
means a lot to any trainer, whether it's Wayne Lukas or me. I was a 
little nervous before the race, because we had a new jockey, but 
Johnny (Velazquez) rode him perfect, as if he'd ridden him every 
time before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under Velazquez, who got the mount after Jerry Bailey elected to  
ride the Lukas-trained Cat Thief and Richard Migliore had already 
committed to Crafty Friend, Sir Bear broke well and then settled in 
sixth position on the outside as Lil's Lad, Cat Thief and Affirmed 
Success sped through early fractions of :22.44 and :44.64. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming out of the far turn, Affirmed Success grabbed the lead  
but was unable to hold it for long as Crafty Friend rallied to take 
over approaching the eighth pole. But Sir Bear, who had moved into 
striking position between horses on the turn, was moving fastest of 
all on the outside and drew clear of the field in the final yards 
to hit the wire in 1:34.55 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything worked out perfectly,'' said Velazquez. ``He broke  
well and I took him back off the pace. He took some dirt in his 
face, but he was relaxed the whole time. They were moving (fast) up 
front, and he picked it up on the turn and began passing horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds pretty easy, right? But I was expecting a fast pace  
and it worked out good for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sir Bear, who extended his lifetime record to 15 victories in 44  
starts, earned $300,000 for the win and boosted his bankroll to 
$1,362,160 for owner Barbara Smollin. He returned $14.60, $7.90 and 
$6. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafty Friend paid $22 and $12, while Liberty Gold, ridden by  
Jose Santos, paid $5.40 for show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed,'' said Richard Schosberg, trainer of  
the beaten favorite. ``(Jockey Mike Smith) should have waited 
longer, but he got a little anxious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ziadie said he was considering keeping Sir Bear in New York for  
the Brooklyn Handicap (June 12), a race he finished third in last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loves New York, I don't know if it's the weather or what,''  
said Ziadie. ``But he's also like vintage wine -- the older he gets, 
the better he gets.''

<HEADLINE> Azzi Withdraws From U.S. Hoops Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- One Olympic gold medal and three world  
championship appearances are enough for Jennifer Azzi. 
</P>
<P>
	She's ready to spend the rest of her basketball career doing  
something other than playing for U.S. national teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Azzi has withdrawn from the six-member group that was expected  
to form the nucleus of the U.S. Olympic women's basketball team 
next year, saying she had lost her fire for that type of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done it once and it was really intense. I was extremely  
motivated doing it,'' Azzi said Sunday. ``I think sometimes when 
you do something the second time around it's a little different. 
Everything I do, I have to do with all of me. I guess I didn't feel 
the same kind of intensity and motivation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azzi, 30, said in a telephone interview that she gets along well  
with coach Nell Fortner and she did not have a falling out with USA 
Basketball, which runs the national team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with anybody but myself,'' Azzi said. ``I  
would rather give the spot to someone that is really excited about 
being on the team. This is the best decision right now for my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azzi, who plays for the WNBA's Detroit Shock, also said she had  
a difficult time accepting her position as a role player on the 
national team. Other members of the core group are Ruthie 
Bolton-Holifield, Lisa Leslie, Nikki McCray, Katie Smith and Dawn 
Staley. 
</P>
<P>
	All except Smith played with Azzi on the 1996 U.S. Olympic team  
that captured the gold medal in Atlanta. That team went 60-0 in its 
Olympic and pre-Olympic competition while dazzling audiences with 
its teamwork, intensity and fast-breaking style of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had done it before, I'd be happy with my role,'' Azzi  
said. ``I see it, I accept it. Now I'm going to be doing something 
different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azzi, a former Stanford star, has played on USA Basketball teams  
since 1987, winning seven gold, one silver and two bronze medals. 
She is one of just three U.S. players to have been on three world 
championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people have asked if I was crazy,'' Azzi said. ``There's  
a lot of marketing potential, a lot of fame that goes with it. But 
with me, if I'm not 100 percent excited every day of practice, I 
shouldn't be out there.''

<HEADLINE> Man Accused of Posing As Trader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A Sunday school teacher who posed as a  
commodities trader supported his lavish lifestyle by bilking church 
members, neighbors and others out of $5 million, federal 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a four-year period, Donald Eugene James, 36, told  
investors that he traded in commodities futures and promised 
returns of as much as 18 percent a month, according to documents 
filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	But James, who taught a preschool Sunday school class at the  
Calvary Assembly of God in Dunwoody, apparently deposited most of 
the $5 million he collected into personal bank accounts and spent 
it, authorities allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed in connection with a lawsuit filed by the  
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show James did very little 
trading and never registered as either a commodity pool operator or 
as a commodity trade adviser, as federal law requires. 
</P>
<P>
	A commodity pool invests the combined funds of investors and  
trades commodities futures. The operator manages the pool and makes 
or authorizes the trades. Like a mutual fund, transactions are made 
on behalf of the entire commodity pool whose members share in the 
accrued profits and losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Court filings show James, who moved in 1994 to metro Atlanta  
from Asheville, N.C., invested less than $200,000 of which he lost 
about $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, James and his wife moved from Dunwoody to a $1.9  
million, 7-acre estate in Alpharetta. He spent $300,000 remodeling 
the basement and bought a BMW, a Range Rover and a Suburban. He 
also bought his wife a Rolex watch and a 3-carat diamond ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities say there are at least 25 victims in Georgia  
and Florida who invested between $300,000 and $500,000 each in two 
commodity trading pools that James established. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 9, several investors showed up at James' Alpharetta  
house demanding their money back. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities took action on April 16 when officials won a  
temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court that froze all 
of James' assets and prohibited him from soliciting more funds for 
his commodity trading pools. He was jailed by Fulton County police 
nine days later on a charge of theft by conversion. He remains in 
custody until he can post $400,000 bond.

<HEADLINE> Two Railroads To Take Over Conrail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Two railroads this week will take over and  
carve up what once was the government-run Conrail, continuing a 
trend toward consolidation in an industry struggling to compete 
with truckers. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Tuesday, shippers, regulators and other railroads will  
watch closely as CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. attempt to 
redraw the rail map while avoiding the service foul-up that 
followed the last major rail merger. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay Conrail's $10.3 billion purchase price, both CSX and  
Norfolk Southern are counting on persuading more shippers to carry 
goods by rail instead of trucks. It is a strategy that has 
preoccupied Tom Finkbiner, vice president for intermodal services 
at Norfolk Southern. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the map of the competition there,'' Finkbiner said,  
pointing to a picture of the interstate highway system on his 
office wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is we paid an enormous premium for  
Conrail infrastructure,'' he said. ``Now we have to make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conrail was born in 1976 as a government monopoly created from  
six bankrupt railroads. The Philadelphia-based carrier was sold to 
the public in 1987 at about $15 a share. It grew it value to $115 
per share when CSX and Norfolk Southern jointly bought it and 
promised to restore competition to several Northeastern markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is the most complex in modern railroading. It  
comes as shippers remain uncertain about the viability of rail in 
light of major disruptions and delivery delays that Union Pacific 
faced after it tried to absorb Southern Pacific routes in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Norfolk Southern and CSX, which operates out of  
Richmond, Va., have focused more on making sure their transition 
goes smoothly. The companies figured they could worry later about 
changing routes and adding traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	They have spent millions of dollars -- and two years --  
reconfiguring their computers, retraining their workers and making 
other preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	After Tuesday, the attention turns to marketing their new  
railroads to shippers of food products, electronics, paper goods, 
auto parts and just about anything else that now moves primarily by 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies eye traffic headed from the Southeast to New York,  
Philadelphia and other Northeastern markets with high demand for 
consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for us to be successful, we can't just have a smooth  
transition,'' said Jim Howarth, vice president for CSX's Northeast 
commercial operations. ``CSX borrowed a lot of money. We must grow 
the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two Southeastern railroads will be able to offer direct  
service to lucrative markets in the Northeast, avoiding the costly 
interchanges now required with Conrail. But the railroads have the 
burden of proving their worth to potential customers wary of 
switching to rail without guarantee of a flawless transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reliability and performance for rail service is something we  
have to show people and prove to people,'' Howarth acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Donald Nelson, senior vice president of operations at  
Conrail: ``This is a complicated transaction, and it's foolish to 
say Murphy's Law won't play a role. We have to be prepared to react 
to rapidly changing events, day by day, hour buy hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Rastatter, director of policy for the National Industrial  
Transportation League, a shipping group, said service reliability 
is essential as businesses increasingly rely on ``just-in-time'' 
delivery to reduce inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	In hopes of avoiding service troubles, the companies already had  
postponed by nine months the split that occurs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move ahead, the issue will be whether the industry can  
come out of the transition and be an even more productive force in 
the economy,'' said Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the rail regulating 
Surface Transportation Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucks have the advantage of reaching the 77 percent of  
communities that are not served by rail. They can also deliver 
goods faster, as highways cut through mountains and difficult 
terrain, while rails tend to meander along rivers and through 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	However, railroads are cheaper for moving bulk goods over long  
distances, and the new Conrail owners believe they can seize that 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	To overcome the limited reach of rail, the railroads have  
focused on expanding their intermodal service, which involves 
moving trucks on top of rail cars for most of the distance and then 
driving the rest of the way to the destination. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern has plans to introduce direct Texas-to-New York  
and Miami-to-Montreal intermodal service on July 1. CSX has 
compiled a list of 700 potential customers to target and will 
adjust routes as warranted. The two companies predict they can 
remove 1 million trucks from the highways over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	That volume would represent only a small dent to the trucking  
industry but a significant level of growth for the railroads, which 
have been losing market share to the truckers since World War II.

<HEADLINE> Couric Speaks at Lehigh University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- You know Katie Couric as the cheerful host  
of NBC's ``Today'' show. Now meet Katie Couric, ABC flunky. 
</P>
<P>
	Couric, speaking at a college commencement at Lehigh University  
on Sunday, recalled her days of getting ham sandwiches for the 
executive producer of ``World News Tonight'' and making photocopies 
for Sam Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that she's complaining: Couric advised the graduates to make  
the most of starting at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask questions, be an eager beaver, be Eddie Haskell with  
sincerity,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Couric said finding the right job takes the kind of persistence  
displayed by Lehigh's senior class officers, ``who just wouldn't 
get off my back'' in persuading her to speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Couric turned down 12 commencement invitations this year, but  
said yes to Lehigh after the senior class officers wrote letters, 
camped outside the ``Today'' show, and kept ``begging, pleading and 
stroking my ego, until finally, they just wore me down.''

attacking tanks and artillery pieces, as well as airfields and 
other targets across Yugoslavia. Local media reported that six 
people were killed today. Serbian media reported more civilian 
casualties, including two deaths in the village of Cumurjila

	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian army spokesman Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh  
says ground fighting in the disputed region of Kashmir could last 
for several weeks before the military regains control over the 
area. The air force began sorties Wednesday aimed at infiltrators 
entrenched in Indian territory in Kashmir. New Delhi says they 
include Afghan mercenaries and Pakistan army soldiers disguised as 
guerrillas. Meanwhile, India's prime minister won the backing of 
political rivals on the airstrikes and said he had rejected a 
suggestion by his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, to end the 
military action in the divided territory, claimed by both of the 
nuclear nations.

	Vitter Wins Louisiana Race  
</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Former state Rep. David Vitter was elected  
Saturday night as Bob Livingston's successor in Congress, winning a 
close election over former Gov. Dave Treen. With 99 percent of the 
precincts reporting, Vitter got 60,699 votes, or 51 percent, to 
Treen's 58,825 votes, or 49 percent. The two solidly conservative 
Republican lawyers, both veteran politicians, struggled to point 
out their differences after they were the top finishers in a field 
of nine in a May 1 primary. Vitter, 38, hoped to use youth to his 
advantage, saying the 70-year-old Treen's influence would be 
diminished because of his age.

<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Maryland prosecutors have asked the  
federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President 
Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of 
Monica Lewinsky, The Baltimore Sun reported Saturday. State 
prosecutors filed the request with U.S. District Judge Norma 
Holloway Johnson, unidentified sources told the paper. A Maryland 
grand jury is considering whether Mrs. Tripp broke Maryland law by 
recording conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. If tried and convicted, 
she could get five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Promising that ``we shall not fail,''  
Olusegun Obasanjo today became Nigeria's first civilian president 
in 15 years, ending a string of disastrous military regimes that

Abubakar, who guided the 11-month transition that brought Nigeria 
from brutal dictatorship to democracy. Obasanjo pledged to rebuild 
a nation left in squalor despite billions of dollars in oil wealth.

	Mariners Bury Devil Rays 11-5  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- David Segui hit a double and triple and scored  
three runs to lead the surging Seattle Mariners to an 11-5 victory 
over the struggling Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Saturday night. Segui 
continued to feast on Tampa Bay pitching. After going 2-for-3 with 
two walks, two RBI and three runs scored Saturday night, he is now 
hitting .429 (27-for-63) in his career against the Devil Rays. 
Mariners starter Jeff Fassero (3-6) was struck in the left hand by 
a line drive hit by Herbert Perry with two outs in the fifth 
inning. Fassero managed to finish the inning to qualify for the 
win, but did not return for the sixth.

	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Sparks pitched no-hit ball for 5

relief help, and the Anaheim Angels held on to beat the Kansas City 
Royals 4-3 Saturday night. Sparks (2-4) appeared to be in complete 
control going into the ninth with a 4-0 lead, but gave up two hits 
and a walk with one out and left the game in the hands of Troy 
Percival. The Anaheim closer gave up a bases-clearing double to 
Scott Pose before getting the last two outs for his 13th save in 14 
opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Former Triple-Jump Champ Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Joao Carlos de Oliveira, who held the  
world triple jump record for a decade, has died after a month-long 
battle with lung and liver ailments. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
	He died late Saturday at the Beneficencia Portugesa Hospital in  
Sao Paulo, hospital spokesman Manuel Veras said. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the Brazilian sports hero was taken to the  
Legislative Assembly in Sao Paulo on Sunday and draped in the 
national flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Burial is Monday in his hometown of Pindamonhangaba, about 90  
miles northeast of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira was in a car accident in 1981 and his right leg had to  
be amputated. His car was hit head-on by the car of a drunken 
driver going the wrong way at night on a highway. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, he set the world record with a jump of 58 feet, 8 1/4  
inches at the Pan American Games in Mexico, a mark that stood for 
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won bronze medals in the 1976 and 1980 Olympics, and  
Brazilians dubbed him ``Joao do Pulo'' -- Portuguese for ``Jumping 
John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He continues to be for me one of the 10 best athletes the  
world has seen,'' said Oliveira's former trainer, Pedro do Toledo. 
``He could have done much more if he had been born at a different 
time, in a different country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira reportedly become depressed after unsuccessful ventures  
in business and politics. Still, he had wanted to compete in the 
Paralympics in Sydney next year ``if not to win, to set an 
example,'' Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's sports minister Rafael Greca said Oliveira ``enters the  
gallery of Brazilian Olympic heroes'' and should be remembered for 
his conquests, not for the period in which his life ``fell down.''

<HEADLINE> Super Mario Helps Spurs Down Blazers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- For all the talk about Tim Duncan and David  
Robinson, Mario Elie probably has done as much as any player to 
transform the San Antonio Spurs from a good team to a title 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	He's a tough defender, he's played on two NBA championship teams  
in Houston and, most of all, he's brought an attitude to a team 
that needed one. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie was a major factor in holding down Isaiah Rider in San  
Antonio's 80-76 victory over Portland Saturday in Game 1 of the 
Western Conference finals, and he had a crucial drive to the 
basket, as well as two important, free throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	With the experience that comes from nine previous playoff  
appearances, he keeps his team from ever becoming complacent. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 on Monday night, he tells his teammates, ``will be the  
toughest game of the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 1, he stays angry,'' Avery Johnson said. ``He's one of the  
angriest guys on the court. On the court, he has an edge, he's 
bitter about a lot of things. He stays mad all the time and we kind 
of needed that little edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gregg Popovich used the same word when describing Elie's  
importance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He adds an edge to your team. He really helps you create a  
personality, a toughness,'' Popovich said. ``He's somebody who 
doesn't accept losing. If we lose a game, he doesn't want to talk 
any of us. We're all bums, and that's kind of good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said it's no coincidence San Antonio got rolling after a  
6-8 start when Elie's role grew. 
</P>
<P>
	``We finally got Mario into the rotation,'' Johnson said, ``and  
we took off from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elie saw a blandness on his new team after he signed with a  
Spurs as a free agent before this season began. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought at first when I got here that we were sort of a  
corporate team, just punch in and have no fun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For Elie, who had to claw his way up to the NBA by playing in  
Europe and the Continental Basketball Association, there was no 
excuse for just going through the motions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of laid-back guys, and that's just not my  
personality,'' he said. ``I just try to bring some fun, excitement, 
some chest bumping, some high-fiving, just having fun and enjoying 
the game. It seems like now our guys are showing a lot of 
emotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They will need it Monday against a Blazer team that remains  
confident even though it has lost four of five from San Antonio 
this season, a confidence that comes from playing the Spurs close 
in each loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, who came to practice at the Alamodome on Sunday wearing a  
straw cowboy hat that looked as if somebody bit a hole in the brim, 
noted that Portland lost by just four points Saturday despite a 
sub-par performance by almost everyone on the team except Rasheed 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's so funny is we're still confident we can beat this  
team,'' Rider said. ``We haven't played well at all against this 
team, not for 48 minutes. We feel if we play good, we'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, whose size, long arms, jumping ability and quickness  
create a serious matchup problem for San Antonio, scored a career 
playoff-high 28 points in Game 1, but no other Blazer managed more 
than Rider's 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland also committed 16 turnovers, twice as many as the  
Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to have a chance to win, we need other guys to step up  
and have good games also,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. 
``That's the good thing about our team. They could be over there 
worrying about Rasheed all day long and it's not Rasheed tomorrow, 
its somebody else. That's been the strength of our team all year 
long. You don't necessarily know who to prepare for, who it can be 
on any night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs didn't think much of their game Saturday, either. They  
believe they relied too much on Duncan and Robinson, who scored 21 
points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we've got to shoot the ball better,'' Robinson  
said. ``We shoot 40 percent it's going to be tough for us to put 
together a good game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, San Antonio was good enough for its sixth straight win in  
the playoffs. Three more, and the Spurs have their first trip to 
the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had five days off. We weren't really in-synch the way we  
should have been,'' Johnson said. ``But whether you win ugly, 
whether you win pretty, it really doesn't matter during this time 
of the year, as long as you win.''

 *Thomas Coffin    	
</P>
<P>
	STANTON, Calif. (AP) -- Thomas E. Coffin, an NBC researcher whose  
studies during the infancy of the television age showed the impact 
of advertising, died May 13. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffin conducted scientific studies that showed that people  
bought products after seeing them in television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all talk about it today as a given that people see  
television and act on it. But he was the first to document and 
quantify the effectiveness of advertising on television,'' said 
Nicholas Schiavone, NBC senior vice president of television network 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffin had been a psychology professor at Hofstra University  
until he left to become the network's market research specialist in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
	His groundbreaking research, known as the Hofstra studies, found  
that brand awareness was ``hundreds of percent higher'' among TV 
owners, said Bill Rubens, who succeeded Coffin as head of NBC's 
research department. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffin was NBC's director of research from 1964 to 1972, then  
became a consultant for the network until his retirement in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife and three nieces and nephews.

 *Ralph Geffen    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ralph J. Geffen, a federal magistrate who  
ordered the release of papers that documented the FBI's efforts to 
monitor gay rights organizations, died Wednesday after a two-month 
battle with cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Geffen ruled in 1988 that there was no ``plausible law  
enforcement basis'' for the FBI's surveillance and infiltration 
operations, conducted for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercover probes by the FBI using paid informers were ``based  
upon the anti-homosexual bias of the late FBI Director J. Edgar 
Hoover and his belief that homosexuals, especially when organized 
or joining in groups, posed a threat'' to national security, Geffen 
said in his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI released more than 5,800 pages of documents, but many  
files were withheld and passages were blacked out on those that 
were released. 
</P>
<P>
	His ruling was made in a 1983 lawsuit filed by the American  
Civil Liberties Union. 

</P>

 *William R. Lawley Jr.    	
</P>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Retired Air Force Col. William R. Lawley  
Jr., who was awarded the Medal of Honor for bringing a badly 
damaged World War II bomber back to base despite his wounds, died 
Sunday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawley was a 24-year-old lieutenant when he participated in the  
Feb. 20, 1944 raid on German aircraft centers -- the largest raid on 
the continent at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lawley's plane was coming off the target in Liepzig, Germany,  
it was attacked by 20 enemy fighters. Eight crew members, including 
the co-pilot, were killed, and the brand-new B-17 bomber was 
severely crippled, one engine on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawley suffered serious wounds around his face, according to his  
citation, but forced the co-pilot's body off the controls and 
brought the plane out of a steep dive.

 *Harry Melling    	
</P>
<P>
	GAYLORD, Mich. (AP) -- Harry Melling, president of Melling Tool  
Co. and owner of the NASCAR team on which Bill Elliott enjoyed his 
greatest success, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Melling was in his 20th year of NASCAR Winston Cup Racing.  
Melling Racing won the Winston Cup points championship with Elliott 
behind the wheel in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years earlier, Melling's team won a then-record $1 million  
bonus -- the Winston Million -- from R.J. Reynolds for winning three 
of the four major races on the Winston Cup schedule that year -- the 
Daytona 500, the Winston 500 and the Southern 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott drove for the team from 1981-92, getting 34 of his 40  
career victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Cup Scene, the leading publication covering stock car  
racing, in 1997 named Melling one of the 40 most important people 
in NASCAR history. 
</P>
<P>
	Melling was the grandson of George Melling Sr., who founded  
Melling Tool in Jackson, in 1944. The firm grew to become a leading 
supplier of oil pumps.

 *Raphael Recanati    	
</P>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Israeli business magnate Raphael  
Recanati, former chairman of one of Israel's largest banks and 
founder of a shipping company that brought vital supplies to the 
fledgling state, died Friday at his home in New York. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Recanati was born in Greece in 1924 and left for pre-state  
Palestine in 1935 with his family, which founded Israel Discount 
Bank. He enlisted in the Jewish militia Palmach and was sent to 
Egypt, where he worked to help Egyptian Jews reach Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	When the state was established in 1948, he founded the shipping  
company Israel-America Line, which brought badly needed food and 
weapons to Israel. Recanati served as chair of Israel Discount Bank 
from 1982 until 1986, when a Jerusalem court sentenced him to eight 
months in prison for fraudulent business dealings. The sentence was 
reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Recanati moved to New York, where he founded and headed foreign  
subsidiaries of the bank.

<HEADLINE> Report: Indian Scientist Expelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government expelled an Indian scientist  
who worked in a U.S. weapons lab because he was connected with 
India's nuclear-weapons program, Newsweek reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine did not report the scientist's name or reveal its  
sources for the man's removal from the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year Los Alamos expelled an Indian scientist when it was  
discovered he had ties to India's nuclear-bomb program,'' Newsweek 
said it has learned. 
</P>
<P>
	It did not characterize his relationship with India's program.  
It detonated what it characterized as a peaceful nuclear device in 
1974 and set off a round of tests last year that prompted 
neighboring Pakistan to reply with nuclear weapons tests of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist was among around 17 foreign nationals who worked  
in the highly classified nuclear-weapons division at Los Alamos, 
Newsweek said. Others were from India, Russia, China and Israel, it 
said, and laboratory officials said none had access to classified 
information.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Thinks Gun Bill Will Pass House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- The House will likely pass a package of  
gun-control measures approved last week by the Senate and could go 
even further, Rep. Henry Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see the Senate bill at least (passing in the House) ... and  
maybe more,'' said Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary 
Committee. ``But the bill will deal with much more than just gun 
control. It'll deal with entertainment and that sort of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Research is being done to find out what limits Congress can  
constitutionally impose on television, movies and music, Hyde told 
The Salt Lake Tribune in a story in Sunday's edition. The Illinois 
Republican did not elaborate on what the limits might be, but said 
House Republican leaders will ``have them early next week'' for 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainment industry has come under siege by lawmakers and  
others for its violent movies and video games in the wake of school 
shootings in Littleton, Colo., and Conyers, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate legislation would require background checks of buyers  
at gun shows, would ban the importing of high-capacity ammunition 
clips and would require guns be equipped with childproof safety 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde was in Provo speaking at a fund-raiser for Rep. Chris  
Cannon, R-Utah. Hyde said he was skeptical that new gun laws are 
the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is a spiritual vacuum ... New gun laws are not  
going to change that,'' he said. ``That isn't to say there isn't 
the need for some new amendments.''

	Stampede in Minsk Leaves 54 Dead  
</P>
<P>
	MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- State radio is reporting Monday that 54  
people were killed when a crowd stampeded in a pedestrian 
passageway following a rock concert. About 100 others were injured. 
The incident occurred late Sunday night after a concert and 
festival marking the two-year anniversary of the Mir radio station. 
According to police and health officials, the crush occurred in a 
pedestrian tunnel near the Nemiga metro station not far from the 
center of the city. The ITAR-Tass news agency said 2,000 people 
leaving the concert near the city Sports Palace had dashed into the 
underpass when a heavy rain began.

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO missiles slammed into a bridge  
crowded with civilians on their way to market Sunday leaving 11 
dead, state-run Yugoslavian media reports. Several cars plunged 
into the Velika Morava River after three missiles struck the bridge 
used by shoppers going to and from a market near the town of 
Krusevac, Tanjug news agency reported. Divers were searching for 
victims, the news agency said, adding that the attack wounded 40 
people, including five in critical condition.

	Astronauts Enter Space Station  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts swung open  
the hatches of the international space station Sunday night and 
floated into the chilly but brightly lit outpost. They were the 
first visitors in six months. Before the seven shuttle astronauts 
began opening the doors, flight controllers warned it would be 57 
degrees in the first module, the American-made Unity. The 
astronauts will spend the next three days making repairs and 
deliveries to the 240-mile-high station, vacant since December. 
It's bigger and far more tedious work than what they did earlier 
Sunday during the second-longest spacewalk ever -- rigging cranes 
and other tools to the exterior.

	Colombian Rebels Abandon Hostages  
</P>
<P>
	CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist Colombian rebels masquerading as  
soldiers abducted about 100 churchgoers Sunday, but later abandoned 
at least 79 of them after army troops and police commandos began 
pursuit. Just as the weekly Roman Catholic children's Mass was 
ending at the rustic La Maria church, about 30 uniformed rebels 
forced the worshippers out of the wooden pews and on to two 
canvas-covered trucks and drove them out of the southern 
residential district of Ciudad Jardin. The rebels, who shot and 
killed the bodyguard of one of the churchgoers, belonged to the 
National Liberation Army, or ELN, Colombia's second-largest rebel 
band, authorities said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday  
he would fire department officials for failing to act on signs 
China was stealing secrets from a U.S. nuclear weapons lab. 
Dismissals and demotions could come as early as this week, after 
Richardson receives an internal report on security lapses at the 
Los Alamos lab in New Mexico that may have contributed to China's 
thefts of U.S. nuclear secrets. Richardson said China got 
information on three nuclear warheads but there is no evidence 
China has used that information to modernize or deploy nuclear 
weapons.

The restoration of the Great Pyramid, built as a tomb for King 
Cheops about 4,500 years ago, is part of Egypt's plan to welcome

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The monetary dispute in the camp of  
IBF champion Felix ``Tito'' Trinidad was resolved Sunday, giving 
the green light to the Sept. 18 date for a welterweight unification 
with WBC champion Oscar De La Hoya. Trinidad is a little-known 
fighter from Puerto Rico with an impressive 35-0 record that he 
upheld Saturday night with his 30th knockout, this one of 
Colombia's Hugo Pineda on Saturday night. De La Hoya is 31-0 with 
22 knockouts and will earn $15 million from the Sept. 18 fight at 
Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas.

<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- Equally strong before the sun went down and  
after darkness descended, Jeff Burton powered his way to victory in 
the Coca-Cola 600 Sunday night at Lowe's Motor Speedway at 
Charlotte. Winning for the third time this year and the eighth in 
his career, Burton wound up about 10 car-lengths ahead of Bobby 
Labonte. Mark Martin was third and Tony Stewart fourth, 
successfully completing his odyssey of driving the Indianapolis 500 
and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Occidental Leaving Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- The Occidental Petroleum Corporation is  
pulling out of Bangladesh, handing over its oil and gas operations 
there to another U.S. company, an official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-based Unocal Corporation will take over all  
Occidental's assets and liabilities in Bangladesh starting next 
month under a deal signed Thursday, said Terry Budden, Unocal's 
country representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Unocal's present investment of $260 million in Bangladesh could  
reach $1 billion if all planned projects, including power plants 
and gas pipelines, come through, Budden told journalists in the 
capital, Dhaka. 
</P>
<P>
	Occidental's General Manager Nigel Hopkinson said his company  
was withdrawing from Bangladesh after four years in order to 
concentrate in regions where it is already strong, including the 
Middle East and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will take over Unocal's holdings in Yemen.  
</P>
<P>
	Occidental's assets in Bangladesh include three gas blocks in  
the northeast in which Unocal already holds 50 percent working 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Unocal is also working in Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines,  
Thailand and Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Stock Slowdown May Be Positive / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market has been looking a little  
sickly of late, but analysts say that is actually healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	They contend that the recent setbacks suffered by the great bull  
market stand to prolong its life by slowing down its pulse and 
cooling its temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	All the market averages have retreated of late from the new  
highs they reached earlier in the spring. The red-hot Internet 
stocks took a tumble. 
</P>
<P>
	On the economic front, fears of inflation have revived, and the  
Federal Reserve has signaled its willingness to tighten credit 
conditions if it sees fit. But analysts at Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. 
label all this ``a healthy consolidation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We view the market's essentially sideways movement over the  
past several weeks as beneficial,'' they say in the current edition 
of the firm's weekly advisory The Outlook. ``A digestive phase such 
as we are now witnessing is clearly in order. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps avoid a damaging blowoff and gives earnings time to  
narrow the gap with stock prices at least somewhat. We don't see 
signs that the underlying upward trend is about to reverse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet stocks, in particular, are widely considered a case  
of glaring excess that may need a lot more correcting than has 
already occurred. Still, in the eyes of many analysts, their sharp 
drop from mid-April through May served as a caution to 
overenthusiastic speculators. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, many observers believe the shock of a  
larger-than-expected 0.7 percent rise in the consumer price index 
for April, and a tilt toward Fed tightening, may work in the 
market's favor as time passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Federal Open Market Committee has begun to set the stage  
for a rate hike,'' say Robert DiClemente and Mitchell Held, 
economists at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Despite near-term risks, such 
a tack would prolong the expansion, cap an incipient inflation 
threat, and underpin long-term investments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that if the Fed raises short-term interest rates,  
rates in the long-term bond market could actually fall, reflecting 
encouragement among bond traders that the central bank was staying 
vigilant against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, some market-watchers add, a touch of inflation now may  
be far less troublesome than the specter of deflation that loomed 
over the markets at the worst of the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It now seems very likely that the cyclical low in both  
producer and consumer prices has been seen,'' says Peter Canelo, an 
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``Higher inflation and higher interest rates are bad news for  
high-P-E growth stocks. However, the shift in inflationary 
expectations corresponds with a more-vigorous U.S. economy and 
stronger earnings growth. 'Global healing' has resulted in rising 
U.S. export orders in the past three months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amid all these pluses and minuses, many observers say there is a  
good chance the economy and the markets can maintain the favorable 
balance they have enjoyed for the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, they say, a hint from the Fed that it is willing  
to tighten credit oftentimes lately has served the purpose that 
used to require overt action to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``A tightening bias does not equate to a tightening,'' says Jack  
Lavery, economic consultant to Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``The Fed has 
had a tightening bias on 15 separate occasions since 1996 and has, 
in fact, raised interest rates only once.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As S&AMP;P's Outlook commented recently, ``It has been a mistake to  
underestimate this market's ability to climb a wall of worry.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Enjoy Crusty Bread </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RHINEBECK, N.Y. (AP) -- Consider the lowly loaf of bread -- soft  
and spongy, white and sliced. 
</P>
<P>
	Now consider the display at Bread Alone.  
</P>
<P>
	There are crusty brown baguettes and boules emitting  
earthy-sweet aromas. There are fresh-baked loaves dusted with 
flour, many with names to match their exotic ingredients: sesame 
semolina, rustic corn, whole wheat walnut, onion levain and organic 
sourdough miche. 
</P>
<P>
	And there are customers, lots of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``This business will grow as fast as I want it to grow,'' said  
Dan Leader as he sat in his newest Bread Alone store, an eat-in 
Hudson Valley shop with the air of a funky cappucino joint. 
</P>
<P>
	Leader is benefitting from a bullish bread market. Sales of  
fresher, crustier ``specialty breads'' are rising in the United 
States as the country that perfected the packaged, pre-sliced loaf 
acquires more discriminating tastes. 
</P>
<P>
	The small but tight-knit fraternity of bakers -- buoyed by an  
unprecedented American win in an international baking competition 
this year -- even see signs of a bread Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	The term ``specialty bread'' defines any number of hearth-baked  
crusty creations, from long, thin baguettes to rounded boules. A 
premium is put on freshness and sometimes unusual ingredients: 
shallots, chocolate, dried cherries, kalamata olives, Asiago cheese 
-- even hot peppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan breads -- like the ones Leader produces -- are a subset of  
specialty breads. Kneading and shaping is done as much as possible 
by hand. Longer fermentation times give the bread a richer, 
earthier taste. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisans -- who are not always charitable toward the larger  
specialty market -- tend to be passionate about their craft. They 
will describe the perfect loaf in almost blushingly sensual detail: 
The outside gives a springy resistance to the touch; crusts crackle 
to the bite; sinewy dough yields a sweet, sharp hint of 
fermentation. 
</P>
<P>
	While the taste is tops, the cost can be too. Prices of $3 to $5  
are common for fancy breads. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high-end breads have had an established niche since at  
least the mid-'80's, but their popularity is growing. Ed Lee, 
editor of the trade publication Modern Baking magazine, said the 
market for specialty breads has been growing for about five years 
as more people are introduced to exotic bread. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say: `Whoa! This stuff tastes pretty good,''' Lee said.  
``And they're willing to pay for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Specialty breads are even making headway in the South,  
traditional ``white bread territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta-area wholesaler Richard Orta admitted that peddling  
crustier breads was a ``hard sell'' when he started his BreadWorks 
business last year. He recalls potential customers at a country 
club saying ``This is great stuff Richard, but do you have it in 
soft?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orta mixed in artisan rolls with the soft rolls, and the country  
clubbers soon developed heartier tastes. Others did too -- Orta has 
about 70 accounts with local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Mistell, head of the Bread Bakers Guild of America, said a  
``bread culture'' has grown recently, evidenced by things such as 
newspaper food critics reviewing new bread bakeries. Mistell said 
bread is taken especially seriously in New York City, San 
Francisco, Seattle and his hometown, Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a far cry from 15 years ago, when Leader said people  
considered him crazy for opening his Bread Alone bakery in the 
remote Catskill town of Boiceville. Today, the bakery supplies 
three stores. There are two more Bread Alone shops in Austin, 
Texas, and one set to open in June in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Leader sees the growth as part of the broader trend of Americans  
developing tastes for all sorts of better foods, like wines, 
cheeses and coffees. In fact, the boom of high-end coffee shops has 
tended to carry fine bakery goods in its wake. A chewy bite of 
baguette washes down well with espresso, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are waking up to what good food can be,'' Leader  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another reason for bakers to hold their hats a little higher  
came in February. That was when Thomas Gumpel and Robert Jorin of 
the Culinary Institute of America in St. Helena, Calif., and Jan 
Schat of the Academia del Fornaio baking school of Burlingame, 
Calif., took top-prize honors in the World Cup of Baking. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest is hardly a household word, but hopes are high that  
the win will give added attention to artisan baking. It has already 
bought mainstream press attention, including a People magazine 
spread with a picture of the beaming bakers, baguettes in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gumpel, for one, fears that corporate bakers trying to  
capitalize on the popularity of specialty breads will blur the 
distinctions between artisan and other breads. He noted that one 
supermarket chain is putting its machine-made loaves in a fancy new 
bag with wheat stalks on it and calling it artisan bread. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bakers worry about increasing competition, especially from  
partially baked, frozen loaves of specialty bread, which are 
finished up in-house. They have started showing up in more 
supermarkets and trendy, upscale restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	La Brea Bakery of Los Angeles, for instance, distributes its  
frozen loaves in several states, including Arizona, California, 
Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada and Wisconsin. The bread has 
gotten rave reviews from food critics and chefs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leader said there's no reason for concern. With the bread  
market estimated to exceed $15 billion a year, he said that there's 
plenty of room for competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the artisan bread market took 2 percent of the total  
market,'' Leader said, ``well, we'd all be working seven days a 
week, 24 hours a day.''

	FRISCO, Texas (AP) -- Australian Alayna Burns recovered from a  
fall during the women's points race to finish in second, but led 
her mates to the team title Sunday in the World Cup of Track 
Cycling. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns was among a half-dozen riders who crashed the 41st of the  
80-lap race. Three riders were injured, but Burns returned to the 
competition with some scrapes to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
	She also earned 10 points toward the team competition. Australia  
registered 83 team points to win the team crown, followed closely 
by the United States and France, who both compiled 81 points. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. cyclists Karen Dunne and Erin Veenstra were finished fourth

<HEADLINE> Ex-Menudo Member Talks to TV Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former members of Menudo shouldn't knock the  
Latin teen group, says Ricky Martin, an alumnus of the band. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it was a boy band,'' Martin told the June 5 issue of TV  
Guide. ``Everything, they tell you what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he wanted to remind those who still complain about the  
experience: ``Dude, you were sitting under the Eiffel Tower when 
you were 12 years old, and kids in your classroom were reading 
about it. Complaining is for losers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 27, is riding high these days with his self-titled  
English-language debut. ``Livin' la Vida Loca,'' the album's first 
single, is topping the music charts, and he is on People magazine's 
list of the 50 ``most beautiful people in the world'' for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	As he cultivates his sexy image, Martin also is on a spiritual  
quest. So far, he has explored Catholicism, Scientology, Judaism, 
Hinduism and currently, Buddhism.

	``I will always search,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Angered by US Chip 'Dumping' </HEADLINE>

<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's Finance Ministry will consider  
tariffs of up to 67 percent against U.S. computer chip makers found 
guilty of dumping products on the Taiwan market, news reports said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Trade Commission, a body under the Economics  
Ministry, has accused Micron Technology Inc. and the U.S. 
subsidiaries of Korean firms Samsung Electronics and Hyundai of 
dumping dynamic random access memory chips in Taiwan, Taiwan's 
United Daily News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The action caused Taiwan chip prices to drop from $60 a chip to  
$4, and caused Taiwan's top three DRAM makers to lose $351 million 
over 12 months, the report said, citing data released Saturday by 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Ministry is expected to recommend punitive tariffs  
by August, with a final ruling in October, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Completes Indy, Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- One double is probably going to be enough  
for Tony Stewart. So he made sure he made it a good one. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting sickness for about the last hour of the race, Stewart  
charged to a fourth-place finish in Sunday night's Coca-Cola 600, 
becoming the first driver to complete the NASCAR race and the 
Indianapolis 500 in one day. He finished ninth at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an experience I'll never forget,'' said an  
exhausted Stewart ``To come in here and see the reaction from the 
crowd and to hear the applause at the driver's introductions at the 
500, I wouldn't trade it for anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``But 600 next year.''  
</P>
<P>
	After climbing out of his car, Stewart's legs collapsed and he  
sank to the ground. He sat on the ground next to his car, a wet 
towel wrapped around his head for about five minutes, occasionally 
drinking fluids. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also given oxygen, and then put on a stretcher and taken  
to the track hospital. He didn't say anything, and he wrapped the 
towel around his face as he was put on the stretcher. He was given 
fluids, and released about 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready for a nap,'' he said. ``I'm ready to lay my head  
down for the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That Stewart was exhausted was no surprise. The former Indy  
Racing League champion, now NASCAR's hottest rookie, raced 1,100 
miles in 10 hours. That's the equivalent of driving from Los 
Angeles to Denver. It's 600 laps and a mind-numbing 2,400 left 
turns. 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti is the only other driver to race in Indy and the  
Coca-Cola in the same day, but he crashed in 1994 and didn't finish 
the 600. Robby Gordon's bid to do the double in 1997 was rained out 
in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was supposed to start 27th at the Coca-Cola, but he was  
banished to the last and 43rd spot when he missed the drivers' 
meeting. He worked his way up quickly, weaving through the field 
just like he did in last week's Winston Open, when he went from 
last to second. 
</P>
<P>
	By the 62nd lap, he was in 10th place. He moved into third on  
lap 251 and took the lead on 268. He battled Jeff Burton and 
teammate Bobby Labonte for the lead the rest of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we got started, the car was great and we just tried to  
take our time and tried to be methodical about how we got 
through,'' Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the 80th lap, Stewart told his crew he wasn't feeling too  
well. The biggest problem was hunger. He had two mini-bagels before 
Indy, two Power Bars on the plane and a few bites of another energy 
bar during the Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 80 laps to go, he was getting sick and feeling  
light-headed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never use the head rest in cars and I used the head rest the  
last 60-70 laps,'' he said. ``I felt like I was about 90 percent 
and leaving 10 percent on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to make sure I didn't make a mistake and  
could bring the car home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stewart still managed his sixth top-five finish in his  
first 12 races. 
</P>
<P>
	The first half of the day wasn't nearly as tough.  
</P>
<P>
	After his finish at Indy, four laps behind winner Kenny Brack,  
Stewart raced back to his trailer, changed into a red T-shirt and 
blue jeans and returned to his garage to say goodbye to his crew. 
They waved and cheered as Stewart was whisked away in a golf cart 
to a helicopter, waiting on the infield near the third turn. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a three-minute ride to the Indianapolis airport, where  
The Home Depot, his sponsor, had its private jet waiting for the 
65-minute flight to North Carolina. Aboard the plane, Stewart 
changed into his NASCAR racing suit, ate a Power Bar and guzzled 
some Powerade and water. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't have intravenous fluids, and aside from a couple of  
blisters and some muscle fatigue, said he was in good shape. Then 
he settled into a couch in the back of the jet to relax. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited,'' he told The Associated Press aboard his  
plane. ``I thought I'd feel a lot more fatigued. I think after an 
hour's sleep, I'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart got his catnap and looked refreshed and ready to go by  
the time the plane landed about a half-hour before the 600 was 
scheduled to start. He laced up his racing shoes, got off the jet 
and hopped on fellow NASCAR driver Rusty Wallace's helicopter for 
the 2-minute ride to Lowe's Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	As the helicopter flew low around the speedway, fans stood and  
cheered Stewart, who waved to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's awesome,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter landed on the track infield, and a huge roar went  
up as Stewart got out. Then he got into a white Camaro and was 
driven around the track as part of driver introductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who switched to NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit after  
three years in the Indy Racing League, had said all along the 
Coca-Cola was his priority. But Indy is still special to Stewart, 
who grew up 45 minutes away in Columbus, Ind., and he didn't want 
to give up his chance to win it -- even if it meant driving 1,100 
miles in less than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	He started off strong, moving from the 24th spot to the top  
five. Then the handling problems kicked in, made worse by a mistake 
in the pits. While working on the Dallara Oldsmobile Aurora, the 
crew released the jack too soon and slightly damaged the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of practice time didn't help. With Stewart shuttling  
back and forth between Indianapolis and Charlotte the last couple 
of weeks, the team never got to test the car on any long runs. If 
it had, Stewart said the handling problem might have been 
discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	After the race ended, Stewart climbed out of his cockpit and  
dropped his head. Waving to cheering fans in the stands, he raised 
his index finger and told them, ``One more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In all honesty, I'm not as disappointed as I thought I'd be,''  
he said. ``Obviously, I wanted to win the race and anything short 
is a disappointment. But we did everything we could. We fought hard 
all day.''

	Netanyahu Confirms Talks With Syria  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged conducting  
secret talks with Syria that included a proposal to replace Israeli 
soldiers on the Golan Heights with foreign troops, a Cabinet 
minister said today. Netanyahu, trounced by moderate Ehud Barak in 
elections two weeks ago, outwardly maintained an unwavering 
commitment to Israeli sovereignty over the strategic plateau, 
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. But reports last week 
said that the outgoing prime minister talked with Syria for a year 
and nearly reached agreements for substantial withdrawals.

	Barak Already Facing Trouble  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's prime minister-elect Ehud Barak came  
under mounting pressure today to take a stand on the future of 
Jewish settlements in lands that both Jews and Arabs claim. 
Palestinians want Barak to stop settlement activity now. His 
preferred coalition partner -- the hard-line Likud party he ousted -- 
wants guarantees that some settlement growth will continue. The 
demands were a switch from the days after Barak's win, when 
Palestinians warmly welcomed his victory and Likud members praised 
him for extending his hand. A spokesman said today that Barak would 
not intervene until he takes power.

	NATO Confirms Bridge Attack  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO acknowledged attacking a bridge  
in central Serbia today, saying the span was a legitimate and 
designated target. The alliance did not confirm Yugoslav media 
reports of 11 deaths in the attack. The Tanjug news agency reported 
that several cars plunged into the Velika Morava River after three 
missiles struck the bridge near the town of Krusevac. The news 
agency said the attack wounded 40 people.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A NATO missile attack in Kosovo hit  
near a convoy of Western journalists today, killing a driver and 
wounding a Times of London reporter and two others, the Serb-run 
Media Center in Pristina said. A NATO spokesman said he was unable 
to comment. The extent of the injuries was not immediately clear, 
but the center said the wounded were taken to the Prizren hospital.

	Chinese Espionage Could Cost Jobs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson urged an end  
to ``scapegoating'' in the Chinese espionage scandal and said today 
he would fire department officials for failing to act on signs 
China was stealing nuclear secrets. Richardson said dismissals and 
demotions could come as early as this week, after he receives a 
report on security lapses at the Los Alamos lab that may have 
contributed to China's thefts. He also urged a renewed focus on 
increased security.

	Car Haulers Strike Looms  
</P>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- The Teamsters and new car haulers were  
still far apart today on major issues such as pay for new workers 
and pensions as a strike deadline loomed. Teamsters President James 
P. Hoffa said the union was ready to strike when its contract 
expires at 12:01 a.m. EDT Tuesday. Negotiations began in February 
between the Teamsters, representing 12,800 workers in the contract 
dispute, and the National Automobile Transporters Association, 
which is made up of 17 companies.

Kosovo, one of more than 840,000 ethnic Albanians forced out of the 
province, has been crowned Miss Albania '99. Venera Mustafa, who 
won late last night, said her greatest desire is to return to

	DALLAS (AP) -- Chris Drury scored his second straight game-winner  
and fourth of the playoffs as the Colorado Avalanche beat the 
Dallas Stars 7-5 today in an unlikely wide-open game and moved one 
victory away from the Stanley Cup finals. The Avalanche, who blew a 
two-goal lead late in the game before coming back to win, took a 
3-2 lead in their best-of-7 Western Conference finals. They can 
advance to the championship round with a victory in Game 6 Tuesday 
night in Denver.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Randy Johnson shut down the New York Mets with  
his powerful left arm and knocked out Masato Yoshii with his 
usually weak bat. Johnson struck out 10 in eight dominating innings 
and had two hits and an RBI to lead the Arizona Diamondbacks to 
their sixth straight win, 10-1 over the New York Mets today. Steve 
Finley went 4-for-5 with two home runs, a three-run shot in the 
first and a two-run shot in the third, as Arizona swept the 
three-game series.

<HEADLINE> North Dakota Governor Low Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- He doesn't crack jokes with Jay Leno on  
late-night television. He doesn't have bodyguards or personal 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ed Schafer conducts North Dakota's business in a quieter,  
less-expensive manner than neighboring Minnesota, where Gov. Jesse 
Ventura last week launched a national tour to promote his 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, Schafer flew to Washington, D.C., last week to  
testify on North Dakota water legislation. He took a commercial 
airplane. No bodyguards, no driver, no grunt even to carry his 
luggage. 
</P>
<P>
	``My security is living in the safest state in the nation,''  
Schafer said. ``We've had discussions about security. I don't think 
it's necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schafer is known to drive to public appearances himself. He jogs  
six miles a day without any security detail trailing the huffing 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``He likes to do his own thing. He doesn't like to tie up the  
Highway Patrol,'' said Jim Hughes, North Dakota Highway Patrol 
commander. ``He likes to jog and drive his own car and have his 
freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota doesn't have a specific budget to protect its  
governor. The cost is folded into the general Capitol security 
budget shared by many agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes said the two officers assigned to Capitol security cost  
about $100,000 per year for salaries and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, by contrast, at least one guard is assigned to the  
governor at all times. Residents pay $1.5 million for Capitol 
security and an additional $767,730 to protect Ventura, his family, 
the lieutenant governor, the governor's mansion and the Ventura 
ranch in Maple Grove, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Schafer's spokeswoman, Julie Liffrig, said governor staffs from  
other states are amazed by North Dakota's gubernatorial security -- 
or lack of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he feels threatened or vulnerable. He likes the  
openness of being open to the public,'' she said. ``He runs in and 
out Mini-Marts and gets his Coke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At his first Western Governors Association meeting, Schafer  
stepped off an airplane, wearing jeans. Immediately, he was met by 
a uniformed trooper, a uniformed guard and a plain-clothed officer 
with a high-tech headset. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like more of a target after this gang showed up than I  
did before,'' Schafer recalled.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs Are Blowin' in the Wind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Great expectations have turned to grand despair  
for the Toronto Maple Leafs. And nobody seems to know why. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect we'd come back and win necessarily,'' Toronto  
coach Pat Quinn said following the Maple Leafs' embarrassing 5-2 
loss Saturday night to the Buffalo Sabres at Marine Midland Arena. 
``But I didn't expect we'd have that kind of short response. We 
kind of disintegrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That left them down 3-1 in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight game, the Maple Leafs played as though  
it were the middle of January instead of a warm night in late May, 
when visions of etching one's name on the Stanley Cup have a 
tendency to drive hockey players. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 on Thursday night, the Sabres scored three goals in  
less than five minutes in the second period and won 4-2. Barrages 
like that rarely occur in the playoffs, let alone at this juncture. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened again Saturday in a shorter span.  
</P>
<P>
	Brian Holzinger, Rob Ray, and Geoff Sanderson scored in less  
than three minutes early in the second period as the Toronto 
defense collapsed in front of goalie Curtis Joseph. The flurry 
transformed a 1-0 game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Maple Leafs had 33 shots at Buffalo goalie Dominik  
Hasek, he was rarely tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us to every loose puck. They initiated every hit,''  
said Maple Leafs captain Mats Sundin, who scored both Toronto 
goals, the first on his second penalty shot of the playoffs. 
``Every play for the first two periods, it looked like our heads 
were somewhere else, like we were too tense to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until their uninspired play against the Sabres, the Maple Leafs  
had been the surprise team of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round, they took advantage of the absence of  
Philadelphia star Eric Lindros, got some clutch goaltending from 
Joseph, and rallied from a 2-1 deficit to eliminate the Flyers in 
six games. They did the same to Pittsburgh in the next round with 
Penguins star Jaromir Jagr slowed by a nagging groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hasek, who makes the Sabres so dangerous, and Miroslav  
Satan, the team's leading scorer, sitting out the first two games 
of the finals with injuries, the Maple Leafs again had luck on 
their side. But they lost the opener at home, 5-4, to the Sabres, 
who relied on a goalie who had never started a playoff game to bail 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
	When both Hasek and Satan returned to the lineup for Game 3, the  
Maple Leafs' good fortune abruptly ended. Now they are one loss 
away from elimination, and the Sabres have no intention of letting 
them back into the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be time to go for the killer instinct,'' Holzinger  
said. ``We're going to have to go into Toronto and play like we're 
capable of playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs displayed some of their resilience in Game 2,  
scoring two goals late in the game for a 6-3 win after Buffalo had 
rallied from a three-goal deficit to trail by just one goal. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Hasek's health still questionable, they have been  
unable to test him with any regularity because of Buffalo's dogged 
checking. That will have to change for the Maple Leafs to have any 
chance of rallying again on Monday night at Air Canada Centre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing good at home,'' Sundin said. ``It's going to be  
a different story. We're going to do everything we can. If we win 
at home, we're back in the series.''

<HEADLINE> N.D. Farmers Plant Crops From Air / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Farmers frustrated by heavy rain in  
north-central North Dakota need not slog through soggy fields to 
plant crops like canola. They might want to take to the air. 
</P>
<P>
	A crop sprayer already has seeded about 1,700 acres of canola  
from his airplane, helping meet the crop insurance planting 
deadline for the popular alternative crop. Farmers had until May 25 
to plant canola and receive full crop insurance protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a do-or-die situation,'' said Greg Eisenzimmer, who runs  
the crop spraying company Air Ag North in Munich, N.D. ``We've got 
an awful lot of guys on the bubble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenzimmer blends the canola seed with fertilizer and applies  
it from a spreader on the airplane. The process works best if 
farmers are able to run a disk over the ground to cover the seeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury will be out,'' Eisenzimmer, who seeded 60 acres of  
his own canola from the plane, said last week. ``I'll tell you in 
about two weeks. So far, the overall population (of seed) looked 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cavalier County Extension Agent Ron Beneda doesn't believe  
seeding by air will take off and become a standard planting 
practice, but he says it's an attractive alternative for farmers 
who have no other choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big concern on how we can get that grain to sprout  
without covering it up,'' he said. ``It could work. I sure wouldn't 
be in a position to try it on a lot of acres.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Lepp, who works for Rivers Air Spray in Rivers, Manitoba,  
said airplane seeding has proven to be a viable option for flooded 
Canadian farmers. Lepp said he has seen canola sprout after seeds 
were dropped on potholes with standing water. 
</P>
<P>
	``The canola fell through the water and when the water dried up,  
it grew in the potholes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenzimmer charges $4.50 per acre to plant canola from his  
plane. Custom operations normally charge between $6 and $9 to seed 
crops with air drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can seed it cheaper than they can run their drill over it,''  
he said. ``We're doing the canola at $2 to $3 an acre cheaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eisenzimmer said he is considering planting durum and wheat for  
one farmer, to help him meet the June 5 insurance deadline for 
those crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy rain also is a problem in south-central North Dakota.  
</P>
<P>
	Hazelton farmer Tom Voller is one of those scrambling to meet  
the crop insurance deadline. He said recent storms that dumped 
about 10 inches of rain in his area will make it impossible to 
plant between 20 percent and 30 percent of his 2,500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Voller said he is already three weeks behind with planting.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst I've ever seen'' he said. ``We had it bad in  
'95, but not this bad.'' 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Monsanto Co. is about to launch a new wheat  
herbicide in the United States for the first time in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The weed killer, called Maverick, was approved May 19 by the  
Environmental Protection Agency. It marks the beginning of a 
renewed effort by the St. Louis-based company to develop wheat 
protection products through chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto plans to begin selling Maverick this fall, primarily in  
Idaho, Oregon and Washington, although it will be available in 
several Midwestern states. The EPA approved a similar formulation, 
which will be sold under the brand name Outrider, for roadside and 
industrial use. 
</P>
<P>
	The weed killer will help growers alter tillage and seeding  
practices so they can ``reduce soil erosion from wind and water,'' 
said Carl Casale, managing director of Monsanto's U.S. agricultural 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Maverick kills several weeds that plague farmers of winter  
wheat, including cheatgrass and downy brome.

<HEADLINE> Editor Attacked at Gunpoint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The editor of a weekly newspaper was  
attacked by two men at gunpoint then locked in the trunk of his 
rental car while the suspects apparently robbed and shot a 
newspaper carrier, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Henningsen, senior editor for the Weekly Alibi in  
Albuquerque, N.M., was in Memphis for the annual conference of the 
Association of Alternative Newsweeklies. 
</P>
<P>
	Henningsen, 32, said he was assaulted and robbed by two men  
early Friday outside a club. He said the men took his wallet and 
drove him to an automated teller machine around 1:30 a.m. where 
they forced him to withdraw cash. A witness notified police. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the two men forced Henningsen in the trunk of his  
rental car while they made several stops. During that time, police 
believe they robbed and shot a newspaper carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spotted the vehicle, and chased the two men until they  
stopped and ran on foot. The suspects, 20 and 18, were arrested and 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I don't blame the city,'' said Henningsen, who went  
back home Saturday after getting stitches in his forehead and the 
back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Memphis is pretty and I had great food while I've been  
here. Aside from the incident Friday, I had a good time.''

<HEADLINE> Cranes Installed at Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- With their flawless docking behind  
them, Discovery's astronauts ventured out on a spacewalk late 
Saturday night and spruced up the outside of the new international 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Jernigan and Dr. Daniel Barry emerged from the space  
shuttle around 11 p.m. The seven-story-plus station loomed above 
them, jutting straight out of Discovery's cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unbelievable!'' Jernigan said as she unlocked the hatch.  
</P>
<P>
	The pair promptly attached a 5-foot construction crane to the  
exterior of the station early Sunday. A second crane, still in 
unfinished pieces, took longer to install. Jernigan had to use 
extra tools, and extra muscle, to loosen bolts that held the second 
crane down in the shuttle. Barry helped her accomplish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The extendible booms will be used by future spacewalkers to move  
large items around the orbiting complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Jernigan and Barry's other duties 240 miles up: hanging  
out three bags of tools, installing boot platforms, putting a 
glare-reducing shroud over a docking target, and covering an 
exposed pin. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacewalk was expected to last more than six hours, well  
into the wee hours of Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd just like to stay here and look at that Earth,'' Barry  
said, his voice rising in excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was there to greet the seven shuttle astronauts when they  
arrived at the space station early Saturday -- the first residents 
don't move in until March. So Mission Control extended an 
ultralong-distance welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been six months since anyone came to visit,'' Mission  
Control radioed up. ``Welcome aboard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole station looks beautiful, and we're happy to be  
visiting,'' replied Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first of dozens of shuttle dockings expected for the  
space station, launched in two pieces late last year. Mission 
Control was delighted with the way everything went. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've made the first docking with space station look  
effortless, and you've set the standard for all those who follow,'' 
Mission Control told commander Kent Rominger, a Navy pilot who 
guided Discovery in. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of business involved opening the outermost hatch  
of the space station and ducking a few feet inside to take air 
samples and do a little rearranging. The hatch was then closed; it 
won't be opened again until Sunday night, when the crew ventures 
all the way in. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA wanted the doors between the two spacecraft sealed in case  
there was an emergency during Saturday night's spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the plan called for Jernigan and Barry to attach  
themselves with double safety lines to the spacecraft at all times, 
and even though their spacesuits had jet packs, neither the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration nor Rominger was 
taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Rominger said before the flight that if one of the spacewalkers  
got loose and floated away, he'd ditch the station and chase after 
the astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
	Jernigan was a little anxious, but not because of any fear of  
snapped tethers. 
</P>
<P>
	During her last shuttle flight in 1996, a loose screw caused the  
hatch to jam, and her spacewalk was canceled. Workers at Kennedy 
Space Center promised her it wouldn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will remain docked to the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space  
station until Thursday night. Between now and then, the astronauts 
will lug nearly 4,000 pounds of gear into the station. 
</P>
<P>
	During the last station-assembly flight, astronauts took up an  
American-made component and connected it to a Russian-built control 
module that was already in orbit. Problems have since popped up 
with some of the electronics, so Discovery's crew will spend time 
making repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Ross, the lead spacewalker for the December construction  
mission, said the antennas he installed show signs of cosmic wear 
and tear, like peeling paint. Otherwise, ``the station looks pretty 
much as we left it.''

as investors covered short, or oversold positions. Tokyo stocks 
rose moderately. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.66 yen in early trading, up 1.14 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.43 yen, also on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 50.08 points,  
or 0.31 percent, to 16,022.76 in the first 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the average shed 204.51 points, or 1.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher on short-covering  
while strength in the euro against the yen also indirectly helped 
support the greenback in relation to the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's strength was based on speculation the European  
Central bank may finally move to prop up the euro by intervening in 
foreign exchange markets to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no such action by the bank has been seen to try to stem  
the euro's steady decline since its January launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was expected to remain quiet in Tokyo as U.S. and  
European markets are closed Monday for holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices were slightly higher early  
Monday as investors remained nervous over the outlook for recently 
volatile New York financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Market sentiment was also hurt by news that foreign investors  
turned into net sellers of Japanese stocks in the week ended May 21 
for the first time in 18 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tokyo stocks are currently linked closely with the performance  
of the U.S. market, and players remain cautious before Friday's key 
U.S. jobs data,'' said a general manager at a Japanese securities 
company, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.80 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,297.87. The 
TOPIX closed down 10.10 points, or 0.78 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.81 points  
to close Friday at 10,559.74. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.5050 percent from Friday's finish of 1.4900 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.08 yen from 99.21 yen.

	German Pols Say No to Ground Troops  
</P>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Government and opposition politicians  
reiterated today that Germany will not provide ground troops for a 
possible invasion of Kosovo, while at the same time backing an 
international peacekeeping force in the region once the fighting 
stops. Meanwhile, NATO war planes struck at targets across Serbia 
today in intensified attacks meant to force President Slobodan 
Milosevic to accept alliance demands on Kosovo. NATO spokesman 
Jamie Shea today said the Yugoslav leader is slowly moving from a 
position ``of almost total defiance of the international 
community'' but still far away from accepting NATO conditions for 
ending the air campaign.

	BEIJING (AP) -- Critical resolutions in the U.S. Congress marking

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost one-quarter of those surveyed in an  
Associated Press poll conducted by ICR of Media, Pa., say they 
expect to spend more on getaways than they did a year ago. The 
strong economy is a big factor. About six out of 10 say they expect 
to spend as much on vacations in 1999 as in 1998. The typical 
American likes to vacation in the summer, travel by car and spend a 
week or less on the trip, according to the poll.

<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Two railroads this week will take over and  
carve up what once was the government-run Conrail, continuing a 
trend toward consolidation in an industry struggling to compete 
with truckers. Beginning Tuesday, shippers, regulators and other 
railroads will watch closely as CSX and Norfolk Southern attempt to 
redraw the rail map while avoiding the service foul-up that 
followed the last major rail merger. To pay Conrail's $10.3 billion 
purchase price, both CSX and Norfolk Southern are counting on 
persuading more shippers to carry goods by rail.

<HEADLINE> Luyendyk Crashes in Final Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Arie Luyendyk wasn't supposed to go out this  
way. Maybe if his car had broken down, it would have been easier to 
take. Or if he had simply been out-raced to the finish line, that 
would have been OK. 
</P>
<P>
	But to make a rookie mistake while leading his final  
Indianapolis 500 was simply inexcusable for the Flying Dutchman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel stupid right now,'' Luyendyk said after crashing  
out of his farewell race Sunday on lap 118. ``It's going to be a 
long summer, thinking how things might have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time 500 winner announced his retirement before the Indy  
Racing League season, with the caveat of coming back for one final 
drive at his favorite track. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-year-old Luyendyk started from the pole and was leading  
his 63rd lap of the day when he came up behind the lapped car of 
Tyce Carlson, trying to make a seemingly harmless inside pass in 
Turn 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, about the time Luyendyk's right front wheel drew even  
with Carlson's back left tire, the Dutchman's G Force Aurora began 
to wobble and shake. In a matter of seconds, it was over -- the car 
spun around backwards and slammed into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for going out like John Elway or Michael Jordan in this  
year of the retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk wasn't hurt, but his frustration was apparent as soon  
as he climbed from the battered car. He hovered over the wreckage, 
hands on hips, as if he couldn't comprehend what had just happened. 
As he walked toward the infield grass, he slapped his right glove 
on the hood of the red safety truck, a rare display of emotion from 
this stoic man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have known better than to be racing the traffic that  
hard,'' said Luyendyk, racing for the 15th time at Indy. ``I was 
having so much fun. I probably just got too relaxed out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, who won Indy in 1990 and '97, hugged his son, Arie  
Jr., and fought back tears after leaving the infield hospital. The 
only injury: a bruised ego. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car was unbelievable,'' he said. ``I could go anywhere I  
wanted to go on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk couldn't help but think back to the 1994 race, when  
Emerson Fittipaldi had a huge lead with less than 10 laps to go but 
slammed into the wall while trying to get past teammate Al Unser 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how Emmo was feeling now,'' Luyendyk said with a sigh.  
``Ahh, this is too bad. I can't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His 17-year-old son, himself a budding racer, was just as  
somber. Arie Jr. had allowed himself to imagine what it would be 
like to embrace his father in Victory Lane, celebrating that third 
Indy 500 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was starting to get my hopes up,'' the teen-ager said. ``I  
was trying not to, because I know this place has a way of biting 
you in the butt. You shouldn't think about winning until the last 
lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk waved to the huge crowd at Indianapolis Motor Speedway  
on his warmup lap, then pulled away from the field as soon as the 
green flag waved. He led the first 32 laps and seemed to have the 
strongest car in the field, surrendering the top spot only when he 
dipped into the pits. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, the car might have been too strong for  
Luyendyk's own good. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was driving so confidently,'' he said. ``Maybe my confidence  
bit me at the end. I got too greedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk felt he was pinched a bit in Turn 3 by Carlson, forcing  
a touch of the brakes that sent the leading car skidding into the 
wall. Television replays seemed to show the blame clearly belonged 
to the more experienced driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my fault,'' Luyendyk conceded. ``I was the guy making  
the pass. There's no excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson's radio went out during the race, which meant he  
couldn't communicate with his trackside spotters as Luyendyk 
approached. But the 28-year-old saw the approaching car in his 
rear-view mirror and tried to make room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I even went off the throttle,'' Carlson said. ``Arie's a great  
guy, and I never would have gotten in his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk wavered a bit when asked if he might change his mind  
about retiring, but that was merely the competitor in the man 
showing through. He's looking forward to spending time with his 
family, in addition to working as a television analyst on IRL 
events and assisting the Treadway Racing team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to stick with my plan,'' he said. ``I'll be back  
here next year in another capacity and enjoy the race. ... But I 
know when I come back next year, I'll start kicking myself again 
for what happened here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arie Jr. doesn't want his father to return for another run,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs to retire. My mom is always worried,'' the teen-ager  
said. ``He's had some great moments here. I don't think he'll dwell 
on finishing this way. I hope not, anyway. If he does, he'll 
probably want to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, this appears to be the final vignette for the Flying  
Dutchman: He hopped aboard a golf cart, waved to the fans and drove 
away from the Indy 500 at considerably slower speed than he should 
have. 
</P>
<P>
	``Arie,'' a women yelled, ``we still love you!''

<HEADLINE> Investors To Back Philippine Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Two foreign investors have agreed to  
invest about $100 million in ailing Philippine Airlines on 
condition its workers guarantee not to launch a strike for 10 
years, PAL chairman Lucio Tan said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan, who owns 70 percent of the Philippine flag carrier,  
identified the investors, both based in Hong Kong, as Top World 
Investment Co. and Bank of East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan has pledged to raise $200 million by a June 4 government  
deadline to ensure the viability of a PAL rehabilitation plan. He 
has already placed in escrow $100 million, and he said the two Hong 
Kong investors would provide the other half. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're willing to come. We have guaranteed some 10 years no  
strike,'' Tan said, adding a formal agreement with the investors 
could be forged as soon as majority of PAL's 8,000 workers sign a 
10-year no-strike accord. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the workers have already signed the accord in  
exchange for 60,000 shares of stocks in the company, Tan said. The 
60,000 PAL shares are worth $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
	Two strikes last year worsened PAL's financial woes, caused in  
part by Asia's financial crisis and an ill-timed refleeting 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	PAL has been unable to service more than $2.2 billion in debt  
and has proposed a rehabilitation plan to help it recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The $200 million capital infusion is a key element of the plan,  
which also calls for deep cuts in PAL's staff and fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Tan, one of the  
Philippines' richest men, has indicated he ``is more or less 
assured'' of raising the money by the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	In case Tan fails to deliver, President Joseph Estrada said the  
government is continuing talks with two Middle Eastern groups and a 
Singapore group that may be interested in taking over PAL's reins. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Estrada's administration has adopted a policy of not  
bailing out financially troubled companies like PAL, he has pledged 
the Philippine carrier will continue operating as long as he is 
president.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Nazi Helper Won't Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man who lived in the United States for  
nearly three decades has returned to Lithuania rather than testify 
about his activities as a policeman in his Nazi-occupied homeland 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight by Aloyzas Balsys, 86, to stay in the United States  
without testifying resulted last year in a landmark Supreme Court 
decision that fear of prosecution abroad is insufficient ground to 
invoke the Fifth Amendment's protection from self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Sunday that Balsys, formerly of New  
York City, left Saturday, a day ahead of a departure deadline set 
in a settlement with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Balsys' problems began with a Justice subpoena that required his  
testimony on his wartime conduct in Vilnius, the Lithuanian 
capital. He contended the answers would open him up to prosecution 
in Lithuania, Israel or Germany and he refused to testify, invoking 
his Fifth Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court agreed with the federal trial judge's ruling  
that Balsys could not refuse to testify and it overturned an 
appeals court decision that the Fifth Amendment protected Balsys. 
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the Supreme Court's decision, Balsys agreed to  
depart the United States permanently for Lithuania in order to 
avoid enforcement of the subpoena,'' a Justice Department statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, ``Balsys conceded that he misrepresented  
and concealed his true wartime activities when he entered the 
United States,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Balsys arrived in the United States in 1961 from England and  
never took U.S. citizenship. He told U.S. immigration officials on 
his arrival that he served in the Lithuanian army from 1934 to 
1940, then lived in hiding in that Baltic country until 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli M. Rosenbaum, director of the Justice Department's Office of  
Special Investigations, said historians on his staff had found 
documents showing that Balsys served with the Nazi-sponsored 
Lithuanian Security Police, the Saugumas, at least until 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	He headed a Saugumas precinct office in Vilnius, Lithuania's  
capital. The Lithuanians acted as Gestapo surrogates, Rosenbaum 
said, and turned over to the Nazis Jews and Lithuanians who helped 
them. The Justice Department said nearly 55,000 of Vilnius' 60,000 
Jews were summarily executed at Panerjai, a wooded area near the 
capital, during the Nazi occupation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court's ruling in the Balsys case was cited by a  
federal judge in Florida in a case involving a Lithuanian found in 
contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
	Vytautas Gecas, 77, of Sunny Hills, Fla., was ordered to jail  
three weeks ago for refusing to testify about his wartime 
activities in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	On the same day the Supreme Court ruled against Balsys, it  
refused to hear Gecas' appeal of an order to testify despite 
fearing prosecution in Lithuania, Israel or Germany.

<HEADLINE> One Race Down, One To Go for Stewart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- While the other 32 drivers in the  
Indianapolis 500 rested and relaxed after the checkered flag fell 
today, Tony Stewart rushed to the airport, changed into another 
racing suit, took a quick nap and got ready to do it all over 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	And then some.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart still had 600 miles and 1,600 mind-numbing left turns,  
to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to become the first driver to complete the Indianapolis  
500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day, Stewart accomplished the 
first part with no problem. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished ninth, four laps behind winner Kenny Brack, on a day  
when several of the top racers were knocked out by crashes and 
engine blowouts. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't exactly the easiest of races. After starting in the  
eighth row, Stewart had handling problems with his car for much of 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all honesty, I'm not as disappointed as I thought I would  
be,'' Stewart said on the private jet that took him to North 
Carolina for the second half of his racing doubleheader. ``The guys 
worked really hard and built me a great car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After crossing the finish line at Indy, Stewart sprinted to his  
trailer, changed into a red T-shirt and blue jeans and returned to 
his garage to say goodbye to his crew. They waved and cheered as 
Stewart was whisked away in a golf cart to a helicopter, waiting on 
the infield near the third turn. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a three-minute ride to the Indianapolis airport, where  
The Home Depot, his sponsor, had its private jet waiting for the 
65-minute flight to North Carolina. After that, Stewart had another 
helicopter ride to Lowe's Motor Speedway, where he was supposed to 
start in the 27th spot in the Coca-Cola. Since he missed the 
driver's meeting, however, he was sent to the back of the grid and 
started in the 43rd spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard the plane, Stewart changed into his NASCAR racing suit,  
ate a Power Bar and sipped Powerade and water. Contrary to what 
doctors expected, he didn't need any intravenous fluids. He had a 
blister on his right hand from the steering wheel, another blister 
on his right knee from the steering column and was a little tired. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's to be expected after a 500-mile race,'' Stewart said  
before dozing off for a quick nap on a sofa in the back of the jet. 
``I'm really excited, though. I thought I'd feel a lot more 
fatigued. I think after an hour's sleep, I'll be fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the plane landed in the track infield, Stewart wiped the  
sleep from his eyes, put on his driving shoes and got ready for 
another plane ride, this time on a helicopter borrowed from fellow 
NASCAR driver Rusty Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	As the helicopter flew low around the speedway, fans stood,  
cheered and waved. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's awesome,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	When the helicopter landed, Stewart got into a white Camaro and  
was driven around the track as part of driver introductions. 
</P>
<P>
	After three years in the Indy Racing league, Stewart switched to  
NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit and has done better than anyone 
expected. He's had five top-10 finishes in his first 11 races, and 
captured his first pole. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 28-year-old Indiana native didn't want to give up his  
chance to win at Indy -- even if it meant driving 1,100 miles in 
less than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``A beautiful sunny day like this, I suppose people could figure  
out better things to do,'' he said. ``But I'm looking forward to 
doing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti was the first to do the double in 1994, but he  
crashed in the Coca-Cola 600 and didn't finish the race. Robby 
Gordon's attempt in 1997 was rained out in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the long day, Stewart looked loose and relaxed Sunday  
morning. When he walked to his race car, his crew handed him two 
helmets and told him to pick one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eenie, meenie, minie, mo,'' Stewart said as his crew laughed.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart has been shuttling back and forth between Indy and  
Concord the past two weeks, and he arrived in Indianapolis late 
Saturday after two days of practice in North Carolina. After 
sleeping in his motor coach at the speedway, Stewart and fiancee 
Krista Dwyer arrived at his garage about 9:25 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked onto the track, there were loud cheers from the  
crowd. People dashed in front of Stewart to get pictures, and 
several drivers stopped to wish him luck. His father, Nelson, gave 
his son a bear hug and told him to have a good day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last two weeks have been the most relaxing months of May  
I've had,'' said Stewart, co-owner of his Indy team. ``We did it 
our way. We didn't have to answer to anyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The handling problems in his Indy car were caused by a mistake  
in the pits. While working on the Dallara Oldsmobile Aurora, the 
crew released the jack too soon and slightly damaged the car. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, you're in a survival mode,'' crew chief Larry  
Curry said. ``You just want to get the car home. I'm disappointed 
in the fact we made that mistake. We would have been the fourth or 
fifth or sixth car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team also was hurt by the lack of practice time, since  
Stewart also had to focus on his Winston Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to win the race, but we did everything we could do,''  
he said before hinting this won't be the last time he does double 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a lesson for next year.''

<HEADLINE> Viagra Stolen From Manila Drugstore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- About 10 men armed with rifles broke  
into a drugstore in a Manila suburb Sunday and stole boxes of the 
anti-impotence drug Viagra and cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The thieves fired at a police patrol car as they emerged from  
the Mercury Drugstore in Quezon City, police said. A woman 
bystander was shot in the arm, and the thieves fled in two cars and 
a van. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra was the only medicine taken by the robbers, who seemed to  
know where it was stored, said an official from the Mercury chain. 
Store employees were still determining how much was taken, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the pre-dawn robbery, the gang also forced a drugstore  
supervisor to open a vault from which a large amount of cash was 
apparently taken, the official said on condition on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The supervisor and a few other clerks had stayed in the  
drugstore overnight for an inventory, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Viagra was introduced last October in the Philippines. Although  
the drug's introduction was widely welcomed, many Filipinos say 
they cannot afford its high price. 
</P>
<P>
	Filipinos have generally relied on traditional balms, herbs,  
homemade concoctions and Chinese traditional medicine to deal with 
impotence.

<HEADLINE>  Indian Strikes in Kashmir Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- As fighter jets pounded a Himalayan border  
expanse, Indian military columns inched closer to hide-outs of 
hundreds of Islamic guerrillas in Kashmir, officials and military 
commanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	India's prime minister won the backing of political rivals on  
the airstrikes and said he had rejected a suggestion by his 
Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, to end the military action in 
the divided territory, claimed by both of the nuclear nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not stop until our aim is achieved,'' Press Trust of  
India quoted Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as telling a 
meeting of major political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	The air force began sorties Wednesday aimed at infiltrators  
entrenched in Indian territory in Kashmir. New Delhi says they 
include Afghan mercenaries and Pakistan army soldiers disguised as 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stopping the airstrikes may not be possible. It cannot be  
one-sided,'' Vajpayee said he had told the Pakistani prime minister 
in a telephone call Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In their call, Sharif offered to send his foreign minister to  
New Delhi for talks to defuse the tension. But India has not yet 
given its formal consent for the visit, and demanded that Pakistan 
stop its military from dispatching infiltrators to Kashmir as it 
considered Sharif's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashmir has been at the center of two of the three wars that  
India and Pakistan have fought since their independence in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Russia and other countries have urged  
restraint, fearing Kashmir could spark a new all-out war between 
the two nations, which both exploded nuclear devices in underground 
tests last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan has denied any connection to the guerrillas and has  
accused India of hitting its territory in the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian army spokesman Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh said strikes by MiGs  
and helicopter gunships had helped drive out many guerrillas. But 
ground fighting could last for several weeks before the military 
regained control over the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of miles north of New Delhi, along the unofficial  
border through Kashmir both nations agreed to after the last war, 
Indian army soldiers made their way up to positions held by the 
guerrillas at about 17,000 feet, a military commander said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The soldiers closed in within about 200 yards of the  
infiltrators and in some places even within 50 yards, expecting a 
hand-to-hand fight and the possibility of heavy casualties, the 
commander said. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier close-quarter fighting, Indian soldiers took some  
positions on the slopes of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Artillery battles also raged through the night. The military  
camp at Dras, close to the disputed border, came under heavy fire. 
But there was no damage or casualties, the commander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister George Fernandes, in New Delhi, said that some  
400 infiltrators had so far been killed in the operation and that 
others had been captured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian army said its casualties stand at 29 killed and 128  
wounded. Twelve soldiers or officers are missing, the army said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. built F-16 fighter jet of the Pakistan Air Force crossed  
about 3,000 yards into Indian air space and was fired at by an 
Indian anti-aircraft gun, a local commander said on condition of 
anonymity. The intrusion occurred near Pandrass, a town near the 
Line of Control, the commander said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane dived and fired at the gun, turning back without  
causing any damage, the commander said. 
</P>
<P>
	But an air force spokesman in New Delhi denied any such  
incident. Pakistani army spokesman Brig. Rashid Quereshi also said 
the report didn't seem correct. He would not say whether Pakistan 
has deployed F-16s in the conflict zone, saying military strategy 
and tactics were confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Early Friday, an Indian MI-17 helicopter gunship was downed and  
its four-member crew was killed. The United Jehad Council, an 
umbrella group of Kashmiri Islamic militant groups, claimed 
responsibility. India lost two MiG fighter jets Thursday, one to 
Pakistani anti-aircraft guns and the other due to a mechanical 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two pilots died after his plane crashed in Pakistani  
territory. The other pilot was taken prisoner in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> How AP's Travel Poll Was Taken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press poll on travel is based on telephone  
interviews with 1,008 randomly selected adults from all states 
except Alaska and Hawaii. The interviewing was conducted May 21-25 
by ICR of Media, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were weighted to represent the population by key  
demographic factors such as age, sex, region and education. 
</P>
<P>
	In the poll, no more than one time in 20 should chance  
variations in the sample cause the results to vary by more than 3 
percentage points from the answers that would be obtained if all 
Americans were polled. 
</P>
<P>
	This margin of sampling error is larger for responses of  
subgroups, such as income categories. There are other sources of 
potential error in polls, including the wording and order of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP poll questions (because of rounding, sums may not total  
100 percent): 
</P>
<P>
	1. If you take a vacation trip this year, which is likely to be  
your primary method of travel? 
</P>
<P>
	Bus, 3 percent; train, 2 percent; car, 55 percent; plane, 30  
percent; cruise, 3 percent; don't plan on taking a vacation, 5 
percent; don't know-refused, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	2. How long do you expect your longest vacation to last this  
year? 
</P>
<P>
	Less than one week, 21 percent; about one week, 44 percent;  
about two weeks, 22 percent; three weeks or more, 12 percent; don't 
know, 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Which season of the year is your favorite for vacation  
travel? 
</P>
<P>
	Summer, 50 percent; Fall, 23 percent; Winter, 9 percent; Spring,  
16 percent; don't know, 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	4. How much do you expect to spend on your vacation travel this  
year? 
</P>
<P>
	Less than $500, 25 percent; more than $500 but less than $1,500,  
43 percent; more than $1,500 but less than $3,000, 19 percent; 
$3,000 or more, 8 percent; nothing, 1 percent; don't know, 3 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Is the amount you expect to spend on vacations this year less  
than you spent on vacations last year, more than you spent on 
vacations last year or about the same as you spent on vacations 
last year? 
</P>
<P>
	Less, 12 percent; more, 22 percent; about the same, 60 percent;  
don't know, 5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sailboats Race to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- The first of 230 yachts from the United States  
cruised into the Marina Hemingway early Sunday in a race that draws 
more attention for its finish line than winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth annual Havana Cup regatta is opposed by Cuban exiles  
in Florida, who say the race makes light of their families' 
suffering and helps Fidel Castro's communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	But the sailors say they see it as a way to better understand a  
country and people most Americans know little about. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we left Florida, there was a guy in boat with a bullhorn  
shouting: ``Don't go! You are helping Fidel Castro!'' said Steve 
Hasting, a personal injury attorney from Corpus Christi, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we wanted to see Cuba, to meet the Cuban people,'' said  
Hasting, 43, co-owner of ``Passion,'' a Santa Cruz 50 sailing 
vessel that was the third to dock at the marina early Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only think I think we are supporting is racing,'' said  
Constance Ledicke, another Corpus Christi attorney in Passion's 
11-member crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to smoke cigars,'' said Susie Loyd, a disc jockey for  
GT 108, the Good Time Oldies radio station in Chattanooga, 
Tennessee. ``We want to go to the Floridita,'' she added, referring 
to one of writer Ernest Hemingway's famous hangouts in old Havana 
during the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who voiced their opposition to the regatta last week  
was Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who called it an ``insult'' to Cuban 
Americans living in his state. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the powerful exile lobby, the Cuban American National  
Foundation, gathered at Tampa Bay to protest as the boats began 
leaving Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba, the sailors are  
prohibited from spending any money on land. Thus, as in past years, 
the Cuban government will not charge them docking fees, electricity 
or other services associated with their stay at the marina. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the sailors said they planned to spend their entire time  
on their boats. Everyone wanted to see what was outside the marina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see this as an adventure in a foreign land, support for  
racing,'' said Bill Liles, a Corpus Christi engineer in Passion's 
crew. ``This is not about politics.''

<HEADLINE> Dancers Try for Largest Chorus Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DODGE CITY, Kan. (AP) -- Hundreds of dancers filled a downtown  
street in an attempt to form the world's largest cancan line. 
</P>
<P>
	A piano player cranked out traditional French cancan music on  
Friday night as cattle trucks slowed on nearby Wyatt Earp 
Boulevard, their drivers watching the interlocked dancers kick 
left, then right. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said at least 600 men and women attempted to break  
the world record for the number of people to perform the feat 
during the start of the town's annual Cowboy Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Guinness Book of World Records will review a  
videotape of Friday's event before ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearest official record recognized by Guinness is for the  
world's largest chorus line, set in 1990 in Great Britain by 598 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we know now that everybody wants to be a cancan girl,  
at least a little bit,'' said Sonya Hughes, who thought of the 
idea.

<HEADLINE> Robby Gordon Watches Indy Slip Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- As the miles wound down in the Indianapolis  
500, race leader Robby Gordon kept asking his pit about his fuel. 
The answer was always the same from car owner John Menard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fuel's OK. Keep racing,'' Menard calmed his driver.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon kept racing, right up to the next-to-last lap, and then  
the fuel was not OK. He coasted into the pits as Kenny Brack 
screamed by on the front straightaway to take the white flag 
signifying one last lap to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``What else could we say?'' Menard said. ``You could play  
what-ifs forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Brack crossed the finish line, Gordon was screeching his  
tires, trying to leave his pit after he took on a splash of fuel, 
hoping against hope something would happen to let him back in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``To lose by just one lap was heartbreaking,'' Gordon said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just feel like crying, OK?'' Menard said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon had started out fourth, then found himself a lap down to  
the leaders midway through the race. ``I worked really hard and 
fought back,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the leaders started falling by the wayside, Gordon crept to  
the front. He grabbed the lead on lap 171 and led for 28 times 
around the 2 1-2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a moment Gordon had thought about for a long time and  
visualized. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon does not regularly drive in the Indy Racing League, the  
breakaway oval league for open-wheel cars. Usually, he labors in 
the cockpit for CART, which is the bigger marquee except for 
Memorial Day weekend and the Indy 500. Gordon finished last in the 
CART race Saturday in Madison, Ill., and has been among the 
owner-drivers who have lobbied most heavily for reunification. 
</P>
<P>
	He first drove the 500 in 1993, led for two laps and finished  
27th. He finished fifth in 1995 and led again briefly in 1995 
before another fifth-place finish. In 1997, he had a terrifying 
exit when his car caught fire in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Gordon hooked up with Menard, a Midwesterner through  
and through whose racing operation is based in Indianapolis. He has 
been among the most loyal IRL owners and won the 1997 league title 
with driver Tony Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard's best hope going into the race had been Greg Ray, the  
second-fastest qualifier who had the fastest car in the place for 
every day but qualifying. Ray, however, went to the sidelines on 
lap 120. Gordon was moving up -- and thinking back a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should have won this race in '95,'' Gordon said Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	After that, the driver who has raced everything from motorcycles  
to stock cars tried to learn from the looming figures of the 
storied track -- Roger Penske, Rick Mears. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just really studied it. We felt we were on our game,''  
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the miles slipped away under tires turning at 200-plus mph,  
Gordon kept asking that question. What about the fuel? His gauge 
showed enough, but he wasn't confident. 
</P>
<P>
	Menard considered bringing Gordon in for a quick splash but  
hoped for a caution flag or something else to squeak out the last 
mile. 
</P>
<P>
	``To lose by one lap was just heartbreaking,'' Gordon said.

<HEADLINE> Cast of Sitcom Talks to Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monica and Chandler weren't supposed to fall in  
love. 
</P>
<P>
	The producers of the top-rated sitcom ``Friends'' originally  
conceived a ``dark horse'' romance between Monica, played by 
Courtney Cox, and Joey, played by Matt LeBlanc. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was before we cast the show,'' David Crane told the June  
4 edition of Entertainment Weekly magazine. The creators intended 
this second romance to play off the one between David Schwimmer's 
Ross and Jennifer Aniston's Rachel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, the producers decided that Monica and Chandler,  
played by Matthew Perry, would make the most strangely entertaining 
bedfellows. ``We've gone out of our way to make it feel different 
than Ross and Rachel,'' said Crane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't do anything to lead up to it,'' he said. ``We  
thought it could be one episode or three, but they have so many 
problems built into their characters that it's yielded a ton of 
wonderful stories.''

<HEADLINE> Crew Chief Hit by Car Leaving Pit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A race car leaving a pit stop struck and  
critically injured a crew member at the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Fried, the chief mechanic and right front tire man for  
Robbie McGehee, was directing the car out of the pit when he was 
hit from behind by Jimmy Kite's car. 
</P>
<P>
	He flipped into the air, landed on his face and was bleeding  
badly as he was taken to Methodist Hospital, where he was listed in 
critical condition, but responding to stimulation. Linda Conti, the 
team manager, went to the hospital with Fried. 
</P>
<P>
	No crew member has been killed at Indy since 1973, when Armando  
Tehran, a mechanic for driver Swede Savage, was struck by a fire 
truck speeding from the pits to the scene of a crash that fatally 
injured Savage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fried accident was triggered when Kite, the youngest driver  
in the race at 23, was hit by Johnny Unser, whose brakes failed as 
he was entering the pit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kite's steering broke and his car lurched into Fried.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was on the brakes as hard as I could. There's nothing you  
could do with broken steering,'' Kite said. ``I feel bad right now. 
There's nothing you could do. It's the most helpless feeling I've 
ever had.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Banks To Pay Fee for Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's banks will have to pay 0.4 percent  
of their total deposits for coverage from Mexico's new deposit 
insurance agency, the agency, known as IPAB, announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent required by IPAB is the minimum allowed by the  
Bank Savings' Protection Law passed in Congress last December, 
which created IPAB to launch a new regulatory framework for 
Mexico's banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important the banks channel an important part of their  
income to building reserves and fortifying their financial 
position,'' IPAB said in explaining why banks would have to pay the 
minimum possible fee for deposit insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	IPAB, however, reserved the right to raise the fees to no more  
than 0.5 percent ``in case conditions arise requiring an increase 
in quotas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``extraordinary circumstances,'' the fees paid by individual  
banks will be reduced to no more than 0.3 percent, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	IPAB also announced a seven-stage calendar for gradually  
reducing deposit insurance coverage to 400,000 inflation-linked 
accounting units known as UDI's worth around $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, banks were given unlimited deposit insurance  
coverage.

<HEADLINE> Al Michaels Talks to TV Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Michaels says losing his longtime ``Monday  
Night Football'' broadcast partners, Frank Gifford and Dan 
Dierdorf, has been emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, the changes are personally tough,'' he told the June 5  
issue of TV Guide. ``When you have a long-standing relationship, 
which I had with both guys, changes in that regard are not welcome 
probably by any of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer Esiason got mixed reviews after replacing Gifford last  
season. Dierdorf left the network in February after failing to mesh 
with Esiason. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC is considering a return to a two-man booth on ``Monday Night  
Football'' for the first time since Michaels teamed with Gifford 13 
years ago.

	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- While Jeff Burton was savoring his victory  
in the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday night, Dale Jarrett was celebrating 
his fifth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could have been ugly,'' said Jarrett, who started 28th in  
the 43-car field, quickly fell one lap off the pace and never 
flirted with leading. Jarrett got his lap back by passing the 
leader on an early restart, then spent the rest of the evening 
merely trying to keep his car under control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just missed it,'' he said. ``I thought it was going to be a  
lot looser than it was, and we just plowed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who came into the race with a 63-point lead over Burton  
atop the Winston Cup standings, saw his margin shrink to 33.

<P>
	KENSETH'S JUMP: On the day Dale Earnhardt Jr. made his Winston  
Cup debut, Busch Grand National points leader Matt Kenseth outlined 
his plans to also move up to NASCAR's top circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth, the Grand National points leader, said Sunday he will  
run five Winston Cup races later in 1999, beginning with the Aug. 
22 event at Michigan Speedway, before moving up to the circuit on a 
full-time basis next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth, 27, will drive a Ford Taurus owned by Jack Roush, who  
already fields a Winston Cup series-high five cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Roush has built a tremendous organization with great  
people at every level, and I can't wait to take advantage of their 
program,'' Kenseth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making the jump with Kenseth are Robbie Reiser, his crew  
chief, and DeWALT Industrial Tool Co., his primary sponsor on the 
Grand National circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth lost out to Earnhardt for the Grand National  
championship last year. They have swapped positions in the 
standings this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth announced his Winston Cup plans at Lowe's Motor Speedway  
at Charlotte, where Earnhardt drove in the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, 
his first event on stock car racing's premier circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth also plans to drive in Winston Cup events this year in  
Darlington, S.C., on Sept. 5; Dover, Del., on Sept. 26; Concord, on 
Oct. 10, and Rockingham, on Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: Long known as a leader in pre-race antics,  
the speedway staged another extravaganza Sunday, enlisting the aid 
of the 82nd Airborne Division for a mock battle against the forces 
of evil. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict, staged on the grassy area in the infield trioval,  
featured plenty of exploding buildings, fake gunfire, burning 
trucks and low-flying passes by helicopters, much to the delight of 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest cheers were reserved, however, for when one of the  
helicopters dropped a line onto which four members of the 82nd 
attached themselves. The chopper then raised up to 200 feet and 
flew slowly around the speedway, dangling the tethered soldiers 
below. 
</P>
<P>
	It took about 30 minutes for the U.S. troops to successfully  
complete their mission, eradicating the enemy and making the 
speedway safe again for racing. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	SCHWANTZ UPDATE: Grand National driver Kevin Schwantz, flown by  
helicopter to Carolinas Medical Center in neighboring Charlotte 
after crashing in a race at the track Saturday, was upgraded to 
fair condition Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwantz was originally diagnosed with a brain contusion and a  
fractured pelvis, and he was listed in serious condition when he 
was admitted. But doctors subsequently discovered that Schwantz, 
the 1995 Grand Prix world motorcycle champion, had actually 
fractured the hip during a previous cycling accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He dislocated the hip Saturday, and it was put back in place.  
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Schwantz was alert Sunday and was moved from the  
intensive care unit to a private room. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	MELLING REMEMBERED: Winston Cup car owner Harry Melling, who  
died of a heart attack Saturday in Michigan at age 54, was 
remembered before Sunday's race with a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Melling's team members also wore black arm bands on their  
uniforms, and they put special decals in his memory on the car, 
driven by Jerry Nadeau. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service will be held Tuesday at the golf and ski  
resort Melling's family owns in Gaylord, Mich. A funeral will be 
held Thursday in Jackson, Mich.

	SPENCER'S ADVENTURES: Jimmy Spencer didn't have a particularly  
enjoyable two weekends at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	After failing to qualify for The Winston last weekend, Spencer  
publicly questioned whether his team was giving him the strongest 
engines possible. Not surprisingly, his statements didn't sit too 
well with a number of people at the team's shop. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, Spencer got a first: first driver behind the  
wall. He had to pit five laps into the event because of a broken 
radiator, and he spent 29 laps in the garage getting repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	He wound up 38th in the 43-car field, 53 laps off the winning  
pace. 
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	JOB OPENING: Burton's victory came in one of five events  
designated by series sponsor R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. as ``No Bull 
5'' races. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only does winning such races carry a $1 million bonus for  
eligible drivers, but a fan also is selected to be represented by 
that driver, and the fan also collects $1 million as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton was representing Wade Smith, a remodeling contractor and  
big racing fan from Metropolis, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, Smith was ecstatic when he met Burton in  
Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did it,'' Smith yelled to his favorite driver. ``I don't  
think I've ever seen a better race in the history of NASCAR.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith didn't hesitate when asked what he planned to do with the  
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure as hell not going to go to work Tuesday,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the five fans had agreed before the race that if any  
of them won, they would give $10,000 apiece to the each of the 
other four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We became a family since we've been here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
                              *------	 
</P>
<P>
	DID YOU KNOW? The engine in the car Kenny Brack drove to victory  
in the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday was built by Roush Racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the Livonia, Mich.-based company is owned by the same Jack  
Roush who fields five cars on the Winston Cup circuit, including 
those driven by Burton.

<HEADLINE> Two Railroads To Take Over Conrail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Two railroads this week will take over and  
carve up what once was the government-run Conrail, continuing a 
trend toward consolidation in an industry struggling to compete 
with truckers. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning Tuesday, shippers, regulators and other railroads will  
watch closely as CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. attempt to 
redraw the rail map while avoiding the service foul-up that 
followed the last major rail merger. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay Conrail's $10.3 billion purchase price, both CSX and  
Norfolk Southern are counting on persuading more shippers to carry 
goods by rail instead of trucks. It is a strategy that has 
preoccupied Tom Finkbiner, vice president for intermodal services 
at Norfolk Southern. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the map of the competition there,'' Finkbiner said,  
pointing to a picture of the interstate highway system on his 
office wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact of the matter is we paid an enormous premium for  
Conrail infrastructure,'' he said. ``Now we have to make it work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conrail was born in 1976 as a government monopoly created from  
six bankrupt railroads. The Philadelphia-based carrier was sold to 
the public in 1987 at about $15 a share. It grew it value to $115 
per share when CSX and Norfolk Southern jointly bought it and 
promised to restore competition to several Northeastern markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction is the most complex in modern railroading. It  
comes as shippers remain uncertain about the viability of rail in 
light of major disruptions and delivery delays that Union Pacific 
faced after it tried to absorb Southern Pacific routes in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Norfolk Southern and CSX, which operates out of  
Richmond, Va., have focused more on making sure their transition 
goes smoothly. The companies figured they could worry later about 
changing routes and adding traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	They have spent millions of dollars -- and two years --  
reconfiguring their computers, retraining their workers and making 
other preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	After Tuesday, the attention turns to marketing their new  
railroads to shippers of food products, electronics, paper goods, 
auto parts and just about anything else that now moves primarily by 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies eye traffic headed from the Southeast to New York,  
Philadelphia and other Northeastern markets with high demand for 
consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order for us to be successful, we can't just have a smooth  
transition,'' said Jim Howarth, vice president for CSX's Northeast 
commercial operations. ``CSX borrowed a lot of money. We must grow 
the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two Southeastern railroads will be able to offer direct  
service to lucrative markets in the Northeast, avoiding the costly 
interchanges now required with Conrail. But the railroads have the 
burden of proving their worth to potential customers wary of 
switching to rail without guarantee of a flawless transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reliability and performance for rail service is something we  
have to show people and prove to people,'' Howarth acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Donald Nelson, senior vice president of operations at  
Conrail: ``This is a complicated transaction, and it's foolish to 
say Murphy's Law won't play a role. We have to be prepared to react 
to rapidly changing events, day by day, hour buy hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Rastatter, director of policy for the National Industrial  
Transportation League, a shipping group, said service reliability 
is essential as businesses increasingly rely on ``just-in-time'' 
delivery to reduce inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	In hopes of avoiding service troubles, the companies already had  
postponed by nine months the split that occurs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move ahead, the issue will be whether the industry can  
come out of the transition and be an even more productive force in 
the economy,'' said Linda Morgan, chairwoman of the rail regulating 
Surface Transportation Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Trucks have the advantage of reaching the 77 percent of  
communities that are not served by rail. They can also deliver 
goods faster, as highways cut through mountains and difficult 
terrain, while rails tend to meander along rivers and through 
valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	However, railroads are cheaper for moving bulk goods over long  
distances, and the new Conrail owners believe they can seize that 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	To overcome the limited reach of rail, the railroads have  
focused on expanding their intermodal service, which involves 
moving trucks on top of rail cars for most of the distance and then 
driving the rest of the way to the destination. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern has plans to introduce direct Texas-to-New York  
and Miami-to-Montreal intermodal service on July 1. CSX has 
compiled a list of 700 potential customers to target and will 
adjust routes as warranted. The two companies predict they can 
remove 1 million trucks from the highways over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	That volume would represent only a small dent to the trucking  
industry but a significant level of growth for the railroads, which 
have been losing market share to the truckers since World War II.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Espionage Could Cost Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time, Energy Secretary Bill  
Richardson on Sunday said he would fire department officials for 
failing to act on signs China was stealing secrets from a U.S. 
nuclear weapons lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Dismissals and demotions could come as early as this week, after  
Richardson receives an internal report on security lapses at the 
Los Alamos lab in New Mexico that may have contributed to China's 
thefts of U.S. nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were communications breakdowns. There were incompetent  
acts, security was not considered important,'' Richardson said on 
NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On ``Fox News Sunday,'' he cited ``individuals at the Department  
of Energy and the labs that, in my judgment, did not do their 
jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the fallout continued from last week's release of a  
special House committee's report on China's 20-year campaign to 
steal America's nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department's counterintelligence chief said Congress  
responded slowly to FBI warnings China was stealing U.S. nuclear 
secrets from the federal labs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate intelligence committee chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby,  
called the remarks ``out of bounds'' and said Congress acted 
appropriately. A Democratic colleague said ``a game of blame'' 
accomplished little. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Curran, a veteran FBI official who now directs the Energy  
Department's counterintelligence office, said the FBI in 1997 gave 
Shelby ``very, very significant proposals'' with 26 recommendations 
on improving security at the national labs, as well as a request 
that Congress provide $12.5 million to begin putting the new 
precautions in place. ``And I never heard anything since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curran, on ABC's ``This Week,'' said the department later  
adopted those recommendations, but ``it would have been nice to 
have a head start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby, appearing later on the same show, said Curran was ``out  
of bounds in some areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said that in 1996, the Senate intelligence committee,  
then under Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., did respond to 
counterintelligence problems at the labs and provided additional 
money. Shelby, R-Ala., said the Energy Department ignored the 
committee's advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, a Democrat from New Jersey who has been  
strongly critical of the administration's handling of the spy case, 
said Curran's comments were ``entirely inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not proper, he said, for Curran ``to engage in a game of  
blame between the Congress and the executive branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also urged an end to ``scapegoating, looking for  
heads to roll'' and a renewed focus on increased security. 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed with Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chief author of  
the report on China's thefts of U.S. nuclear secrets, that Chinese 
espionage was serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the People's Republic of China stole information  
about the seven major warheads in the current American nuclear 
arsenal as well as the neutron bomb, and the thefts ``almost 
certainly continue to the present.'' China has said the spying 
charge was ``groundless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the Chinese got information on three U.S.  
nuclear warheads but there is no hard evidence China has used that 
information to modernize or deploy nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox agreed it is unclear what the Chinese are doing with the  
American technology, but ``diminishing the problem, saying it's 
really not that bad, is actually an obstacle to fixing the 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also stressed that the Energy counterintelligence has  
already put in place 85 percent of the measures recommended to stop 
future attempts at espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox disagreed with that assessment, saying that since the people  
who have penetrated the labs over many years have not been 
apprehended, ``we have to presume they are still there.''

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush To Crow About Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush awaited  
legislative approval of tax cuts worth about $1.7 billion, less 
than he sought but enough to claim bragging rights in a 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	While the final plan was almost $1 billion less than Bush wanted  
-- and about one-fourth the $6.4 billion budget surplus lawmakers 
had to work with -- the Republican governor still was on the verge 
of claiming a big tax cut. Lawmakers were finishing their work by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked for $2.6 billion in various cuts and was taking less:  
some $1.2 billion in property tax relief, plus $506 million in 
sales and business tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a Republican primary, taxes are a great issue. It'll kill  
you or make you. He's golden on taxes,'' said Bill Miller, a Texas 
political consultant who has worked for Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got bragging rights,'' Miller said. ``He's got real  
thrust for his presidential campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said Bush ducked difficult issues and left it to  
lawmakers to hammer out everything from teacher pay to children's 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to sit on the fence about everything there is and see  
which way the wind's blowing,'' said Texas Democratic Party chair 
Molly Beth Malcolm. ``A leader takes a stand on tough issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other issues that will be scrutinized as Bush begins to sound  
out a presidential effort in the coming weeks: 
</P>
<P>
	--Democrats and Republicans approved his proposals to require  
parental notification before minors can get an abortion, jail 
juveniles caught with guns and begin deregulation of the electric 
utility industry. 
</P>
<P>
	--His biggest defeat was failure to get taxpayer-funded vouchers  
to pay private school tuition. His brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, has 
approval for vouchers in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	--Critics beat up the Texas governor over the Legislature's  
refusal to toughen the state hate crimes law or require background 
checks on buyers at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush sat out those fights. He said ``all crime is hate'' but  
left the debate to lawmakers; he said he favored background checks 
but called it a federal matter. 
</P>
<P>
	While he took heat, the death of those bills in legislative  
committees kept Bush from having to sign or veto them. That spared 
him the possible wrath of voters on either side of two politically 
contentious issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call him Governor beat-around-the-Bush,'' Mrs. Malcolm said.  
``It's rhetoric vs. reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time and again, Democrats accused Bush of putting his  
presidential ambitions first. 
</P>
<P>
	They accused him of putting too much emphasis on corporate tax  
relief; pushing property tax cuts that benefit only some Texans 
rather than broad sales tax cuts for all; failing to demand 
stronger environmental measures; and being stingy toward the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're either going to care more about the voters in New  
Hampshire or Iowa, or we're going to care more about the school 
children of Texas,'' Rep. Domingo Garcia of Dallas complained 
during a debate pitting property tax cuts against funding for 
smaller school classes.

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO missiles slammed into a bridge  
crowded with market-goers and cars in central Serbia today, killing 
11 people, state-run media said. Several cars plunged into the 
Velika Morava River after three missiles struck the bridge, Tanjug

	NATO Force May Help Rebuild Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 50,000 peacekeepers NATO plans for Kosovo  
after the bombing ends would include heavily armed soldiers to 
protect returning refugees and hard-hat engineers to rebuild roads, 
airports and utilities battered by the allies. The peacekeeping 
force is only a theoretical army, for now, with no timetable to 
stop the airstrikes against the forces of Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. That has not prevented the allies from planning 
the force's makeup and duties. The peacekeepers would include 
engineers, road crews, mine-clearing teams, water purification 
experts and police troops.

	SOWETO, South Africa (AP) -- Nelson Mandela told cheering  
supporters today that South Africa's struggle to recover from 
apartheid continues. Nearly 80,000 people packed into a

Africans elect their second post-apartheid government. Mandela told 
the crowd they had struck a ``death blow'' to apartheid when they 
overwhelmingly elected the ANC five years ago. Surveys predict the 
ANC will win at least 60 percent of the vote Wednesday.

	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Kenny Brack drove to Victory Lane, giving  
owner A.J. Foyt his fifth Indianapolis 500 victory and first as a 
car owner today. Brack took the lead just over one lap from the end 
when Robby Gordon lost his gamble and ran out of fuel. Gordon 
skipped a late pit stop and tried to go the final 32 laps on one

become the first driver to complete the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 
600. Shortly after the race ended, he sprinted for a helicopter and 
headed for the airport to board a plane to North Carolina. It's a 
50-minute flight, and then he's got another helicopter ride to 
Lowe's Motor Speedway. He'll start in the 27th spot in the 
Coca-Cola.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's oldest opposition party has voted to  
adopt a presidential primary for the July 2000 elections, following 
in the footsteps of the governing Institutional Revolutionary 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 6,000 delegates at a national assembly for the center-right  
National Action Party voted late Saturday to hold a national 
primary open to members and registered ``sympathizers'' of the 
party. The election was expected to be held in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came less than two weeks after the governing party,  
known as the PRI, voted to hold its first national primary, ending 
a tradition where the outgoing president selects the party's 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1939, the National Action Party struggled for decades  
against rigged elections and a system stacked in favor of the PRI 
until winning its first governorship in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The party, whose main strength is among businessmen, middle  
class and religiously inclined voters, has taken advantage of 
democratic reforms in Mexico and now governs Baja California, 
Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, Jalisco, Guanajuato and Nuevo Leon.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The center-left coalition that has ruled  
Chile since the end of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military 
dictatorship chose Ricardo Lagos as its candidate for president, 
according to election returns. 
</P>
<P>
	With 99 percent of the vote counted, Lagos had 71.34 percent to  
28.66 for his rival, Christian Democratic Sen. Andres Zaldivar. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaldivar conceded defeat in an emotional speech and pledged to  
``loyally work'' with Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagos, 61, was a key figure in the fight for democracy during  
Pinochet's rule. In the Dec. 12 presidential election, he will face 
Joaquin Lavin, a 37-year-old economist nominated by the right wing. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Coalition for Democracy, which was formed to fight  
the Pinochet regime, has won every election since civilian rule was 
restored in 1990.

	Nearly 6 million people were eligible to vote in Sunday's  
election, but officials said only around 1.3 million cast ballots.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's banks will have to pay 0.4 percent  
of their total deposits for coverage from Mexico's new deposit 
insurance agency known as IPAB, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 0.4 percent required by IPAB is the minimum allowed by the  
Bank Savings Protection Law passed in Congress last December, which 
created IPAB to launch a new regulatory framework for Mexico's 
banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important the banks channel an important part of their  
income to building reserves and fortifying their financial 
position,'' IPAB said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fees could go up to 0.5 percent or be reduced to 0.3 percent  
in ``extraordinary circumstances, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Details of Conrail Transaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	--Norfolk Southern gets about 58 percent of Conrail, CSX most of  
the rest. The two companies will share Conrail tracks and 
facilities in Detroit, Philadelphia and most of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	--Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va., takes over about 7,200  
miles of Conrail routes, creating a 21,600-mile rail system in 22 
states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada. It will be 
the fourth-largest U.S. railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	--CSX, based in Richmond, Va., gets about 4,000 miles of Conrail  
routes, forming a 22,300-mile system serving 23 states, the 
District of Columbia, and Montreal and Ontario, Canada. It will be 
the No. 3 railroad. 
</P>
<P>
	--The restructuring will introduce competition to several  
Northeastern markets for the first time since 1976, when Conrail 
began operating as a monopoly created by Congress out of six 
bankrupt railroads. However, the transaction also leaves CSX as the 
sole carrier in many markets east of New York's Hudson River. 
</P>
<P>
	--Philadelphia-based Conrail was sold to the public in 1987 at  
about $15 a share. Its stock was hovering at $71 when CSX offered 
shareholders a package of cash and stock worth $92.50 a share. 
Norfolk Southern eventually upped the bid to $115 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	--CSX and Norfolk Southern hope to grow their business by  
persuading shippers they can offer better north-south service by 
avoiding costly interchanges they now do with Conrail. 
</P>
<P>
	--The transaction is costing a net 1,500 union positions and  
requires a similar number of transfers. Much of the disruption 
involves clerical and maintenance workers. Another 1,150 management 
positions are being abolished, mostly at Conrail's Philadelphia 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	--The restructuring leaves two giant railroads in the East and  
two in the West, paving the way for the creation of a 
transcontinental railroad.

<HEADLINE> Tethers Do Their Job at Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The wheel tethers did their job.  
</P>
<P>
	Only once in five crashes in Sunday's Indianapolis 500 did a  
wheel come loose from a race car, and the new restraint system 
slowed it enough that time so it posed no danger to fans or 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tethers were put on the cars Thursday, less than a month  
after three spectators were killed and eight others injured when a 
wheel and other debris hurtled a catch fence into the grandstand 
during an IRL race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Just nine laps into the Indy 500, the tethers got their first  
major test, and media-weary IRL officials were watching closely as 
Eliseo Salazar crashed into the outside wall on the second turn. 
His right rear wheel wobbled loose but remained attached to the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	``The restraint system performed very well and certainly reduced  
the amount of debris on the track, especially wheels,'' said Fred 
Nation, vice president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Safety Wheel Energy Management System (SWEMS) is designed to  
keep the wheel assembly attached to the car in the event of a 
crash. Even if the wheel becomes detached, the SWEMS system reduces 
the energy and velocity of the wheel, Nation said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a crash late in the race by Mark Dismore, the right front  
wheel broke free but merely rolled across the track. As the car was 
being towed back to Gasoline Alley, the safety tethers were 
stripped of their casing, revealing badly frayed cables. 
</P>
<P>
	The tethers on Salazar's car were also badly frayed, although  
Sam Garrett, a spokesman for chassis-builder Dallara, said that 
does not necessarily indicate weakness in the tether. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the tethers are frayed allows some strands in  
the cable to be severed without severing the wire itself,'' Garrett 
said. ``The wheel came off with less energy than it would 
normally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The original Indy racer was designed to dissipate energy in a  
collision, Nation said. Wheels and pieces of the racer's chassis 
would splinter away from the car to protect the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	With the fatal accident in North Carolina, IRL officials speeded  
the installation of safety tethers, which had been in development 
for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Each wheel is anchored to the chassis by cables to prevent it  
from leaving the car, but the cables do not stretch and are not 
long enough to snap back and hit the driver, Nation said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the safety tethers, IRL will lower the speed at  
which cars can race. Beginning June 12 at the Texas Motor Speedway, 
engines cannot operate at more than 10,000 rpm. 
</P>
<P>
	This is a reduction from the current 10,300 rpm maximum and will  
reduce race speeds by 5 mph.

<HEADLINE> Former Triple-Jump Champ Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Joao Carlos de Oliveira, who held the  
world triple jump record for a decade and later lost a leg in an 
accident, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira died late Saturday at the Beneficencia Portugesa  
Hospital in Sao Paulo where he was admitted a month ago with lung 
and liver ailments, said hospital spokesman Manuel Veras. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian jumper became a national hero when he set the  
world record with a jump of 58 feet-8 1-4 inches at the 1975 Pan 
American Games in Mexico, a mark that stood for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won bronze medals in the 1976 and 1980 Olympics, and  
Brazilians dubbed him ``Joao do Pulo'' -- Portuguese for ``Jumping 
John.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He continues to be for me one of the 10 best athletes the  
world has seen,'' said Oliveira's former trainer Pedro do Toledo in 
a televised interview. ``He could have done much more if he had 
been born at a different time, in a different country...'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, Oliveira's car was hit head-on by a drunk driver going  
the wrong way at night on an interstate highway. Oliveira was 
seriously injured, and doctors amputated his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliveira reportedly become depressed after unsuccessful ventures  
in business and politics and became an alcoholic, which undermined 
his health. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his difficulties, he had wanted to compete in the  
ParaOlympics in Sydney next year ``if not to win, to set an 
example'', Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's sports minister Rafael Greca said Oliveira ``enters the  
gallery of Brazilian Olympic heroes'' and should be remembered for 
his conquests, not for the period in which his life ``fell down''. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, mourners paid tribute to Oliveira whose body was  
taken to the Legislative Assembly building in Sao Paulo and draped 
in a Brazilian flag. 
</P>
<P>
	He was to be buried Monday in his home town of Pindamonhangaba,  
some 90 miles northeast of Sao Paulo.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Control Plan Saved Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's sudden decision to  
impose exchange control measures last year not only saved the 
country from disaster, but other nations in the region as well by 
scaring away currency speculators, a central bank official said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Malaysia introduced exchange control measures Sept.  
1, the economy of countries in the region started to recover, the 
adviser to the bank, Nor Mohamed Yakcop said in the Mingguan 
Malaysia newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	According to him, several months before Malaysia introduced  
exchange controls, there was a plan by hedge fund managers and 
other speculators to weaken further the ringgit to just 5 ringgit 
to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also plans for similar action against currencies of  
Thailand, Indonesia and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar is now officially pegged to 4.80 ringgit.  
</P>
<P>
	``As such, it was vital to them that these three countries which  
did not impose exchange control measures received assistance from 
the International Monetary Fund,'' said Nor Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia had succeeded in its economic recovery on the  
initiative of the people themselves and ``we did not receive a cent 
from the IMF rescue fund of $180 billion,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Vitter To Succeed Livingston in La. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- His opponent had the backing of the state's  
political elite, but David Vitter's anti-establishment campaign 
prevailed as voters elected him to replace Bob Livingston in the 
House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter defeated former Gov. Dave Treen on Saturday despite  
Treen's garnering of endorsements from more than a dozen 
high-profile politicians, including Gov. Mike Foster, Livingston 
and Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have been the past, but we are the future,'' a  
jubilant Vitter said in his victory speech Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Complete but unofficial returns gave Vitter 61,661 votes, or 51  
percent, to Treen's 59,849 votes in Louisiana's affluent, 
predominantly white and largely suburban 1st Congressional 
District. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Vitter and Treen are Republicans. They finished atop a  
field of nine in a May 1 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter benefited by portraying himself as an outsider shunned by  
many influential Louisiana politicians, said Ed Renwick, a 
political science professor at Loyola University. 
</P>
<P>
	``Running against the establishment probably helped him in the  
end,'' Renwick said. 
</P>
<P>
	But low voter turnout helped Vitter because he had a dedicated  
group of supporters who show up to vote, Renwick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitter, a former Rhodes scholar who's slim and boyish-looking at  
38, made a name for himself by pushing a term limits bill for state 
lawmakers through a reluctant Louisiana Legislature in 1995. And he 
is noted more for his ability to get under his fellow politicians' 
skins than for his willingness to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Livingston's popularity during more than 20 years in Congress  
stemmed in part from his successful steering of defense contracts 
to Avondale Shipyards and money for flood control. He had risen to 
the chairmanship of the House Appropriations Committee and was in 
line to be speaker until he resigned after confessing to marital 
infidelities as news of them was about to break. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen congratulated Vitter Saturday but could not hide his anger  
at the Vitter camp's campaign tactics in the final days. 
</P>
<P>
	Treen decried opposition campaign material claiming or implying  
he was running to increase the congressional pension he had earned 
during a seven-year stint in Congress in the 1970s, that he had 
voted for congressional pay increases and that he was supported by 
ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.

<HEADLINE> Gun Crackdown in Va. Cut Slay Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Police, prosecutors and politicians love  
Project Exile. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint federal-local crackdown on criminals who carry guns  
has been given much of the credit for reducing Richmond's 
once-soaring murder rate by 32 percent in the last year measured, 
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Project Exile has shipped off hundreds of violent offenders to  
serve long terms in faraway federal prisons. President Clinton, 
impressed by the statistics, recently held it up as a national 
model for fighting gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	What could be wrong with a program like this?  
</P>
<P>
	Two big things, critics say.  
</P>
<P>
	For one, it is inherently racist, according to local defense  
attorneys. Because it targets city violence, city suspects -- 
usually black -- end up facing federal charges while suspects from 
outlying counties-- usually white -- face only state prosecution for 
the same crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Secondly, it floods federal courts with small-time local crime,  
the region's federal judges say. One went so far as to write Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist to criticize Project Exile as a pricey 
federal power grab. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only does this do violence to the concepts of federalism,  
the cost to national taxpayers is at least three times more'' than 
it would be to prosecute suspects normally, U.S. District Judge 
Richard L. Williams told Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
	Project Exile was created in 1997 by Richmond authorities  
horrified by high crime. Annual murder totals for the city of 
203,000 ranged from 112 to 160 in the mid-1990s, which consistently 
put Richmond among the 10 U.S. cities with the highest per-capital 
murder rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Project Exile was born of the belief that crime would fall if  
local officials could stop criminals from carrying guns. 
</P>
<P>
	It works this way:  
</P>
<P>
	If a convicted felon is caught carrying a gun, local prosecutors  
drop the case and let federal prosecutors press charges instead. 
They can do that because gun possession by a felon is a federal as 
well as a state violation. Federal prosecutors can seek longer 
sentences than their state counterparts -- typically a 10-year 
maximum instead of five. Federal authorities also have the option 
of sending convicts to distant federal prisons instead of nearby 
state facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest advantage to Project Exile, prosecutors say, is  
that federal courts are simply better at putting gun-toting 
criminals behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, the feds have completed 347 cases and gotten 304  
convictions, says Stephen W. Miller, an assistant U.S. attorney 
based in Richmond. The average sentence was 4 1/2 years without 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the state system ... even if they're convicted, they  
don't spend much time in jail,'' Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
	The average state sentence for felons caught with guns is about  
nine months and about 18 months for armed drug dealers, he said, 
citing a Justice Department report. 
</P>
<P>
	Project Exile is no secret. Billboards, bus ads, radio spots and  
television commercials drive the point home to those who haven't 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the TV spots begins with a picture of a night sky and the  
sound of gunfire. The words ``9 millimeter'' flash on the screen, 
followed by more gunfire and ``.380 caliber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sound of chirping crickets is next with the question:  
``Nice, isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murders in Richmond dropped from 139 in 1997 to 94 in 1998, and  
Project Exile deserves some of the credit, say federal and state 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents, however, question whether the benefits are worth the  
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	David Baugh, a local defense attorney, asserts Project Exile is  
illegal because it affects blacks almost exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
	Richmond's three U.S. District judges agree in part. In a  
January opinion on motions for an ongoing Project Exile case, they 
said the program wasn't unconstitutional but did have a 
disproportionate impact on blacks, who make up 55 percent of 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Baugh argues, the program makes black defendants face  
mostly white juries. 
</P>
<P>
	Juries for state cases are drawn from a defendant's community,  
and jury pools in Richmond are about 75 percent black. But federal 
juries are drawn from a wider area of the state. Those jury pools 
end up being 80 to 90 percent white. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors insist neighborhood demographics have no bearing on  
the program. And, notes Assistant U.S. Attorney James B. Comey, at 
least 95 percent of Project Exile defendants plead guilty and never 
face any jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal judges also complain the program makes already  
overworked federal courts handle cases the state should be 
pursuing. In their January opinion, the three Richmond judges wrote 
that Project Exile represented ``a substantial federal incursion 
into a sovereign state's area of authority and responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to Rehnquist, Williams wrote that the federal  
court ``has been transformed into a minor grade state police court. 
More than 200 gun possession cases totally lacking in federal 
significance have been processed through our court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that, Williams says, but the program ends up hitting  
taxpayers in their wallets. During a hearing on a Project Exile 
motion, he commented that federal court-appointed attorneys are 
commonly paid $2,500 to defend suspects, compared to $350 for those 
on the state level. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Project Exile-type programs are gaining popularity  
with politicians. Last month, President Clinton praised Project 
Exile by name, and similar programs are up and running elsewhere, 
including Philadelphia; Norfolk, Va.; Rochester, N.Y.; and Oakland, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion of the concept concerns Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hear rumors that Project Exile-type programs may be  
undertaken in every major city,'' he wrote Rehnquist. ``I call this 
to your attention because it will have a serious impact on budget 
needs in the future.''

	Russia Continues Work on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Seeking to map out a strategy to  
ending the Kosovo conflict, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin met 
in Moscow today with Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and other top 
government officials. Chernomyrdin said after the talks that 
Yugoslavia's ``sovereignty and territorial integrity'' remained 
inviolable, meaning Russia still opposes a well-armed foreign force 
in Kosovo with a strong NATO component. NATO wants Yugoslavia to 
withdraw its troops from Kosovo and let 840,000 ethnic Albanian 
refugees who have fled or been expelled from the province to return 
under the protection of an international peacekeeping force. 
Yugoslavia refuses to agree to the peacekeeping force.

	Astronauts Enter Space Station  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts swung open  
the hatches of the international space station tonight and floated 
into the chilly but brightly lit outpost. They were the first 
visitors in six months. Before the seven shuttle astronauts began 
opening the doors, flight controllers warned it would be 57 degrees 
in the first module, the American-made Unity. The astronauts will 
spend the next three days making repairs and deliveries to the 
240-mile-high station, vacant since December. It's bigger and far 
more tedious work than what they did earlier today during the 
second-longest spacewalk ever -- rigging cranes and other tools to 
the exterior.

	Hostages Released in Columbia  
</P>
<P>
	CALI, Colombia (AP) -- About 100 churchgoers were kidnapped by  
Leftist Colombian rebels today, but about at least 79 have been 
released. The rebels captured took the people from a Mass in an 
exclusive neighborhood and drove them into the countryside in 
trucks. The rebels belonged to the National Liberation Army, 
authorities said. However, there was no claim of responsibility. At 
least two guerrillas were killed and one rebel and two soldiers 
wounded in firefights, said an army commander said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today he  
would fire department officials for failing to act on signs China 
was stealing secrets from a U.S. nuclear weapons lab. Dismissals 
and demotions could come as early as this week, after Richardson 
receives an internal report on security lapses at the Los Alamos 
lab in New Mexico that may have contributed to China's thefts of 
U.S. nuclear secrets. Richardson said China got information on 
three nuclear warheads but there is no evidence China has used that 
information to modernize or deploy nuclear weapons.

two weeks ago, outwardly maintained an unwavering commitment to 
Israeli sovereignty over the strategic plateau, captured in the 
1967 Mideast war.

<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Archaeologists have unearthed evidence  
of a turn-of-the-century Chinatown. City records, newspaper 
accounts and fire insurance maps suggested the existence of a 
Chinese community, but no traces had been found until the 
excavations. The site was discovered as crews prepared for 
construction on a freeway extension. Excavations began in April but 
were kept secret to prevent looting. By Friday, the site was 
covered by dirt again after artifacts, including an oil lamp and 
glassware, were removed.

holes and cruised to his first PGA Tour victory today at the Kemper 
Open. Beem, who putted well all tournament, sank a 45-footer on the 
first hole, a 10-footer on the third and rattled one in from 25 on 
the fifth. By then he had a four-stroke lead, and he parred all but 
two holes the rest of the way for a 1-under-par round of 70 and a 
10-under 272 total, one shot ahead of Bradley Hughes and two-time 
champion Bill Glasson.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Spruce Up Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts wrapped up  
an eight-hour spacewalk early Sunday, outfitting the new 
international space station with cranes and tool bags needed for 
future assembly and maintenance missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts Tamara Jernigan and Dr. Daniel Barry floated back  
inside the shuttle at 6:51 a.m. EDT, reluctant to leave behind the 
spectacular view. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be telling me we're almost done?'' Barry said as the  
outing -- the only one planned for the 10-day mission -- neared an 
end. ``Wow. It feels like we just walked outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole flight is as if we blinked,'' Jernigan agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	The pair began their tasks late Saturday night. They attached a  
5-foot, extendible crane and pieces of a second crane to the 
exterior of the outpost. Future spacewalkers will use the booms to 
move large items around the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Working 240 miles above the Earth, the astronauts also hung  
three tool bags, installed two foot restraints and placed a 
glare-reducing mask over a docking target. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacewalk had been intended to last about six hours but  
lasted longer because the astronauts performed some extra tasks, 
such as covering an exposed pin and photographing the outside of 
the seven-story station. 
</P>
<P>
	There were only a few minor hiccups: Jernigan had to use extra  
tools, and extra muscle, to loosen bolts that held the second crane 
down in the shuttle, and a new communications system dropped out 
periodically. 
</P>
<P>
	With their work on the exterior of the station done, Discovery's  
astronauts were ready to turn their attention to the interior. The 
seven-member crew was scheduled to venture inside the station 
Sunday evening to begin some repairs and start transferring 3,620 
pounds of supplies into the outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will remain docked to the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space  
station until Thursday night. The shuttle is due back June 6.

<HEADLINE> Moni Maker Upset in Swedish Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Moni Maker, the 1998 Horse of the Year  
and the world's fastest trotter, was upset in the Elitloppet on 
Sunday in a race won by Remington Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Remington Crown, a Swedish-bred horse from France, received a  
perfect tactical ride from Joseph Verbeeck in one of the most 
prestigious harness races. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeeck's victory came less than two days after he was attacked  
by two bikers on the French Riviera while driving his convertible 
to his Monte Carlo home. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the second victory at Solvalla Racetrack for the French  
champion driver, who also won with Sea Cove in the 1993 Elitloppet. 
</P>
<P>
	Moni Maker, the defending champion, was the overwhelming  
favorite for the $420,000 race. But the 6-year-old mare, who gave 
American driver Wally Hennessey his first victory in this race last 
year, never made a serious charge on the final straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had planned to take the lead and then slow down the pace a  
bit,'' Verbeeck said. ``Moni Maker was not in top form today. 
Remington Crown is one of the best. I like him a lot'' 
</P>
<P>
	Remington Crown covered the mile in 1:56.8. Moni Maker was  
second, a length behind. Canadian entry Goodtimes, driven by David 
Wall, finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Remington Crown, sold to a French stable last year, also won the  
first of two qualifying heats held earlier Sunday and earned a 
total of $238,000. She now has 36 wins in 67 races. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the 18th victory for a French-owned entry in the  
Elitloppet. Sweden is second with 14 wins, followed by Italy (five) 
and the United States (four). 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeeck said he had no time to react when he was attacked  
outside Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit me in the face with baseball bats. They were trying  
to steal my car,'' he said. ``I've read about similar incidents 
recently in France. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was lucky. A taxi cab came up to the traffic lights and the  
bikers fled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeeck spent six hours at his dentist Saturday before flying  
to Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did a good job,'' he said. ``I don't look pretty now. But,  
of course, I've never been a handsome guy.''

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs Are Blowin' in the Wind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Great expectations have turned to grand despair  
for the Toronto Maple Leafs. And nobody seems to know why. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't expect we'd come back and win necessarily,'' Toronto  
coach Pat Quinn said following the Maple Leafs' embarrassing 5-2 
loss Saturday night to the Buffalo Sabres at Marine Midland Arena. 
``But I didn't expect we'd have that kind of short response. We 
kind of disintegrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That left them down 3-1 in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference  
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight game, the Maple Leafs played as though  
it were the middle of January instead of a warm night in late May, 
when visions of etching one's name on the Stanley Cup have a 
tendency to drive hockey players. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3 on Thursday night, the Sabres scored three goals in  
less than five minutes in the second period and won 4-2. Barrages 
like that rarely occur in the playoffs, let alone at this juncture. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened again Saturday in a shorter span.  
</P>
<P>
	Brian Holzinger, Rob Ray, and Geoff Sanderson scored in less  
than three minutes early in the second period as the Toronto 
defense collapsed in front of goalie Curtis Joseph. The flurry 
transformed a 1-0 game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Maple Leafs had 33 shots at Buffalo goalie Dominik  
Hasek, he was rarely tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us to every loose puck. They initiated every hit,''  
said Maple Leafs captain Mats Sundin, who scored both Toronto 
goals, the first on his second penalty shot of the playoffs. 
``Every play for the first two periods, it looked like our heads 
were somewhere else, like we were too tense to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until their uninspired play against the Sabres, the Maple Leafs  
had been the surprise team of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first round, they took advantage of the absence of  
Philadelphia star Eric Lindros, got some clutch goaltending from 
Joseph, and rallied from a 2-1 deficit to eliminate the Flyers in 
six games. They did the same to Pittsburgh in the next round with 
Penguins star Jaromir Jagr slowed by a nagging groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hasek, who makes the Sabres so dangerous, and Miroslav  
Satan, the team's leading scorer, sitting out the first two games 
of the finals with injuries, the Maple Leafs again had luck on 
their side. But they lost the opener at home, 5-4, to the Sabres, 
who relied on a goalie who had never started a playoff game to bail 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
	When both Hasek and Satan returned to the lineup for Game 3, the  
Maple Leafs' good fortune abruptly ended. Now they are one loss 
away from elimination, and the Sabres have no intention of letting 
them back into the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got to be time to go for the killer instinct,'' Holzinger  
said. ``We're going to have to go into Toronto and play like we're 
capable of playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs displayed some of their resilience in Game 2,  
scoring two goals late in the game for a 6-3 win after Buffalo had 
rallied from a three-goal deficit to trail by just one goal. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Hasek's health still questionable, they have been  
unable to test him with any regularity because of Buffalo's dogged 
checking. That will have to change for the Maple Leafs to have any 
chance of rallying again on Monday night at Air Canada Centre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing good at home,'' Sundin said. ``It's going to be  
a different story. We're going to do everything we can. If we win 
at home, we're back in the series.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Vacation Spending Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Second-grade teacher Susan Iery and her family  
plan to pack their suitcases and swimsuits to drive from 
Manchester, Ohio, to Disney World this summer on a vacation that is 
more expensive than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	An Associated Press poll suggests there are plenty more  
vacationers like her this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost one-quarter of those surveyed in an AP poll conducted by  
ICR of Media, Pa., say they expect to spend more on getaways than 
they did a year ago. About six out of 10 say they expect to spend 
as much on vacations in 1999 as in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first year we've been able to get away,'' said  
Iery, who notes her 5-year-old son is now old enough for car 
travel, their preferred way to see the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's usually the only way we go,'' she said. ``It's more  
affordable and we need a car when we get there. We like to stop and 
mosey around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strong economy was a big factor for Darroll Dawkins, a  
20-year-old junior college student from New York City. He plans to 
fly to Jamaica in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money isn't that much of a problem, it's been a good year with  
the economy,'' he said. ``Being able to save money made a lot of 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The typical American likes to vacation in the summer, travel by  
car and spend a week or less on the trip, according to the poll. 
Almost two-thirds said they expect their longest vacation this year 
to last less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I manage an office and it is difficult to take more than one  
week at a time,'' said Coleman Hart, a 51-year-old insurance 
adjuster from Cape Coral, Fla. ``I steal a day and make a long 
weekend to travel or get out on holiday weekends like Memorial 
Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Hart and his wife plan a winter cruise to the  
Caribbean, a dramatic, if expensive, way to celebrating her 
completing school. 
</P>
<P>
	About a quarter in the poll said they would spend less than $500  
on vacation; four out of 10 said they would spend between $500 and 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Summer travelers will spend an average of $213 a day for a  
family of four, according to estimates from the AAA travel service. 
That figure is $3 higher per day compared with 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-day trip to the Smoky Mountain resort town of Gatlinburg,  
Tenn., fills the bill nicely for Chris Hughes, a Bristol, Tenn., 
mother of four with another on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought a house a couple of years ago,'' she said. ``It  
seems like the finances are better for a trip this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the poll:  
</P>
<P>
	--About half said they prefer to travel in the summer, while  
almost a fourth said fall and one out of six said spring. Winter 
was the choice of 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--A majority of adults between 18 and 55 prefer summer trips. For  
those from 55 to 64, fall was almost as popular as summer. For 
those 65 and older, spring and fall were more popular for vacations 
than summer. 
</P>
<P>
	--The percentage of people taking three-week vacations increases  
steadily as they get older. 
</P>
<P>
	--Driving, 55 percent, was the most popular mode of vacation  
travel, followed by flying at 30 percent, bus travel at 3 percent, 
cruises at 3 percent and train at 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only those who made $50,000 or more preferred to fly as much as  
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The phone survey of 1,008 people was conducted May 21-25 and has  
an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Gas prices have increased in recent months, but travel officials  
say they do not expect that to have an impact on the vacation 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	They expect a very busy summer vacation season, because of the  
strong economy, low unemployment and consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a big year,'' said Jack Mannix, managing  
director of travel-related services for AAA. ``There's almost a 
sense of entitlement about vacations. They feel like it's a 
learning experience, time to be with family, time to rest and 
recharge batteries.''

spectacular view. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be telling me we're almost done?'' Barry said as the  
outing -- the only one planned for the 10-day mission -- neared an 
end. ``Wow. It feels like we just walked outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole flight is as if we blinked,'' Jernigan agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	The pair began their tasks late Saturday night. They attached a  
5-foot, extendible crane and pieces of a second crane to the 
exterior of the outpost. Future spacewalkers will use the booms to 
move large items around the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Working 240 miles above the Earth, the astronauts also hung  
three tool bags, installed two foot restraints and placed a 
glare-reducing mask over a docking target. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacewalk had been intended to last about six hours but  
lasted longer because the astronauts performed some extra tasks, 
such as covering an exposed pin and photographing the outside of 
the seven-story station. 
</P>
<P>
	There were only a few minor hiccups: Jernigan had to use extra  
tools, and extra muscle, to loosen bolts that held the second crane 
down in the shuttle, and a new communications system dropped out 
periodically. 
</P>
<P>
	With their work on the exterior of the station done, Discovery's  
astronauts were ready to turn their attention to the interior. The 
seven-member crew was scheduled to venture inside the station 
Sunday evening to begin some repairs and start transferring 3,620 
pounds of supplies into the outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will remain docked to the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space  
station until Thursday night. The shuttle is due back June 6.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Ponders Senate Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YULEE, Fla. (AP) -- The president and first lady wrapped up a  
quiet Florida vacation Sunday in a way only the Clintons could -- 
sitting in on a conference about progressive politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual forum sponsored by a wing of the Democratic  
Leadership Council was held at White Oak Plantation, a sprawling 
wildlife preserve where President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, 
have been relaxing since Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides to the first lady suggested that in between eying the  
giraffes, white rhinoceroses and other species at the plantation, 
she was pondering her potential bid for the Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While flying back to Washington Sunday night, the president was  
asked by reporters if Mrs. Clinton had decided whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever she's for, I'm for,'' he answered. ``I gave her  
probably what I gave everybody. You have to know, you need to know 
why you want the job. You have to be able to tell somebody in 30 
seconds. You have to be able to tell somebody in five minutes. You 
have to be able to give a 30-minute talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Clintons would vacation in New York state this  
summer, he replied, ``I'll go wherever she wants to go, from now 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent players in Democratic politics, as well as like-minded  
politicos from abroad, attended the plantation conference, which 
was closed to the press. Mrs. Clinton offered no hint at a morning 
meeting whether she had come to a decision, according to one 
attendee. 
</P>
<P>
	But a longtime adviser to the first lady said that the longer  
she waits to make an official move, the more likely it was that she 
would run. Otherwise, other potential Democratic candidates would 
be cheated of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mrs. Clinton comes back in very early June and doesn't say  
`no,' I think it's fair to assume that she's going to move 
forward,'' the adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step would be the formation of an exploratory committee  
in July to cover the costs of unofficial campaigning in New York. A 
bid for the seat in 2000 likely will cost $15 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	James Carville, who managed President Clinton's 1992 campaign,  
said on CNN's ``Late Edition'' Sunday that he expected that she 
would decide to run. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything I know and conversations I've had with any number  
of people, the first lady included, indicates to me that this is 
something that she really wants to do,'' Carville said. ``I expect 
her to mount a heck of an effective campaign.... And I expect her 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One concern has been how the first lady would handle the  
increased scrutiny she would come under once she was the candidate, 
and not just the candidate's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an interview published Sunday in The New York Times  
Magazine she said that she was prepared for such scrutiny after the 
attacks she and her family have weathered from the Whitewater 
investigation through the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has crossed my mind. But the possibility of partisan or  
political attacks does not serve as a deterrent,'' she said. ``That 
is not anything that would prevent me, after having been through 
what we've been through, from deciding to run for office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The subject of the fifth annual ``working retreat'' at White Oak  
was ``The Politics of the Third Way'' -- the term moderate Democrats 
have coined for Clinton's blend of restrained economic policies and 
liberal social agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton gave an 11 a.m. address to the group. She and the  
president were mingling with the guests after a roundtable in the 
late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Also attending the forum were Mark Penn, the president's  
pollster; Bruce Reed, the White House domestic policy adviser; DLC 
head Al From; Rep. Cal Dooley, D-Calif.; David Milband, an adviser 
to British Prime Minister Tony Blair; and Tony Giddens, director of 
the London School of Economics.

<HEADLINE> Child Abuse Bill Debated in Nevada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Adults would have to tell police if  
they witness child abuse under legislation approved by Nevada 
lawmakers Sunday. The bill was inspired by the case of a 7-year-old 
girl strangled in a casino restroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Most family member would be exempt under the bill named for  
Sherrice Iverson. The only exception would be if a parent was 
abusing a child; the other parent would be required to report it to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, if signed by the governor, would carry a maximum  
penalty of six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Strohmeyer, 19, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life  
in prison without parole for molesting and killing Sherrice in a 
Las Vegas casino restroom in 1977. The girl had been left in a 
casino arcade with her older brother while their father gambled. 
</P>
<P>
	Strohmeyer's friend, David Cash, said he saw the beginning of  
the assault but did not intervene or report it to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not be charged under Nevada law at the time.  
</P>
<P>
	At least four states have so-called Good Samaritan laws  
requiring witnesses to call police, including Vermont, 
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Minnesota.

<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Swamp set a Monmouth Park record for 1  
1-16 miles on the turf while winning the $150,000 Jersey Derby 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The time of 1:40 4-5 took two-fifths off the record set by  
Double Booked in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by John Kimmel, Swamp took command around the far turn  
and drew off to a 3 1/4-length victory, returning $3.60 as the 
favorite of a crowd of 15,805. 
</P>
<P>
	``Around the far turn he just dropped his head and took off,''  
said winning rider Richard Migliore. ``This is a serious race 
horse. He really impressed me today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crash Course was second, followed by Good Skate.  
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the fourth in six career for Swamp, whose  
earnings grew to $222,240.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Victims Still Coping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. (AP) -- An American flag flies at half-staff  
on what is left of Suzanne Cox's home this Memorial Day weekend. 
The flag hovers over a waist-high pile of rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars and stripes pay tribute to Ms. Cox. The 55-year-old  
was the first to be fatally injured in the deadly Oklahoma 
tornadoes a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at her home that a tornado at least a half-mile wide  
touched down and continued on a deadly path that killed 43 others 
across the state May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 800 people were injured and 8,093 homes were damaged  
or destroyed. Insured losses total at least $955 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado's trail is still visible looking north from Ms.  
Cox's home. The few patches of green are new. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new grass and leaves on the trees helps,'' said Bridge  
Creek Superintendent Terry Brown. ``It helps cover up the wounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month later, the streets have been opened and the curfews have  
ended. But this is the phase that some say is the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the crying stage,'' said Kay Norman, the Bridge Creek  
elementary principal. 
</P>
<P>
	The high school's cafeteria, which served as a morgue after the  
storms, now is home to the Small Business Administration, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency and various insurance agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Victims must deal with the officials and watch for the  
unofficial. Reported cases of fraud included contractors being paid 
by homeowners to remove debris from private property that was 
covered by government aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Little League baseball has begun in Bridge Creek. It was this  
rural community southwest of Oklahoma City that suffered the 
highest deaths per capita in the storms. Twelve people died in the 
community of 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Paulmore threw baseballs this weekend to his 15-year-old  
and 12-year-old sons behind Bridge Creek High School. Paulmore, a 
firefighter, is an assistant coach for the Firehawks, the Little 
League team. 
</P>
<P>
	He was part of the initial search teams for the living and then  
helped recover the dead that Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still hard. Some of those people who died I had breakfast  
with the day before,'' Paulmore said. ``We all know everyone around 
here.''

<HEADLINE>  Swede Wins European Song Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Swedish singer won Europe's biggest song  
contest on Sunday in Jerusalem with a performance that was a 
throwback to the 1970s and the Swedish supergroup ABBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Nilsson, who won by singing ``Take Me To Your Heaven''  
in a 1970s-style pink-and-beige pantsuit, acknowledged the song 
mimicked the harmonies and chorus of the Swedish band. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it sounds a little like ABBA,'' she said at a news  
conference after the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyricist Gert Lengstrand, who wrote the winning song along with  
Lars ``Dille'' Didricson, grabbed the microphone and quickly jumped 
to Nilsson's defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with sounding like the most popular  
group in the world,'' he said. ABBA was propelled to international 
fame after winning the Eurovision song contest in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Countries participating in the contest conducted telephone polls  
in the five minutes after the contest ended at midnight Saturday. 
Respondents may not vote for their own country. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout much of the contest, Sweden was neck-and-neck with  
Iceland's Selma, who sang an upbeat techno-influenced song, ``All 
Out of Luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Sweden's fourth win. Abba's 1974 winner, ``Waterloo,''  
provoked controversy because the band performed the song in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to a rule limiting entries to languages that are widely  
spoken in the competitor's homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the rule was lifted for the first time since 1975 and  
led to much discussion of national identity during the rehearsals 
the week before the contest. About half of the 23 entries were in 
English, the Bosnian entry was in French, and the German entry was 
in Turkish. 
</P>
<P>
	Nilsson said she believed singing lyrics in English helped her  
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I would have won if I had sung in Swedish,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultra-Orthodox Jews had threatened to disrupt the festival,  
partly because it involved dress rehearsals on the Sabbath and 
partly because it featured a return performance by Dana 
International, the transsexual who won the title for Israel last 
year in Britain singing ``Diva.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contest organizers rescheduled rehearsals to appease the  
Sabbath-observant, but International still performed.

<HEADLINE> Actor Billy Barty Injured in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Billy Barty, the diminutive actor  
whose career spans seven decades, was injured when a scooter he was 
riding flipped over and dropped him headfirst onto a concrete set 
of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Barty, 74, was leaving an outdoor stage after performing at the  
Garden Grove Strawberry Festival when the accident happened Friday. 
His face was bruised and he suffered a fractured eye socket in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel good. I just look horrible,'' Barty said Sunday from  
his home. 
</P>
<P>
	Barty has used the motorized scooter since undergoing hip  
surgery about a month ago. The scooter apparently lost a wheel. 
Barty said he was leaving the stage ``and the next thing I knew I 
was in the ambulance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-foot-10 Barty appeared in his first Hollywood feature in  
1927 at age 3. He has played a number of outrageous characters in 
his career. Just a few of his roles include a wizard in the movie 
``Willow,'' a tongue-in-cheek stint as a German spy in ``Under the 
Rainbow'' with Chevy Chase and a suspected stalker in ``Foul 
Play.''

<HEADLINE> Colleges Offer Vietnam War Courses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- They liked Jim Blight's impression of  
Lyndon Johnson. They liked how his face drooped like a basset 
hound's, how he would adopt a Texas drawl to praise the ``brave 
boys'' in ``Vee-yet Nam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of these Brown University students was alive during  
America's misadventure in Vietnam, yet like many others of their 
generation they wanted to know so much about it. 
</P>
<P>
	So Blight, their professor, pulled out all the stops. He did his  
LBJ impersonation -- not bad for a skinny guy from Flint, Mich. He 
described his own part in the peace movement. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the spring semester's last session, he introduced Robert  
S. McNamara, an architect of the war. For the moment, the '60s came 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	When the former defense secretary acknowledged he had harbored  
doubts that the war could be won, one student argued that McNamara 
should have gone public right away with his qualms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had you spoken frankly, it seems years of war could have been  
avoided,'' said Michael Ellsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsberg was a flower-power baby. His father is Daniel Ellsberg,  
the man who leaked the Pentagon Papers, and a one-time member of 
the McNamara team who came to oppose the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Ellsberg is 22. He remembers his father telling him  
``very subtle points'' about U.S. war policy that he couldn't 
really grasp because he was too young. Now, he says, he has an avid 
interest in the war and in his father's role: ``I have a unique 
resource right in my own home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His classmate Jeffrey Dillon's father, on the other hand, has  
told him little about his time in Vietnam as a U.S. Marine 
machine-gunner at a base at Da Nang. He knows that his father still 
believes the United States could have won if it had used greater 
military force. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace activists ``would talk about peace and love, and then  
treat people who disagreed with them with contempt. That's 
hypocritical,'' says the senior from Brick, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wanted to know more. And he's not alone among the sons  
and daughters of the people who fought the war and fought over the 
war. Though Vietnam is a conflict many Americans would sooner 
forget, it is relived year-round in classrooms throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Just ask Blight and colleagues like Robert Brigham, a history  
professor at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., who also teaches 
about the war. ``These courses are among the most popular on 
American campuses,'' says Brigham. 
</P>
<P>
	Their parents fought, protested, fled to Canada, savored high  
draft numbers, tuned in, turned on, dropped out. Today's students 
envy their parents for having lived through the era, and they are 
fascinated by everything about it: the music, the politics, the 
sense of cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``This generation sees their parents' generation as the  
measuring stick,'' says Brigham. ``They feel that that time period 
is hanging over everything they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Levy's dad opened up about his Vietnam-era history  
when she coaxed him. He had long hair back in those days, and he 
recalls trying to sleep in his frat house while someone played 
``In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida'' on a stereo. He was, she says, probably less 
of a hippie than he looked. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Levy, 20, from Orono, Maine, overheard her parents talk  
about her father's fear of being drafted when his college deferment 
expired upon graduation. His luck held, and he was never called to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Quang Do's father also escaped the war.  
</P>
<P>
	He moved from South Vietnam to California in 1968 to study  
engineering and joined a group of other South Vietnamese students 
who protested the war. It was up to the Vietnamese to choose their 
destiny, he believed, without interference from the United States 
or any other country. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans have a one-sided view of the war -- obsessed with the  
58,000 soldiers they lost without giving much thought to the 3.8 
million Vietnamese who died, laments Quang, 21, of Rancho Palos 
Verdes, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	A fan of the Beatles' ``Abbey Road'' and ``White Album,'' Quang  
is certain that he would have joined the antiwar movement had he 
been in his father's shoes: ``There's no doubt in my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Thompson knows of no one in her family who fought in  
the war or protested it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew very little about the war. I knew there was a movement  
against the war in the '60s,'' says the 22-year-old from New 
Rochelle, N.Y.,'' but I didn't know why, other than the movement 
said it was immoral and unjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson admires the 1960s because it was ``a time of activism,  
when people actually cared about issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea of being involved, of not being afraid to take  
the least-traveled road'' is something that appeals to her. 
</P>
<P>
	That road was taken by her professor, Blight. He joined the  
1960s peace movement as a student at the University of Michigan. In 
1970, he was among marchers who carried a giant black coffin to the 
Ann Arbor post office to protest the fatal shooting of four 
students by the National Guard during an antiwar demonstration at 
Kent State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Blight's students signed up for his Vietnam seminar  
because they'd heard he is a lively lecturer. He doesn't 
disappoint. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get weepy. But a lot happens in 1968,'' he  
said. He told them about communist guerrillas on suicide attacks 
during the Tet Offensive, and about the assassination of Bobby 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Blight talked about Johnson's struggles to deal with mounting  
opposition to the war, and about LBJ's credibility problem among 
the ruling elite: ``He sounded like a hillbilly. He looked like a 
hillbilly. Lyndon Johnson was no Jack Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When his students ask him about his peacenik past, he is bemused  
by their fascination with the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimi Hendrix once draped the American flag around himself.  
What can that possibly mean to this generation?'' asks Blight, a 
professor of international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, the relevance of Vietnam hit home to some students when  
McNamara lectured. He told the class that some of the same mistakes 
made by the United States during the Vietnam War are being repeated 
in NATO's war with Serbia.
