<HEADLINE> IOC Irritated by Transportation Mess in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) is getting irritated by the mess in transportation
as well as late delivery of information into the computers,
spokesman of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG)
confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have got complains about the transportation and technology
problems, but it was not a matter of criticism from IOC, we take
them as advice at the daily session of our ACOG and IOC
coordinating committee," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Dick Pound, IOC vice president, said on Sunday the Atlanta
organizers were told "to fix the transport. Nobody ever believes
it will be as difficult as it is. Now they believe it."
</P>
<P>
Walid Al Awazen of Jordan, a medal contender in the judo
tournament, was delayed for hours in transportation to the
competition venue which resulted in his disqualification.
</P>
<P>
Several other cases were also reported in the first two day
competition either due to wrong informantion or delay in
transportation.
</P>
<P>
About 50 shuttle bus drivers have quitted after complaining of
exhaustion and insufficient training as many a driver didn't know
the routes to the competition venues.
</P>
<P>
The mess in transportation has forced the ACOG to "take
flexible measures to get athletes to and through very quickly,"
the spokesman said at the morning press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ACOG has been discussing issue of partial
closure of streets with the municipal government in order to
improve the transportation situation.
</P>
<P>
"We have 600,000 more people here for the Olympic Games," the
spokesman said, promising "the issue is got to be resolved,
whatever it is."
</P>
<P>
ACOG has a working staff member of 85,000, with volunteers
being the backbone of the system, including some 2,000 from
overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Centennial Olympics is also being plagued by slow delivery
of electronic scores and other information into the IBM computer
terminals at the Main Press Center and other press working rooms.
</P>
<P>
Time and again, reporters cann't retrieve the starting lists
even after the medalists have left their competition venues.
</P>
<P>
IBM spokesman Fred McNeese said the company was working around
the clock to address the problem.

<HEADLINE> Greece Says EU Ban Unjustifiable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece said today that it considers
a EU decision banning all Greek exports of meat and dairy products
detrimental to its interests and "incomprehensible, unjustifiable,
an overreaction and harsh."
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas made the statements today,
hours before a decision is expected from the European Union's
standing veterinary committee on the future of the ban.
</P>
<P>
The EU banned all exports of live animals, meat and dairy
products from Greece earlier this month following an outbreak
of foot and mouth disease in the northern Evros region.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Reppas said, had taken the necessary measures well
before the European Union made any move. "Our aim was to ensure
the safety of public health and to illustrate that our country
respects the guidelines that govern such cases."
</P>
<P>
Greece hopes that the brussels meeting today will either lift
the ban or restrict it to exports from the affected region only.

Brussels, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) is
launching a major initiative Tuesday to encourage European
businesses to participate in the reconstruction and economic
recovery of war-torn Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
International donors, including the European Union and the

<HEADLINE> Evans Eliminated in Olympic Women's 400m Freestlye Heats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Four-time Olympic champion Janet
Evans of the United States was out of the women's 400-meter
freestyle Olympic swimming final after finishing a disappointing
ninth in the heats here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The veteran of the U.S. swimming squad, who made a big splash
in the Seoul Olympic pool in 1988 with three golds and defended
the 800-meter crown in the Barcelona Games four years ago, turned
in a slow time of 4:13.60, almost 10 full seconds off her own
world mark of 4:03.85 set in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Kielgass of Germany led the heats winners with a time
of 4:08.99.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Smith of Ireland, who claimed a gold in the women's
400-meter individual medley Saturday, was second in 4:09.00.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Dagmar Hase of Germany came in fourth, which
was enough to assure herself a berth in the final.
</P>
<P>
Claudia Poll of Costa Rica outswam Evans in the 3rd heat to
secure the chance to pocket another medal in the Olympic pool with
a clocking of 4:12.07.
</P>
<P>
Claudia, 23, grabbed the first ever Olympic gold for her tiny
Latin-Amerian country in the women's 200-meter freestyle event
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's former sole Olympic medal was a silver that
Claudia's elder sister, Silvia, had won in the same event in Seoul
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
After winning the gold Sunday, Claudia declined to talk with
the media. According to Silvia, who works for a Costa Rica radio
station, Claudia just wanted to concentrate on Monday's 400-meter
freestyle event.

<HEADLINE> SADC Leaders to Meet in Lesotho Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 12-member Southern
African Development Community (SADC) will meet in Lesotho next
month at the regional grouping's annual summit where trade,
investment, energy and food security will dominate the agenda.
</P>
<P>
A SADC spokesman told the Zimbabwe National News Agency on
Monday that the summit would, among other activities, review
implementation of the SADC programme of action, as well as
discuss major economic and political developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Protocols likely to be considered by the summit include
energy, anti-drug trafficking, transport and communications,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which is slated for August 17, comes amid hopes
that member states will agree on the finer details of a landmark
treaty establishing a SADC trade facilitation protocol, and
endorse measures to attract investment to the region.
</P>
<P>
The trade protocol, first proposed soon after SADC's
establishment in 1992, is aimed at boosting intra-regional trade
as part of a wider strategy to create a regional market with over
150 million people and a combined gross domestic product of over
15.7 billion US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
SADC ministers of trade and industry have already agreed that the
protocol would eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, and
establish mechanisms to ensure fair competition among investors in
the region and encourage free movement of capital, goods and
people.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Helps Boost Manufacturing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Those UK regions most successful
in attracting foreign investment are achieving the fastest
manufacturing growth, bucking the current national trend of
falling manufacturing output, according to a survey published
today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Business Strategies, the economic
consultancy, shows that manufacturing industry in Scotland, Wales,
the East Midlands and Northern Ireland has remained buoyant in
spite of a national slowdown in manufacturing due to weakening
exports and a build-up of stocks.
</P>
<P>
These regions have been among the most successful in capturing
substantial inward investment by overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that those regions, such as the North West,
Yorkshire region and Humberside, have been hit especially hard by
the weakness of manufacturing. They all have lower-than-average
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Neil Blake, research director of Business Strategies, said: "It
is very noticeable that all of the regions where manufacturing
output appears to be buoyant are those which have received
substantial sums of foreign direct investment."
</P>
<P>
Compared with a forecast rise of just 0.5 percent in
manufacturing output at the national level this year, the East
Midlands is expected to show a four percent improvement, largely
as a result of the contribution from the Toyota car assembly plant
in Derbyshire.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing growth in Scotland is predicted to reach 2.6
percent and 2.2 percent in wales, while Northern Ireland was on
course for a four percent rise before the setbacks to the peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> Internet Usage Growing Rapidly for Job Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Usage of the Internet for seeking
jobs in the U.S. is rapidly changing the way job hunters and
companies seek out one another, according to a national research
study released by hWT Specialized Communications.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the number of job seekers found on the net
will be doubled in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The study found that corporate recruiters have only begun to
scratch the surface of the Net's applications for their industry.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on more than 400 telephone interviews with
human resources professionals and a survey of nearly 800
job-seeking Internet users.
</P>
<P>
Although newspapers and trade publications remain the number
one medium of choice, the study found that the advantages of
Internet recruitment are substantial. The Internet reaches an
extremely large group, giving human resources personnel a broader
selection of candidates.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, contact is immediate and the Internet is
inexpensive and relatively easy-to-use.
</P>
<P>
Companies that use the Internet for recruiting report positive,
results. They fill significantly more positions per year than
non-users with.
</P>
<P>
In addition, companies using the Internet tend to fill more
higher level jobs. Recruiters looking for technical people are
especially successful when using the Internet since most of those
who surf the Net are highly knowledgeable users.
</P>
<P>
Ninety four percent of companies currently using the Internet
for recruitment intend to continue their use for that purpose in
the future, and of that number, 75 percent will increase usage in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow's future use of the Internet is expected to increase
substantially. Thirty-nine percent of Internet literate,
non-users will try it in the year ahead and 84 percent of "current
users" will increase their use of the Net, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Job seekers using the Internet are predominantly highly
educated, young males (18-34 years old) with household incomes
well above the U.S. average.
</P>
<P>
Both job seekers and human resource professionals consider job
posting sits to be the most effective means of locating career
connections on the Net, according to researchers.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMSCUS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette is due to arrive here today for talks with Syrian
officials to bolster the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. coordinator for the Middle East peace process Dennis Ross
is also due in the region for the same purpose, a visit viewed as
the U.S. continued effort to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources in Damascus, the French foreign
minister's tour of the region is aimed to boost the role played
by France and the European Union (EU) in establishing peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister's talks with Syrian officials will
focus on ways of pushing forward the Middle East peace process,
working out a mechanism for the work of the ceasefire-monitoring
commission in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The French ties with both Syria and Lebanon, consolidation of
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and preparations for French
President Jacques Chirac's upcoming visit to both Syria and
Lebanon are also expected to be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Syrian capital said that Ross will convey to
Syrian President Hafez Assad a message from his U.S. counterpart
Bill Clinton to the effect that the Clinton administration is
committed to the peace process and the Madrid Conference
principles, and that the U.S. will continue to act as a mediator.

<P>
Ross will also brief the Syrian President on the outcome of the
recent talks held by Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Natanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Secretary General of the Arab League (AL) Esmat
Abdul Meguid will arrive in the Syrian capital next Thursday to
consolidate inter-Arab relations and to secure Arab solidarity so
as to counter the Israeli leader's intransigent position on the
peace process.

<P>
On Sunday, Assad received a message from his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarak on the latter's recent talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu.

the two countries should strengthen cooperation in maintaining
peace and stability in the region.

The bilateral trade between the two countries in 1995 recorded
1.1 billion US dollars and is expected to increase this year, said
Qian, who is also Chinese Vice Premier.
</P>
<P>
On the border negotiations between the two countries, Qian said

<HEADLINE> Pipe Bomb Found at Chicago Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Chicago police found a crude
pipe bomb in the cargo area of O'Hare International Airport Sunday
and detonated it safely by the city bomb and arson squad, local
media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was 0.6 meter long and taped over the ends. "It
didn't seem to be of such a magnitude that would have caused us
great concern," Chicago police Commander John Kennedy was quoted
by the United Press International as saying. Investigators
attempted to detonate the device twice before succeeding on a
third try.
</P>
<P>
The airport was already on heightened security after several
bomb threats earlier Sunday. But the detonated device did not
appear to be related to the bomb scares.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous 911 emergency phone caller at about 9:30 a.m. said
there was a bomb on a Mexicana Airlines flight to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The flight that had just taken off from the airport for Puerto
Vallarta, Mexico, was returned to O'Hare and the passengers were
evacuated, but no explosives were found.
</P>
<P>
A second Mexicana Airlines airplane and a Delta Air Lines jet
were also searched at the airport after two separate calls
threatened their flights. Searchers did not find bombs on the
planes.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Port Authority police cleared the Delta terminal
for 45 minutes when a grenade was reported in a suitcase about 10
p.m. The device turned out to be a cigarette lighter.
</P>
<P>
The New York City Emergency Services Unit was notified and
part of the terminal was evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Airports police have been on a high state of alert since
Wednesday when a Trans World Airlines' Boeing 747 exploded minutes
after takeoff from the New York JFK International Airport, killing
all 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have not determined what caused the explosion.

<HEADLINE> UK's Treasury Minister Quits Over European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Government's policy on Europe
is not working, resigning treasury Minister David Heathcoat-Amory
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation letter, the Paymaster General said joining a
single European currency would be "disastrous", and the Government
was quilty of "equivocation" on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The resigning minister went on: "The drive to political union
in Europe is relentless and has already gone beyond what most
people regard as acceptable."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that his departure from the government will
signal an intensified campaign by Euro-sceptics to force Prime
Minister John Major to give a manifesto commitment ruling out
membership of a single currency during the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
Heathcoat-Amory is the first minister to resign from the
Government over the single currency issue, which some
Conservatives believe is in danger of splitting the party.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected John Major faces a larger reshuffle than he
wanted, thanks to Heathcoat-Amory's resignation over his refusal
to say Britain will not enter a European single currency during
the next Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, has been joined by
Michael Heseltine, the deputy Prime Minister, and Malcolm Rifkind,
the Foreign Secretary, in the battle to prevent the Conservative
Party going into the election promising to rule out a single
currency for the lifetime of the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
They are insisting that the party should fight on the
Government's White Paper policy of a promise of a referendum if a
Cabinet recommends joining a single currency.
</P>
<P>
A political commentator said that despite nearly six years of
bitter argument over Europe, John Major's government has not
previously lost a minister on this subject alone. To do so now, so
close to a general election, is embarrassing.

<HEADLINE> UK Schools Enjoy Best Teaching Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Schools in Britain lead the world
in teaching information technology, with primary and secondary
pupils having access to more computers per head than their
counterparts in any of the G7 group of leading industrialised
countries, according to a study published today.
</P>
<P>
The study, commissioned by Research Machines, a leading
supplier of educational technology, shows that secondary schools
in Britain have more than twice as many computers per 100 pupils
as those in Germany, and are even further ahead of Japan, France
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Only Canada and the United States approach the UK ratio of one
computer to 8.5 pupils, the study says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain is the only country of the seven to have at
least one computer in every primary school.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that information technology in Britain is more
fully integrated into the curriculum than in any of the other
countries.
</P>
<P>
The study will hearten UK ministers, who have recently seen
British schools lagging in a series of international comparisons.

NEW DELHI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram today presented the maiden budget of the ruling United
Front government to the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament), the
local media reported.
</P>
<P>
In his 90-minute speech, the finance minister reported a budget
deficit of 8,924 crore rupees (about 2.51 billion US dollars) for
1996-97 (April-March).
</P>
<P>
According to the draft general budget, the government will
reduce the income tax, cut the surcharge on corporate tax from 15
percent to 7.5 percent, and increase the tax revenue by extending
service tax to sectors such as advertising and radio paging and
raising duties on items such as cigarettes and some petroleum
products.
</P>
<P>
Defense expenditure will be increased by 919 crore rupees
(about 259 million dollars) from 26,879 crore rupees (7.57 billion
dollars) in the 1995-96 budget to 27,798 crore rupees (7.83
billion dollars) for 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 792 crore rupees (223 million dollars) have been
allocated for health and 3,388 crore rupees (954 million dollars)
for education, essentially for primary education and mid-day meal
program.
</P>
<P>
After the presentation of the budget, Prime Minister H. D. Deve
Gowda told reporters that the budget fully reflected the objective
of the United Front's common minimum program and the measures
would create a climate in which everyone should feel that they
have a stake.
</P>
<P>

Narasimha Rao described the maiden budget as a "good budget which
maintains continuity from the past."
</P>
<P>

however, said budget will fuel price rise, unemployment and it was

ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- World record holder in the women's
100-meter backstroke He Cihong of China on Monday failed to book
herself a berth in the final in her speciality.
</P>
<P>
He, 21, the double world champion in the 100m and 200m
backstroke events, couldn't find her form and clocked a modest
1:05.87, 5.71 seconds behind her own world mark set at the Rome

losing the chance to pursue her first Olympic gold in the women's
100 backstroke.

Chen, 17, qualified for the final, finishing sixth in the heats
at 1:02.62.

to several wrong alarming-bell harrasement in the village
recently. "some swimmers can't adjust themself to the time
difference, and the long trip is quite tough for us."

However, He, the gold medalist in the World Military Games,
still has the opportunity in the 200m back event which will be
held on Thursday.

<P>
LAGOS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- China and Nigeria have enjoyed
smooth development in bilateral relations, especially in the
field of trade and economic cooperation, the Chinese ambassador

Association.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, the visits of Nigeria's first lady and

since the second half of last year have promoted the development
of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
As a result, trade between China and Nigeria in 1995 reached

million Dollars for 1994. Nigeria's export to China jumped to

of its leading seaports. Large-scale cooperation in power
generation and metallurgical industry is also expected to begin

<HEADLINE> UNRWA Headquarters to Be Moved to Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine refugees in the Near East will
move its headquarters from Vienna to the Gaza Strip in August, the
Jerusalem Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hansen, Commissioner of UNRWA, told reporters in Gaza
that the official opening will take place in August. He said
that there was full co-ordination between UNRWA and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in various sectors. He gave
the example of a hospital that UNRWA is in the process of
building.
</P>
<P>
"We are involved in extensive discussions with the PNA to find
a way by which they can take over the administration at some
future point," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the local authorities could find a way of
running their services in a more efficient way, UNRWA would be
ready to help.
</P>
<P>
Hansen explained that the relocation of the UNRWA headquarters
to Gaza was in response to a call by the U.N. General Assembly to
shift the agency to the field of operations proper as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"In July 1994, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
announced that UNRWA headquarters would be shifted to Gaza as
part of the support extended by the United Nations to the peace
process," Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
The present UNRWA offices consist of the Commissioner's Office,
the Office for External Relations, the Legal Office and the
Office for Human and Material Resources.
</P>
<P>
By moving its headquarters from Vienna to Gaza, UNRWA expects
to save large sums of money. This is especially important as UNRWA
expects a large deficit in its 1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for UNRWA to move its headquarters in
its 47-year-old history. In 1978, owing to the unstable
conditions in Lebanon, UNRWA moved its headquarters to Vienna,
where it has remained for the past 18 years.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, UNRWA has funded the construction of 20
schools in Gaza to accommodate the children of the refugees, and
has invested in the restoration work of over 2,000 homes in the
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA was established on December 8, 1949 in accordance to a
U.N. General Assembly decision. It draws its funds mainly from
various governments, governmental and non-governmental
organizations and private contributions.

BELGRADE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia received today Luxembourg Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign
Minister Jacques Poos, who arrived here last night for an official
visit.
</P>
<P>
The two sides has discussed an all-round cooperation,
development and ties between Yugoslavia and western European
countries, with particular interest in strengthening economic and
business ties with the European Union, a statement released by the

</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Poors also discussed the latest development of

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Daily Raps Japan for Boosting Military Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's army newspaper, the
People's Army, today criticized Japan for its efforts in
strengthening its military power over recent years.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said in a signed commentary that the Japan-U.S.
security alliance and the gradual modernization of the Japanese
defence force have revealed Japan's intention to strengthen its
military power since early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that Japan is now reforming its armed
forces, with the purpose of not only building a purely defensive
force, but also a mighty army.
</P>
<P>
As an economic power, the commentary said, Japan's final
intention is to have a higher international status in conformity
with its political and military strength.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Banks Urged to Lend More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will extend the lending
ceilings of its commercial banks to encourage them lending more to
Vietnamese businesses, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Le Van Chau, deputy governor of Vietnam's central bank, the
State Bank, was quoted by (VNA) as saying that the central bank
will also give priority to long and mid-term loans.
</P>
<P>
The move by the central bank is aimed at cutting the huge "dead
lending capital" in the commercial banks of the country, estimated
at 10,000 billion dong (nearly 1 billion U.S. dollars), VNA said.
</P>
<P>
The bank will work together with the Ministry of Finance to
regularly open treasury bill biddings and issue state bank bonds
aimed at regulating capital sources among commercial banks, the
deputy governor said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that loans given by Vietnamese banks account for
only 60 to 70 percent of their usable capital.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, some commercial banks were still yet to use
the credit ceilings set for 1996 by the State Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the commercial banks, however, do not agree. They
argued that stagnation in the capital lending market has been
caused by low lending limits set by the State Bank.
</P>
<P>
They also complained that commercial banks could not put their
idle money to use by increasing investment in businesses, as
Vietnamese laws impose limits on the proportion of bank investment
in enterprises.
</P>
<P>
VNA said it is a paradox that while large amounts of money
remains idle in banks, many businesses are badly in need of
capital to purchase advanced technical equipment for long-term
development.
</P>
<P>
At least both sides agree that the present interest rates of
bank loans are too high, averaging 21 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The current lending regulations is too harsh and complicated,
often beyond the capacity of businesses, VNA said, for instance,
to get bank loans, a business must hold at least 30 percent of its
total investment, and have enough property to mortgage.
</P>
<P>
VNA said many businesses, especially private companies, do not
fulfill bank lending regulations. At present, only 5 percent of
Vietnam's private businesses have access to bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the lending capital surplus at Vietnamese
banks is that domestic businesses have borrowed an estimated total
of 1 billion U.S. dollars from foreign banks, who offer lower
interest rates and longer repayment terms than Vietnamese banks.
</P>
<P>
By offering annual interest rates of only 7 percent, many
foreign banks are luring domestic customers away from Vietnamese
banks, and placing domestic banks in an untenable situation, VNA
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 21 (Xinhua) -- China scored their first victory
in the Olympic women's soccer tournament, beating their old rivals
Sweden 2-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two teams met in the first women's World Cup in Guangzhou
in 1991 when Sweden stopped hosts China from entering the last
four. But in last year's women's World Cup held in Sweden, China
took revenge by beating Sweden in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's match is the third encounter between the two teams at
major international competitions, the Chinese team took an upper
hand over their Swedish opponents.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team kept up most of the pressure on the Swedish
rivals but their efforts were time and again turned down by the
brave Swedish goal-keeper.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese team finally broke the deadlock at the 30th
minute when Shi Guihong beat the Swedish goal-keeper from the
right side.
</P>
<P>
Only two minutes later, Zhao Lihong consolidated China's
victory by making it 2-0 as she dribbled across the center of the
penalty box and volleyed from the left side into the upper right
corner.
</P>
<P>
In a other match played on Sunday, hosts the United States
trounced Denmark 3-0.
</P>
<P>
The American team had all the advantage over Denmark but failed
to score until later in the first half.
</P>
<P>
Tisha Venturini opened the scoring while 5 minutes later Mia
Hamm scored the second of the match to give the host team a 2-0
half time lead.
</P>
<P>
The third goal came four minutes into the second half when
Tiffeny Milbrett beat the Danish goal-keeper to wrap up the
game.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Grant 293.4 Million Dollars to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) will extend a total of 293.4
million U.S. dollars in grant and technical assistance to Egypt to
support the country's development and economic growth in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker, Egyptian Minister of
Economy Nawal el-Tatawi and Minister of State for Scientific
Research Venus Gouda signed here today three agreements for the
grant.
</P>
<P>
Under the first agreement, the USAID will extend approximately
13.4 million dollars in technical assistance to expand and enhance
technologies available to Egypt's privately-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement was signed for granting 200 million
dollars to help Egypt's privately-owned companies import equipment
and materials from the United States. The agreement is part of
the Private Sector Commodity Import Program (PRCIP), which started
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The USAID will also release 80 million dollars to support
Egypt's economic reform program under the third agreement.
</P>
<P>
Walker said at the signing ceremony that since 1992 the U.S.
government had granted 380 million dollars to support Egypt's
economic reform, which began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He added that the implementation of the economic reform program
is encouraging more U.S. businessmen to invest in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Lauding the U.S.-Egyptian economic relationship, Walker said,
"I believe these agreements demonstrate the commitment of both
governments to advancing even further our joint business
relationship."
</P>
<P>
"Assistance to the private sector will foster business
cooperation with the U.S. and provide the growth envisioned by
President (Hosni) Mubarak to assist job creation here in Egypt,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Rare Red Wolves Attack Cattle in Central Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 20 red wolves, believed to be
the last of their species living in Vietnam, have been blamed for
the death of about 300 head of cattle and buffaloes in the western
mountainous area of the central province of Quang Tri, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fir-colored wolves, named "cuonalpinus", were listed in the
World Wildlife Fund's Red Book because they face global
extinction, said the sources of the National Ecological Resource
Center.
</P>
<P>
Only a single wolf has been killed by local residents in recent
years after falling into a trap set by wild boar hunters.
</P>
<P>
A local hunter said there were about three packs of wolves
within the area, each pack containing seven to eight wolves.
</P>
<P>
He said he had witnessed spectacular raids on cattle by the red
wolf packs.
</P>
<P>
Local residents count their herds once a week or once a month,
providing an easy food source for the wolves.
</P>
<P>
The wolves appear to feel safe in the area, which might be a
possible explanation for their increasingly aggressive behavior.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Urged to Widen AIDS Control Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government has
been advised to widen its national HIV/AIDS control program
(NACP) in an attempt to cope with the epidemic throughout the
country, the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to an external review of the NACP published in
Windhoek, the Ministry of Health and Social Services and the NACP
can no longer cope with the increasingly heavy burden alone, as
the epidemic continues to progress.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the review included members from five national
and four international organizations as well as other
specialists.
</P>
<P>
There are many individuals and organizations in the
government, non-governmental and private sector that must be
called upon to play "their most appropriate and effective roles"
to complement the health sector's efforts, said the review.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that a total of 21,737 HIV infection cases
have been recorded in Namibia since 1986 and an "alarming" rate
of increase has been reported.
</P>
<P>
The review also recommended that the NACP establish a "proper
HIV/AIDS surveillance system with adequately trained personnel as
soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
While the NACP has succeeded in creating awareness of the
epidemic, the program has not effected changes in behavior, it
said, adding Namibians need more information on the scale and
impact of HIV/AIDS in their country.

</P>
<P>
During their summit meeting today, Kim said that he will

<HEADLINE> WFP Resumes Airlift Food Deliveries To Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
resumed C-130 airlift/airdrop deliveries of relief food to
southern Sudan after a 10-month suspension ordered by the Sudan
government.
</P>
<P>
The WFP regional office in Nairobi said today the resumption
has been made possible by the Sudanese government's recent
decision to authorize use of C-130 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government also made additional assurances to the
WFP that no time limit is being imposed on the relief flights.
</P>
<P>
"The operation follows the announcement last week of agreement
by the government of Sudan to allow the WFP renewed use of C-130
aircraft for relief deliveries into southern Sudan."
</P>
<P>
"In two rotations, the WFP today delivered 32 tons of food to
30,000 people in the area of Akobo, Upper Nile Province as well
as to the town of Panthou in the hard-hit Bahr El Ghazal area
where estimated 500,000 people in Bahr El Ghazal are described as
seriously hungry", WFP said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the WFP Catherine Bertini today welcomed
the move made by the Sudanese government, and appealed to the
donor community to provide sufficient food and financial
resources to ensure the success of the WFP emergency operations
in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The civil war between the Sudanese government and the rebels
of southern Sudan, which broke out in the early 1980s, has made
thousands of people in the area homeless and hungry.

<HEADLINE> Intel to Unveil Internet-Phone Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp. will unveil a free
software program today that enables users to make long-distance
telephone calls over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Such phone calls only cost as much as the local connection to
the global computer network, so that if computer telephony catches
on it could greatly affect the profits of telephone companies,
according to a report by the Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
A few people already use the Internet to make phone calls, it
said, but caller and receiver must have identical software and
sound quality is poor.
</P>
<P>
However, Intel's software is based on a standard embraced by at
least 120 companies, including Microsoft Corp., which will plug a
compatible product, NetMeeting, into its operating systems. The
new standard will allow users of different computers and different
phone software to talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
Once the technology is widespread, a user would be able to
access the directory service, click on a particular name, and
immediately initiate a call to that person. Microsoft will
distribute its similar product, NetMeeting, from its Web site in
September, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But experts also said Internet telephony also faces barriers
now. It is still plagued by delays in voice transmission, and
widespread adoption will put a big strain on the global network,
which wasn't designed for real-time applications.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, no one knows the real number of Internet users. In
the U.S., the number is estimated at anywhere from 10 million to
20 million, but only about 10 percent to 15 percent of that
number use the Internet with great frequency.

of the final. She was ninth in heats.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Evans seemed calm at the news conference after a severe
setback in her world record event.
</P>
<P>
"I'll do better in the 800m free." she said.
</P>
<P>
World's best men sprinter Alexander Popov showed her advantage
by finishing first in the men's 100m freestyle, edging his closest
rival Gary Hall of the United States, a talent from a swimming
family by 0.16 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Popov clocked 48.74 while Hall was timed 48.90 seconds.

200m butterfly heats at 1:57.77.
</P>
<P>
Denis Pankratov, the world record holder in the event, came in
fourth at 1:58.28 to enter the final. His time was 3.6 seconds off
his world mark set in Canet, France on June 14, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chinese squad suffered another heavy blow as one of their gold
hopeful He Cihong failed to move into the women's 100m back final.
</P>
<P>
"She was not in good shape since the Trials in Tianjin in
April," said coach Zhou Zhewen, "She had a infection in her in her
back and we haven't found the reason for the disease yet."
</P>
<P>
Whitney Hedgepeth of the United States finished first in the
heats of the event and is favored to take the title in this
evening's finals.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan, a teenager from Jiangsu Province, China, make the

</P>
<P>
China also kept their medal hope alive in the relay event as

<TEXT>
<P>
Gold arrived in Muscat from Qatar where he met with Qatari
Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin Jabr Al Thani, according to
reports reaching here from the Omani capital.
</P>
<P>
Gold reportedly explained to the Omani foreign minister the
position of the new Israeli government and assured him that the
Israeli government will adhere to the peace with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli is willing to continue the peace process in a
bid to reach a comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Omani minister reiterated the positions of Oman and other
Gulf Arab nations on the peace process, urging Israel to respect
the land-for-peace principle, which Netanyahu has repeatedly
rejected.
</P>
<P>
Gold's visit to Qatar and Oman with whom Israel established
trade relations is the first made by Israeli official since the
election of Benjamin Netanyahu in May.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Qatar and Oman threatened to suspend their
fledging economic ties with Israel if Netanyahu government backs
away from Middle East peace commitments.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have said they will only consider establishing
diplomatic ties with Israel once a just and comprehensive peace
is reached with the Arabs, including Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Arabs Capable of Resuming Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said here today that the Arabs are capable of resuming the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a celebration marking the 44th anniversary of the July 23,
1952 Revolution, Mubarak said in an address that Arab states have
been making great efforts to boost the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the Arab summit held in Cairo last month, noting
that it was aimed at maintaining the Arab-Israeli peace talks
"against perils which might push the region to the circle of
destruction and havoc."
</P>
<P>
The summit called on Israel to resume peace talks with the
Arabs in accordance with the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, which the Arabs have
regarded as the basis for the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs have feared that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's tough stance might jeopardize the peace process, which
started five years ago.
</P>
<P>
There has been a new hope for the resumption of peace talks
since Netanyahu's brief visit to Cairo last Thursday, when he
appeared to have somewhat softened his stance, saying that he
would honor all agreements signed with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But apparently he still refuses to fully accept the
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said in the celebration today that the main result of
Netanyahu's visit was his understanding that the importance of
security lies in its being maintained to everybody.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that development and peace are concomitant as
development could not be achieved in the absence of comprehensive
peace.
</P>
<P>
"We all stand at a crossroad but I am confident that peace
will triumph as it realizes security, counters terrorism besides
achieving development," he said.
</P>
<P>
In an implicit warning to Sudan, Mubarak demanded that other
Arab countries not give shelter or funding to Moslem militants who
are involved in terrorist operations against governments abroad.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has long accused Sudan of harboring Moslem extremists.
</P>
<P>
The president highlighted the significance of the 1952
Revolution, saying that it brought about deep changes in the
history of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The revolution, in which King Farouk's regime was overthrown,
changed Egypt from a monarchy into a republic.

Bank of Iran (CBI) announced in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reached 13,880 billion

<P>
The agricultural sector saw a growth rate of 3.7 percent while
the mining sector rose 5.3 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Marines will conduct large
military exercises on Australia's northern coastline under an
agreement between the United States and Australia, expected to be
signed this week, a U.S. Defense Department official said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 U.S. Marines from bases on the U.S. West Coast and
Okinawa, Japan, will use the remote training site on the far
northern end of Australia near Darwin to practice amphibious
assaults, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A core group of about 15 to 20 Marines will be permanently
stationed at the facility to help coordinate the maneuvers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States lost major training facilities in the West
Pacific when Clark Air Base in the Philippines was abandoned in
June 1991 and Subic Naval Base closed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It has training facilities in Japan, which, however, is densely
populated, and small in size for large-scale maneuvers. And its
sites on the South Korea peninsula are unsuitable for drilling as
it might provoke tensions on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A team of U.S. diplomats and military officials, including
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William
Perry and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili, will
travel to Sydney later this week to meet with Australian officials
and sign an accord to allow the training to begin.

JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel arrived in Botswana today for a 24-hour visit to the
country, reported the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The visit was primarily aimed to improve trade links between
Germany and the 12-member Southern African Development Community
(SADC) countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was accompanied by a delegation of German businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, Kinkel held talks in Gaborone with SADC
Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende, who briefed him on the
political and economic situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was also scheduled to meet Botswana President Ketumile
Masire later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The major issue between Botswana and Germany at the moment was
the proposed purchase by the Botswana defense force of 50
German-made Leopard tanks from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The German government was reportedly trying to block the
Botswana-Netherlands tanks deal at the request of Namibia, which
accuses Botswana of a military build-up.
</P>
<P>
Germany, as a member of the European Union, has a final say in
the reported tanks deal on condition that its arms export to

Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in East Jerusalem, Agence

of Higher Education, as saying today.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. de Charette will not go to East House. He will meet a
Palestinian delegation at the French General Consul in
Jerusalem," Ashrawi told AFP in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
De Charette began a three-day visit to the Mideast today in an

</P>
<P>
He will return to Jerusalem on Wednesday to meet with Israeli
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said that the Palestinians know the position of France
over the status of Jerusalem, and therefore the decision by France
does not make up a problem.

<P>
Israel has indicated that it would take measures to ban foreign
high-level officials from visiting East House.

PARIS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- French police in the southwest city

investigation into a bar explosion on Sunday which police said was

examining the debris of a three-story building that completely
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
When the explosion took place, the bar -- which was located at
the ground floor of the building -- was closed. The boss of the
bar said that he had received some "serious threats"after he made
a selection of his clients.
</P>
<P>
Police said that a criminal sabotage could be the cause of the
explosion since the house did not have a gas supply system.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Tehran, the capital of Iran, has
launched an 8,000 kilometer-long sewerage system for 10 million
residents, a high-ranking official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Energy Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said that the
project has a great significance because it is an economical and
job-creating project.
</P>
<P>
The system consists of two main sewers -- a 23 kilometers one
stretching from the north to south and a 24 kilometers sewer from
the east to west.
</P>
<P>
He said the sewerage system used to be viewed as an
unattainable and luxury project before the Islamic Revolution in
1979 and now the importance of the project has become known to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
At present, he added, sewerage systems were being built in 100
cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that the sewerage system would play an
important role in improving environment and in agricultural and
economic development in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
They noted that expansion of the city, increase in its
population and use of wells for absorbing waste waters have
created many problems for the capital city.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Greater Pressure on Deadbeat Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Monday asked for more pressure on deadbeat parents to pay child
support.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said if more mothers and fathers fulfilled their
responsibilities, the nation's welfare rolls would shrink.
</P>
<P>
"No one should be able to escape the responsibility of bringing
a child into this world," news reports quoted Clinton as saying in
Denver. Clinton arrived in Denver Sunday night on a three-day
Western swing.
</P>
<P>
The president told Attorney General Janet Reno to propose
legislation making it a felony to withhold support payments to a
son or daughter in another state.
</P>
<P>
He also announced a cooperative effort between states and the
U.S. Postal Service to tack "Wanted" pictures of deadbeat parents
in post offices. Similar postings would be put on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In February 1995, Clinton ordered federal employees to pay
child support they owe. Since then, he also approved measures to
allow states to track parents who owe child support across state
lines, and would require mothers to name their children's fathers
on welfare applications to obtain benefits.
</P>
<P>
The president made his proposals along with an appeal to
Congress to pass a welfare reform bill.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton's primary purpose for visiting the West was to
raise money for the Democratic Party, he also worked to win women
voters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Sunday night that his goal is to "emphasize things
that create opportunity, that call for greater responsibility" and
help parents succeed at home and at work.
</P>
<P>
Denver was the first stop on the three-day trip expected to
raise between 4.5 million dollars and 5 million dollars for the
Democratic Party, campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton
leaves later Monday for his 25th trip to California as president,
with stops in Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Approves Departure of Officials from Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Monday approved the authorized departure of U.S. government
employees and their families in Saudi Arabia, if they wish to
return home for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Nicholas Burns announced in a statement that the
approval was authorized by Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
which says all U.S. government employees working in Saudi Arabia
and their dependents have the option of returning to the United
States at the U.S. government expense.
</P>
<P>
"By this action," Burns said, "the U.S. government does not
recommend that U.S. citizens or their families depart Saudi
Arabia. The U.S. government does encourage them to take
appropriate and prudent precautions, given the security situation
in the region."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has issued two warnings in the past
month -- one on June 26 and the other on July 10 -- urging
Americans working in Saudi Arabia to "be vigilant of their
personal security" and cautioning that their might be future
attacks against U.S. targets in the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The warnings came following the June 25 truck bomb explosion at
an air base near Dhahran, killing 19 American soldiers and
injuring several hundreds of other people.
</P>
<P>
It was the second blast during several months. The first one
happened on a U.S.-run military training facility in Riyadh, the
capital of Saudi Arabia, last November, which killed five
Americans and two Indians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Saudi security forces sealed off a road in
Riyadh and removed suspicious parcels, which were found in a gap
between newly erected concrete security barriers and a high wall
surrounding a U.S. housing compound, less than 500 meters from the
site of last November's bombing, reports say.
</P>
<P>
U.S officials, who formerly perceived Saudi Arabia as being
free from violence plaguing much of the region, have been forced
to acknowledge that more attacks are possible.

LUANDA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- An envoy of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin said today he is optimistic about the recent
progress in the Angolan peace process and that Russia will
continue to support the process.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Possuvaliuk told newsmen here after meeting Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos that it is imperative to provide
assistance to Angola as its peace process has entered a "decisive

meet UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
The visit occurs when the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) have sent over 50,000 fighters
into assembly camps and a lot of them have been incorporated into
the national army according to the Lusaka peace pact signed by
the two sides in 1994.
</P>
<P>
As an observer state monitoring the Angolan peace process like
the United States and Portugal, Russia has been playing a great
role in bringing peace to Angola.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is determined to eradicate
food insecurity, Prime Minister Kintu Musoke said here today.
</P>
<P>
The food insecurity is related to under-development and
poverty, and the government of Uganda is determined to change the
situation through educating its population, Kintu said at the
opening ceremony of the National Forum on Food Strategy.
</P>
<P>
His government is doing everything possible to improve the
infrastructure, especially feeder roads to enable farmers to get
their produce to the market, Kintu added.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning and Economic Development Richard Kaijuka
gave a summary of the food strategy in a long report.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Uganda does not lack resources but
lacks an integrated national food strategy, coordination in
policy making and implementation.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-page report said agriculture needs funding through
an appropriate credit delivery system.
</P>
<P>
The forum, sponsored by the U.S. aid mission in Uganda, will
be held for two days.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Praises 'Different Tone' by Netanyahu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today that the "different tone" by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu makes it possible to resume the Middle East
peace process in a proper way.
</P>
<P>
"The different tone that the Israeli prime minister used in
Egypt has opened some doors and possibilities for progress on the
Palestinian track, in particular, along with other tracks, we are
now waiting," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the remarks by Netanyahu during his visit to Cairo
last Thursday were different from those he made previously on
other occasions.
</P>
<P>
A significant change was that Netanyahu expressed his
commitment to the framework of the 1991 Madrid peace conference as
the basis of the Arab-Israeli peace talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Mubarak during the brief visit,
Netanyahu appeared to have somewhat softened his tough stance he
had earlier expressed on the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel would honor the agreements it signed with the
Palestinians and was willing to resume talks with Syria as well as
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the peace process should resume from the point it
stopped at and should not start from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who will leave here early Tuesday morning for a visit
to the United States, said the important U.S. role as a co-sponsor
of the Mideast peace process is required now more than ever.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit is aimed at preparing for Mubarak's visit to
Washington late this month and encouraging American businessmen to
invest in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Defendant Denies Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A banker in Arkansas today
denied having ever misused his bank's money for political
contributions to the then Governor Bill Clinton, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Robert M. Hill, co-owner of the Perry County Bank, testified in
his own defense as the conspiracy and bank fraud trial against him
and partner Herby Branscum Jr. entered its sixth week in Little
Rock in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Hill and Branscum are accused of conspiring with Clinton
campaign treasurer Bruce Lindsey, now a White House counsel, to
keep the bank from filing Cash Transactions Reports with the
Internal Revenue Service after the campaign withdrew 30,000
dollars in May 1990 and 22,500 dollars in November 1990.
</P>
<P>
Federal laws requires such cash transactions of more than
10,000 dollars should be reported.
</P>
<P>
The two are also charged with misapplying bank funds to
reimburse themselves for campaign contributions made to Clinton
and other Democratic politicians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Branscum had also taken the stand to deny the charges.
</P>
<P>
Former bank president Neal Ainley, the prosecution's key
witness, said he was told by the defendants to comply with the
campaign's wishes. He said Lindsey asked him not to file reports
required by IRS whenever a bank handles cash transactions of more
than 10,000 dollars. Lindsey had denied the accusation.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Suffers Heavily in Road Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Road accidents in South
Africa caused the economy an annual loss of 10 billion Rand
(about 2.3 billion US Dollars), Transport Minister Mac Maharaj
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium on road safety in Pretoria, Maharaj
said the loss is more than half the country's annual fuel sales.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that the drivers' level of traffic
discipline was unacceptably low. There was an almost total
disregard for the law.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, about 69 percent of drivers exceeded
the speed limit in 60km/h zones, while the blood alcohol level of
47 percent of drivers and 75 percent of pedestrians killed on the
road was over the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 79 percent of vehicles maintained a following
distance of less than two seconds, and 37 percent of front seat
occupants failed to wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
Maharaj said the annual cost to the economy of road accidents
amounted to about 3.3 percent of the country's gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, damage to rural roads because of the
overloading of heavy vehicles was about 450 million Rand (about
105 million US Dollars) a year. Vehicle theft cost the country
more than 1.7 billion Rand (about 395 million US Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Evans Out of Women's 400m Free Final at Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Four-time Olympic gold medalist
Janet Evans of the United States crashed out of the women's
400-meter freestyle Olympic swimming final after finishing a
disappointing ninth in the heats here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The American veteran made a big splash in the Seoul Olympic
pool in 1988 to win three golds and she defended her 800-meter
event crown at the Barcelona Games four years later. She clocked
a really slow time of four minutes 13.60 seconds, almost 10
seconds slower than the world mark of 4:03.85 she set in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
"It was just a really fast morning race," she said, shocked by
the quick results in the heats.
</P>
<P>
"I thought 13 (4:13.00) would get in. I made a mistake in that
and I didn't go out fast enough."
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Kielgass of Germany was atop after the heats with a
time of 4:08.99.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Smith of Ireland, who claimed a gold in the women's
400-meter individual medley on Saturday, placed second at 4:09.00.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the late entry of the Irishwoman, she said:"Being
someone who always plays by the rules, I can make an analogy: in
life you're supposed to play by the rules, but life is not fair."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. swimming team had lodged a protest against Smith's
late entry.
</P>
<P>
"The United States feels she should not be in the 400 free,
because she was entered late," said Richard Quick, head coach of
the U.S. female swimming team.
</P>
<P>
The coach also explained the reason for Evans' failure:" Janet
swam a little bit too easy going out, and she made a little
mistake."
</P>
<P>
However the coach highly praised the veteran U.S. swimmer,
torch bearer at the Opening Ceremony on Friday. "She is a great
champion and that can never ever be taken away from her."
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Dagmar Hase of Germany came in fourth, which
well assured her of a berth in the final.
</P>
<P>
Claudia Poll of Costa Rica, swimming alongside with Evans in
the 3rd heat, had another medal chance for the tiny Latin American
country after placing sixth in the heat, clocking in 4:12.07.
</P>
<P>
Claudia, 23, grabbed the first Olympic gold ever for Costa Rica in
the women's 200-meter freestyle event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica's former sole Olympic medal was a silve that Claudia's
elder sister, silvia, had won in the same event in Seoul in 1988.
</P>
<P>
After winning the gold on Sunday, Claudia declined to talk with the
media. According to her Silvia, who now works for a Costa Rica radio
station, Claudia just wanted to concentrate on Monday's 400-meter
freestyle event.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Woos Iran to Make More Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has appealed to Iran, Israel's arch enemy, to come to
terms on bringing back all MIAs and POWs.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the Prime Minister's Office here
Sunday afternoon following the return of two bodies of slain
Israeli soldiers from Lebanon under a deal between Israel and
Hezbollah, Netanyahu said that Iran has been involved in the
efforts to secure the exchange agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure Iran has something to say about it. It is
obvious. There is no question about an Iranian decision to go
ahead with this particular exchange," he said.
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view we welcome all efforts that would
bring about the return to Israel the remaining MIAs and POWs," he
said. "We welcome the development. We hope that it signifies
additional information and exchange on the part of the government
of Iran at the humanitarian level."
</P>
<P>
The rightwing Likud leader said in an unprecedented
reconciliatory tone that "there can be many policy differences
between governments. Unfortunately there are many conflicts
between governments. But as we seek a better world, a world
without conflicts, we should remember that this principle of
bringing back MIAs and POWs should transcend any policy
differences."
</P>
<P>
He said that the event will hopefully mark a move toward
the return of all MIAs, adding that "there is a humanitarian
principle involved and that principle involves Geneva Convention
and the basic norms of civilized governments."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu spoke by phone to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Sunday afternoon and thanked him for his effort in returning
Israeli MIAs.

<HEADLINE> Britain Puts Forward EU Fishing Reform Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The British government has launched
a diplomatic initiative to protect the country's much-pressed
fishing fleet from what it sees as unfair competition from other
European Union (EU) member states.
</P>
<P>
Tony Baldry, agriculture minister of state, said in a written
parliamentary answer today that the government has introduced
proposals for several amendments to the bloc's founding Treaty of
Rome at the EU's Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the EU's Common Fisheries Policy, all the member states'
fishing fleets are given a specified catching quota for EU waters,
according to a report.
</P>
<P>
But the British government accused other EU countries, notably
Spanish trawlermen, of obtaining British fishing quotas by forming
British companies to buy up fishing licenses.
</P>
<P>
The action, known as "quota-hopping" has greatly infuriated
both the British fishermen and many right-wing Conservative
members of parliament, who pointed out that Britain has ceded too
much power to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Baldry said that the proposed amendments to the treaty would
allow EU member states to ensure fishing vessls to which they
gave quotas "have a real economic link" with its fishing
communities.
</P>
<P>
The government minister explained that they could do this by
requiring that a certain proportion of the crew of a vessel have
to live inside their boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Britain has repeatedly made it clear that it will not consider
the EU Commission's proposals for a 40-percent cut in the British
fishing fleet until the problem of "quota-hopping" is properly
resolved.

<HEADLINE> NP, IFP meeting to focus on political coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior National Party (NP)
and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leaders will meet in Ulundi on
Tuesday, possibly to close working relationship between the two,
the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The planned meeting, to be led by NP leader F. W. De Klerk and
IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, would take place ahead of an
Inkatha annual general conference in Ulundi at the weekend and a
NP federal congress in Cape Town next week, said the report.
</P>
<P>
However, Kwazulu/Natal provincial government premier and IFP
Chairman Frank Mdlalose dismissed speculation of an alliance with
either the NP or the African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Port Shepstone today, Mdlalose said
Inkatha would also hold a meeting with the ANC on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that the talks would be about creating
alliances, adding the meetings would be part of of the normal
political process with an emphasis on promoting peace and
tolerance in Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NP Kwazulu/Natal spokesman Pieter Van Pletzen said
in Durban that Tuesday's meeting is likely to establish "common
ground" and clear the way for effective NP participation in the
Kwazulu/Natal provincial executive committee members.
</P>
<P>
The NP also withdrew from the provincial governments of eight
of the country's nine provinces after its withdrawal from the
government of national unity on June 30.
</P>
<P>
In a response to IFP-NP alliance, ANC Kwazulu/Natal spokesman
Dumisani Makhaye said closer ties between the IFP and NP would
harm Inkatha's political image, adding "the NP is a political
hyena."
</P>
<P>
"The ANC calls on the NP to simply pull out everywhere,
including here in Kwazulu/Natal, because they are against the
concept of national unity," said Makhaye.

Trovoada was reelected as head of state of Sao Tome and Principe
in the second round of presidential elections held on Sunday, the
Angolan television reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The poll results announced by the National Election Commission

Trovoada said today in a speech that he will commit himself to
promoting stability and development in the country. But so far,
Da Costa has not yet made any comment on the election results.
</P>

Born in 1936, Trovoada once studied law in Portugal and was
one of the main founders of the Committee for the Liberation of
Sao Tome and Principe which was set up in 1960.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cases of Guinea Worm Disease Drops in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Since the national guinea worm
eradication program started in 1990 in Uganda, the number of
cases have dropped from 126,000 to 1,140 cases countrywide in the
last six months, said President Yoweri Museveni today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read for him by Minister for Information Ruhakana
Rugunda at the opening of the 4th Uganda National Guinea Worm
Eradication Day and conference, Museveni noted that this is
certainly a sign of eradication of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said since Guinea worm affects people living in areas
with no access to safe drinking water, to ensure complete
eradication, there is need to continue with provision of safe
drinking water targeting guinea worm endemic villages in the
affected districts of north and northeastern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Guinea worm eradication program is to
establish a reward system whereby anybody who reports a case of
the disease will receive a prize, which he said will enhance the
current surveillance and cases reporting so that not a single
case of Guinea worm is missed.
</P>
<P>
Uganda marks the Guinea worm annual day and conference today
and tomorrow. This is the third time to celebrate the day and
conference since its inception in 1994.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today urged passage of a bipartisan welfare reform bill that is
tough on work requirement but good to the kids.
</P>
<P>
Congress should "get together, don't be hard on kids, be tough
on work, be good to the kids," Clinton was quoted as saying by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an audience including child and family advocates in
Denver, Clinton said that if Congress approves a welfare bill that
meets the standards that he has set, he is certain it would have
the support of the American people.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Congress will pass a bipartisan bill," he said. "It
should not be a party issue. All Americans ought to want this
system changed. We can move 800,000 women and children off welfare

<P>
On Sunday, Vice President Al Gore said on CBS' "Face the
Nation" that he's hopeful the Republican-led Congress will make
White House-sought changes in a bill to fundamentally change the
nation's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
Gore stressed that "real shortcomings" could be overcome when
the House of Representatives and Senate meet to work out
differences in their two bills.
</P>
<P>
The House passed its version last Thursday and the Senate is
scheduled to complete work on its similar measure Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has vetoed two previous welfare bills sent to him,
citing provisions which he said would hurt the poor or unrelated
amendments that he found unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
This time Clinton has embraced the main tenets of the bill --
requiring welfare recipients to get jobs and giving the states
block grants so they can run the programs, though voicing
objections to some specifics.
</P>
<P>
Among White House objections are provisions that would prohibit
legal immigrants from receiving benefits, would cut off assistance
to children after their parents use up the time permitted for them
to receive benefits and would block grant food stamp funding.
</P>
<P>
Much of the nearly 60 billion dollars in savings over six years
the Republicans say will result from passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
Under the House and Senate bills, able-bodied people receiving
welfare would have two years to find a job. In most cases, a
five-year lifetime cap would be put on the length of time a person
may receive benefits.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unveils European Court Reform Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The British government unveiled
its proposals on reform of the European Court of Justice here
today, calling for necessary changes in an effort to prevent the
court from imposing excessive costs on national governments.
</P>
<P>
The proposals, published in a memorandum for discussion at the
European Union's (EU) Intergovernmental Conference, call for a
limit on the retrospective effect of European Court judgements,
according to a press report.
</P>
<P>
The British government is also demanding a limit on damages
payable by member states and the introduction of an appeals
procedure.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind was quoted by the BBC
Radio as saying today that Britain supported an effective and
independent court, but "changes are necessary both to improve the
workings of the court and to address concerns about the effects of
some of its judgements."
</P>
<P>
"Some judgements have imposed disproportionate costs on
governments and businesses where every effort had been made to
comply with EC obligations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind stressed, "We are also concerned that the European
Court of Justice's interpretation sometimes seems to go beyond
what member states intended when they made the laws. The role of
the court is to interpret existing law and not to make new law."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say that Britain has been particularly
angered by a European court opinion saying the 48-hour week goes
against EU health and safety laws and another decision forcing
Britain to pay damages to Spanish fishermen who are barred from
fishing in British waters.

ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Artem Khadzhibekov edged
out Austrian Wolfram Jr. Waibel, a world record co-holder, to win
the men's air rifle event at the Olympic Games here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Khadzhibekov, an expert in the prone rifle shooting but a
less-known in the air rifle, jumped ahead after scoring 10.6
points in the seventh shot of the final round. He hang onto his
lead to clinch Russia's second shooting title in the Games with a
total of 695.7 points, which is a new Olympic mark.
</P>
<P>
Waibel, who evened the world record of 597 points in the Munich
World Cup two months ago, garnered 695.2 points for the silver
medal.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Jean-Pierre Amat, sixth-finisher in the qualification
round, scored 10.6 and 10.4 in the last two shots to lift the
bronze with a total of 693.1.
</P>
<P>
Rob Harbison, who finished second in the qualification, two
points away from leader Waibel, tumbled to seventh after getting a
poor 8.4 points in the last shot.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Khadzhibekov, who was the first one to pull the
trigger among the eight finalists for most of the final 10 shots,
said he didn't mean to pressure on his rivals with a style
reminicent of fast-shooting western cowboys.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't my strategy," he said through interpreter. "I was
just trained like this."
</P>
<P>
The Russian believed he would overtake Waibel in the final.
</P>
<P>
"I lost concentration in the qualification round." he said.
"But I stopped thinking other things in the final and I was sure
that the turning point like the seventh shot would come at last."
</P>
<P>
Waibel blamed his defeat on loss of nerve. "I have a lot of
problems through the final round. I just kept shaking."

<HEADLINE> IFOR Prevents Muslim Attack on Serb Grave-Diggers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Peace Implementation Force (IFOR)
troops have prevented a group of Muslims from attacking Serbs who
were exhuming the graves of Serb soldiers killed in northern
Bosnia, an IFOR spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Swedish IFOR troops intervened Sunday when about 200 Muslims
gathered in Stog near Doboj in northern Bosnia, IFOR spokesman
Major Brett Boudreau said at a press conference in Sarajevo, the
Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims were "hostile and armed with sticks and stones,"
Boudreau said, adding that the intervention was necessary because
the local Muslim-Croat federation police had done very little to
disperse the angry mob.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman of the U.N. police, at whose
request the IFOR intervened, also told the press that "local
police didn't try to control the crowd."
</P>
<P>
"Exhumations of battlefield graves began Sunday morning and 20
bodies were located when the process was interrupted at 2 p.m. by
200 Muslims," Tanjug quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs, including pathologists from Doboj, exhumed 10
bodies. Another 10 were found but were not moved due to the mob
threat, Ivanko said.
</P>
<P>
In line with an earlier agreement, the Serbs escorted by U.N.
police monitors crossed over into the territory of the
Muslim-Croat federation to exhume the graves.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Naim Suleymanoglu of Turkey lifted
a world record weight of 335 kilograms to take his third
consecutive Olynmpic title in weightlifting here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish strongman snatched 147.5 and jerked 187.5, beating
his long time rival Valerios Leonidis of Greece to the second by
2.5 kilograms in the 64-kg category.
</P>
<P>
China's Xiao Jiangang finished third at 322.5, with 145 in
snatch and 177.5 in jerk.
</P>
<P>
Suleymanglu, who made his Olympic debut in Seoul 12 years ago,
had stable lifts in today's competitions.
</P>
<P>
After making 145 kgs and missing the second try, Suleymanoglu
succeeded in his third lift of 147.5.
</P>
<P>
Leonidis, who had the jerk world record of 183 kgs in hands,
snatched 145 kgs in the second trial.
</P>
<P>
The clean and jerk competition witnessed a neck-to-neck fight
between the two, who had the identical weight of 180 kgs in the
first lifts.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after Suleymanoglu lifted 185 kgs in the second attempt
for a new world record, Leonidis, who enjoyed the bodyweight
advantage over Suleymanoglu, also succeeded in his second lift at
187.5, tying the total at 332.5 kgs. With the lift, Leonidis set a
new world record in the jerk.
</P>
<P>
Suleymanoglu, who had collected 22 gold medals at the world
championships, tried his third attempt at 187.5, and lifted the
bar for his third Olympic gold medal and a new world record in the
total.
</P>
<P>
With little room to go but adding the bar for the gold,
Leonidis tried 190 kgs in the third and last attempt, but he had a
bad lift.
</P>
<P>
"I have never lifted 190 kilograms in competition before," said
the red-eyeed Leonidis after the competition. "I just want to do
my best and win an Olympic gold for my country."
</P>
<P>
Suleymanoglu, with the victory, has made him the greatest
weightlifter in history, becoming the first with three Olympic
weightlifting titles in hand.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish hercules, who harbored an idea of retirement after
Atlanta at the last World Championships, said that he may continue
in the sport, which makes him one of the richest and the biggest
stars in his country.
</P>
<P>
According to Turkish reports, Suleymanoglu has got a dozen of
houses and cars from the Turkish government for his achievements at
the Olympic Games and the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Suleymanoglu, begining his weightlifting career at the age of
11, said: "I will continue to lift, but I don't know whether I
could take part in the next Olympic Games or not."
</P>
<P>
If he returns to the Olympics in Sydney, he would make another
record, becoming one of the oldest Olympians in weightlifting at
the age of 33.
</P>
<P>
After three day competitions, Turkey led the weightlifting medal
table with two golds, China was second at one.

<HEADLINE> UN Agency Resumes Food Airdrops to Southern Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program
(WFP), the lead U.N. agency in the global anti-hunger fight, has
resumed C-130 airlift/airdrop deliveries of relief food to hungry
people in southern Sudan for the first time in 10 months, a U.N.
spokeswoman announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The operation followed the announcement last week of agreement
by the government of Sudan to allow the WFP's renewed use of C-130
aircraft for relief deliveries into southern Sudan, according to
spokeswoman Sylvana Foa.
</P>
<P>
In two rotations, the WFP today delivered 32 tons of food to
30,000 people in southern Sudan. An estimated 500,000 people in
the area are described as seriously hungry, according to the WFP.
</P>
<P>
Use of the C-130 will enable the WFP to more than double the
amount of food aid currently supplied by smaller aircraft to
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Large quantities of relief food are urgently needed in southern
Sudan as June, July and August mark the "hunger gap" period when
local food stocks are at their lowest and farmers await the
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains make dirt airstrips unsuitable for landing and
overland transport is rendered virtually impossible. Airdrops are
often the only means available to the WFP to deliver food to
thousands of people, the WFP said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- More and more Canadians are using
the Internet, both at work and at leisure, a new survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Some 29 percent of the 1,081 Canadian adults polled have used
the Internet at least once in the past year, up from 12 percent a
year ago, the survey commissioned by Anderson Consulting and
conducted by Gallup Canada and Goldfarb Consultants showed.
</P>
<P>
Anderson Consulting's Tom Healey attributes the increase to
greater opportunities for logging on to Internet -- both at work
and in public places such as community centers and libraries.
</P>
<P>
The numbers are another sign that the Internet has become a
viable place to do business, said Healey, whose firm helps

<HEADLINE> France Refuses to Let Austria Question Carlos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- France has refused to let Austrian
officials question Carlos "the jackle", who was arrested in
August 1994 by French agents in Sudan and is now jailed in the
Sante prison in downtown Paris.
</P>
<P>
Stefan Benner, an official at the Austrian Ministry of Justice
in Vienna, told Agence France Presse (AFP) today that Austria has
been asking France to let its judicial officials question Carlos
about his possible involvement in an terrorist attack on an
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) conference in
1975 in the Austrian capital.
</P>
<P>
The news was first reported by the Austrian daily Die Presse
today.
</P>
<P>
France told Austria that it would be useless to question
Carlos, because he would surely refuse to answer questions, said
Benner.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Austrian government also wans to know whether
it is possible to extradite Carlos or provide some evidence
against Carlos once he is put on a trial in France.
</P>
<P>
Austria does not reproach the French government for refusing
cooperations, but is curious why nothing has been heard about
Carlos for a long time, he added.
</P>
<P>
France has accused Carlos of being involved in five terrorist
attacks in France from 1974 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
In a terrorist attack on December 21, 1975 on a conference of
the OPEC in Vienna, 70 people, including 11 ministers of OPEC
countries, were taken hostage. A shootout killed three people,
including an Austrian policeman during the hostage crisis.

COLOMBO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops today

to advance towards the Mullaitivu base in the north while
encountering heavy resistance, according to a military spokesman
here this afternoon.

fire mortars at the advancing columns and the Sea Tigers kept
resisting Naval craft proceeding towards the beach ferrying
reinforcements, he said.

education -- ways through which the returned students can display
their abilities and talents to the greatest extent.
</P>
<P>

back 5,000 years. The Chinese people cherish the traditional
virtues of loving their homeland and excelling at learning from

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Bank Reports Business Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC), China's largest state bank, has made substantial
progress in business expansion over the past six months due to
improved operating efficiency, according to a bank official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the bank showed that at the end of June this
year, ICBC's total income reached 109.1 billion yuan, 23.3 billion
yuan more than in the same 1995 period, with its operating profits
soaring to 3.7 billion yuan over the negative 300 million yuan
registered a year ago.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the balance of loans granted by the bank
had reached 1,512.6 billion yuan, 82 billion yuan more than at the
start of the year and 29.6 billion yuan more than in the same
period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, of the newly-added loans, 62 billion
yuan industrial working capital loans were granted to well-run and
marketable large and mid-size state enterprises in such fields as
metallurgy, petrochemicals, railways, coal and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Fixed-assets loans worth 5.2 billion yuan were granted mainly
to major state technical transformation projects; 10.8 billion
yuan were commercial capital loans granted to support the reserves
of important commodities.
</P>
<P>
During the January-June period, the bank's deposits increased
steadily, with the balance of deposits reaching 1,657.8 billion
yuan by the end of June, 155.6 billion yuan more than at the start
of the year. They accounted for 76 percent of the year's target of
increasing deposits.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, the ICBC's foreign exchange
profits totalled 260 million US dollars, making up 52 percent of
the full-year target. At the end of June, the balance of foreign
exchange loans was 8.4 billion US dollars, and the volume of
settlement and surrender of foreign exchange reached 14.7 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank issued a total of 7.03 million Peony credit
cards, with the transaction volume of the card hitting 183.5
billion yuan, accounting for 76.5 percent of the year's target.
</P>
<P>
In addition to self-operating businesses, the bank has also
obtained 49 agent lending projects worth 50 billion yuan from the
State Development Bank, and has acted as an agent for issuing 10.2
billion yuan worth of certificate treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in the first half of the year, the bank
had made great efforts to support the major state projects,
industries and large and mid-size state-run enterprises in
particular.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, the bank granted 38.5 billion yuan loans
to 40,000 state enterprises, accounting for 62 percent of the
newly-added industrial working capital loans. In order to offer
better service to state firms, it also helped 458 firms set up
settlement centers.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in the second half of the year, the bank
will continue to support the state sector by giving loan grant
priority to 300 backbone enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"As the largest state bank, the ICBC will take positive
measures in the second half to support well-run state enterprises
and such export-led industries as machinery and electronics. It
will also help boost the reform of the housing construction and
allocation system, strictly control loans for infrastructure and
appropriately increase loans to support technical transformation,"
he noted.

<HEADLINE> French Foreign Minister Ends Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- After talks with Lebanon's three
top leaders and Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz, French Foreign
Minister Herve De Charette left Beirut this afternoon for Amman
to continue his tour in the region.
</P>
<P>
At the end of talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri,
De Charette stressed identity of the two sides' view points on
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity to implement international
decisions, including U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which
calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters following the meeting with Boueiz earlier
today, the French foreign minister stressed that his country has
an "effective role" in the Middle East and it would exert efforts
to push the peace process in the region forward.
</P>
<P>
He said that France would "work and act in order to activate
the negotiating process in the region."
</P>
<P>
De Charette warned that the current dilemma of the peace
process would "encourage enemies of the peace to enhance the
violence," and called on the conflicting parties in the region to
embrace "the spirit of responsibility."
</P>
<P>
The French official said that after the formation of the
cease-fire monitoring committee, "our goal now is to establish
the consultative committee with the United States, the European
Community and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Electricity Workers Continue Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The strike by Zimbabwe Electricity
Supply Authority (ZESA) employees who are demanding a 37 percent
salary increase entered its second day here today.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of workers gathered outside the utility's head office
in the city center holding placards, chanting slogans and singing
revolutionary songs.
</P>
<P>
Workers' representatives and management were reportedly locked
in negotiations for most of the morning.
</P>
<P>
The employees, who began the strike on Monday, have rejected
management's offer of a 25 percent pay rise.
</P>
<P>
ZESA Board Chairman Solomon Tawengwa on Monday failed to
convince the employees of returning to work while negotiations
between their representatives and management continued.
</P>
<P>
ZESA employees in Harare booed Tawengwa and told him they
would continue their strike and converge outside the head office
buildings in the capital until management agreed to meet their
demands.
</P>
<P>
The workers today also threatened even more drastic action
that could impact adversely on industry and commerce unless they
were awarded a 37 percent salary increase.
</P>
<P>
Workers in many other urban centers throughout the country are
reported to have joined the strike or demonstrated in support of
their Harare colleagues.

<HEADLINE> PICC to Issue Legal Person's Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The People's Insurance Company of
China (Group), the country's first state insurance group, an
outgrowth of the People's Insurance Company of China, is planning
to issue legal person's shares for its three subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, PICC's president, said at the group's opening
ceremony held today in Beijing that the group is progressing
towards commercialization, and its three subsidiaries, which will
offer life insurance, property insurance, and re-insurance, will
become liability-limited companies.
</P>
<P>
The three companies -- the PICC Property, the PICC Life and the
PICC Reinsurance -- have been registered as liability-limited
companies and are preparing to issue the shares to domestic
corporations.
</P>
<P>
The PICC is considering having the domestic large enterprises
as its shareholders, Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
In the near future the group will not accept overseas insurance
companies as shareholders, according to a source with the PICC.
</P>
<P>
The source also predicted that the market share claimed by the
PICC, which used to be above 90 percent, will gradually shrink as
more and more domestic and overseas insurers join the field.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government has been
making efforts to help Egyptians find jobs in Arab states with the
aim of alleviating the country's unemployment problem and
increasing its overseas remittances.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Labor and Immigration Ahmed el-Amawi was quoted
today by The Egyptian Gazette as saying that the government is
keen on seeking job opportunities for Egyptians in Arab
countries, particularly the Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the past three months, his ministry managed
to find 4,361 jobs, most of which were in Libya, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of this year, the General Department for
Foreign Employment in the ministry received 1,300 applications for
working abroad, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is one of the most serious social and economic
problems besetting Egypt. The World Bank has put Egypt's
unemployment rate at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overseas remittances are the largest source of Egypt's foreign
currency income. According to official statistics, Egyptian
expatriate workers sent home 4.2 billion U.S. dollars in the
1994-95 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-premier Appeals to Fight Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- In a speech televised today from
central China's Hubei Province, Chinese Vice-premier Jiang Chunyun
warned that the flood situation there remains grave, although
water levels in the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake have begun to
fall.
</P>
<P>
"The fortification of dykes has reached the most critical
moment," said Jiang, who is also the chief of the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Residents and relief workers should still be on alert for flood
waters and continue battling the floods, he said, noting that
people should never be careless about the hazards of floods.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier, acting on authority from President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Li Peng, arrived in the province on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the vice-premier encouraged people to rely on
their courage and wit to eliminate dangerous situations.
</P>
<P>
He said the province must ensure the safety of the provincial
city of Wuhan, and safeguard the major dykes along the Yangtze and
the major production base of Jianghan Plain.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier urged people to spare no efforts in defending
till the end the major dyke sections, especially the 30-km-long
Honghu section.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters will give full support to provide needed
materials, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
People who have been courageous in their flood-relief efforts
will be honored, while those who created trouble through
carelessness will be severely punished, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang suggested that every family get life preservers in case
of new floods. He also hopes that people will work against the
clock to drain water and plant late rice crops so that a harvest
will be turned in despite the floods.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier inspected Honghu and Qianjiang on Monday, and
expressed his sympathy solicitude for the military and civilians
who have been fighting the floods.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette arrived here today on his third-leg of Middle East tour
which aims at pushing forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The French minister will hold talks with Crown Prince Hassan,
the Regent, and Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti and other senior Jordanian officials.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will focus on the latest developments in the region
in light of the May 29 Israeli elections, that brought the Likud
party to power, and France's position vis-a-vis the peace process.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, who has finished his missions in Syria and
Lebanon, will also visit Egypt, the Palestinian self-rule areas
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The French official will discuss means of pushing forward the
peace process and the role France can play in that effort in light
of the "excellent ties" France has with countries in the region,
said a statement released by the French embassy here in Amman a
few days ago.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the concerned parties ought to resume their
bilateral negotiations without preconditions and on the basis of
the earlier agreements.
</P>
<P>
It added that the minister will stress the view that all
parties of the peace process should refrain from committing "acts
that would create a fait accompli situation or seriously affect
the resumption of the peace process, especially in connection
with Jerusalem whose status is still pending the negotiations
between the concerned parties."

<P>
CAIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian cargo ship carrying 650
tons of oil sank Monday night near the southern entrance of the
Suez Canal, with some oil leaking into the water.
</P>
<P>
Seven crew members of the ship, named "Salwa 2," were rescued,
and a search was under way for another crew member, the ship's
mechanic, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The ship, which belongs to the Suez Petroleum Company for Naval
Services, sank off the port of Suez, some 130 kilometers southeast
of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made to contain the oil leakage, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Thana Kamel, Chairman of the Red Sea Ports Authority, was
quoted as saying that the ship was on its way to fuel another one
in the canal when the incident took place.
</P>
<P>
The traffic in the canal and the port of Suez was not affected,
MENA added.
</P>
<P>
Crew members said the ship sank because of heavy winds and high
waves, the Egyptian leading Arabic-language newspaper al-Akhbar
also reported today.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Dam-caused Resettlement Wins Nationwide Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Building comfortable homes for the
resettled residents of the Three Gorges Project has won widespread
support from China's central and local governments, who are
supplying funds, technology and talented individuals to aid the
effort.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Gengtian, a senior official from the Three Gorges Project
Construction Committee under the State Council, said that each of
the 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions should aid
one county (including county-level city and district), while all
of the ministries and commissions under the State Council should
play a coordinative role. Zhao is Director of Economic and
Technological Cooperation Bureau under the Committee's
Resettlement and Development Administration.
</P>
<P>
According to latest Administration statistics, the localities
and central government departments have agreed to support nearly
1,900 direct aid projects, involving a contractual capital of 3.7
billion yuan. Of the total, 620 projects have been implemented
with invested funds exceeding 800 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The river-blocking of the dam project is scheduled to be
carried out next year; the reservoir is expected to start
receiving water by 2003; and the whole project is planned to be
completed by 2009.
</P>
<P>
About one million local residents will be resettled from 21
inundated counties in Hubei and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, all the localities, based on the principle of
"mutual benefit, mutual compliment, long-term coordination and
common development," have strengthened their direct assistance to
the dam area, which is weak economically. The resettlement and
economic reconstruction are of critical significance to the entire
Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
To date, 14 provinces and municipalities have set up special
funds, totaling about 400 million yuan, to assist the resettlement
efforts, and all of the ministries and commissions have opened
special offices to deal with the work.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 large and medium-sized enterprises have entered
the area by undertaking economic cooperation in various forms with
local people.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Stresses Role of Russia in Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today stressed the important
role played by Russia in pushing forward the Arab-Israeli peace
talks as a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, before his departure on a
visit to the United States, told reporters here that the Russian
stance on the peace process is vital.
</P>
<P>
"Its role is important due to the fact that Russia is a great
country that has many contacts with Arab states," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we add the Russian role to the European and the American
ones, we would be able to push forward the peace process in the
right direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa left here for Washington to prepare for Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's visit to the U.S. late this month and
encourage American businessmen to invest in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been seeking bigger European and Russian roles in the
Mideast peace process. Moussa visited Russia earlier this month as
part of the recent efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described the meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, which took place
today, as "a step in the right direction" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also said that there have been intensive
diplomatic contacts aimed at garnering support for the
re-nomination of U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for
another term of office.
</P>

<HEADLINE> DPRK Urges U.S. to Sign Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) has again urged the United States to sign a peace
agreement to replace the existing Korean Armistice Agreement, the
official Rodong Sinmum newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has repeatedly called for the establishment of a new
peace deal between Pyongyang and Washington, saying that the
armistice agreement, which ended the three-year Korean War in
1953, is insufficient to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsular.
</P>
<P>
A peace deal between the two sides is imperative in order to
establish a new mechanism to guarantee permanent peace on the
peninsular, particularly when the north and south have signed a
joint declaration of mutual non-aggression, the paper quoted Yang
Hyong Sop, chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yang was speaking at a meeting to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the Democratic Front for the Re-unification of the
Fatherland (DFRF), set up to push for the re-unification of the
DPRK with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the development of the DFRF, he said the shortcut to
reuniting the fatherland is to unite the Korean people and to
establish a federal pan-national unified country, with neither
trying to destroy the other.
</P>
<P>
He urged all Koreans to make efforts to establish a solid
mechanism to guarantee peace on the peninsular.
</P>
<P>
Korea was divided in 1945 at the end of the the Second World
War, when the north was dominated by the Soviet Union and the
south by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Fighting erupted on the peninsular in 1950, which ended in
1953, when an armistice treaty was finally concluded between the
DPRK's People's Army and the Chinese Volunteers' Army on the one
side, and U.N. forces led by the U.S. on the other.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. still has a significant military presence in South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Breakthroughs in Reforming State Enterprises Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Li Tieying has
called on various localities to blaze new trails and make
breakthroughs in their ongoing drive to reform state-owned
enterprises and to give top priority to restructuring large
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist
Party (CPC) Central Committee and also minister of the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, made the call at a
symposium to promote the reform of large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises. The two-day symposium was concluded today
in Harbin, capital of the Heilongjiang Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior official, reform of state-owned
enterprises is entering a critical period: China has developed
correct theories, policies and principles guiding the enterprise
reform, and initial success has been achieved in exploration
efforts and a wealth of experience in the field accumulated.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's speech dealing
with enterprise reform is very important, as it systematically
explains the fundamental policies and principles for speeding up
the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The success or failure of the state enterprise reform has a
great impact on the implementation of the State-set reform and
opening-up policy, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The State Councillor said that the establishment of a modern
corporate system includes a series of key factors, including
assets formation with a diversification of property rights, a
standardized organizational setup, and scientific management.
</P>
<P>
He urged the state-owned enterprises to make breakthroughs in
the reform of the state assets administration system and to
promote the separation of government functions from those of
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he called on various localities to create better
external environments for enterprise reform.

<HEADLINE> ECE Warns of Overcapacity in Global Steel Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A world glut in crude steel is
looming at the end of the decade as consumption fails to keep pace
with the growth in supply.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes in the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe
(ECE) annual review of the global steel market.
</P>
<P>
New, innovative technology and continuing robust growth in
steel demand have led to significant plans for new steelworks in
North America and Asia, which will lead to an extra 76 million
tonnes of crude steel capacity by 1999 -- 18 million tonnes in
North America and 58 million tonnes in Asia, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Against this background of rising capacity, the only region in
the world where there has been a strong increase in demand is
Asia, particularly in the South Korea, India and China and its
Taiwan province.
</P>
<P>
But it will be difficult for these Asian economies alone to
absorb all the steel produced from the new capacity. The
situation will be compounded by 18 million tonnes of new capacity
coming on stream in North America in 1999 which will cut
U.S. imports by half.
</P>
<P>
A key factor determining the extent of oversupply in the global
steel market will be growth in China's steel consumption, the ECE
report said.
</P>
<P>
China's steel consumption grew by an annual average of 11
percent a year between 1990-1995 period. But the ECE pointed out
that China's consumption is unreliable and subject to violent
swings: it jumped from 82 million tonnes in 1992 to 122 million
tonnes in 1993, then fell to 95 million tonnes in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"In the years when steel consumption fluctuates downwards,
massive overcapacity might take place," ECE said.

<HEADLINE> US Inspection to Iraqi Ship Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has protested a recent
U.S.inspection of an Iraqi fishing ship near Al-Baker port in
southern Iraq, calling it an "aggressive action."
</P>
<P>
The fishing ship, affiliated to Albasra company, was checked
by a U.S. frigate on July 5, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the U.N. Secretary-General Butros
Butros Ghali, Iraq's permanent representative to the U.N. Nizzar
Hamdoun urged for pressure on Washington to stop such "aggressive
actions" against Iraqi civilian ships.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. actions represent a blatant challenge to the
U.N. charter and the international law, and pose a threat to the
interests of a member state of the U.N., he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi ambassador, the Iraqi ship was anchored
between Al-Baker and Khaour al-Ameek ports for repairing at the
time of U.S. inspection. No details were given.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Iraq would use its legal right to seek
compensation for the damage caused by these "provocative and
unjustified actions."
</P>
<P>
In another letter to Ghali, the Iraqi diplomat protested Iran
for alleged continuation of ceasefire violations. He said that
Iran has committed 11 violations from March 24 to July 8.
</P>
<P>
No official comment from Tehran was available here so far.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war in the 1980s. The ties
between the two foes have remained tense since the conflict ended
in 1988.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Regional Forum Meeting Ends in Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The third meeting of the ASEAN
Regional Forum (ARF) concluded here today by endorsing proposals
for realizing a three-stage goal for regional security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The three "broad stages" are the promotion of confidence
building, development of preventive diplomacy and elaboration of
approaches to conflicts.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the ARF Chairman and Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas said all ministers agreed to continue dialogue
on security perceptions within the ARF process, including that at
inter-sessional meetings (ISM), and to continue information
sharing on dialogue and other activities of the ARF participants
on the basis of the papers voluntarily submitted by participants.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, the ARF participants were further
encouraged to submit an annual defense policy statement to the
regular ARF Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) on a voluntary basis,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The participants were also encouraged to conduct exchanges
among national defense colleges, including information sharing and
personnel exchanges, and to convene meetings of heads of national
defense colleges.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also agreed that the ISM on Peacekeeping
Operations co-chaired by Canada and Malaysia continue to function
for another year to coordinate the implementation of the specific
proposals adopted at the ISM.
</P>
<P>
The participants also welcomed offers made by China and the
Philippines to co-host a confidence building meeting in Beijing in
early 1997 and by Thailand and New Zealand to co-host an ISM on
disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
The meeting welcomed the participation of India and Myanmar at
this year's ARF meeting for the first time and took note of their
express commitment to help achieve the ARF's key goals.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand,
the Philippines and Vietnam. The ministers present at the today's
meeting were from ASEAN members, their dialogue partners --
Australia, Canada, China, European Union, India, Japan, New
Zealand, Russia, South Korea, and the United States -- and four
observers -- Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN foreign ministers decided to set up the ARF in July
1993 at their 26th annual meeting in Singapore, for the purpose of
discussing security issues in the region.
</P>
<P>
The first formal meeting of the ARF was held in 1994 in
Bangkok, Thailand, and the second meeting in 1995 in Brunei.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Students Studying Abroad Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A three-day seminar on "China in
the 21st Century and the New Generation of Students Studying
Abroad" opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 Chinese students studying in England, France,
Germany, the U.S. and other countries and regions, and more than
100 students who returned to China after the completion of their
studies, attended today's event.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin met the representatives of the overseas
Chinese students group prior to the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the seminar is to offer more opportunities and
channels for the overseas Chinese students who want to serve
China's modernization process and return to their motherland, said
Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of the standing committee of China's
National People's Congress and the president of the Western
Returned Scholars Association (WRSA).
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, more than 200 scholars from both China and
abroad will discuss issues such as the transforming of state-owned
outmoded enterprises, the reform of the finance and tax system,
the establishment of a social security system and the introduction
and widespread use of high technology.
</P>
<P>
According to Weiyan, vice-minister of the State Education
Commission, since its reform and opening-up to the outside world
in 1979, China has sent a total of 250,000 students abroad, and
80,000 of them have returned.
</P>
<P>
"Sending students abroad has enlarged the cooperation and
communication between China and the outside world in various
fields, such as technology, education and trade", she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the State Education Commission will soon draft a
new plan to encourage and help students abroad return to or serve
the motherland in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuezhong, vice-minister of personnel, said that his
ministry will make every effort to create a better policy and
working condition for the returned students.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 working stations for returned students have been
set up in Shanghai, Dalian, Nanjing and elsewhere. In addition,
Nanjing and Shanghai have set up undertaking parks for returned
students to start their career and realize their dream.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, more than 300 returned scholars are now applying
for business licenses, and 168 enterprises run by returned
scholars have opened.
</P>
<P>
The WRSA, founded in 1913, is a non-governmental organization
formed voluntarily by returned scholars from Europe, America and
other countries. It is now the largest of its kind and has more
than 7,000 members in China, as well as some 300 overseas
members.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets Israeli Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
EREZ CHECKPOINT, Gaza Strip, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy here today.
</P>
<P>
The talks marked the first high-level meeting between Israeli
officials and Palestinian Authority leaders since Israeli
right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu's May 29 election win.
</P>
<P>
Levy and Arafat did not speak to reporters as they arrived for
their meeting on the Gaza side of the Erez military checkpoint
between the coastal strip and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu said he considered the
Levy-Arafat meeting important as it was aimed at setting up a
mechanism for Israel and the Palestinians to discuss how to
implement the peace agreements signed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, however, said they hoped the meeting would
also pave the way for the resumption of final status talks which
began in May but were suspended after the Israeli election.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has said that while he would send members of his
cabinet to talk to Arafat, he himself would only meet with the
Palestinian leader if it was vital for Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
But, observers here predicted that future Netanyahu-Arafat
meeting was inevitable.

<HEADLINE> China Works out New Plan to Attract Scholars Studying Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China has developed a plan to
encourage more scholars who are studying abroad to return to their
homeland or serve their country overseas.
</P>
<P>
Wei Yu, vice-minister in charge of the State Education
Commission, announced the "Spring Sunlight Plan" at the opening
ceremony of a three-day symposium to discuss China's trans-century
development and the tasks of Chinese studying abroad.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 domestic and overseas scholars will exchange
ideas on the transformation of state large- and medium-sized
enterprises, the reform of financial and taxation systems, and the
industrialization of advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
They will seek new ways and opportunities to serve the
motherland, either coming back or remaining overseas.
</P>
<P>
Once the new plan is in operation, the state will set aside
special funds for the scientific research conducted by those
returning to the motherland or coming back for short periods, Wei
said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, when Deng Xiaoping advocated sending more people
overseas to study, 250,000 did so and were funded by the state,
their employers, or paid their own way.
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of them have returned, the official said,
adding that most of them are playing an important role in
scientific research, teaching and economic management.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that for the past five years, the SEC has spent 200
million yuan (about 24 million US dollars) to assist returned
scholars. More than 5,000 of them have received funds from the SEC
so that they can start up their scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Via embassies in 17 countries, including the United States, the
SEC last year helped more than 300 outstanding scholars studying
abroad to return for short-term research work.

<HEADLINE> A White-Flag Dolphin Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A white-flag dolphin died in China
June 23 when it swam into an protective net and suffocated.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture reported today that
a medical check revealed the white-fin dolphin sustained no
injuries due to sharp weapons or electric shock.
</P>
<P>
The female dolphin was caught December 19 and put into the
Tian'erzhou Natural Reserve in a section of the Yangtze River in
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Since April, the dolphin had been in poor health and lived in
the muddy river water, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The white-flag dolphin is under state protection in China, and
is called the "panda in water" by Chinese. In the past several
years, the number of dolphins has greatly decreased, and now the
rare animal is near extinction.
</P>
<P>
China has worked to protect the animal, said a ministry
official, who noted that the country has carried out a project to
move the dolphin to safer water.
</P>
<P>
Though the experts agreed that moving it to safe water was the
best method of protection, the official admitted that the death of
the dolphin indicates that continued efforts are still necessary
to protect the animal from extinction.
</P>
<P>
He said that the change in the Yangtze River's water conditions
has greatly impaired the lives of the dolphin, and that the
country will continue with its protection efforts for the animal.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Germany's SAP Ltd. (System,
Applications and Products in Data Processing) intends to occupy
more than 30 percent share of China's client/server enterprise
application software market by 1998.
</P>
<P>
SAP is one of the world's leading providers of client/server
business application products and solutions.
</P>
<P>
Xinxiang Chen, chief representative of SAP China headquarters
in Beijing, told a news conference here today about SAP's
investment strategy in China.
</P>
<P>
SAP will invest more than 500,000 US dollars this year to set
up a center in Shanghai that will provide technology service for
users of its R/3 system, which is characterized by multi-national
language support. It uses 26 languages, including Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, and Thai.
</P>
<P>
The center is expected to begin the multi-national language
technology service within the year.
</P>
<P>
The center will provide the service for China, Japan, The
Republic of Korea and Thailand, and will help expand technology
and products exchange between SAP's headquarters in Waldorf,
Germany and the Asia-Pacific Region. It also will improve SAP's
localization in the region.
</P>
<P>
In order to help improve modernization of China's enterprises'
management, SAP has supplied its R/3 systems to the nation's
nearly 20 enterprises, covering chemical, manufacturing,
automobile, retail sales, and electronics industries.
</P>
<P>
SAP now gives priority to foreign-funded enterprises in China
to supply them with the systems, but in the future emphasis will
be placed on promotion of its products and solutions for the
country's state-owned enterprises, said Xinxiang Chen.
</P>
<P>
SAP has established long-term cooperation with some of the
country's renowned universities, which is expected to help SAP
cater to China's unique situation and to expand its business in
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- In a surprise move, the
Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army (SLA) has evacuated one of its
military posts in the Israeli self-claimed "Security Zone" in
south Lebanon, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Sidoun post is situated within the Israeli-occupied border
enclave in south Lebanon, Lebanese newspaper "Al-Watan" said,
citing security sources.
</P>
<P>
The security sources linked the move to Israel's talk about a
unilateral Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in a bid to
separate the Lebanese-Israeli track of the peace process from the
Syrian-Israeli one.
</P>
<P>
The security sources expected this move to be a prelude to
other partial Israeli withdrawals from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Several days ago, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
dismissed a complete Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, but
said he expected an Israeli withdrawal from some areas of it with
the aim of reducing casualties suffered by Israeli forces
there.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A new museum has opened in
the city of Tangshan, on display are more than 1,000 cultural
relics unearthed in the city.
</P>
<P>
Boasting a floor area of 3,768.7 square meters, the museum is
divided into four exhibition areas for the stone, pottery, bronze
and porcelain items.
</P>
<P>
Included among the relics are a bronze food container and a
tripod used for divination practices. The relics are said to have
been used in the kingdom of Guzhu, which thrived during the Spring
and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The kingdom was founded about 3,000 years ago and destroyed by
neighboring powers in the seventh century B.C., according to the
Records of History, one of the country's earliest annuls.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan, located in north China's Hebei Province, survived a
powerful earthquake 20 years ago which killed 240,000 people. The
city has now become an emerging industrial hub, and has an
abundant reserve of historical relics.

So far, the city has excavated more than 100 historic sites
that date to the Stone Age.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Erupts in Afgoe, Somalia, Killing Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- As the traditional Istunka
festival is to be ended today, inter-clan fighting erupted at the
outskirts of Afgoe between the militiamen of Abgal and those of
Murusadeh clans.
</P>
<P>
At least 3 people were killed and seven others wounded when
the Abgal clansmen reportedly attacked a farm owned by their
rivals of Murusadeh on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Abgal men said fighting followed when
Murusadeh militiamen earlier confiscated a farm occupied by three
Abgal men, killing all of them.
</P>
<P>
The confiscated farm belonged to Abdi Hosh, a close relative
of Somalia's late dictator, Major General Mohamed Siad Barre who
doesn't belong to any of the warring clans.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Murusadeh clan who declined to be named
characterized the fighting as clan arrogance based on war under
the cover of politics.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the Abgals have hijacked a Murusadeh civilian
land rover, killing two men and wounding eight others late last
week as peace negotiations over the issue had produced nothing,
but prompted the attack of the Murusadeh men on Hosh's farm.
</P>
<P>
The attack by Abgal clansmen against the Murusadeh farm Monday
seem to be a retaliatory move which might as well ignite new
fighting by the two clans over their farmland which stretch along
River Shabelle.
</P>
<P>
The two clans are believed to be the richest clans of Hawiye
tribe which toppled the late regime early in 1991.
</P>
<P>
An underground peace dialogue among politicians from both
sides in Mogadishu is continuing in an effort to curb the
fighting between their clansmen in the central regions, Mogadishu
and this new one in particular where their opposing militiamen
still remain in defense positions.
</P>
<P>
the two clans were engaged in bitter fight since December last
year when 16 people were killed and 11 others wounded in a
similar clash between militiamen of the two clans in Tihsile
village, 30 west of Afgoye last December.
</P>
<P>
A number of other villages were swept away during the fighting
which also blocked momentarily the road linking Mogadishu to
Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the two clans of Murusadeh and Abgal is
rooted back to the political difference between Ali Mahdi Mohamed
and Mohamed Qanyare Afrah which emerged in late 1994.

<HEADLINE> China Expresses Indignation over a European Resolution on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed deep
indignation over recent action by the European Parliament to adopt
a resolution on the so-called role of Taiwan in international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out in Beijing
today that the resolution was passed after being advocated by
certain parliament members using urgent resolution procedures.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, he noted, wantonly interfered in China's
internal affairs, and openly supported the Taiwan authorities'
attempt of creating "Two Chinas" and "One China, One Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan issue is entirely China's domestic affair which
allows no foreign interference," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament members who advocated the resolution
had put on an anti-China farce by trying to involve Taiwan in
certain international organizations to help realize its target
of "returning to the United Nations", the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
These attempts, which go against the historical trend and the
common aspiration of the international community, are totally
futile efforts, he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to urge the European Parliament to take effective
measures to stop the recurrence of such activities which ignored
the norms governing international relations and deliberately
undermined Sino-European friendly co-operative ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The 16 member countries of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have been
urged to fulfill their financial obligations to the sub-regional
economic union.
</P>
<P>
Funds are badly needed in the on-going restructuring of the
ECOWAS fund and secretariat, Nigeria's National Planning Minister
Ayo Ogunlade on Monday told finance ministers, those responsible
for ECOWAS affairs and top officials of Central Banks in the
sub-region attending the ECOWAS council of ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
The three-day 39th session of the council opened on Monday in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria. The restructuring of the ECOWAS fund
and secretariat is among issues on the agenda of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Ogunlade, Nigeria will continue to meet its
finance obligation to the ECOWAS secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Ogunlade's remarks, according to the out-going chairman of the
council of ministers Kwame Peprah, who is the Ghanaian Finance
Minister, had set the tone of the meeting with his appeal to
member states to pay up their dues to the organization.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Cut Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is set to agree
to cutting its tariffs substantially over a short period by
signing a regional trade protocol at the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) Council of Ministers' Meeting next
month.
</P>
<P>
The +Business Day+ paper today quoted trade and industry
adviser Maruping Kodisang as saying that South Africa had acceded
to its neighbors' demands and accepted in principle the need to
substantially reduce its tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters yesterday in Cape Town, Kodisang said
details of the protocol had to be negotiated before the meeting
in Maseru, Lesotho, on August 22.
</P>
<P>
However, this in-principle agreement would run counter to
proposals by academics and lobbyists who favored reaching
agreement on procedural issues only at the meeting, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Kodisang said members of the 12-nation SADC believed these
proposals were delaying tactics by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa has been criticized for calling for
increased access to the European markets without opening its own
to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Unlike South Africa and Mauritius, many SADC members had been
forced to reduce tariffs in terms of structural adjustment
programs, enhancing opportunities for South African
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, South Africa was under increasing pressure by
its neighbors to reduce tariffs to allow manufacturers in the
region similar opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, for example, once criticized South Africa for its
continuing trade imballance and warned that it would adopt
industrial measures to protect its own economy.
</P>
<P>
Kodisang said outstanding issues were time frames, rules of
origin and certain procedural matters, adding the tariff cuts
would be +substantial+.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean PM Calls for Measures Against "Ugly" Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime Minister Lee
Soo-sung ordered the cabinet today to take stern measures against
misdemeanors committed by Koreans during overseas travels.
</P>
<P>
Lee's order came after the recent wildlife killing in Thailand
and the plane-side sit-in at an Uzbek airport by South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
Five tourists from South Korea were arrested in Thailand
recently after police found the butchered remains of six bears in
their van during a routine check at a traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four bears' paws, along with other organs preserved in
whisky, were found when police searched the van. The bear parts
were apparently destined for the cooking pot, to serve as a
special food reputedly good for increasing strength and vitality.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over a cabinet meeting, Lee told the foreign, justice
and culture-sports ministers and other related government officials
to take punitive measures against South Koreans going abroad only
to disgrace the nation by their misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Those traveling overseas only to gamble or seek tonic food
should be given corresponding disadvantages or punished in
accordance with pertinent laws at home, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> France Vows to Bolster Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 23 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve De
Charette said here today that his country has played an "effective
role" in the Middle East and would exert more efforts to push
forward the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after meeting with his Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz in the latter's office in Beirut, the
French foreign minister reiterated that France would "work and
act in order to activate the negotiating process in the region."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the current dilemma of the peace process would
"encourage enemies of the peace to enhance the violence," calling
on the conflicting parties in the region to embrace "the spirit of
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
On his talks earlier today with Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad at
Syria's Mediterranean resort of Lattakia, the French foreign
minister announced that their discussions dealt with the
Arab-Israeli negotiations, south Lebanon and the multinational
committee in charge of monitoring cease-fire in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said President Assad reaffirmed to him Syria's support for a
continuity of the peace process and an implementation of the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said that after the formation of the cease-fire
monitoring committee, "our goal now is to establish the
consultative committee with the United States, the European
Community and Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The international consultative committee, proposed following
the end of an Israeli blitz in south Lebanon in April, is aimed
at rallying international financial supports for Lebanon's
post-war reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister reiterated his country's support
for Lebanon, underlining that "France is standing on Lebanon's
side."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz, on his part, said that De Charette's visit to Lebanon
came within the framework of "discussing the stumbling situation
of the peace process and the ways to activate this process."
</P>
<P>
He said that he had stressed to the French minister Lebanon's
adherence to the peace process based on an implementation of
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, the
French foreign minister described his talks with Syrian President
Hafez Al-Assad today as "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
He described the coincidence of his tour in the region with
another one by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator to the Middle
East peace talks, as a "very positive element."
</P>
<P>
After talks with Boueiz, De Charette went to the Beirut
Presidential Palace to meet Lebanese President Elias Hrawi.
</P>
<P>
He will also have meetings with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri and Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri before returning to the
Syrian capital this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
De Charette arrived in the Lebanese capital from Damascus this
morning on the second leg of his tour in the region, which will
also take him to Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule area.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong City Issues Floating Envelops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A sea-mail service with a
difference has been launched in a city in China's southern coastal
province of Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The Yangjiang city's post and telecommunications department has
issued over 10,000 floating envelops. They have been put into the
Pacific Ocean, 21 degrees north latitude and 112 east longitude.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that China's post and telecommunications
departments have floated stamped envelops in the sea, following
similar envelops on the land and in the air.
</P>
<P>
The envelops are known as "mother-and-son", in which the local
postal offices mail the "mother" envelops to the country's 5,000
subscribers. They then put their associated "son" envelops in cans
and cash them into the sea.
</P>
<P>
Postal sources say that in 50 years time the covers of the cans
will naturally open due to rust. People who find them are urged to
mail the envelops to the respective addresses.
</P>
<P>
The combined mother-and-son envelops are expected to become
very precious collectables.
</P>
<P>
In China, stamp and envelop collection has become one of the
most popular pastimes. The country is to host the world's largest
stamp exhibition during the 22nd Universal Postal Congress in
Beijing in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Iran Plays Role in Hezbollah-Israeli Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati has declared that Iran played a "crucial role" in
Sunday's Israel-Hezbollah swap of the bodies of two Israeli
soldiers who have been listed as missing in Lebanon since 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Iran along with Germany played a crucial role in making the
deal a success," the foreign minister was quoted as saying by
local English daily Iran News.
</P>
<P>
Velayati also confirmed that Germany's secret service chief
Bernd Schmidbauer was in Tehran recently and played an effective
role in further solidifying the relations between Iran and
Germany, the report said.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also had his role to play
for better Iran-German ties, the Iranian foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented event, Israel and Hezbollah Sunday
exchanged their prisoners and bodies of the killed under the
mediation of Germany. The deal marked the first time in five years
that Israel and Hezbollah have managed to reach an agreement on an
exchange of prisoners and bodies.
</P>
<P>
Israel returned 123 anti-Israeli combatants and sent them to
south Lebanon under the supervision of the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC). Hezbollah returned the bodies of two
Israelis killed in Lebanon 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said that in the light of growing relations between
Iran and Germany, occasional exchanges of views should be carried
out by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
If problems erupt, he added, the two countries, with mutual
cooperation, should solve them.
</P>
<P>
Germany wanted to play a significant role in the Middle
East. What Iran wanted was to bring Hezbollah of Lebanon and the
German government closer through negotiations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Velayati also said that Germany, like France, has close
relation with Iran and also expected to be active in the region
with the assistance of Iran.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Good Start of Ninth 5-Year Plan: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China has witnessed a good
beginning to its Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), with the
national economy maintaining a sound development in the first half
of this year, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, told a press conference here that during the past six
months, China has kept a fast economic growth, while further
scaling down inflation, with the balance between social demand and
supply improving.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) chalked up a 9.8 percent
increase to hit 2,975.6 billion yuan in the January-June period, a
speed rarely seen in the world, and also basically in line with
the nation's present conditions, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The retail price index and consumer price index, two indicators
measuring inflation, rose 7.1 percent and 9.2 percent,
respectively, compared to double-digit levels in the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector has received a further boost this year,
with output of summer grain increasing by 3.5 billion tons to set
a new record, and a bumper harvest of early rice within reach.
</P>
<P>
The industrial added value has kept a steady growth, climbing
13.2 percent to reach 910 billion yuan, with the product mix being
readjusted. The overall performance of state-owned enterprises has
also improved to record a slight net profit since May, in
comparison to a net loss in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen took the growth in demand of investment and consumption as
adequate in the past six months. Fixed-asset investments expanded
by 12 percent in real terms, and retail sales of consumer goods
grew by 13.2 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the moderately tight macro-economic control
policy, China has recorded a healthy budget condition so far this
year, with revenue rising 17.7 percent and expenditure increasing
by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Actual overseas investment in China totaled 19.6 billion
U.S. dollars in the past six months, up 20 percent over a year
ago, while national reserves of foreign exchanges hit a record
high of 86.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The trend of macro-economic development in the first half of
this year indicates that the country is most likely to realize its
economic goals set for this year, barring unexpected severe
natural disasters," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> 100-Meter-Long Birds' Nests on Chenpao Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- In true military fashion a
collection of swallows have built nests in a perfect line at an
army barracks in China.
</P>
<P>
Around 280 swallows have built their nests along a 100 meter
stretch of eaves at a four-storey high block at a military
barracks in Zhenbao (Chenpao) Island, in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The building, on the bank of the Wusuli River that borders
Russia, houses the swallows' nests, made of mud, lined one after
another in the white eaves.
</P>
<P>
According to the soldiers, the swallows fly to the south in
late autumn, and then the nests are occupied by sparrows. But in
spring, swallows return to win back their nests.
</P>
<P>
In summer the island is home to thousands of swallows, and the
barracks has fewer flies and insects as a result. The soldiers
love the birds and refuse to touch their nests.
</P>
<P>
Experts said it is rare for swallows to build such a long line
of nests.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Jiaohe City Ruined by Flooding, Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Urumqi, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The world famous ancient city of
Jiaohe could have been ruined by massive downpours of rain, a
leading expert has found.
</P>
<P>
Jiaohe is located 10 km northwest of Turpan City in Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region. As one of the best-preserved ancient city
ruins in the world, it has a history of more than 2000 years, and
covers an area of about 220,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Experts have always believed that the old city died after being
engulfed in flames during warfare.
</P>
<P>
But Tian Lin, a local expert on cultural relics now believes
that the explanation for the decline of Jiaohe might be wrong.
</P>
<P>
Her theory is that city dwellers fled severe flooding centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
After three years of research, Tian discovered that a large
quantity of marks, like V-shape storm cracks, which were a clear
indicator of a severe rain storm and flooding, could be seen
everywhere in the ancient city ruins.
</P>
<P>
She said that judging from the V-shape storm cracks just in
front of houses, and the sediment on the streets, the city was
never used after the flooding centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
"The precipitation destroyed the houses, and people took their
wood to other places to build their new homes", she said.
</P>
<P>
When archaeologists dug up, and checked the Jiaohe ruins, they
saw a hardened layer as thick as 20 centimeters, the obvious
result of a large precipitation. This provides more clues for
Qian's explanation.
</P>
<P>
Before her new theory, the popular explanation was that the
city had been destroyed by war-fire.
</P>
<P>
"But in fact except for a small part of the city we seldom saw
any marks of burning in the ruins", Tian said.

<HEADLINE> China's First State Insurance Group Takes Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China's first state insurance
group, the People's Insurance Company of China (Group), was
established today.
</P>
<P>
Its predecessor is the country's number one insurer, the
People's Insurance Company of China.
</P>
<P>
The newly-founded insurance group has three subsidiaries,
specializing in property, life insurance, and reinsurance. They
are PICC Property, PICC Life and PICC Reinsurance.
</P>
<P>
The overseas branches of the People's Insurance Company of
China become the group's direct affiliates, continuing with their
businesses abroad as independent economic entities.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, chairman of the PICC, said at the opening ceremony
in Beijing today that PICC, in line with international practice,
is progressing with reform towards commercialization, and its
three subsidiaries will gradually take the form of
liability-limited companies.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, deputy secretary-general of the State Council,
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, and Xie
Xuren, vice finance minister, attended the group's opening
ceremony, together with a number of officials from the ministries
under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong told the gathering that China will have more
insurance companies in the coming years. However, the state
insurance companys will still play a dominant role in the domestic
insurance market, Dai added.
</P>
<P>
The group's predecessor, the People's Insurance Company of
China, reported a remarkable business growth over the past year,
and posted a total premium income of 47.6 billion yuan in 1995, a
rise of 20.79 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China is a vast potential insurance market, and the national
premium income is expected to reach 200 billion to 250 billion
yuan by the end of this century, local observers say.
</P>
<P>
However, the maturing of the market means that the competition
will become stiffer, economic analysts pointed out.

<HEADLINE> China Markets Locally-produced Food After Weaning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China has broken the monopoly of
overseas baby food markets by marketing its first after-weaning
food.
</P>
<P>
Eastwes has gone on sale in Shanghai, the biggest metropolis in
China.
</P>
<P>
Jointly developed by the Shanghai Paediatrics Research
Institute and Shanghai Eastwes Company, the product is designed to
provide an all-round and balanced nutritional food for infants
aged three or four to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wu Shengmei, director of the institute, described the
product as the first of its kind developed by Chinese experts and
said that it will contribute tremendously to the health of infants
and babies.
</P>
<P>
The Eastwes food series includes meat powder, fish powder,
liver powder, egg and yolk powder and yolk powder, made from lean
meat, freshwater fish, animal liver, and fresh eggs.
</P>
<P>
China's infant food market is currently dominated by such
famous foreign giants as Heinz, Nestle and other brand names.
</P>
<P>
Researches have found that the average weight of Chinese
infants lags behind that of those in developed countries in Europe
and America six months after their births, though the average
weight of Chinese infants at the age of three to four months is
close to, or exceeds their European and American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the discrepancy to a lack of food
supplements.
</P>
<P>
They explained that breast milk cannot provide adequate
nutrients for infants over four months, and extra foods are
essential, such as corn, eggs, fish, liver and fresh vegetable.
</P>
<P>
Although many Chinese families are increasingly aware of the
necessity, they cannot cook foods appropriate for the infants
using corn, eggs, fish, livers and vegetable, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Int'l Cooperation in Geology, Minerals (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to intensify
international cooperation with African countries in the
development of mineral resources, according to the Ministry of
Geology and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
Africa has a number of metals and minerals urgently needed by
China, such as chromium, iron, copper, diamond, oil and gas, but
its mining industry is underdeveloped due to lack of funds,
technology and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation in mining will promote economic development of
both China and African nations, said an international co-operation
official with MGMR.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also intends to strengthen ties with Latin
American countries, and China's neighboring countries for the
joint development of minerals.
</P>
<P>
Prospecting worldwide has become one of the most important
strategies for MGMR, the official said.
</P>
<P>
To develop mineral resources in China experts suggest that the
country should improve its investment environment, work out
regulations governing the introduction of foreign funds in this
sector, and intensify cooperation with the world's major mining
and oil companies.
</P>
<P>
So far, departments from 129 countries and regions have
conducted exchanges with MGMR, 43 of which have established
cooperation relationships with the ministry. The ministry has also
made frequent contacts with more than 10 international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
In international cooperation, China's geological and mineral
resources departments have placed emphasis on foreign economic
cooperation. They have conducted negotiations and signed
agreements with nearly 100 mining and oil companies, on the
prospecting and developing of gold, diamonds, non-ferrous metals,
non-metals, oil, gas and other minerals.

<P>
During the Eighth-Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), MGMR
attracted more than 300 million US dollars of foreign funds, and
put a total investment of over 16 million US dollars overseas. In
addition, it earned over 72 million US dollars from exports, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Three companies under the ministry have rights to export
labor directly, while many provincial geological and mineral
resources bureaus have contracted international projects and
exported labor through diversified channels.
</P>
<P>
In international scientific and technological cooperation, the
ministry has expanded its cooperation with foreign partners, the
official said, adding that many researches have produced economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
At present, nearly 100 Chinese experts have taken offices in
international geological organizations. China has also introduced
talents and technology in geological prospecting, evaluation
of resources, ore extraction, smelting operations and examination
of gems, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, China sent more than 200 delegates to the 29th
International Geological Congress in Tokyo, and won the right to
host the 30th IGC, known as the "Geoscientific Olympics" among
international geological community.
</P>
<P>
The 30th IGC, scheduled to open on August 4, will attract over
6,000 delegates, both from home and abroad. Prepartions for the

<HEADLINE> Australia Says Conditions Ideal for Grain Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The international grain market
has provided favorable conditions for a boom in Australia's grain
exports, Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) Trevor
Flugge said in Sydney today, according to a press release reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
The AWB believes that the world is entering a new booming era
in the trade of grains, Flugge said at the annual conference of
the New South Wales Farmers' Association.
</P>
<P>
"This will bring with it a period characterized by prices which
are relatively higher than experienced over the last decade," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in over a decade, grain is being sold
around the world without the use of export subsidies, while the
grain prices are at a high level and the grain stocks are at a
record low," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995-96 was one of the years that saw record tight
stock situations in both food grains and feed grains, he said.
</P>
<P>
Flugge predicted that higher demand for grain and lower export
subsidies are likely to help Australian grain producers benefit
from an export boom.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Banks to Settle Unemployed Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's state bank will extend the
ceiling of its lending to some commercial banks, and give priority
to both long-term and medium-term loans in a bid to mobilise
capital in these banks, official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) quoted
the governor of the bank as saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the state bank will work together with the
Ministry of Finance to open treasury bill biddings, and issue
state bank bonds aimed at regulating capital sources among
commercial banks, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that total "dead" lending capital in commercial
banks could top 10,000 billion vnd (nearly one billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The loans given by these banks account for only between 60-70
percent of their total mobilized capital.
</P>
<P>
Those with the largest amount of dead capital at present are
industrial-commercial banks and agricultural banks while nine
commercial banks in Ho Chi Minh city are operating at a loss.
</P>
<P>
According to the commercial banks, stagnation in the capital
lending market has been caused by the low lending limit set by the
state bank.
</P>
<P>
But by the end of May, 1996, some commercial banks still have
to use the credit ceilings set by the state bank.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Wants Closer Ties with Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) --Cooperation between Beijing and
Hong Kong will gather a new impetus when Hong Kong returns to
China next year, says a vice-major of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yucheng told Xinhua that the two cities might join hands and
make full use of their advantages to greet the new century.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is in charge of local foreign trade, said the two
cities have respective advantages, and this might serve to help
promote all-round and multi-level cooperation between the two.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is China's center for politics, culture, science and
technology, and for international contacts and exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice mayor added that the capital also has an advanced
infrastructure and service industry, with its comprehensive
economic strength taking the second place in the country, only
next to that of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The unique advantages of Beijing would serve as great
attraction for investors in Hong Kong and overseas, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The "capital effect will have a great impact on Hong Kong
investors, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Hong Kong, as an international center for
finance, trade, transportation and information, might serve not
only as a channel for Beijing to absorb investment and
information, but also as a bridge to link Beijing and
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Lu commented that bilateral cooperation has enjoyed rapid
development, and by the end of June, there were over five thousand
Hong Kong-invested firms in Beijing, with an investment of 9.6
billion US dollars, accounting for 41.2 and 52.5 percent of the
city's total overseas firms and investment.
</P>
<P>
Also, Beijing has set up a dozen firms in Hong Kong, with four
of them listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, bilateral trade has reached one billion
dollars each year, with Hong Kong being one of the four largest
overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Lu stated that the advantages of the two cities are
complimentary, and in the march to the new century, Beijing will
take Hong Kong as a window for the outside world, and Hong Kong
could take advantage of the capital's unique status to expand its
domestic impact and market share.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, the two
cities are becoming closer than ever, and this will lay a sound
foundation for further cooperation, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the capital will open wider to the outside world,
accelerate its trade development and absorb more overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Lu says more Hong Kong businesses are welcome to invest in
Beijing's industries and property sectors.

<HEADLINE> Better Health for Mother and Baby Reported in Jiangsu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Better health care has produced a
dramatic effect on the survival rate of newly born babies and
their mothers in east China's Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of newborn tetanus, maternal and infant
mortality rate in the province has significantly dropped, due to
the effective work in improving the health care for both women and
children.
</P>
<P>
Among the one million newborns last year, only six suffered
tetanus. Whereas in 1978, the incidence rate of newborn tetanus
was 54 among 100,000.
</P>
<P>
Maternal and infant mortality rate has also dropped to 3.6 per
million and 2.1 percent respectively since 1990, 27.6 percent and
32.8 percent lower than five years before.
</P>
<P>
Active measures have been taken in the province to build a
grassroots health-care network for women and children, with 128
professional health-care institutions with 7,260 health care
workers by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 93.5 percent of pregnant women gave birth in
hospital, as against 53.4 percent in early 1980s. The practise
rate of new delivery methods, which are better for mother and
baby's health, reached 99.6 percent in the province.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Export Slump to Keep Thai Deficit High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Slow export growth has made it
impossible to reduce Thailand's current account deficit to the
level the government had projected, a government policy committee
has conceded.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has reported that the current account deficit
for the first half of this year was 8 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), or 35 billion baht (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) per
month.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand earlier this year set a goal of reducing
the deficit to 6.5 percent from 8.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared its intention to bring the figure
down to between 3 and 3.5 percent of GDP by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The worrying factor is, as the Central Bank believed, the trend
of growing current account deficit during the first half of this
year would continue until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports in the five months grew only 7.1 percent
from the same period of last year and are predicted to be 8
percent for the first six months, far below the 18 percent growth
target set early this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has readjusted the export growth rate for the
year from 18 percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Economic Security and Stability Policy
Committee, chaired by Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa, hope
that growth in imports will not exceed 15 percent, to reduce trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
As a measure to improve the situation, Finance Minister Bodi
Chunnananda said the ministry is considering reducing raw material
import taxes to enhance export competitiveness, as well as
strategies to reduce imports of luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Krirk-Krai Jirapaet, director-general of the
Business Economics Department, has urged Thai exporters to
increase production efficiency to compete with emerging
competitors, especially countries with cheaper labor costs which
are supplying the world markets with products similar to those of
Thailand's, such as garments and shoes.
</P>
<P>
Slow economic growth in major Thai markets is another important
factor which has caused Thailand a drop in exports, Krirk-Krai
said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that exports of agriculture products in the
first six months would be down 5 percent from last year,
agro-industry exports would grown only 4.4 percent, and industrial
products would rise only 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Exporters have urged the government to map out measures to help
reduce production costs and to issue long-term plans to develop
the country's industries.

<HEADLINE> Wind of Civilization Blowing New Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Bright and spacious rooms, neat
and well stocked bookshelves, people quietly reading books and
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
It is typical of a library in a city or university. But this
seat of learning and knowledge has been provided in a Chinese
village of just 123 households.
</P>
<P>
Located in the west of Shenzhen, one of China's special
economic zones along the southern coastal line, Xitou village has
seen its fortunes transformed by hard work.
</P>
<P>
Property collectively owned by the villagers is now worth more
than 200 million Yuan, or 24 million US dollars. Yearly income per
head is over 20,000 Yuan, or about 2,400 U.S. dollars, much higher
than in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
With their new found wealth the first thing villagers did was
to build cultural and entertainments facilities. It enabled the
villagers to spend their sparetime in a healthy and meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
They built their own library, park and also a sports stadium.
In addition films are shown more than 20 times a month at their
own village cinema, contributing more color in the small
countryside community.
</P>
<P>
The village library cost some 1.3 million Yuan, or nearly
160,000 U.S. dollars, to build. It boasts a collection of more
than 20,000 books, with facilities described as first class.
</P>
<P>
"New houses do not necessarily mean a new village," said an
official from the village, "but we strongly believe that new way
of life does mean a new beginning for our village."
</P>
<P>
It would be very easy for the newly-affluent villagers to fall
into the habits of gambling and drug taking, say village leaders.
But in Xitou village there has been experience of such anti-social
phenomena.
</P>
<P>
"We villagers in this special economic zone should not only
take the lead in the rural economic development of the nation, but
also take the lead in the rural area's progress of socialist ethics and
cultural development", the official from Xitou village said.
</P>
<P>
They have used their good fortune to make a better way of life
for the 123 households in a booming corner of China.

<HEADLINE> China to Gear Up Export Drive: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is to take
a series of measures aimed at boosting exports in the second half
of this year, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Wang Chunzheng, vice minister of the State Planning Commission,
said at a press conference in Beijing that export-oriented
enterprises will receive more export credit from the state-owned
banks to help stop a decline in exports during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
"Exporting has a significant bearing on China's economic
development and the government will make efforts to speed up
procedures of tax rebates and provide necessary loans for those
firms," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, China recorded a total foreign
trade volume of 127.24 billion U.S. dollars, of which exports
amounted for 64.1 billion U.S. dollars, 8.2 percent down from the
same period of last year, and imports reached 63.2 billion
U.S. dollars, up 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
In order to expand exports, enterprises should concentrate on
improving the quality and competitiveness of their products, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
The product mix of export-oriented firms should be readjusted,
and new markets should be created in addition to traditional
markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will adopt measures favorable to
those firms in accordance with common practices in international
trade, mainly in tax rebates and bank lending, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past two months China has already seen a gradual
acceleration in export growth.
</P>
<P>
"The overall situation of our foreign trade is good at present,
and I expect a further expansion in the second half of this year,"
Wang said.

HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Up to 4,600 km of zimbabwean
rivers are being panned for gold as a source of livelihood by
poverty-stricken peasants, according to a report prepared by the
United States Bureau of Mines.

The report said gold panning stretched along the Zambezi river
for 2,485 km, the Limpopo river for 925 km and the Save river for
1,200 km.

Up to 100,000 people including dependents were now said to be

CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A feed additive has been
developed in Australia that can reduce the amount of methane gas
emitted during livestock production.
</P>
<P>
Methane gas is one of the major greenhouse gases that trap heat
from the sun within the atmosphere and cause global warming.
</P>
<P>
At the international meeting on climate change in Geneva
earlier this month, the Australian government refused to adopt
legally binding targets of the reduction of greenhouse gas
emission.
</P>
<P>
However, its academic arm, the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) has come up with a method
to rein in greenhouse gas emitted by livestock in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a bulletin released by its Animal Health Division, CSIRO
said that methane gas released by animals into the air is a major
contributor to the climate change in the world.
</P>
<P>
The division has developed an anti-methane compound that can be
fed to or put into the stomach of livestock.
</P>
<P>
The antimethanogen, which improves digestion, does not only
reduce the amount of methane gas produced by livestock, but also
helps to increase their weight gain.
</P>
<P>
The division said in the bulletin that the compound had no
toxic effect or residue during trials on animals.
</P>
<P>
"Trials with this antimethanogen in cattle have increased live
weight gains and feed conversion rates," the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
The compound can be delivered to a wide variety of animals,
either as a feed additive or via a controlled release device put
into the stomach of livestock.
</P>
<P>
The invention would be ready for commercialization later this
year, the CSIRO said.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Securities Market Seeks Further Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, one of China's five
special economic zones, is to seize the opportunity of Hong Kong's
return to China next year.
</P>
<P>
The city is exploring more ways of listing B shares in the
island to standardize and develop its securities market, said a
local securities regulation official.
</P>
<P>
The city saw a booming stock market in the first half of 1996,
with 1.05 million investors opening accounts on the market,
lifting the total number of securities buyers to six million.
</P>
<P>
The total transaction volume surpassed 200 billion yuan during
this period, with the value of traded A shares four times the
corresponding figure of last year, B shares five times higher, and
trading in funds going up six times.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange had listed 13
percent more securities than at the early this year, with the
amount of raised capital increasing by nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the brisk market to the control of
inflation, lowered interest rate and better performance of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The market also reported marked improvement in infrastructure
construction including clearing, trading and supervision.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Shenzhen city government is also
expected to promulgate more of the 10 measures drafted early this
year to help develop the securities market.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Closure on Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel today began implementing
the delayed easing of the closure of Palestinian territories
after the Palestinian police released an abducted Israeli
citizen.
</P>
<P>
The easing, effective from 3:00 a.m., will admit 10,000
additional Palestinian workers to enter Israel to work, and allow
the inflow of more Palestinian goods and medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Army decided Sunday to freeze the easing, originally
set on the same day, after Palestinian security services abducted
an Israeli Arab in east Jerusalem last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Israel troops also sealed off immediately the
Palestinian-controlled area of Ramallah. In addition, Israeli
government threatened to cancel an important first meeting
between Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure of the Israelis, Arafat Sunday night
ordered the release of Abed Salem Hirbawi, who was involved in a
dispute with a pro-PNA Christian Church over the ownership of a
shop.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli government decided to go ahead with the
David-Arafat meeting today at the Palestinian side of Erez
crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a crippling blockade of the Palestinian
territories after Islamic anti-Israeli activists launched a spate
of suicide bombings inside Israel between late February and early
March, which killed at least 60 people.
</P>
<P>
The five-month-long closure, which banned 60,000 Palestinian
workers from returning to jobs inside Israel and the export of
local goods to Israel, dealt a severe blow to the fledgling
Palestinian economy and inflicted hardship on the life of
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Donors' Confidence Restored: Tanzanian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Measures taken by the Third
Phase Government of Tanzania to enhance fiscal stability and curb
wastage in revenue collection and public expenditure, has
restored the confidence of the donor community in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State in the President's Office (planning),
daniel Yone, said here on Monday that the government performance
was greeted with warmth and optimistic goodwill at the
consultative group meeting in Paris, France last week, according
to local press today.
</P>
<P>
Yone, who was in the Tanzanian delegation to the meeting
attended by 17 bilateral donors, said the 1.2 billion U.S.
Dollars pledged to support Tanzania's reform program was slightly
higher than the actual financial gap in 1996/97, which he put at
1.055 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the government expected a similarly sympathetic
reception during the Paris Club conference scheduled for later
this year.
</P>
<P>
That meeting has the mandate to write off and re-schedule
debts and Yone expressed the hope that it would trip Tanzania's
foreign debt standing at 7.7 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Minister complained that the government was spending 40
percent of its revenue to service the outstanding debt.
</P>
<P>
The consultative group meeting called for prompt
investigations and prosecution of tax evaders, the elimination of
ad hoc exemptions, the reform of the customs department and the
closing of revenue leakages through the Zanzibar route.
</P>
<P>
Yone also said the donors pressed for progress toward total
peace and stability in Zanzibar and if short of it not being
attained some more donor countries would stop assisting zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Some countries had already stopped giving aid to the Isles
until such problems were sorted out, he added.

<P>
De Charette arrived in the Lebanese capital from Damascus on

Commenting on the Sunday operation of swapping prisoners and
remains of fighters between Lebanon's Hezbollah and Israel, De
Charette said that the operation was a "positive step facilitating
a removal of problems obstructing the peace process."

another one by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the Middle
East peace talks.
</P>

Boueiz announced that he would discuss with the French foreign
minister how to activate the cease-fire monitoring committee, of
which both Lebanon and France are members.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Proposes Defense Dialogue at ARF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JARKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen today proposed that the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) start
dialogue on defense conversion and begin at an appropriate time
discussion on matters relating to comprehensive security
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He made the proposal at the opening session of the third ARF
meeting here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ARF role, he said that it plays an important
role in enhancing mutual understanding, promoting mutual trust and
maintaining regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ARF has increasingly become a major channel
for multilateral security dialogues and cooperation in the Asia
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China will take an active part in the forum's
activities and continue to play its constructive role.
</P>
<P>
The ARF is a new attempt for security cooperation in the region
and represents a new approach to security, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the forum will play an increasingly important role
in maintaining regional peace and stability so long as it gives
full consideration to the region's diversity, maintains its nature
and rules of procedure and develops incrementally on the basis of
shared interests and needs of its members in the spirit of
consensus and seeking common ground while putting aside
differences.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciated that the forum has agreed to let China
and the Philippines co-sponsor the meeting on Confidence-Building
Measures in Beijing next year, which would be the first time for
China to host an official multilateral conference on security
issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that with joint efforts and energetic
cooperation of other members of the forum, the Beijing meeting
will be a complete success.
</P>
<P>
On military cooperation, he said that he had made a number of
proposals on such matters as notifying and inviting other ARF
members to observe joint military exercises, reducing and
eventually putting an end to military reconnaissance targeted at a
certain member of the forum.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that these proposals have a practical significance
for confidence-building in the region and he hoped that they would
gradually become the consensus views of the forum members.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister is among the 21 foreign ministers
of ASEAN members, ASEAN dialogue partners and ASEAN observers
attending the one-day meeting of the ARF.
</P>
<P>
The seven-member ASEAN has 10 dialogue partners -- Australia,
Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, India, New Zealand,
Russia, South Korea and the United States -- and four observer
countries -- Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to work
actively for regional peace and development and fulfill its
responsibilities and obligations as a major power, Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said at the third meeting of the
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) here today.
</P>
<P>
"China attaches great importance to the region's security
environment and is deeply interested in and consistently committed
to stepping up dialogue and cooperation with the other countries,"
he said at the opening session of the one-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country also "attaches importance to
enhancing mutual understanding and mutual trust with the other
Asia-Pacific countries."
</P>
<P>
"A stronger Chinese economy poses no threat to any country. On
the contrary, if China, a country of 1.2 billion people, should be
bogged down in poverty and chaos, that would have an adverse
effect on regional stability," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On regional security, Qian said that China had conducted
extensive political dialogues and military exchange with many ARF
members.
</P>
<P>
He said that China issued a white paper on the country's arms
control and disarmament in November last year and signed an
agreement with Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan in
April this year on military confidence-building in the border
areas.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that as a forum designed to increase mutual trust
among its members, the ARF may as well encourage countries with
common borders to adopt, on a bilateral basis, appropriate
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
The ARF meeting is being attended by foreign ministers of its
21 members -- the seven ASEAN members, their 10 dialogue partners
and four observer countries.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,

<HEADLINE> Hainan's Tight Pollution Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Sanxin Cement Plant in south
China's island province of Hainan spent more than four million
yuan to improve its facilities when local authorities discovered
it failed to meet pollution regulations.
</P>
<P>
Since it was established eight years ago, China's youngest
province has maintained tight control over environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
"The economic development in the province must be accelerated,
but not at the cost of the environment," provincial officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hainan was once listed as one of the last areas of "pure land"
in the world. It discharges the smallest amount of 12 major
pollutants compared with other provinces in China.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Hainan has spent more than 56 million
yuan to treat industrial pollution in more than 160 factories and
enterprises. The province's forest coverage has grown from 38
percent in 1989 to the current 48.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The provincial people's congress issued a dozen decrees
covering environmental protection, and 19 cities and counties have
come up with more than 60 corresponding rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial regulations, no project will be
approved unless it obtains the approval of the environmental
protection department.

<HEADLINE> Economists Lower Growth Forecasts for Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Economists here lowered their
forecasts of Singapore's economic growth rate this year by at
least half a percentage point, in view of the poor trade figures
in June, local newspapers said today.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of worse than expected June trade figures, which
showed that non-oil domestic exports fell by 2.1 percent in real
terms, or by 6.1 percent year-on-year, the economists' forecasts
for the second quarter came down by up to about two points, a
Business Times report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that a month ago, the economy was expected to grow
close to 9 percent in the April-June quarter, with the projections
ranging from 7.0 to 11.3 percent, surpassing the first quarter's
10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the full year, the market consensus was now down by half a
point to eight percent, at the low end of projections a month ago,
it said.
</P>
<P>
A Straits Times report said that a poll of 11 research houses
showed that, on average, the projected full-year Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rates had dropped from 8.3 percent to 7.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
But this figure is still within the 7.5 to 8.5 percent range
projected by the Ministry of Trade and Industry in May.
</P>
<P>
However, some other economists chose to stick to their original
forecast of 8.2 percent growth for the whole year. They said that
the prospects for full-year growth now depends on the last
quarter, and whether growth will be as weak as the third quarter
is expected to be.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Tea Export Falls Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's tea export stood at
19.12 million kilograms during the first 10 months of the outgoing
1995-96 fiscal year, registering a fall of about 24 percent over
the same period in the previous fiscal, a market report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report, published by the National Brokers Limited, said
that Poland topped the list of major importers with 10.61 million
kg or 60 percent of total exports, followed by Sudan with 4.88
million kg and Pakistan with 1.21 million kg.
</P>
<P>
The exports to Russia fell to only 0.15 million kg in the first
10 months of last fiscal ended on June from 4.4 million kg during
the same period of the previous fiscal, while that to Jordan and
Pakistan had also marked significant fall during the period.
</P>
<P>
The average price of Bangladesh tea recorded at taka 48.98
(about 1.2 U.S. dollars) per kg during the period, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report contributed the sharp fall in export to the
political turbulence, which made normal economic activities
disrupted and trade, commerce and manufacture standstill.

So far, the famous ancient port city has launched more than
1,800 foreign-funded projects, actually utilizing 1.36 billion US
dollars in foreign currency. Its exports volume has surpassed 1.5
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The success should be partly attributed to development of ports
of entry. The city invested more than 45 million US dollars in
port construction since the 1980s, bringing the annual combined
handling capacity to two million tons. During the Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1991-1995), the city's ports handled more than 6.6 million
tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Zhangzhou Port in Longhai City began in November,
1993. Its first-phase project, a 35,000-tonnage berth, has been
completed, and has a yearly handling capacity of 800,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Zhangzhou aims to build about 30 large and medium-sized
berths.

<HEADLINE> Peace, Development Predominate in Asia Pacific: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific region has
already entered a period of lasting peace and development as a
whole, despite a host of challenges and problems, Chinese Vice
Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said at the third meeting
of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) here today.
</P>
<P>
He cited the following points as factors exerting long-term
effect on the regional situation.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the Asia Pacific region as a whole, East Asia in
particular, is a scene of robust economic growth, where all the
countries have taken economic development as their primary task.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, said Qian, it has become a greater common interest
of these countries to maintain a peaceful environment that
conduces economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, intra-regional economic links have been significantly
strengthened and interaction and inter-dependence among states
steadily enhanced, which laid a solid economic foundation for
regional security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, bloc confrontation and local conflicts of the Cold War
style no longer exist in the region while coordination and
cooperation among states have increasingly become the mainstream,
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the old and new problems in this region have by and
large been brought under control while dialogue and negotiation
have become the main instrument in handling disputes between
states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian called for increased mutual understanding and mutual trust
through dialogue and consultation as well as stronger regional
security and political security through broader and deeper
economic exchange and partnership, joint participation and close
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The one-day ARF meeting, which will end this evening, is being
attended by foreign ministers from the seven ASEAN members, their
10 dialogue partners and four observer countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Disasters Won't Hinder Economic Growth: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to meet its
goals set for economic development this year, despite frequent
natural disasters, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Although some areas in south and east China have been savaged
by floods, economic losses have not been very huge compared to
previous years, Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State
Planning Commission, told a press conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have caused floods in parts of Guangxi,
Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces since June,
leaving at least 716 dead, and giving rise to about 40 billion
yuan worth of direct losses.
</P>
<P>
But Chen didn't hold that the disasters will lead to a drop in
the nation's grain output, which has been a key factor in the
government's effort to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
The grain acreage is estimated to be one million hectares more
than last year, and supply of farming-related goods has been
basically sufficient this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The state has also raised official prices for grain purchase,
which will boost the peasants' farming enthusiasm, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, north and northwest China, where droughts
prevailed in past years, has witnessed bumper rainfalls since
April, and are expecting an increase in grain yield, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, China is most likely to fulfill its
economic targets this year, barring unexpected severe disasters in
the coming months," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Strains of High-yield Sugarcane Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
new strains of sugarcane by employing a combination of radiation
and chemical methods.
</P>
<P>
Their success points to new ways being found for the growing of
sugarcane, according to science researchers at the Guangxi
Sugarcane Institute, under the Guangxi Academy of Agricultural
Sciences in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The combination of radiation mutagenesis and chemical
mutagenesis techniques, developed in the 1940s, have been employed
separately worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists started experimenting with combining the two
techniques in 1983 in a bid to overcome deficiencies resulting
from the separate use of the two methods. Their experiments over
the past decade showed that proper manipulation of the new method
can overcome the deficiencies of separate techniques, but the
mechanism merits further study and research.
</P>
<P>
Trial planting of the new strains over the past three years
showed that the sugarcane's sugar content in October and November
reached 14.59 percent on average, much higher than that of
"Guitang 11", one of the best and most popularly planted species
in the region.

<HEADLINE> ARF Facilitates Setting up of Regional Order: Alatas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) can
facilitate the establishment of a regional order in which all
countries in the Asia Pacific region could live in peace and
harmony, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said at an ARF
meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the third ARF meeting, Alatas, chairman of the ARF this
year, said that the regional order will not only ensure the
stability and prosperity of the region but will also be a major
contribution to the shaping of a world of greater peace, justice
and shared prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He recalled the progress achieved by the forum since its last
meeting in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei, saying that "these
activities have enhanced the level of mutual confidence among ARF
participants."
</P>
<P>
He said that although the accomplishments of the region in the
pursuit of both peace and development have been widely regarded as
phenomenal, "we cannot and must not be complacent."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the region is by no means free of tension and
anxiety of potential conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We still have to live with actual problems and potential
security challenges, including unresolved territorial disputes and
overlapping claims to sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said that it is important to acknowledge the limits of
what can be expected of the ARF process at this stage of
development as it would be unrealistic to expect a young and
fragile process such as this forum to be able to tackle at once
all security challenges in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ARF members have agreed on a gradual
development of the forum, with the promotion of
Confidence-Building Measures coming first, followed by the
development of the Preventive Diplomacy Mechanisms, and then the
elaboration of approaches to conflict-resolution.
</P>
<P>
The ministers attending the meeting today are from the seven
ASEAN members, their ten dialogue partners -- Australia, Canada,
China, the European Union, Japan, India, New Zealand, Russia,

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada's major banks today trimmed the
prime lending rate by a quarter of point to 6.25 percent, the lowest
since March 1994.
</P>

the Bank of Canada's rate cut Friday, which saw the key bank rate fall
by 0.25 percentage point to 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Montreal was the first bank to lower its prime rate today,
which was followed by Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia,
Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National
Bank of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Explaining Friday's rate cut, the Bank of Canada said that sluggish
consumer spending is keeping downward pressure on inflation.

<HEADLINE> Sole Candidate Poised to Be Bangladeshi President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's former Acting President
and Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed is poised to be the country's
next president as he is likely to be the sole candidate in the
presidential election today.
</P>
<P>
According to sources concerned, two nomination papers on behalf
of Shahabuddin were filed Monday with the Election Commission for
the presidential election as nominee of the ruling Awami
(People's) League.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party did not field
any candidate.
</P>
<P>
An unofficial statement in parliament is likely to declare the
67-year-old Justice Shahabuddin to be elected uncontested after
the scrutiny of the nomination papers, said sources from the
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The tenure of the office of the incumbent president, Abdur
Rahman Biswas, expires on October 8 this year.
</P>
<P>
Shahabuddin, described as a man of strict principle, took over
as the acting president in December 1990 when the then president
Hussain Mohammad Ershad resigned in the face of "mass upsurge"
against his military rule.
</P>
<P>
As a consensus candidate of all the political parties at that
time, Shahabuddin successfully held the election to the fifth
parliament in 1991, which was highly acclaimed both at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
After the parliamentary election, he returned to the bench as
Chief Justice. He retired in March last year after a 35-year
stint with the judicial service.

<HEADLINE> More Small, Medium-sized Enterprises Welcome in Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area in China's
largest industrial city plans to attract more small and
medium-sized overseas enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During a seminar attended by representatives from Singapore,
Mexico, Israel, Japan, Britain, the Republic of Korea and the
United States, Pudong officials reaffirmed that investment
opportunities in Shanghai are equal for all overseas investors,
large or small, and that all will be given the same treatment by
Pudong.
</P>
<P>
So far, 80 of 500 world-renowned multi-national companies have
flocked to Pudong, bringing a total investment of three billion US
dollars to the area. In the first half of this year, 51 projects
were concluded, each with an investment of more than 10 million US
dollars, with pledged investments totalling 1.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although large projects are increasing, overseas projects that
have an investment of less than five million US dollars apiece
account for 85 percent of the total, said an official with the
area.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that small or medium-sized enterprises
comprise the majority of the overseas enterprises, and Pudong
needs large numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises to make
investments," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that small and medium-sized enterprises tend to have
quick economic returns. Ninety percent of the enterprises in
Pudong, most of which are smaller-scaled, realized economic
returns just one year after they went into operation,
</P>
<P>
An investigation of 2,484 foreign-invested enterprises, mostly
small and medium-sized, shows they received an added value of
3.549 billion yuan (about 428 million US dollars) in the
January-June period, up 26.2 percent over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that large projects have provided opportunities
for the smaller enterprises to offer matched investments, and that
cooperation with the larger companies provided greater potential
for the small and medium-sized firms.
</P>
<P>
Pudong New Area officials vowed to improve the investment
environment, and to provide consulting, legal and employment
services and training for local smaller-scale businesses in order
to attract more of their foreign counterparts to the area.

<HEADLINE> Tangshan Orphans Looked After In Quake City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Dang Yumiao, a 20-year-old
soldier in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has no memories
of her mother or father.
</P>
<P>
She was just a few months old when the nature dealt a savage
blow on her home city of Tangshan. It was July 28th 1976, and as
Dang lay peacefully in her bed a devastating earthquake struck her
city.
</P>
<P>
Her parents were among the 240,000 killed in those few minutes
of terror as the earth shook.
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the quake, Dang was plucked from the ruins
of her home. No one knew her name, or even whose child she
was. Rescuers guessed she was about seven months old, and named
her Dang Yumiao, which means "a little seedling nurtured by the
party."
</P>
<P>
Finding her in the ruins of a destroyed city gave her rescuers
hope for the future.
</P>
<P>
The Tangshan earthquake left more than 4,000 children homeless
and orphaned. Since then the lives of the quake orphans of
Tangshan has become the focus of attention in China.
</P>
<P>
Special schools for orphans were built in Xingtai and
Shijiazhuang, the capital of north China's Hebei Province. Most of
the orphans were raised in the two schools; others were taken care
of by various local enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Wang An who was only three years old when he victimized by an
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"I missed the school and the teachers very much, and often
visit them in my dreams," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I was very naughty those days," he recalled. "Once, when I
soiled my clothes, my teacher wanted to change them for me, but I
ran into the garden to play games. My teacher ran after me and
caught me. She took me to the bathing room, where she gently
washed me. I felt so comfortable and cozy that I fell asleep. When
I woke up, I was in my new clothes"
</P>
<P>
Wang An and his companions lived in the two orphanage schools
for eight years, where they say they were happy. They were
transferred to the Tangshan Welfare Institution in 1984, and now
Wang An is working at Tangshan Worker's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Sun Shirong, an unmarried employee at the Tangshan Kailuan Coal
Mine, has spent her life savings on the orphans. During
celebration days, she presented them gifts, and she often bought
them their favorite foods. To help them learn more she even
subscribed newspapers and periodicals for them.
</P>
<P>
Survivor Song Naixuan, who was injured and crippled in the
quake, also spent most of his income on the orphans. Though he set
up his own clothing factory, he is very thrifty in his daily life,
saving more money to spend on the children.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a patient who can't eat much, or use much. These orphans
are ours, I feel happy to spend money on them", he said.
</P>
<P>
On each year's International Children's Day, he bought each
orphan in the welfare institution a suit of new clothes, and when
they started working he presented each of them with a leather
suitcase.
</P>
<P>
When the orphans grew up, the Tangshan city government offered
them preferential treatment in employment.
</P>
<P>
Sun Maogui, director of the Welfare Department of the City
Bureau of Civil Affairs, tried his best to provide the orphans
with good jobs.
</P>
<P>
Asked why he did his utmost to find good jobs for them, as if
they were his own children, he said: "If they had been my own
children I would not have made such an all-out effort. It was
because they are orphans that I spared no effort."

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Exchange Index Further Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The stock exchange of Thailand
(SET) index further slided by 18.19 points on Monday in a bearish
trend in the local bourse.
</P>
<P>
The index stood at 1,164.19, a 1.54 percent drop, with trading
turnover of 4,119.26 million baht (164.76 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The SET index dropped as rumors were circulating that the World
Bank had suggested Thailand devalue its baht because of the
increased current account deficit, according to Boonsom
Kesapradit, assistant vice-president of Asia Credit Plc.
</P>
<P>
Another factor affecting investment sentiment was the growing
concern and tension of opposition MPs over the military's spending
budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts attributed the SET's bearishness to the
announcement of more poor performances during the second quarter
by finance and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
The slide indicated investors' reluctance to commit themselves
to the local bearish bourse at the moment.

<P>
SHENZHEN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen, the first Special
Economic Zone in China, has recorded a sharp increase in foreign
investment in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The local government approved establishment of 506
foreign-funded enterprises in the six months, with contracted
foreign funds reaching 1.014 billion U.S. dollars, 19.2 percent
more than in the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Actual utilization of foreign funds in Shenzhen totaled 901
million U.S. dollars during the period, up 39.5 percent.

has dropped.

Figures also show that the number of large projects remained on
the rise. In the past six months, the local government approved

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will put more
emphasis on the creation of a favorable social environment to
fight AIDS in the next five years, said Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa when unveiling a new anti-AIDS plan here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1997-2001 National AIDS Prevention and Control Plan,
the government will work to promote family values and awareness of
self-protection against the fatal disease among individuals and
communities.
</P>
<P>
The plan called for higher social status of women and efforts
to teach people how to prevent themselves and their families from
being infected by the disease.
</P>
<P>
Noting that HIV and AIDS victims should not be allowed to feel
isolated by the society, the plan stressed the development of
social psychology in the country to help them lead a normal life.
</P>
<P>
It said that doctors alone cannot solve the AIDS problem and
that family members and the community should also offer assistance
to HIV and AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
The plan urged social, health and medical services and related
research institutes as well as international cooperation to help
the country win the battle against AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Students from South China Colleges Ready to Help Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds and thousands of
Chinese students are heading to remote villages to help peasant
farmers learn reading and writing.
</P>
<P>
The 600 groups of volunteers from 45 institutions of higher
learning in south China's Guangdong province, will also spread
scientific and technological know-how to help the farmers become
better off.
</P>
<P>
Universities and colleges based in south China have focused on
social practice this year by aiding the poorer farmers through the
use of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Students from 45 universities and colleges voluntarily
self-organized into various service groups, ready to give a hand
to people who are in need of help.
</P>
<P>
The students choose what to do for the people, according to
their own specialties. Once a kind of need is identified, a
service group of volunteers is established.
</P>
<P>
Students from the South China Normal University and the
Guangzhou Teachers' College headed to mountainous areas, where
economic and cultural growth are backward. They have carried out a
survey on illiteracy elimination, and are training teachers for
local schools, as well as teaching local students.
</P>
<P>
Groups from the South China University of Science and
Technology are expected to work with township enterprises to learn
about the current industrial situation, provide scientific and
technological consulations, and help solve technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Students majoring in medical sciences at the Zhongshan Medical
Science University, Jinan University, and the Guangzhou College of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, have taken medicines with them when
they left for northern parts of the province, such as Yangshan,
Liannan and Qingyuan.
</P>
<P>
Students seeking master's or doctor's degrees also formed
high-level voluntary groups. Zhongshan University sent three
batches of graduate students to do research work in villages.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, some 1.5 million students from universities,
colleges as well as middle schools across China helped eliminate
illiteracy and spread scientific know-how among the poor during
their summer holidays.

<HEADLINE>   Reformed NATO to Face New Tasks: Solana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said today that a reformed NATO will face new tasks, have
more members and renew its relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a jointly press in Salzburg, northern Austria, the
NATO chief said that NATO is undoubtedly the "most important
guarantor" for stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"We are constructing a reformed NATO, which will have new
tasks, a new structure, new member and new relations with Russia,
and will define a new European defense system," the NATO chief
said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has shifted its role from a Western defense alliance to
maintaining stability in Europe, Solana told the joint press
conference after meeting with Austrian Defense Minister Werner
Fasslabend.
</P>
<P>
Solana described the June 3 meeting of NATO foreign ministers
in Berlin, Germany, which boosted Europe's role within the
trans-Atlantic alliance, as the beginning of NATO's adaptation
process to meet post-Cold War challenges.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, NATO has been engaged in a
gradual process of eastward expansion intended to take more
members, particularly former east bloc countries. Russia has been
strongly opposed to the eastward expansion of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Solana expressed the hope that Austria, a non-NATO country,
would make an early decision on whether to apply for NATO
membership, but added he, as the NATO civil chief, would like to
see as many members as possible.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the same occasion, Fesslabend told reporters that
it is unnecessary to hold a referendum on Austria's NATO
membership, adding decisions made by government and parliament on
the matter are enough.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Solana also held talks with Austrian Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky, who said Austria has participated in NATO's
peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and taken an active role in the
alliance's Partnership for Peace Program.
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in the town on Friday to attend a local art
festival which opened Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- More and more US electronics
firms, including world-renowned video-conference system provider
PictureTel, have shown great confidence in China's booming
computer market, "People's Posts and Telecommunications News"
reported.
</P>
<P>
China's total sales of computer products hit 61.5 billion yuan
(about seven billion US dollars) in 1995, up 51 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that many US multinational electronic giants
are setting up branch companies and offices, and finding sales
agents in China, to help claim bigger market share in the Chinese
market, while the world economy is stagnating or developing at a
slow pace.
</P>
<P>
PictureTel has recently opened a Beijing office, and plans to
set up another three in Shanghai, Nanjing and Wuhan later this
year.
</P>
<P>
Unilinx International Company entered the Chinese market and
established its China branch in April. The company plans to set up
an Internet server factory in China in the near future.
</P>
<P>
US information switch system provider Xylan, and world-famous
electronic measuring instrument manufacturer Fluke, settled in
China in May.
</P>
<P>
China's computer market will grow by 30 percent this year, and
its total sales are expected to reach 200 billion yuan by the year
2000, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Special School Helps Mend Impairing Marriages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A school in China where estranged
couples learn how to mend their broken marriages has chalked up
success.
</P>
<P>
Taxi driver Guan Deli, one of the school's "graduates", has
reunited with his wife after attending classes at the
Enlightenment School for Desperate Marriages in Shenyang, capital
of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
But months ago, Guan had instigated divorce proceedings, and
the couple separated.
</P>
<P>
Guan told "China Daily" that he was grateful for the school's
help, like other 240 pairs of his "schoolmates", the couples with
marital troubles.
</P>
<P>
The school was launched in Shenyang two years ago by the
Women's Federation of Dadong District, aiming at helping stablize
society and protect the legal rights of women.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 volunteers -- retired workers, teachers and
government officials -- work through the school, also to fight
family violence, particularly wife abuse, and sometimes offer
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
"As we live in the neighborhood, we can detect every unstable
element, and through our work, family crises can be resolved,"
said a retired woman working at the school.
</P>
<P>
For many of these couples, financial problems played a part in
marital strife, as about 600 women in Guan's area were recently
laid off from state-run enterprises, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Along with the counselling at the school, the women's
federation offers a very unusual insurance package which more
than 65,000 women have already bought.
</P>
<P>
The insurance pays benefits if a woman leaves her husband or is
abused.
</P>
<P>
Projects like the school and the insurance have helped entrench
women's and families' rights in Shenyang, a federation's official
said.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises to be Surveyed for Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Two million township enterprises
in China are involved in the country's largest ever pollution
survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey is seen as an important measure to ensure national
environmental protection goals, control of the overall discharge
of pollutants, and putting pollution caused by enterprises under
effective control, according to Zhang Kunmin, vice-director of the
State Bureau for Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
China's township enterprises have been developing rapidly in
the past few years. Last year, they reported 25 percent of the
gross domestic product and 30.8 percent of the nation's industrial
value-added output.
</P>
<P>
However, they have also become one of the major sources of
pollution owing mainly to low technical levels. They now account
for 16.6 percent of the nation's waste water discharge, half of
industrial dirt discharges, and 16.2 percent of industrial waste
residue discharge.
</P>
<P>
The survey is jointly organized by the State Bureau for
Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Agriculture, the
Ministry of Finance and the State Statistics Bureau. The data
obtained from the survey is expected to be made public by June of
next year, and the results will be included in the State Bureau
for Environmental Protection's annual bulletin on environmental
protection for 1997 to make it more comprehensive.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Becomes China's Major Packaging Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, a major industrial city
in southwest China's Sichuan province, has become one of the
country's top six packaging industrial bases, "China Light
Industry News" reported.
</P>
<P>
The city's gross industrial output value of its packaging
industry soared to 2.3 billion yuan (about 277 million US dollars)
in 1995, from 170 million yuan (about 20.5 million US dollars) in
1981, with an annual growth rate of 20.45 percent, five percentage
points higher than the national average growth rate.
</P>
<P>
With hard effort over the past few years, Chongqing has built
one of the most powerful packaging industrial bases in the
country's inland cities.
</P>
<P>
The city used to suffer losses up to 54 million yuan because of
poor packaging each year.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the huge losses as a result of poor packaging,
Chongqing enacted a series of measures to improvement management,
and established a packaging technology association. As a result,
the city has so far saved 199 million yuan through packaging
improvement initiatives, and 49 million US dollars through
minimizing indemnity in foreign trade.

underdog in the pool at the current Centennial Olympic Games,
again shocked the people with the second gold medal in the
400-meter freestyle event here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Smith, 26, who chalked up a gold in the women's 400m individual
medley on Sunday, stormed back and took the lead after the final
turn to clock a winning time of 4:07.25.
</P>
<P>
She finished second in this morning's heats.
</P>
<P>
"It is unbelievable. I can't really believe it myself. I have
forgotten the controversy and it feels great."
</P>
<P>
"I went out hard the first 200 meters, so they couldn't keep
the pace with me after that." Smith said.
</P>
<P>
As to her relatively modest time, Smith said: "Only the gold
medal matters."
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Dagmar Hase of Germany had to settle for the
silver at 4:08.30. But she was quite satisfied: "One can still be

But Hall was quite satisfied with himself:"I think I swam
better than anybody rally expected me to. I improved my time by a
half-second so there's no disappointment on my part."
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia netted four out of the
dozen gold medals at stake in the 26th Olympic Games here Monday
to top the medal table with seven gold, two silver and two bronze
medals.
</P>
<P>
These four were won through male Russians in the 10m air rifle
shooting, team gymnastics, 100m freestyle and 200m butterfly
events.
</P>
<P>
Host United States inched up to the second place by collecting
two golds and three silvers mainly on the strength of its female
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's leader Poland dropped to the third slot as it bagged
one silver medal in the women's judo event.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's Micchelle Smith became the first double gold
medallist of the current Olympic Games after taking the women's
400m freestyle event in addition to the gold medal she had won in
the 400m individual medley race last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea added two gold medals in the men's and women's judo
men's judo finals.
</P>
<P>
Romania won its first gold medal in the current Games when

by defeating Giovanna Trillini and world number one Valentina
Vezzali in the semi-final and the final respectively.
</P>
<P>
Italy took some consolation later when Alessandro Puccini
claimed the men's crown.
</P>
<P>
A thrilling drama took place in the weightlifting arena when
Turkey's Niam Suleymanoglu and world record holder Valerios

division this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish strongman first jerked 185 kilograms to break the
old mark of 180 kilograms set by Leonidis in May 1995. With a
snatch of 147.5 kilograms earlier, he also created a new world
record of 332.5 kilograms in the two-lift total, which is 2.5 kg
more than his old mark of 330kg.
</P>

kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Suleymanoglu came forward to jerk the same weight, thus setting
another two-lift world record -- 335 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Assured of the gold medal, Suleymanoglu asked for 190 kilograms
in his third attempt but failed.
</P>
<P>
Leonidis and China's Xiao Jiangang lifted the same weight of
332.5 kilograms but the Greek was awarded the silver medal because
of lighter body weight. Xiao got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
So far, four weightlifting world records have been broken on
six occasions while two swimming world marks have been revamped at
the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Australia to Revive Scrapped Asian Aid Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia has decided to continue
to fund some of the aid projects under its abandoned program of
the Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF), a soft loan scheme
for infrastructure development in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Andrea McLaughlan, an official of the Ministry for Foreign
Affairs and Trade, told Xinhua today that the coalition government
would continue to fund some humanitarian-based DIFF projects under
new arrangements within the ministry's foreign aid arm -- AusAid.
</P>
<P>
The government had earlier scrapped the
100-million-Australian-dollar (79 million US dollar) DIFF program
as part of its efforts to slash budget expenditure by eight
billion Australian dollars (six billion US dollars) in two years.
</P>
<P>
The decision had affected infrastructure development projects
with a total contract value of 323 million Australian dollars (255
million US dollars) in China, most of them sewage and electricity
projects.
</P>
<P>
McLaughlan said that there were no indications which projects
would be retained under AusAid. But she said that the projects
must fall in line with the Australian government's focus on
humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian projects include clean water systems and power
network for outback areas.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has written to
four Asian governments, including China, to ask them to put
forward lists of "high-priority" projects that could still proceed
with Australian aid but not under the DIFF program.
</P>
<P>
He said that on deciding which project would survive the cut,
the government would also take into consideration the importance
of the DIFF projects in Australia's overall aid to the receiving
country.
</P>
<P>
The abandonment of DIFF had drawn strong criticism from
business circles in Australia. Local big companies had complained
that they would be at a disadvantage in competing for trade and
investment opportunities in Asia without necessary assistance from
the government.
</P>
<P>
The strongest protest came from the environmental industry,
which said that it would lose its competitive edge on the Asian
market to rivals from Europe and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Step up Cooperation with Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A top official from coastal Fujian
Province has vowed to speed up all forms of cooperation with Hong
Kong in the future.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, said that Fujian will have unique
advantages it expands cooperation with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has more than 800,000 residents of Fujian origin,
about 15 percent of its population. And many of them have
extensive relations with overseas Chinese who live in southeast
Asia.

From 1979 through 1995, Fujian brought in 13.73 billion US
dollars in overseas investment, 57 percent of which came from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>

eight-fold increase in its gross domestic product (the value of
goods and services produced) from 1980 and established a market
economic structure.

<P>
"To achieve this objective, we must do our utmost to expand
cooperation and exchanges with the rest of the world, introduce
foreign managerial expertise, technology, personnel and funds, and
adapt to the economy of the world as a whole," Jia said.

<HEADLINE> Motorcycle Sales Set Record In Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Motorcycle sales in Brazil
reached a new record in the first half of this year with a volume
of 129,728 units, a Brazilian association said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Association of Manufacturers of Motorcycles,
Scooters and Bicycles said that it was a 26 percent increase over
the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
After customs duties were removed on imports, a basic
productive process (BPP) was established, which launched 10 new
models, the association added.
</P>
<P>
Consumption is boosted due to stable prices of motorcycles,
pointed out the association.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that BPP can sell 280,000 motorcycles by the
end of the year, 40 percent up from last year.
</P>
<P>
The association predicted that sales volume could reach 500,000
units in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Step up Cooperation with Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 22 (Xinhua) -- A top official from coastal Fujian
Province, east China, has vowed to speed up all forms of
cooperation with Hong Kong in the future.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, said that Fujian will have unique
advantages it expands cooperation with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has 800,000 residents of Fujian origin, about 15
percent of its population. And many of them have extensive
relations with overseas Chinese who live in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 through 1995, Fujian brought in 13.73 billion US
dollars in overseas investment, 57 percent of which came from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past ten-plus years Hong Kong has remained Fujian's
leading trading partner," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the 1979-1995 period, 44 percent of exports from Fujian
went to Hong Kong, which also provided 48 percent of the imports
into the province, he added.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, Fujian will have scored an
eight-fold increase in its gross domestic product (the value of
goods and services produced) from 1980 and established a market
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve this objective, we must do our utmost to expand
cooperation and exchanges with the rest of the world, introduce
foreign managerial expertise, technology, personnel and funds, and
adapt to the economy of the world as a whole," Jia said.

<TEXT>
<P>
To this end, Fujian will give top priority to expanding
cooperation with Hong Kong, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I think to gear itself with the global economy, Fujian should
first adapt its economy to the Hong Kong economy," he said, adding
that Hong Kong's economy is vigorous and holds an important
position in the Asia-Pacific economy and the world economy at
large.
</P>
<P>
Fujian needs to forge close cooperative ties with Hong Kong in
many areas, such as trade and the introduction of sophisticated
technology, information, personnel and funds.
</P>
<P>
"Invigorating the economy of China's inland requires Hong
Kong's stability and prosperity, whereas Hong Kong's stability and
prosperity are inseparable from its close cooperation with Fujian
and other parts of the interior area," he said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Fujian's investment, trade, technology and labor
markets are appealing to Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Labor-intensive industries in Hong Kong are shifting toward
technology- and capital-intensive industries, he said. Hong Kong
companies have set up 40,000 factories in the inland areas so far,
involving 200 billion dollars in total investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that Fujian can certainly accommodate
businesses that are to be moved out of Hong Kong. So the two areas
can greatly expand cooperation in this regard," Jia said.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial leader, Fujian can improve its
market economic mechanism by drawing on Hong Kong's economic
managerial model, including standardizing the conduct of the
government under the conditions of a market economy, improving
economic management efficiency of the government and further
perfecting the economic operational system of a market economy.

<P>
He said that Fujian also can draw on Hong Kong's practices in
pursuing an open, free-port economy, such as allowing free imports
and exports, full authority of enterprises in operation and
management, free convertibility of foreign exchanges and free
entry and exit of personnel.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qinglin emphasized the need to expand Fujian-Hong Kong
trade relations.
</P>
<P>
"With its economy focusing on exports, Fujian should try to
expand trade relations with Hong Kong in order to broaden its
global market and spur the growth of its export-led economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to introduce funds from overseas by
relying on Hong Kong as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
"With the help of Hong Kong, we should make breakthroughs in
utilizing overseas funds in the service sector, trade and
banking," he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that Fujian must step up cooperation in the
telecommunications and information industries, in order to
accelerate its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to speed up the construction of ports in
Fujian by bringing into full play Hong Kong's role as an
international transport hub, and to advance cooperation between
Fujian and Taiwan by relying on Hong Kong's status as a "bridge"
that can be used in handling relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Fujian currently has 118 enterprises in the Hong
Kong-Macao region.
</P>
<P>
"We should give full play to the role of the enterprises as a
window for Fujian in promoting cooperation with Hong Kong in
establishing companies overseas, contracting for overseas
construction projects and providing labor services," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We are sure that Hong Kong's tomorrow will be even more
splendid. We fully confide in Hong Kong's future. And we are full
of hope that we will certainly succeed in cooperation with Hong
Kong," Jia said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Germany Ties India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Winger Stefan Saliger scored a
goal four minutes from time to save Olympic men's field hockey
champion Germany from a second successive defeat on Monday as they
snatched a 1-1 draw against India.
</P>
<P>
Eight-time Olympic champion India looked set for their first
Olympic win over the Germans since 1968 when Mukesh Kumar gave
them the lead eight minutes from time with a glorious rising shot.
</P>
<P>
But India allowed winger Stefan Saliger to move unmarked into
the penalty area and he was able to collect Christoph Bechmann's
cross from the right and pick his spot.
</P>
<P>
It was a dramatic end to a tight, nervous game between two
sides which had lost their opening games. Germany was the more
aggressive and forced six corners, but they could not get the
better of Subbaiah in the Indian goal.
</P>
<P>
India did not have a shot on target or a corner before their
goal, when Dhanraj Pillay robbed substitue Michael Green, raced 25
meters and delivered a perfectly judged pass for Kumar to score.
</P>
<P>
The draw leaves both sides three points behind group A leader
Spain, which beat Pakistan 3-0 earlier today in their second
match.
</P>
<P>
The group's other match between the United States and Argentina
is going on.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Rises on Foreign Exchange Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar eased a
little against the US dollar at noon time today on the foreign
exchange market after hitting an eight-year high of 69.51 US cents
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Radio NZ reported that the Kiwi was trading at 69.39 US cents
at noon time, still higher than last week when the NZ dollar
traded below 69 US cents.
</P>
<P>
But the NZ dollar rose above 88 Australian cents.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a strong overseas interest in the NZ dollar
pushed it higher despite the uncertainty about the country's
economy before the general election later this year.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure we are going to have a good go at 70 US cents
before the middle of the week," a dealer predicted.
</P>
<P>
The major stimulus to the investors is the high interest rates
in New Zealand, which are now the highest among the OECD nations.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight months, the NZ dollar rose sharply on the
foreign exchange market, not only against the US dollar, but also
higher against other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the NZ dollar was trading at around 0.4150 pound
sterling and at around 67 Japanese yen. But at present, it rose
to nearly 0.4500 pound sterling and above 75.00 yen.

<HEADLINE> Helms-Burton Law Will Not Block Free Trade Between Mexico-EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 22 (Xinhua) -- French Senate President Ren
Monory ruled out here today that the U.S. Helms-Burton Law would
be an obstacle for the establishment of a free trade agreement
between Mexico and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Monory expressed his confidence that Mexico will sign a
bilateral trade agreement with France and with the European
Union because "these are times of economic globalization and we
have to be completely open."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Mexican businessmen, Monory said that his
government will discuss with the EU on a common attitude toward
the U.S. Helms-Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
Last week, U.S. President Bill Clinton decided to postpone
Chapter 3 in face of the European Union's pronouncement that it
would retaliate against the Helms-Burton by demanding visas from
U.S. businessmen who want to enter any of the 15 countries of the
EU.
</P>
<P>
The French lawmaker commented that the Helms-Burton Law will
have repercussions in the trade agreements that the United States
has established with other countries.
