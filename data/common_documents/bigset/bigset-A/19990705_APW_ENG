<HEADLINE> Astros Drop Johnson, Call Up Miller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Houston Astros optioned infielder Russ  
Johnson to Triple-A New Orleans on Monday and called up 
right-hander Wade Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was 9-5 with a 4.01 as a starter for New Orleans. He  
could start on Wednesday if Mike Hampton isn't able to go. Miller, 
22, has never pitched in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton was scratched from his scheduled start on Monday against  
the Cincinnati Reds because of a sore pitching wrist, which he 
strained during batting practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson appeared in 54 games and batted .222 with one homer and  
six RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Recall Haad; Kendall Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates on Monday recalled  
Yamid Haad, a catcher who was playing in Single-A a week ago, as a 
replacement for injured Jason Kendall. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall shattered and dislocated his right ankle when he tripped  
over first base Sunday. He is expected to miss the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall, who was fifth in the NL batting race with a .332  
average, was placed on the disabled list Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Haad will back up Keith Osik, who now becomes the starting  
catcher. Haad was 3-for-17 at Double-A Altoona after joining the 
team from Class A Lynchburg June 28. Haad hit .254 with five homers 
and 33 RBIs at Lynchburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Osik never has started regularly in the majors. He had only 40  
at-bats this season going into Monday's game against the Chicago 
Cubs.

<HEADLINE> RVs Increasing on America's Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- In an age of conspicuous consumption,  
nothing says rest and relaxation like a behemoth RV. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a roaring economy, baby boomers with money to spend  
and Americans' love affair with sport utility vehicles, more people 
are buying RVs, those lumbering vacation homes on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	More Americans than ever own RVs in terms of sheer numbers and  
as a percentage of the population. There are 9.3 million on the 
road, accounting for nearly 10 percent of all vehicle-owning 
households in the United States, according to the Recreation 
Vehicle Industry Association, based in Reston. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on who's talking, the RV boom signals a shift in  
Americans' ideals, shows their longing for community or indicates a 
growing desire to escape to the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's no question that, as with luxury boats, RV sales are  
a good indicator of the economy's performance, said David 
Humphreys, president of the RV association. ``If the economy is 
doing well, we're doing well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And RVs, sometimes seen as a vehicle for seniors, are being  
bought by younger people than in the past. RV-owning boomers with 
families now outnumber the traditional core market of over-55 empty 
nesters, with the average age of RV owners at 48, according to the 
RV association. 
</P>
<P>
	Ownership among 45- to 54-year-olds has grown by 25 percent  
since 1993 -- more than any other age bracket, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill and Gayle Putt of Warrenton are among the Americans who  
have joined the RV culture in recent years. They strolled the 
showroom at Reines RV Center in Manassas recently, looking for 
something more spacious than their present 29-foot motor home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Putts -- he's 48 and she's 42 -- said that with three children  
and a dog, an RV allows the family to get away at a moment's notice 
on weekend trips, such as recent expeditions to Chesapeake Bay and 
North Carolina's Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the ability to go anywhere,'' Mrs. Putt said. ``It's  
great family time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Small, towable units cost as little as $3,300, while the largest  
motor homes can cost more than $300,000 and offer basement storage, 
washers and dryers, satellite dishes, VCRs and even hot tubs. Some 
have walls that, with the touch of a button, expand out several 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the 1970s and early 1980s, motor homes were generally  
looked down on, said Gerald Celente, head of the Trends Research 
Institute in Rhinebeck, N.Y., and author of Trends 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were for middle-America, retired blue-collar workers,''  
he said. ``After you did your time on the assembly line, heaven was 
driving around in your portable home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with sport utility vehicles crowding the roads, it's cool  
to own a gas guzzler, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans' love for SUVs means there are more vehicles on the  
roads that can tow non-motorized RVs, said Lindsey Reines, owner of 
Reines RV Center. Reines is so confident about his booming sales 
that he's expanded the size of his dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's roughly 8,000 commercial RV parks are also  
capitalizing on the trends by expanding and teaming with 
manufacturers to pitch RVs as a way of life. Some of these parks 
have become mini resorts with water slides, theme parks, organized 
day trips and shuttle buses to nearby attractions, said David 
Gorin, president of the National Association of RV Parks &AMP; 
Campgrounds in Falls Church. 
</P>
<P>
	A park near Gettysburg, Pa., is one of a handful that has Civil  
War-themed activities such as battlefield visits. Others have 
linked up with golf courses, and a campground in Ocean City, Md., 
called Frontier City has built an amusement park with a Wild West 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, Arizona and other winter roosts for seniors, RV  
parks are marketing themselves as a cheaper alternative to a 
vacation home. 
</P>
<P>
	RV parks also cater to city lovers. Cherry Hill Park in College  
Park, Md., is just off the Washington Beltway and has its own Metro 
stop with trains that connect it to the capital. Aquia Pines in 
Stafford, Va., runs buses into Washington, Gorin said. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who dislike RVs, hold on for a long ride.  
</P>
<P>
	``As the baby boomers age, the roads are going to be flooded  
with these things,'' Celente said. ``It's no longer looked upon as 
unhip to hog the road.''

<HEADLINE> 15 Workers Injured in La. Blasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAMERCY, La. (AP) -- A series of explosions heard for miles  
shook an aluminum plant early today, injuring at least 15 workers 
and spraying a caustic chemical over the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities told residents to stay indoors and close their  
windows. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was killed in the blast at the Kaiser Aluminum and  
Chemical Co. plant, said state police Sgt. William Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosions at about 5:15 a.m. occurred in a part of the  
plant where electricity is generated and where bauxite, a reddish 
and clay-like aluminum ore, is mixed with a liquid form of sodium 
hydroxide, a caustic chemical. 
</P>
<P>
	The blasts awakened people living miles from the plant, broke  
windows several miles away and knocked dishes off shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a jet airplane explosion,'' said Leon Millet,  
who lives about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The blasts sent a cloud of the bauxite-sodium hydroxide mixture  
into the air, and state police Lt. Mike Edmonson said some of it 
landed in residential yards within a mile of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities warned people not to touch the material, which can  
burn the skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone was accounted for at the plant 40 miles west of New  
Orleans, and none of the injuries was considered life-threatening, 
Edmonson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many roads around Gramercy remained closed by late morning. The  
plant may be shut down for months, St. Martin Parish Sheriff Willy 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers' injuries ranged from severe burns to difficulty  
breathing and eye irritation, WJBO-AM reported.

<HEADLINE> Braves Put Smoltz on Disabled List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Braves right-hander John Smoltz was put back on  
the 15-day disabled list Monday night with a strained right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz (8-3), who had surgery on the elbow in the winter of 1998  
and was on the DL twice last season despite a 17-3 record, also 
went on the DL on May 15 and came back June 1, going 3-2 with two 
no-decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz gave up 10 hits and seven runs in 6 1-3 innings in  
Sunday's loss to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's inflammation there and it needs rest,'' Smoltz said.  
``Hopefully it'll calm down and I'll be able to resume pitching 
soon. I'm not going to pick up a ball for 10 days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie left-hander Bruce Chen, who was 0-0 with a 4.50 ERA in  
two previous starts with Atlanta when Smoltz went on the DL earlier 
in the season, was recalled from Triple-A Richmond where he was 6-3 
with a 3.87 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz did not set a timetable for his return.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be able to pitch by the end of the year. That's my  
main goal,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also found out after Monday's 6-5 win over Florida  
that the injury to catcher Javy Lopez's right knee may be more 
serious than originally believed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, who strained his right knee while sliding into second  
base on an attempted steal on June 20 at Arizona, was placed on the 
15-day DL and is eligible to be activated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez, hitting .321 with 11 home runs and 37 RBIs in 56 games,  
took batting practice for the first time since the injury on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling pretty good. I can hit, but I can't squat,'' said  
Lopez, who was wearing a brace that ran from his thigh to his 
ankle, making it virtually impossible for him to catch. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if he would be out for the rest of the season, Lopez  
replied: ``I can't answer that question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He indicated that he might have a partial tear of a ligament in  
his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves orthopedic surgeon Dr. Joe Chandler, however, would not  
confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're treating the injury conservatively with rest and  
rehabilitation,'' he said. ``Hopefully, he'll be back in 1-2 
weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Perez has caught every game since Lopez was injured.  
Rookie catcher Pascual Matos was recalled from Triple-A Richmond on 
June 23, but has played sparingly, going hitless in three at-bats.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Receives Kerrey Endorsement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley received a  
key endorsement today from Sen. Bob Kerrey, who decided late last 
year not to seek the Democratic nomination for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill has the vision to challenge America to greatness and the  
integrity to restore the nation's faith in our public 
institutions,'' the Nebraska senator said at a breakfast in which 
he and Bradley shared pancake-flipping chores. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey and former New York  
Knicks basketball star, is making a solid fund-raising run against 
Vice President Al Gore. Bradley has raised about $11.5 million to 
Gore's $18.2 million in the first six months of the campaign. He 
trails in the polls, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey and Bradley will travel to Des Moines, Iowa, today, where  
precinct caucuses begin the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the political instability in the world around us and  
special concerns here at home, we need a leader like Bill who is 
not afraid to make the tough decisions,'' Kerrey said. ``He has the 
steady hand and foresight necessary to be an effective commander in 
chief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey is a decorated Vietnam war hero who unsuccessfully sought  
the Democratic nomination in 1992. He also has served as head of 
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Kerrey is an American hero,'' Bradley said. ``He is a man  
with unquestioned conviction and stands out in the Senate as a 
courageous leader on issues that define our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement did not come as a surprise. There have been  
tensions between Kerrey and the Clinton administration, and one 
reason Kerrey cited for not running in 2000 was Bradley's presence 
in the field giving Democrats a choice of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has the backing of much of the Democratic Party's  
establishment, including leaders in the House and Senate. Minnesota 
Sen. Paul Wellstone is the only other senator who has endorsed 
Bradley.

<HEADLINE> Hampton Skips Start With Sore Wrist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Houston Astros starter Mike Hampton was  
scratched from his scheduled start Monday because of a sore 
pitching wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampton, 10-3, hurt the wrist during batting practice a few days  
ago and it was still sore Monday. Interim manager Matt Galante said 
Hampton would be given a few more days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
	About two hours before the first pitch, the Astros announced  
that Chris Hold (1-8) would start in Hampton's place. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros already are short one starter. Sean Bergman was  
placed on the disabled list Saturday and Scott Elarton was moved 
out of the bullpen to take his place in the rotation. Elarton is 
expected to remain a starter at least through the All-Star break.

<HEADLINE> Penney's Pulls 'Offensive' T-Shirts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- J.C. Penney has decided to scrap a line of  
sports-themed T-shirts aimed at young men with lines that include 
``Your game is as ugly as your girl,'' and ``You like that move? So 
does your girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``trash talk'' line of apparel, manufactured by AND1  
Basketball, is offensive to women, according to a feminist group 
that complained to the department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a put-down of girls in the process of putting down a  
sports opponent,'' said Martha Burk, president of the Center for 
Advancement of Public Policy in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong implication is that girls are the property of boys  
to be traded like baseball cards,'' she said. ``It's an insulting, 
dehumanizing thing, and we have enough incivility in society 
without this gender-based stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burk said several people contacted her group to complain  
about the shirts, and that she later denounced the apparel in the 
center's newsletter, ``The Washington Feminist Faxnet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney Co. Inc. spokeswoman Stephanie Brown said the  
Plano-based retailer got enough complaints that it will no longer 
carry shirts that specifically target women. Other AND1 apparel 
will still be available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put the T-shirts out thinking we wouldn't have a problem,''  
Brown said. ``But we are having some concerns coming our way, and 
they are valid concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burk said she welcomed Penney's decision and will target  
other retailers, including Footlocker and Just for Feet, that still 
carry the shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with AND1, based in Pennsylvania, were not available  
for comment Monday. A recorded phone message said their offices 
were closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The company produces dozens of shirts with phrases such as  
``Turn on the disposal, your game's garbage.'' Most of them have 
nothing to do with gender. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview with Sports Illustrated, company president  
Seth Berger said, ``Trash talk is a crucial element of basketball, 
part of what makes it great and gives it flavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the first time that J.C. Penney has pulled T-shirts  
from the racks. In April, customer concerns led to the removal of 
shirts featuring South Park, the Comedy Central show about 
foul-mouthed grade-school children.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Encouraging Mrs. Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton will have to ``get  
out from under the cocoon of the White House'' and reach out to 
ordinary New Yorkers if she hopes to win the Senate seat being 
vacated by retiring Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democratic 
strategists in New York say. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton planned to filed papers Tuesday with the Federal  
Election Commission in Washington establishing an exploratory 
committee for a Senate run. That will allow Mrs. Clinton to raise 
and spend money for a Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, who has visited the state frequently in the past  
few months, will officially kick off her exploratory campaign 
Wednesday. The first stop in what aides are describing as a 
summer-long ``listening tour'' -- is Moynihan's farm near Oneonta, 
where he is expected to offer encouraging words. 
</P>
<P>
	``The listening tour will put her face-to-face with New Yorkers  
in small settings,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. 
Clinton's political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic strategists say that's just what she has to do.  
</P>
<P>
	``She has to get out from under the cocoon of the White House  
and the president,'' said William Cunningham, a former campaign 
manager for Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has to do it herself,'' former state Democratic Chairman  
John Marino said. ``It's time now to have the friends and advisers 
shut up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She doesn't need to spend time -- and I say this with all due  
respect as a former state chairman -- with people like us. She needs 
to spend time with people who are Democrats and independents and 
Republicans; who have kids in schools, parents who are sick and 
need care, and who worry about taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that might be difficult given the horde of 200 reporters,  
including television crews from Europe and Asia, who are expected 
to trail Mrs. Clinton around the state. 
</P>
<P>
	To accommodate the journalists, a large wooden platform was  
constructed on the bucolic Moynihan farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spent Monday in Orlando, Fla., where she received  
an award from the National Education Association. 
</P>
<P>
	She would be the first first lady to run for public office. She  
is not expected to have any opposition in the Democratic primary. 
On the Republican side, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has 
already formed a Senate exploratory committee and raised almost $3 
million. Rep. Rick Lazio also is considering a race for the GOP 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are quick to raise the ``carpetbagger'' issue. Mrs.  
Clinton has never lived nor worked in New York, but aides say she 
is looking for a New York residence. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other handicaps facing a first lady seeking to get in  
touch with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to have to somehow or other break through that  
Secret Service cocoon and show that she's not just the great 
lady,'' Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling 
Institute, explained. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's four-day visit takes Mrs. Clinton into the heart of  
Republican strength, upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be met in Binghamton by Republicans staging a contest  
that offers a weekend at a resort in the Adirondack Mountains for 
whoever shows up in the best fly costume. That is designed to 
remind voters of a New York Daily News report two weeks ago quoting 
an unidentified adviser to the first lady saying she wouldn't be 
vacationing this year in the ``fly-infested Adirondack Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said that because of Giuliani's strength in the  
politically crucial suburbs, Mrs. Clinton must try to cut into the 
traditionally strong GOP upstate vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``This might be an honest-to-God retail campaign,'' said  
Carroll. ``You might see -- because of the length of the campaign 
and the fact that both are celebrities -- that they may have to 
reach out and go to people one-on-one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton is expected to run well in traditionally  
Democratic New York City, it is in the suburban counties around the 
city where she could meet her electoral Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giuliani is unbelievably strong in the suburbs,'' Marino said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people who live out there like what's happened in the  
city,'' Cunningham explained. ``If she is going to a 
quality-of-life campaign -- which is what the (suburban) soccer mom 
thing was all about -- he's the guy who made quality of life the 
watchword in New York City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps to counter Giuliani's suburban strength, Mrs. Clinton is  
said to be looking at homes in Westchester County just north of the 
city. She has already rented office space in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Asia Gains Half-Berth in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The third-place team in Asian qualifying will  
play a team from Europe for the final berth in the 2002 World Cup, 
averting a threatened boycott by the Asians, a member of FIFA's 
executive committee said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Japan and South Korea qualifying automatically as co-hosts,  
just two teams were set to advance from the Asian qualifying 
tournament. Those two nations and Saudi Arabia qualified for last 
year's tournament in France along with Iran, which won a playoff 
with Australia for the final spot. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, FIFA decided Europe would get 15 spots in the  
32-nation field, including defending champion France. If the change 
gains approved, which is expected at Tuesday's FIFA executive 
committee meeting, the 14th team in Europe qualifying must play the 
third-place team in Asia qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	South America gets four spots, and its fifth-place team will  
play the Oceania champion for another spot. 
</P>
<P>
	North and Central America and the Caribbean gets three spots and  
Africa five.

<HEADLINE> Newsmagazines Take On Different Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A ship heads out to some Atlantic Ocean fishing  
spots and never returns. A disabled man tries to climb Mount 
Everest. A scientist descends into the belly of an active volcano 
for research. 
</P>
<P>
	They sound like the pitches for some promising movies. Instead,  
these story lines feature in the summer's entertaining new crop of 
TV newsmagazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Adventure! Mystery! Suspense!  
</P>
<P>
	Serious network journalists never used to worry about Hollywood  
storytelling devices. But the summer network schedule suggests 
times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC News is producing a six-week replacement series,  
``Vanished,'' that features true tales of people who disappeared: 
the crew of the Atlantic fishing vessel profiled in the 
best-seller, ``The Perfect Storm''; and a man who twice walked away 
from his life and all who knew him. 
</P>
<P>
	At CBS, the newsmagazine ``48 Hours'' added ``48 Hours Monday  
Mysteries'' that plumbs unresolved true stories, many of them 
updates of previous features on network news programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It has done so well in the ratings that CBS begins ``48 Hours  
Tuesday Adventures'' starting tomorrow. The show will revisit 
stories like the mountain climber with one leg and a New Yorker who 
travels to Spain each year for the running of the bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Both shows are at 10 p.m. EDT.  
</P>
<P>
	Newsmagazines are particularly important to networks in the  
summer. Their ratings tend to go up, or at least not shrink as much 
as the reruns of comedies and dramas. Since they're cheap to 
produce, Hollywood executives are increasingly calling news 
divisions to plug holes in the prime-time schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``The West Coast sees that the audience loves reality  
programming,'' said Susan Zirinsky, executive producer of ``48 
Hours.'' ``It's a good way for the news division to fill a need. 
It's the best of both worlds. We love to do it and they like the 
product.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Dateline NBC'' on five times a week and ``20/20'' four,  
newsmagazines must do something to distinguish themselves, said 
Russ Ptacek, publisher of NewsTV Report, a newsletter that monitors 
the content of these shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes just plain ``48 Hours'' won't do.  
</P>
<P>
	``Vanished'' is something of an experiment, as ABC News tries to  
apply to non-fiction the same storytelling techniques viewers are 
familiar with from dramas or magazines, said Phyllis McGrady, the 
network executive in charge of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a long time, documentaries weren't keeping up with the  
pace of what viewers like to see in other mediums,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each ``Vanished'' is an original show. While the ``48 Hours''  
editions are based on reruns, each contains new footage that 
updates the story. 
</P>
<P>
	The danger for these organizations is in letting entertainment  
values override news judgment. Are any reputations being 
compromised by making shows that appeal to Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider these to be entertaining, but I don't consider them  
to be entertainment,'' McGrady said. ``On the other hand, I watched 
`The Practice' the other night and it almost seemed like news. 
There's an interesting blurring of the lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS's Zirinsky said that between her, ``60 Minutes'' executive  
producer Don Hewitt and ``60 Minutes II'' executive producer Jeff 
Fager, ``you couldn't get any more old school. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing that we do that's compromised,'' she said.  
``And I don't say that lightly, because it's something that we talk 
about all the time. I'm always worried that we're considered the 
stodgy ones. I don't think this hurts us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the special editions bolsters her independence,  
Zirinsky said. ``We don't feel the pressures of entertainment to do 
certain kinds of stories,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra hours on the air convey another benefit, giving ``48  
Hours'' a greater ``quick strike'' capability to tackle breaking 
news subjects in prime time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	That responsiveness is something that ``Dateline NBC'' prides  
itself on. ``Dateline'' isn't attempting any repackaging of its own 
for the summer. Its only new wrinkle is to devote Friday nights to 
hour-long documentaries on weighty topics like welfare reform and 
gambling addiction, said Neal Shapiro, executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro doesn't see anything wrong with telling compelling  
stories in dramatic fashion. Ptacek also doesn't mind the breezy 
new summer style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the product is being diluted,'' he said, ``so  
much as the product is offering additional flavors.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Has Most ATMs in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- The Asia-Pacific region has the most automated  
teller machines in the world, a news report said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asia-Pacific had 275,007 ATMs as of 1998, 34.4 percent of  
the world's total, The Straits Times newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Europe was second with 218,394, or 27.2 percent, the  
newspaper said, while North America was third with 214,832, or 26.8 
percent. The paper quoted statistics from Retail Banking Research 
in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan had the world's highest concentration of ATMs, with  
1,079.7 per million people in 1997, the most recent year for which 
density statistics were given. South Korea was second at 791 per 
million, and Spain was third with 761.4 per million. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of ATMs worldwide grew by 14 percent to some 802,000  
in 1998, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Blaze Across West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Utah (AP) -- Residents of the neighboring towns of Eureka  
and Mammoth were allowed back into their homes after a Fourth of 
July filled with fire, not fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
	High winds spread a wildfire over roughly 61,400 acres near the  
two towns, about 55 miles south of Salt Lake City, twice driving 
residents from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	By Sunday night crews had the fire 70 percent contained and  
hoped changing winds forecast for today would help fire fighters 
make further headway. 
</P>
<P>
	``No homes were burned,'' Linda Jackson, spokeswoman for the  
Richfield Interagency Fire Center said Sunday. ``Yesterday all the 
resources were deployed to protect those communities, but by today 
they were able to move some of the resources to other areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the blaze made for a tense weekend for Mammoth residents.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're scared to death,'' said Phyllis Corbett on Saturday.  
``Everything we have is all gone. We got everything loaded, we're 
taking everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corbett freed her pigeons before leaving, knowing the birds  
would return if their coop didn't burn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting to go numb,'' said Mammoth resident Cheryl  
Wahlberg. ``I cry and then I'm OK ... It's hard. I'm absolutely 
terrified of fire, so I don't want to be in there, but I don't want 
to leave either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 427 fire fighters were battling the blaze Sunday evening,  
including several 20-person crews, four helicopters, 35 engines, 
five bulldozers and two water trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began in a patch of grass along some railroad tracks.  
It was fanned by 50 mph wind gusts and was spread when a tanker 
truck containing 11,000 gallons of diesel fuel exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews evacuated the entire town of Mammoth on Friday. The town's  
60 residents were allowed to return home Saturday before the fire 
shifted toward the town again forcing another evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service senior forecaster Peter Wilensky  
predicted the firefighters would get some relief today. Winds were 
expected to shift, blowing the flames back over the charred ground, 
meaning less fuel for the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	State Highways 6 and 36, which the fire had closed were reopened  
Sunday. Little Sahara Recreation Area, a popular recreation area, 
was also opened, although people were being discouraged from 
visiting the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Separate fires in Utah and Colorado also connected Sunday and  
were burning 8,000 acres of forest, grass and sage. People were 
warned to stay away from a popular rafting area on the Colorado 
River called Ruby Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in northern California, just as firefighters gained  
the upper hand after a two-day battle against a 2,000-acre 
wildfire, a second blaze goaded by dry winds briefly forced the 
evacuations of 30 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	A forest fire 7 miles west of downtown Redding had charred only  
125 acres, but about a dozen people camped out at a nearby school 
overnight. The fire was contained this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt and no structures were damaged in the fire, said  
Elmer Benson, spokesman with the California Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just hit it with everything we had,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Near Lewiston, a federal brush-thinning fire that roared out of  
control Friday and damaged two dozen homes was 75 percent 
contained. It had forced 500 people to flee and scorched 2,000 
acres.

<HEADLINE> Behrens Wins Graded Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Behrens took another forward step in his Horse  
of the Year bid with an impressive 2 3/4-length victory in the 
$400,000 Grade I Suburban Handicap on a hot and humid Monday at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the fourth straight for the 5-year-old horse. The  
others were in the Grade II Mass' Cap at Suffolk Downs May 29, 
Grade I Oaklawn Handicap April 3 at Oaklawn Park and the Grade I 
Gulfstream Park Handicap Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens covered 1 1/4 miles in 2:01 on the fast track to earn  
$240,000 for Budlein Stable and William L. Clifton. He paid $2.60, 
$2.30 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Catienus paid $9.10 and $2.10, and Social Charter was $2.10.  
</P>
<P>
	Ridden aggressively by Jorge Chavez while carrying high weight  
of 121 pounds, Behrens was kept close to the pace early, took over 
with three furlongs remaining, and went the rest of the way 
unthreatened. 
</P>
<P>
	The order of finish was completed by Golden Missile, Well Noted,  
Baytown, Hanarsaan and Brushing Up. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning trainer H. James Bond acknowledged that he had been  
concerned about the oppressive heat and its possible effect on 
Behrens but said ``This is one heck of a horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably the luckiest man in the world to have this horse  
in training,'' Bond added. ``He's getting better and better. This 
is his distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behrens next start, however, will be the 1 1/8-mile Whitney Aug. 1  
at Saratoga in which he is scheduled to meet the tough Victory 
Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's coming to our home court,'' Bond said. ``Behrens likes  
Saratoga, and he'll be pretty tough up there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former New York Jets defensive end Mark  
Gastineau was arrested Monday for violating an order of protection 
in an ongoing domestic dispute, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gastineau, 42, surrendered at a Queens precinct stationhouse and  
remained in custody awaiting arraignment on a charge of criminal 
contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-NFL star allegedly violated a court order on June 22 by  
going to his wife's Queens home, where he repeatedly rang the 
doorbell and refused to leave, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gastineau was sentenced last October to three months probation  
after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge for hitting 
his wife. He had been arrested a month earlier for hitting his 
then-fiancee, Patricia Schorr, at a Manhattan apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gastineau was charged with misdemeanor assault, menacing and  
criminal possession of a weapon. The court complaint said the 
weapon was a glass cocktail table with which he threatened to hit 
Schorr. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Gastineau's guilty plea, Schorr said she had  
married him in late September. She also refused to cooperate in the 
prosecution of her husband.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- A delegation of Taiwanese officials  
came to their sister city looking forward to a weekend of picnics 
and Fourth of July fireworks displays. 
</P>
<P>
	They also saw Bloomington on one of its darkest days.  
</P>
<P>
	The group from Lu Jou, Taiwan, was in the college town Sunday,  
the same day a Korean graduate student was shot twice in the back 
and killed outside a church by a white supremacist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday really sent a shock wave through our community,''  
said Bloomington Mayor John Fernandez, on the verge of tears Monday 
morning. ``It broke up what should have been a celebratory day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's shooting, police escorted the delegation to a  
picnic and fireworks display. Fernandez spent most of Monday 
entertaining the five-member delegation, trying to make them feel 
at ease. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington and Lu Jou have been sister cities for 10 years, but  
this was the first time Mayor Chein-Hui ``David'' Huang had visited 
Bloomington, a city 60 miles southwest of Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang, in town for a cultural and educational exchange, said the  
killing did nothing to affect his opinion of Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bloomington is a peaceful city,'' he said. ``All the people  
here were very kind. The city is beautiful.''

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady To Form Senate Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton must break away from  
being first lady if she is to have a shot at winning a New York 
Senate seat, say veterans of the state's political wars. And she 
plans to start a tour of the state to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving ever closer to a historic candidacy, Mrs. Clinton planned  
to form a Senate exploratory committee today that could lead to her 
becoming the only first lady to ever run for public office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's political staff said an attorney for the first  
lady would file the paperwork with the Federal Election Commission 
to form the committee. That will allow her to raise and spend money 
in preparation for her possible Senate run in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate seat is being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel  
Patrick Moynihan. On the Republican side, New York City Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani has already formed a Senate exploratory committee 
and raised almost $3 million toward the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Mrs. Clinton must establish herself to challenge him,  
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has to get out from under the cocoon of the White House  
and the president,'' said William Cunningham, a former Moynihan 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-day swing across central and eastern New York that begins  
Wednesday with a flight to Binghamton and a drive to the Moynihan 
farm near Oneonta is part of the plan to do that, aides to Mrs. 
Clinton say. The first lady's foray is the kickoff of what aides 
are billing as a summer-long ``listening tour'' by Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The listening tour will put her face-to-face with New Yorkers  
in small settings,'' Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's 
political organization, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Praising the idea of getting out and listening to what he called  
``real people,'' former state Democratic Chairman John Marino said: 
``She has to do it herself. It's time now to have the friends and 
advisers shut up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just how small and intimate Mrs. Clinton's gatherings will be is  
open to question. About 200 members of the news media, including 
television crews from Asia and Europe, are expected along for this 
week's trip and there are other handicaps facing a first lady 
seeking to get in touch with the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to have to somehow or other break through that  
Secret Service cocoon and show that she's not just the great 
lady,'' Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling 
Institute, explained. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's visit takes Mrs. Clinton into the heart of  
Republican strength, the upstate area north of New York City and 
the suburban counties surrounding it. The reception may not always 
be warm. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, she will be met in Binghamton by Republicans  
staging a contest that offers a weekend at a resort in the 
Adirondack Mountains for whoever shows up in the best fly costume. 
That is designed to remind voters of a New York Daily News report 
two weeks ago quoting an unidentified adviser to the first lady 
saying she wouldn't be vacationing this year in the ``fly-infested 
Adirondack Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Cunningham said that because of Giuliani's strength  
in the politically crucial suburbs, Mrs. Clinton must try to cut 
into the traditionally strong GOP upstate vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollster Carroll said that could make for ``an honest-to-God  
retail campaign. You might see -- because of the length of the 
campaign and the fact that both are celebrities -- that they may 
have to reach out and go to people one-on-one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton is expected to run well in traditionally  
Democratic New York City, it is in the suburban counties around the 
city where she could meet her electoral Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giuliani is unbelievably strong in the suburbs,'' Marino said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The people who live out there like what's happened in the  
city,'' Cunningham explained. ``If she is going to a 
quality-of-life campaign -- which is what the (suburban) soccer mom 
thing was all about -- he's the guy who made quality of life the 
watchword in New York City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps to counter Giuliani's suburban strength, Mrs. Clinton is  
said to be looking at homes in Westchester County just north of the 
city. She has already rented office space in Manhattan.

<HEADLINE> Hopes High for Cystic Fibrosis Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Every day for a week, Dannon Baker swallowed a  
little white pill as part of an experiment to see if a new type of 
therapy will finally attack the cause of deadly cystic fibrosis 
rather than just treat its symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies of three drugs called ``gene assist therapies'' are in  
their early stages, experts caution. But, if they work, Baker and 
other patients could expect more normal lives by using a daily 
medicine to control a genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great time,'' says Dr. Pamela Zeitlin of Johns  
Hopkins University, which is testing two of the gene-assist drugs. 
``None of these drugs are cures -- they would have to be continually 
taken. But it's a very good idea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That promise led the 24-year-old Baker to volunteer for the  
study of one drug candidate, a relative of caffeine called CPX. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, taking a medicine for a week isn't going to change  
my life,'' said the Atlanta woman, who, like the scientists, will 
not learn the study's results until fall. ``But down the road, it 
might.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cystic fibrosis afflicts about 30,000 American children and  
young adults. The disease attacks patients' lungs with a thick 
mucus and most die from lung damage or infection. CF also harms 
digestion and vitamin absorption by clogging other organs, and 
causes patients to excrete high levels of salt through sweat. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatments to fight lung infections and improve nutrition have  
improved care dramatically. But they treat only symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	In the majority of patients, CF's damage stems from a single  
genetic defect: It skews a protein called CFTR that is responsible 
for balancing the salt content of cells lining the lungs and 
certain other organs. 
</P>
<P>
	CFTR is supposed to travel to a cell's surface to create  
openings, or channels, for chloride ions to exit the cell. But if 
CFTR is mutated, it dies before ever reaching the surface, so 
chloride cannot escape. The chloride then mixes with sodium inside 
cells and a resulting salt buildup prompts the dangerous mucus 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene-assist drugs would circumvent this, not by curing the  
genetic defect but by helping the mutated protein work more 
normally. 
</P>
<P>
	CPX, the candidate furthest in testing, ``provides eyeglasses  
and a cane to help (the mutated protein) find its way through the 
cell and do its work,'' said Dr. Harvey Pollard, who discovered the 
drug while at the National Institutes of Health. Although the drug 
is related to caffeine, caffeine itself does not help cystic 
fibrosis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug binds to mutated CFTR and chaperones it to the cell  
surface. Once there, even defective CFTR can shuttle out a little 
chloride. But CPX also boosts the protein's power to open chloride 
channels. That double whammy excites the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation, which is helping to fund CPX's development. 
</P>
<P>
	``CPX was able to induce a massive secretion of chloride from  
these CF cells'' in test-tube studies, said Pollard. ``At that 
point, we realized we had something really good going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now the question is whether the drug works in patients the way  
it did in Pollard's laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	SciClone Pharmaceuticals, a California biotechnology company,  
licensed CPX from the government and is sponsoring clinical trials 
to find out. Test results are expected in several months. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other possible gene-assist drugs are in earlier clinical  
trials: 
</P>
<P>
	--Johns Hopkins is testing phenylbutyrate, a drug that also helps  
chaperone mutated CFTR to the cell surface. A pilot trial suggests 
the drug could partially restore chloride transport in key cells. 
</P>
<P>
	--Duramycin is a failed antibiotic that researchers recently  
discovered also may help cystic fibrosis, allowing chloride to 
escape cells by a different route so it does not need the mutated 
CFTR. First-stage testing of an inhaled version is to begin this 
fall, Zeitlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists hope gene therapy to correct the cystic fibrosis  
defect might eventually cure the disease, but progress is slow. 
That is why doctors are anxiously watching this new gene-assist 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we're waiting around for gene therapy ... we have got to  
do something,'' Pollard said. ``This is something that could 
actually work.''

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Launches Currency Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- Bulgaria lopped three zeroes off its  
currency on Monday and introduced new bills in a reform aimed at 
simplifying accounting and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Monday, 1.9098 leva bought one U.S. dollar.  
</P>
<P>
	Under a currency board Bulgaria enacted in its central bank two  
years ago, the lev was pegged at 1,000 to the German mark and later 
at 1,955.83 to the euro. Now those exchange rates move to one lev 
for one German mark and 1.95583 leva per euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform doesn't change the purchasing power of the lev, as  
prices were adjusted accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
	New 1, 2, 5, 20 and 50 leva bills are replacing the previous  
100, 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 50,000 leva bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the new and old currencies will circulate until the end of  
the year. After that, the central bank will take the old leva out 
of circulation but continue to exchange them for new ones.

<HEADLINE> Magicalmysterycat Gives Lukas Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Magicalmysterycat defeated She's Classy  
by three lengths to win Monday's $103,096 Landaluce Stakes, giving 
trainer D. Wayne Lukas his sixth victory in the Grade II race at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Magicalmysterycat, ridden by Chris Antley, covered six furlongs  
in 1:11 and paid $4 and $2.60. She's Classy returned $2.80 to 
place. There was no show wagering because of the four-horse field. 
Princes Melissa was another length back in third and Desert End was 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her natural speed was good enough to get the lead,'' Antley  
said. ``Right now, of all the 2-year-old fillies who have shown 
themselves, she's right near the top. So far, her ability has been 
enough to keep her unbeaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $63,120, increased Magicalmysterycat's career  
earnings to $132,780. She's undefeated in three races. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas won the Landaluce, renamed for the undefeated filly he  
trained, for the sixth time and first since he saddled Serena's 
Song in 1994. Landaluce died of a blood disorder in 1983 and is 
buried in the track's infield. She won the race, then called the 
Hollywood Lassie Stakes, by 21 lengths in 1983 and set the stakes 
record of 1:08. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was probably the most brilliant horse we've ever been  
around,'' Lukas said. ``Every once in a while when we're feeling a 
little down, we plug in that old tape and watch her waltz down 
through there like she did in this race.''

<HEADLINE> Motive Sought in Shooting Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At times, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith looked the  
part of a skinhead -- the words ``Sabbath Breaker'' tattooed on his 
chest and his head sometimes shaven. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say he also played the part, blanketing neighborhoods and  
university campuses with hate-filled fliers mostly aimed at Jewish, 
black and Asian people. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities and acquaintances wondered Monday what would  
drive a rich kid -- described as hateful but publicly reserved and 
even ``very polite'' -- to go on a two-state shooting spree that 
would leave two people dead and at least eight wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed mad at the world,'' said Tyrese Alexander, one of  
Smith's neighbors in Bloomington, Ind., and a fellow student at 
Indiana University, where Smith had been a criminal justice major. 
``But I had no idea it would end like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, grew up in a posh neighborhood in suburban Wilmette --  
a country club world full of big houses, expensive cars and 
influence. The eldest son of a doctor and real estate agent, he 
attended New Trier High School, one of the wealthiest public 
schools in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say his father, Kenneth, could be hard to warm to and  
even withdrawn. But Sid Condit, a 61-year-old attorney and the 
family's neighbor in Wilmette, called Smith's mother, Beverly, ``a 
wonderful person -- soccer Mom 101.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Smiths, who have two younger sons, moved about two years ago  
to nearby Northfield, into a smaller house but one with a swimming 
pool and private tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
	They have declined to talk to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're totally shocked and devastated,'' Condit  
said. ``They're probably in church praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hints that Smith had a streak of rebellion popped up in a high  
school yearbook, where his entry carried the slogan ``Sic Semper 
Tyrannis'' -- or ``Thus ever to tyrants.'' Those are said to be the 
words John Wilkes Booth spoke after shooting Abraham Lincoln and a 
phrase on a T-shirt worn by Timothy McVeigh the day he bombed the 
federal building in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's brushes with the law began in October 1997, when  
University of Illinois records show he was reprimanded for 
marijuana possession and for fighting in his room, including one 
report of domestic violence against a female student. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, he met with the dean of students and was put on  
``conduct probation,'' according to university records. He also 
agreed to attend counseling, an ethics class and to do community 
service, said Bill Murphy, a university spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith began that process but got into more trouble for putting  
up racist posters in his dorm and eventually was called back into 
the dean's office for allegedly peeping in dorm windows and 
carrying unspecified weapons, records show. 
</P>
<P>
	He withdrew the next day, Feb. 14, 1998, ``because he was going  
to be expelled,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said a notation was put on Smith's transcript -- ``a red  
flag for anybody'' -- but he didn't know if officials at Indiana 
University, where Smith completed his sophomore year in May, had 
seen the transcripts or the notation. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard McKaig, Indiana's dean of students, said he didn't have  
access to Smith's admissions records on Monday, a holiday, but said 
his university considers applications of transfer students on 
non-academic probation, like Smith's, on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	While Alexander and others said they were shocked by the  
shootings, one of Smith's ex-girlfriends seemed unsurprised by his 
violent end. Authorities say he fatally shot himself in the chin 
late Sunday as he fled police in southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``The things he was doing were not working -- distributing  
pamphlets and things. It wasn't stirring up news or making 
headlines,'' said Elizabeth Sahr. ``He wanted to make a name for 
himself, to show people that this could be done if you wanted to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``This was the Fourth of July. This was his freedom  
day from the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sahr said she ended her one-year relationship with Smith  
because he was abusive and racist. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would spout out anti-Semitic things, about white  
supremacy,'' she said. ``He would talk about getting groups of 
people together to overtake the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith took with him many unanswered questions, which  
investigators from a task force in the north Chicago suburbs are 
attempting to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave few clues, if any, in April, when he testified in front  
of a board considering Matt Hale's appeal for a law license. Hale 
is leader of the World Church of the Creator, a white supremacist 
group that counted Smith as a member from June 1998 until May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our number one goal is to straighten out the white man's  
thinking,'' Smith told the panel. ``We're the new minority being 
crushed left and right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a navy suit, Smith admitted he had ``considered violent  
acts to achieve racial goals, but Hale counseled me to act 
peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the board rejected Hale's appeal, saying his beliefs  
and character make him ill-suited to practice law in Illinois. 
</P>

and spraying a caustic chemical over the area. Authorities told 
residents to stay indoors and close their windows. No one was 
killed in the blast at the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Co. plant, 
said a state police officer. The explosions at about 5:15 a.m. 
occurred in an area where electricity is generated and where 
bauxite, a reddish and clay-like aluminum ore, is mixed with a

<HEADLINE> Pyrotechnic Blowups Kill Four People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Holiday weekend fireworks accidents killed four people as  
pyrotechnics displays misfired or blew up prematurely in two towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the victims were fatally injured in Centerville, Ark.,  
when one fireworks shell exploded just after it was launched 
Sunday, shooting a fireball into the open door of a trailer where 
more fireworks were being assembled. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a dud that went about treetop high and then went  
off,'' said witness Roy Tillman. ``Then the whole thing blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion took place about a quarter-mile from spectators.  
</P>
<P>
	Two teen-agers were killed in the blast, and a 32-year-old man  
died Monday at a Little Rock hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Walls, a supervisor at Henderson Specialties, the company  
that put on the show, said the youths who died were relatives of 
the company's owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took as many precautions as we could,'' Walls said.  
</P>
<P>
	In Peoria, Ariz., stacks of fireworks started detonating Sunday  
while workers from the Salt Lake City-based Lantis Fireworks were 
still unloading them for a Fourth of July show there, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One worker suffered burns over 90 percent of her body and died  
Monday. Four others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The blasts shook windows a half-mile away.  
</P>
<P>
	``There must've been 50 to 60 explosions,'' said Chris Powell,  
who was setting up his camera across the street to photograph the 
display. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, officials in Gardendale, Ala., were investigating  
whether fireworks caused a house fire that left five family members 
dead Monday. The family, including three children ages 6 to 10, had 
apparently shot off fireworks in their yard late Sunday, Deputy 
Fire Chief Robert Ryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze appeared to have started in garbage cans outside the  
house, then spread to the dining room and filled the house with 
smoke, Ryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, seven people suffered minor injuries in a fireworks  
mishap at West Bend, Wis.; a 13-year-old boy was in critical 
condition Monday after being struck in the face by fireworks in 
Washington's Snohomish County; and a teen-ager lost the tips of his 
fingers to a large firecracker at Martha Lake, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	In Dilworth, Minn., 20-year-old Terry Engel lost his right index  
finger when a cherry bomb exploded in his hand. He also was charged 
with disorderly conduct because police believe he intended to toss 
the device into a squad car.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- China coach Ma Yuanan doesn't expect the  
Wo,0573men's World Cup final to be a repeat of his team's Fourth 
of July humbling of Norway.  
</P>
<P>
	He'd be happy enough if it was a repeat of April 25.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the last time China met the United States team that it  
will face again in Saturday's World Cup gold medal game in 
Pasadena, Calif. And China won that one 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has beaten the U.S.A. already twice (this year),''  
Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said Sunday after China shut out the 
Norwegians 5-0 at Foxboro Stadium to advance to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they will be the favorites in the final. But they will  
meet a very enthusiastic U.S. team. So I think that will be an 
interesting fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Ailing and Sun Wen scored two goals apiece -- scoring once  
each in the first 14 minutes to give China control early on a hot, 
sweaty night. The Chinese took a 3-0 lead six minutes into the 
second half on Liu's second goal, which was assisted by Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	And Norway still hadn't gotten a shot on goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to dictate the way the game was played,'' China  
goalkeeper Gao Hong said. ``We play with a sense of spiritual 
unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was enough to win by the biggest margin in World Cup  
semifinal history and match the largest defeat in Norway soccer 
history. The loss left the Norwegians out of the final for the 
first time in the three World Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no possibility to show our best'' because of the early  
deficit, said Norway defender Linda Medalen, whose team will play 
for third place against Brazil, a 2-0 loser to the United States 
earlier Sunday in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship game will be a rematch of the 1996 Olympic gold  
medal game that the United States won 2-1. Since then, the teams 
have met six more times, with the United States holding the 
advantage, three games to two, with one tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that the United States is one of the  
strongest teams in the world,'' the Chinese coach said. ``But the 
Chinese have played them three times (this year) and hold a 2-1 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will have a tough time if China dominates the ball  
as it did Sunday in stopping Norway's 10-game World Cup winning 
streak -- a streak that dates to the final of the 1991 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a hard game'' for the Americans, said the  
34-year-old defender, who is one of three Norway players remaining 
from the 1991 team. ``The two best teams are in the final, no doubt 
about that. ... I look forward to seeing (it).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gao, the Chinese keeper, was rarely tested in the first half  
when Norway was outshot 11-0. The Norwegians had a 12-9 shooting 
advantage in the second half as they substituted and strategized to 
increase their offense, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, China closed in often on Norwegian keeper Bente  
Nordby, scoring on its first two chances with goals by Sun in the 
third minute and Liu in the 14th. 
</P>
<P>
	Six minutes into the second half, Liu scored again with a  
12-yard left-footed volley after a Norwegian defender tried to 
clear a corner kick into the box. Fan Yunjie made it 4-0 in the 
65th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun also scored on a penalty kick after a hand ball in the box  
in the 72nd minute to tie Sissi of Brazil for the tournament lead 
with seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hasn't thought about that (the scoring lead) at all,'' Sun  
said through an interpreter. ``Her whole outlook has been to play 
with the team and to win.''

<HEADLINE>  Steels Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-NAZAIRE, France (AP) -- With some top riders caught behind  
a crash on an ocean causeway, Tom Steels of Belgium won the second 
stage of the Tour de France on Monday and Lance Armstrong of Texas 
lost the overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American, Jonathan Vaughters, fractured his chin in the  
crash and had to retire from cycling's showcase race. Estonia's 
Jaan Kirsipuu was second in Monday's stage and took the leader's 
yellow jersey from Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill happened on the Passage du Gois, which connects a  
small island to the mainland in the coastal Atlantic Vendee region. 
The strip of land is no more than two car lengths wide and is 
closed during high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	The road proved treacherous for such favorites as Alex Zulle,  
Michael Boogerd and Ivan Gotti. They lost valuable minutes when 
they were behind the 10-rider crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughters and Armstrong both ride for the U.S. Postal Service  
team. Armstrong, recovering from testicular cancer, is second 
overall. He is in excellent position for Sunday's time trial and 
the later mountain climbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to stay out of trouble until the real race begins  
on Sunday with the time trial,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu earned bonus points in winning two of the day's three  
sprints. In third and fourth place were sprinter Mario Cipollini of 
Italy and Germany's Erik Zabel. 
</P>
<P>
	In another strong showing for U.S. Postal, George Hincapie came  
in sixth and is seventh overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughters was taken to a hospital in Nantes, as was Marc  
Wauters, who also is out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash wasn't the first of the day -- there was an earlier  
mishap at 21 miles involving 30 riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of vacationers lined the roads through the 109-mile  
stage, which came at the beginning of the summer holiday for many 
of the French. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers set up folding chairs and elaborate picnic tables  
along the road and leaned out of balconies in small villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the occasional anti-drug banner -- ``Say No to EPO'' --  
many fans showed support for French cycling star Richard Virenque. 
He is under investigation for last year's race that was nearly cut 
short because of the drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allez Richard -- We Forgive You,'' said one banner held by two  
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Race organizers say there will be spot drug tests during the  
coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong won the world championship in 1993 and competed in the  
Olympics in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that  
had spread to his lungs and brain. He had surgery to remove his 
right testicle and brain lesions, and returned to racing early last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday he thought the drug scandal was ``exaggerated and  
overblown.'' He also complained of what he said were aggressive 
tactics during last year's drug busts by French police. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think that nobody here has anything to hide,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE>  United States 2, Brazil 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- As the ball floated temptingly toward  
the U.S. net, the huge crowd collectively gasped. American players 
turned and stared at the one woman who could save them. 
</P>
<P>
	And Briana Scurry did just that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never a doubt,'' defender Kate Sobrero said after Scurry made  
the first of several spectacular saves Sunday, preserving the 
United States' 2-0 victory over Brazil and earning a berth in the 
Women's World Cup final against China. ``We know that if we need 
it, Bri is going to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans needed it before 73,123 on the Fourth of July,  
when their usual offensive fireworks often turned into duds. Scurry 
tipped that shot by Brazil's Nene from 35 yards just over the 
crossbar early in the second half. Later, Scurry barely got a hand 
on Nene's kick in the 56th minute and made a sprawling two-handed 
stop on Pretinha in the 83rd. 
</P>
<P>
	So while the attack generally sputtered as the grind of playing  
two games in less than three full days affected both sides, Scurry 
stood firm for her 52nd career shutout and third of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any game where I can do my part and get my team in the final  
of the Women's World Cup is my best game,'' said Scurry, who also 
backstopped the Americans to a 1996 Olympic gold medal, then 
streaked through the streets of Athens, Ga. -- for a few seconds -- 
in celebration. ``I definitely think today was my best effort in 
five years of playing with the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she might need another such display in Saturday's final at  
the Rose Bowl. China routed Norway, the defending champion, 5-0 in 
the other semifinal in Foxboro, Mass., and has looked like the best 
team in the field throughout the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the United States has been inconsistent.  
</P>
<P>
	Against Brazil, which U.S. coach Tony DiCicco once again called  
``the most improved team in our sport,'' there was little flow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think fatigue probably played a part,'' said U.S. star Mia  
Hamm, who created a few scoring opportunities and was fouled in the 
penalty area, setting up Michelle Akers' 80th-minute penalty kick 
goal. ``Both teams are pretty emotional, attacking teams. We both 
had our surges where we would be in their end for 15 or 20 minutes, 
then they would be near our goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But every time the Brazilians got close, Scurry was too good.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to keep them under wraps,'' Scurry said. ``Brazil's  
going to get their chances no matter how well you play defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just know that when the shots go up, I have to be there. I  
feel I really helped our team out to win today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For once, the Americans got going quickly, thanks to a misplay  
by Brazil keeper Maravilha. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Foudy's long cross went directly to the goalie. But as she  
leaped for it, the ball went off her hands into the air and Cindy 
Parlow headed it home in the fifth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been behind in some games and had to come back,'' Parlow  
said. ``This time, we concentrated on not falling behind and it 
made things a lot easier for us to play our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was tight until Carla Overbeck's goal kick was headed  
downfield by Akers to Hamm, who broke into the penalty area. She 
was nudged by Brazil captain Elane and went down. Referee Katriina 
Elovirta signaled the penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``FIFA should punish the referee,'' Brazil coach Wilson de  
Oliveira said. ``In such a match of importance, to have poor 
quality refereeing with so many fouls not being punished ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akers supplied the worst kind of punishment for Brazil, sending  
the ball into the right side of the net for a 2-0 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	It was over, and the Americans could celebrate their second trip  
to the World Cup final in the three times the event has been held; 
they won in 1991. Sprinting to the far end of the field, they 
congratulated Scurry, who left the stadium pumping her arms above 
her head and saluting the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Scurry who drew the salutes afterward.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was the player of the game,'' Wilson said. ``She made the  
difference.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Reassures Gold Markets on Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Gold markets have nothing to fear from the  
International Monetary Fund's plan to sell gold to finance debt 
relief for poor countries, the IMF's managing director said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the ``legitimate preoccupation'' of gold producing  
countries, Michel Camdessus said he believes that ``we can find a 
solution that everyone can accept unanimously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the world's main industrial nations meeting in June  
in Cologne, Germany, gave the go-ahead for the IMF to sell 10 
million ounces of its $27 billion in gold reserves to help finance 
the IMF portion of debt relief for poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, Senators Jesse Helms and Chuck Hagel have  
charged that the sale would hurt many of these nations and the U.S. 
gold industry. Lawmakers representing gold mining states have also 
objected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're selling 10 percent of our gold. That means we're keeping  
90 percent of our gold and we have no desire to see our remaining 
90 percent losing any of its value,'' Camdessus told reporters in 
Geneva, where he was attending the annual meeting of the U.N. 
Economic and Social Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we won't be so stupid as to sell the gold in a disordered  
and unplanned way which risks depressing further an already 
depressed market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although U.S. approval will be needed for the sale, ``I have no  
reason to doubt the good sense of the United States and I think we 
will be able to convince them that the way we will proceed poses no 
major danger to the gold market or to American gold mines,'' 
Camdessus said.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Halfway to Aaron HR Total </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 378th career home  
run Monday night, moving him past the halfway mark toward breaking 
Hank Aaron's major league career record. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, 29, drove a 2-2 pitch from Anaheim's Shigetoshi  
Hasegawa high off the right field foul pole 330 feet from home 
plate for his 28th homer of the season. It tied him with Norm Cash 
for 40th place on the career list. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year veteran, who was elected to the All-Star game for  
the 10th time earlier Monday, has averaged 32.9 home runs per 
season and would need to play 11 more years at that pace to eclipse 
Aaron's mark of 755 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record of 714 homers on April 8, 1974,  
when he homered against Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey was the second-youngest player to reach the 300 mark in  
homers, second only to 27-year-old Jimmie Foxx. Griffey hit his 378 
homers in 5,535 at-bats. Aaron, who played 23 seasons and was a 
21-time All-Star, hit his 755 home runs in 12,364 at-bats.

<HEADLINE> European, Japanese Stocks Close Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed higher Monday, with oil,  
telecommunications and chemical companies leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan and Hong Kong, the main stock gauges rose to their  
highest levels in more than 20 months. Other markets in Asia closed 
generally higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Market activity around the world got a boost from last Friday's  
gains on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed 
at a record-high 11,139.24 points, up 72.82. Wall Street was closed 
on Monday for the Independence Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index extended gains with a 1.9  
percent advance, and earned itself a new record high at 5,625.62. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Energy index registered its biggest  
percentage gain on record, up 4.3 percent, after the Paris-Brussels 
group, Total Fina SA, made a hostile bid for smaller French rival 
Elf Aquitaine SA. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the takeover would create the world's fourth  
leading oil company in terms of market share. Shares in Elf rose 22 
percent on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	London's FTSE-100 index closed up 1.5 percent, just short of a  
new closing record high, at 6,592.00. 
</P>
<P>
	Other European markets rose as well. The Paris CAC 40 index  
ended 1.7 percent higher, Milan's MIBtel index rose 1.9 percent, 
and Madrid's IBEX-35 index was up 1.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
202.59 points, or 1.13 percent, to finish at 18,135.06. It was the 
Nikkei's highest closing level since Sept. 25, 1997, when the index 
closed at 18,341.96. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp rise followed release of a Bank of Japan survey  
showing that business sentiment has improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks surged for a second straight session. The Hang  
Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of blue chip 
stocks, rose 322.16 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 14,506.74. 
That was its highest level since Oct. 8, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares also closed higher, with the main index  
surging 3.2 percent on expectations that the government will 
maintain low interest rates. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index 
rose 29.42 points to 962.84, its highest close since May 14, 1996.

<HEADLINE> East Swelters in Hot, Muggy Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A wave of record heat and sticky, humid air enveloped the  
eastern third of the nation Monday, wilting people who had to be 
outside and shifting air conditioners into electricity-sucking 
overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
	The air ``feels like a warm, wet blanket,'' said Amanda Finley,  
22, in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking numerous showers,'' said Iris Robinson of Newark,  
N.J., where the temperature hit a record 103 degrees. ``I didn't 
really get any sleep last night. All you could do was just lay 
still and don't talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service posted heat advisories from the  
Mississippi Valley all the way to the East Coast, warning that the 
combination of humidity and high temperatures would create heat 
indexes of up to 110 and more. It was the third advisory day in a 
row for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds and Astros played an afternoon baseball game in  
Cincinnati, a thermometer stuck in the artificial turf at Cinergy 
Field registered 154 degrees, highest in at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperature records started falling a few minutes after noon,  
with Portland, Maine, reaching 94. Raleigh-Durham, N.C., hit 102. 
New York City and Atlantic City, N.J. rose to a record 101, 
Bridgeport, Conn., registered 100 for the first time and 
Philadelphia tied its record at 100.

	At the Flag Acres Zoo in Rensselaer County, N.Y., owner Harry  
VonHaggin fed his monkeys popsicles and made giant ones for bears 
by freezing fruit chunks and water in 5-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a luxury that they enjoy, and for the bears, it's a

	``It's hotter than at home. I expected it to be cooler here,''  
said Douglas Napo, an exchange student from the African nation of 
Togo. 
</P>
<P>
	And just west of Washington, a heat index of 115 was forecast in  
West Virginia's eastern panhandle. ``It's been 101 degrees in the 
shade on our porch thermometer,'' Angie Hott said before noon in 
Berkeley Springs, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Mayor Thomas Menino declared a heat alert and urged the  
elderly to use community centers as ``cooling sites.'' 
Philadelphia's heat hot line was swamped with phone calls, mostly 
from older residents without air conditioning or their concerned 
relatives. Hospitals around Michigan reported a small number of 
heat-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	With air conditioners cranked up to full blast, many utilities  
asked customers to turn off unnecessary lights and appliances to 
conserve electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility Conectiv, which serves parts of Delaware, Maryland  
and New Jersey, had scattered heat-related outages that blacked out 
several hundred customers, along with record demand that could 
force brownouts in some areas, said spokesman Vince Jacono. 
</P>
<P>
	Roads buckled in Delaware and in parts of New York, backing up  
traffic for those returning home from the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Theria Williams of Columbus, Ohio, had a simple goal once she  
returned to her air-conditioned home after some necessary shopping: 
``Eating something else besides barbecue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easterners got a little sympathy in the Southwest, where the  
summer sun pushes desert temperatures above 100 daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be 115 degrees here but it's more tolerable because of  
the lower humidity,'' former New Yorker Andrew Deschapelles said in 
Phoenix, where the forecast high was 108. ``Ninety-five degrees in 
the summer in New York is the most miserable thing on Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there wasn't much sympathy at all from the Pacific  
Northwest, where Pendleton, Ore., cooled to a record low of 44 on 
Monday and Seattle barely warmed to 70 for the first time since 
mid-June.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Americans Less Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A majority of Americans feel their own  
family's lives have gotten better at the end of the 20th century, 
but they are less optimistic about the country as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two-thirds of the people in a new poll say their  
families' lives have improved since the 1950s. But fewer than half 
say the country as a whole is better off now and nearly one-third 
say it is worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more money, but less human caring,'' said Wayne  
Dubrawsky, a government worker from Orchard Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Ralph Mittelstaedt, a retired Nebraska farmer: ``Life may  
have gotten better, but people haven't gotten better, especially 
the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press  
and released over the weekend, looked at how Americans feel about 
changes that have occurred over the past 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to name the reasons for personal betterment, four out  
of 10 cited the strong economy and one out of six pointed to 
advances in technology and modern conveniences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life in this country has gotten better,'' said Charlene  
Bridges of North Augusta, S.C., visiting Washington recently with 
her grandchildren. She cited higher salaries, ``the World Wide Web 
and the spread of knowledge and information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for key factors in America's progress, people point to the  
Constitution, free enterprise and free elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think the American way, politically and economically,  
is a remarkable achievement and it does work,'' said Andrew Kohut, 
director of the Pew Research Center. But, he added, the poll 
indicates ``technological and material success is undercut by the 
sense that somehow we have lost our way morally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Women, blacks and people with disabilities are among those who  
have gained the most, according to those polled. More than four out 
of five said the people in those categories are better off than 
they were in the 1950s, and the movements for civil rights and 
women's rights were widely viewed as two of the most positive 
social developments of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not as much racism,'' said Charles Caldwell, a  
17-year-old street vendor on the Mall in Washington. ``Everybody's 
getting their share of the American pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mack Arthur Brown, a retired schoolteacher from DeKalb, Miss.,  
remembers what it was like for blacks when he was growing up 50 
years ago, with segregated bathrooms, schools and restaurants in 
parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Integration came in and things have gotten a lot better for  
blacks in America,'' he said. ``We're able to go where we want to 
go now, without any problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was also widespread agreement that farmers and  
teen-agers were not as well off as they were a half-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 1,546 adults was taken from April 6 to May 6. The  
school shootings in Littleton, Colo. occurred during that period, 
when almost two-thirds of the interviews had been completed. The 
margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Littleton shootings did not change the overall  
findings of the poll, they increased the numbers that thought life 
was worse for teens, from 52 percent before the violence to 61 
percent just after. And the number who thought life is worse in the 
country in general jumped from 25 percent before to 36 percent 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseland Jones, a 61-year-old homemaker from Plainville, Ill.,  
questioned whether the computer and the Internet are offering 
children as healthy an outlet as the pastimes of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Computers probably help, but what are the children learning  
now?'' she asked. ``Are they learning to socialize with other 
people? Are they going to dances? Are they going to church? 
</P>
<P>
	``The lifestyle is too fast. Parents don't have time for their  
children and you can't trust anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other changes that were viewed less positively included:  
</P>
<P>
	--Two-thirds said increased use of credit cards is a bad trend.  
</P>
<P>
	--Just over half decried rap music.  
</P>
<P>
	--About half were concerned about the growing ease of divorce.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Ill. Gunman Had Racist Bent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- The gunman suspected in a deadly  
shooting spree targeting blacks, Jews and Asians came under the 
scrutiny of Indiana University officials last year for distributing 
racist fliers on campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fliers bore the mark of the Illinois-based white  
supremacist group World Church of the Creator and contained a 
rambling history of the United States, which it said was formed by 
heroic white people. 
</P>
<P>
	It concluded that ``Our people, the Great White Race, are slaves  
to a deceitful, alien government, a controlled media, and a 
suicidal religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After an uproar over the fliers, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith -- a  
wiry criminal justice major -- told a student university newspaper 
that the American government favors minorities at the expense of 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is pretty clear that our government has turned  
against white people,'' Smith told the Indiana Daily Student 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, Richard McKaig, the university's Dean of  
Students, summoned Smith to his office. The two had a 15-minute 
conversion about the fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very common type of student, nothing disturbing or  
unusual about him at that time. Not his dress or look, except for 
his racist views, which were pretty abhorrent,'' McKaig said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wasn't confrontational in any way. He just said `I'm just  
passing out fliers. This is America.''' 
</P>
<P>
	McKaig said that after his meeting with Smith it appeared that  
the young man shifted his flier-distribution efforts from the 
campus to Bloomington's downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who apparently shot and killed himself late Sunday during  
a high-speed chase by police, was linked to a deadly shooting spree 
that killed two men and injured seven others. All the victims were 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, completed his sophomore year in May and would have  
been a junior this fall, McKaig said. Smith was not enrolled for 
fall classes, but students often wait until late summer to 
re-enroll, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also was a regular contributor to the opinion pages of the  
Indiana Daily Student, penning letters under the nickname ``August 
Smith''. 
</P>
<P>
	In a June 11, 1998, letter to the editor, he defended his latest  
batch of leaflets. ``It is true that the fliers were racially 
oriented, but to label them racist, bigoted or prejudiced 
demonstrates bias,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith attended Indiana University from the summer of 1998  
through the spring of 1999. He left Bloomington in mid-May for 
Illinois, where he was born and raised, McKaig said. Enrollment 
records showed Smith was from Northfield, Ill., a Chicago suburb. 
He was a 1996 graduate of prestigious New Trier High School in the 
wealthy Chicago suburb of Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
	The Anti-Defamation League said Smith was arrested in late April  
in connection with distributing racist and anti-Semitic literature 
in Wilmette, another Chicago suburb. Village Trustee Frank 
Whitehand said he believes the Wilmette case, a littering count, 
was pending in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan Loeb, Midwest counsel for the ADL, said that the  
organization had been tracking Smith's activities for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is representative of the aimless, directionless young adult  
that is searching desperately for affiliation and tragically has 
found that kinship with organized hatred and bigotry,'' Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Illini reported that Smith was a student at the  
University of Illinois from September 1996 to February 1998, when 
he was expelled. Urbana police said he had several run-ins with 
campus police, including for drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Smith's ex-girlfriends told the newspaper he was  
emotionally and physically abusive during their one-year 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not going to stop until he's shot dead. He's not going  
to surrender,'' Elizabeth Sahr told the Daily Illini. ``He's not 
going to give up until he leaves this world.''

<HEADLINE> Ill. Shooting Suspect Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ill. (AP) -- A white supremacist who targeted minorities  
in a deadly Fourth of July weekend shooting spree in two states 
fatally shot himself as officers grappled with him after a chase, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, was being pursued Sunday after he  
carjacked a van at gunpoint in rural Marion County, Ill., said Doug 
Garrison, an FBI spokesman in Indianapolis. No one was hurt in the 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County Sheriff Gerald L. Benjamin said today that Smith  
apparently shot and wounded himself twice as officers pursued the 
van in a slow-speed chase. The van then crashed and Smith shot 
himself a third time when he was struggling with sheriff's 
deputies. He said that the final shot appears to have hit Smith in 
the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the shots were fired by him,'' Benjamin said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over,'' he added. '' feel sorry for his parents  
and the victims and their relatives. I don't know what caused this 
but it's very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe Smith began his drive-by killing spree in  
Chicago on Friday, when a black former college basketball coach was 
fatally shot and six Orthodox Jews were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter also fired at Asians and blacks in two Illinois  
cities, on Saturday, seriously wounding one man, and fatally shot a 
Korean man Sunday outside a church in Bloomington, Ind., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two guns found with Smith were consistent with the shootings and  
the body had a tattoo on the chest that said ``Sabbath Breaker'' -- 
which Smith was said to have sported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like our guy,'' Garrison said, adding that the FBI  
must double-check the fingerprints of the body with those of 
Smith's to make sure. Authorities also were attempting today to 
trace the source of the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a member of the World Church of the Creator, a white  
supremacist organization, and distributed anti-minority and 
anti-Semitic literature while a student at Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, based in East Peoria, Ill., is led by Matt Hale, who  
said Smith was a member from June 1998 until May 1999 and never 
showed any predilection for violence 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to him he never gave any inkling of being able to  
do this,'' Hale said before Smith apparently took his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI had not been investigating Smith until the last couple  
of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was known to police in Chicago and police in Bloomington  
but not to the FBI,'' Ken Kaiser, special agent in charge of FBI, 
said today. Witnesses did not see anyone with Smith, but the 
investigation into whether he acted alone was continuing, Kaiser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan Loeb, Midwest counsel for the Anti-Defamation League,  
said his organization has had Smith ``on our radar screen for quite 
some time, which is particularly tragic for someone so young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington Police Chief Jim Kennedy said officers had  
questioned him twice at his apartment in the past, related to the 
pamphlets he was passing out, because some people had complained 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing we could've arrested him for was  
littering,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman struck outside a synagogue in Chicago on Friday  
evening, the start of the Jewish Sabbath. The same shooter is 
believed to have killed Ricky Byrdsong, the black former basketball 
coach at Northwestern University, a half-hour later as he walked 
with his children in nearby Skokie, and later fired at an 
Asian-American couple in the suburb of Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Saturday the same blue Taurus was seen at shootings in  
Springfield, 200 miles southwest of Chicago, and Champaign-Urbana, 
135 miles south of Chicago. In the first attack, the gunman fired 
on two black men Saturday morning, but no one was hit, Chicago 
Police Cmdr. William Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday evening, six men of Asian descent were standing on  
a corner near the University of Illinois when three or four shots 
were fired, Hayes said. A 22-year-old graduate student, whose name 
wasn't released, was hit in the leg and was listed in serious 
condition today at Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's attack, Won-Joon Yoon was hit twice in the back and  
killed outside Korean United Methodist Church in Bloomington, which 
is roughly 130 miles southeast of Urbana. Witnesses told police 
that after firing into the crowd, the shooter sped off, running 
several lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was apparently parked at the corner and waited for these  
people to come out of church and then fired,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said .380-caliber shell casings -- the same kind  
found in some of the Chicago shootings -- were also found at the 
scene of the Indiana attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year on the Fourth of July, Smith tucked white supremacist  
fliers under windshields around Bloomington. Asked whether the 
shootings this weekend were related to Independence Day, 
Bloomington Police Capt. William Parker said, ``It raises questions 
in our minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also passed out similar hate literature when enrolled at  
the University of Illinois. The Daily Illini reported that Smith 
attended the school from 1996 through 1998 before being expelled. 
Urbana police said he had been in trouble with campus police for 
drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith attended Indiana University from the summer of 1998  
through the spring of 1999, and he is believed to have moved to the 
Chicago area in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The towns he's hit, he's either lived there or been enrolled  
in college at each of the towns,'' Parker said.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Commission Explains UBS Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERN, Switzerland (AP) -- Staff and organizational shortcomings  
at one of the banks which merged to create Switzerland's UBS AG 
were behind its huge loss following exposure to a troubled U.S. 
investment fund, the Swiss Federal Banking Commission said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	UBS, Europe's biggest bank, was formed last year from the merger  
of Swiss Bank Corp. and Union Bank of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, UBS reported a net third-quarter loss of 911  
million Swiss francs (then worth about $660 million), largely due 
to its exposure to the private Long Term Capital Management hedge 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Failings at Union Bank of Switzerland caused the loss, which  
resulted in the resignation last October of UBS chairman Mathis 
Cabiallavetta and the departure of three other top executives, the 
Swiss commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel said its investigation of the debacle concluded  
that the new bank's organization is adequate for an international 
financial institution of its size. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizational weaknesses have now been largely eliminated, it  
added, noting those involved with the fund loss are no longer with 
the bank.

<HEADLINE> Chief Justice Gets His Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist got what he  
wanted in a series of recent Supreme Court rulings on states' 
rights, but he needed the swing votes of Justices Sandra Day 
O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're the fulcrum. As they go, so goes the court,'' said  
Yale University law professor Akhil Reed Amar. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they do is call the shots'' year after year by casting  
the votes that tip the balance on the nation's highest court, added 
American University law professor Mark Hager. 
</P>
<P>
	During the recently ended 1998-99 term, Kennedy and O'Connor  
each voted in the majority in all but eight of the 75 signed 
decisions. The other seven justices dissented from 10 to 19 times 
each, with Rehnquist voting in dissent 15 times. 
</P>
<P>
	When the court voted 5-4, the majority most often included the  
three most conservative justices --Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia and 
Clarence Thomas -- plus O'Connor and Kennedy. But either O'Connor or 
Kennedy can tip the balance the other way by joining the four more 
liberal justices: John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 16 cases decided 5-4, and only one of those cases had  
both O'Connor and Kennedy in dissent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two joined the three conservatives in the most dramatic  
rulings -- a trio of 5-4 decisions that invoked sovereign immunity 
to shield states from lawsuits claiming they violated federal 
rights such as wage-and-hour laws or patent protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The rulings long had been a goal for Rehnquist, who in 1975 said  
states should not be bound by federal wage-and-hour laws. When that 
ruling was overturned in 1985, his dissenting opinion said he was 
confident his view would ``in time again command the support of a 
majority of this court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices did not actually reinstate the 1975 decision, but  
went a long way toward it by barring many individual lawsuits 
against states. 
</P>
<P>
	So whose is the dominant voice on the court? Legal experts  
disagree. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps O'Connor, says University of Utah law professor Michael  
McConnell. She staked out a pro-states' rights view in her second 
year on the court, writing in dissent in a 1982 utility case that 
the majority was letting Congress ``kidnap state utility 
commissions into the national regulatory family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She may be the leader of this movement,'' McConnell said.  
</P>
<P>
	But she also took the court in the other direction, joining the  
liberals in a 5-4 ruling in May that lets students sue schools for 
failing to stop other students from sexually harassing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy sharply dissented from that decision, one reason  
Pepperdine University law professor Douglas Kmiec said he proved 
the more intriguing justice. Another reason: Kennedy wrote the main 
decision in the states' rights cases, a ruling Kmiec saw as a shift 
in direction from the court's 1995 vote to bar states from imposing 
term limits on members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Erwin Chemerinsky, a law professor at the University of Southern  
California, said he regards O'Connor and Kennedy as crucial swing 
votes but added, ``I also think this is the Rehnquist court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist someday may best be remembered for the success of his  
views on states' rights -- ``his most driving ideological goal with 
regard to constitutional law,'' Chemerinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Assessing the justices' recent contributions is like watching a  
horse race and trying to figure out which one got its nose in 
front, suggested University of Colorado law professor Robert Nagel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepperdine's Kmiec agreed, and said such vying yields ``fairly  
pragmatic'' results. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when they're not closely balanced in a specific opinion,  
they tend to be closely balanced in terms of the overall work of 
the court,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Special Olympians Close Out Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Thousands of Special Olympics athletes  
observed a moment of silence during closing ceremonies for the 10th 
World Summer Games -- an event marred by three deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	During the nine-day international competition that ended Sunday  
a 14-year-old athlete died in his sleep, a volunteer collapsed and 
died minutes after opening ceremonies, and University of North 
Carolina chancellor Michael Hooker died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hooker, 53, was on the Special Olympics board of directors and  
played a key part in bringing the games to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, two Dominican basketball players and two Moroccan  
soccer players slipped away from their delegations in the event's 
opening days. Three of them have been heard from since, but one of 
the Moroccans remains unaccounted-for, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the moment of silence, Tim Shriver, head of Special  
Olympics Inc., urged the 7,000 participants gathered at the closing 
ceremony Sunday to look with optimism toward the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the 21st century, our athletes will not only compete but  
lead,'' Shriver said. ``I want everyone to go away from here 
thinking: 'Label me able not disabled.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1963 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the event this year  
featured competitors with mental retardation from 150 countries. 
There were about 2,000 coaches, 15,000 friends and relatives and 
45,000 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to believe the Shrivers, who have seen it for 30 years,  
that this was the best ever,'' said LeRoy Walker, president of the 
Games and former president of the United States Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The next world Special Olympics competition, the Winter Games,  
will be held in 2001 in Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Outstanding Warrants On Rise in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When police arrested Charles Jaynes in the kidnapping and murder  
of a young boy, he was already wanted on 75 outstanding warrants in 
18 Massachusetts courts. Nobody, however, appeared to have been 
looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say the case is far from unique. Throughout the  
country, hundreds of thousands, probably millions of warrants are 
outstanding for people wanted on felony offenses. The numbers are 
stretching the resources of local police and raising fears that 
criminals are slipping through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the state and local authorities just don't have the  
money or the resources'' to track down fugitives, said Arthur 
Roderick, chief of domestic investigations at the U.S. Marshals 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's National Crime Information Center, which police use  
for background checks on suspects, lists 516,000 outstanding 
warrants, the vast majority for felonies. Though many cases are 
solved each year, the list of open cases has grown from 340,000 in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The actual number of felony warrants is much higher. Many are  
never entered into the national system, often because states don't 
want to spend the time and resources on paperwork -- or pay 
extradition costs if a suspect is found. 
</P>
<P>
	The low percentage of warrants shared with the NCIC also means  
that most felony arrest orders won't show up in background checks 
used for handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts has 70,000 outstanding felony warrants but lists  
only 2,700 at the NCIC. Overall, the NCIC estimates it receives 
less than 20 percent of all outstanding felony warrants in the 
country. That would mean there are upwards of 2.5 million felony 
arrest orders that have never been served. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the largest public safety threat we face in  
the country,'' said Massachusetts state Sen. Cheryl A. Jacques, who 
led a review of her state's warrant management system. ``There is 
no deterrent in the criminal justice system if criminals know that 
they can go months, years or decades without ever paying for their 
first crime and can go on and commit dozens more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jaynes, who was eventually convicted of second-degree murder in  
the killing of 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley in 1997, was living at 
home and holding down a full-time mechanic's job despite scores of 
warrants, including an arrest order for skipping out on parole. An 
accomplice also was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate committee headed by Jacques found that a lack of  
coordination among the state's computer systems meant thousands of 
wanted felons were being allowed to renew driver's licenses and 
even collect welfare benefits without police being informed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are interacting with the government without the slightest  
hassle,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Local police often conduct sweeps and use innovative stings to  
lower their warrant rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, for instance, police sent out letters to hundreds  
of wanted people telling them they'd won tickets to watch the 
Denver Broncos football team, said Colorado Bureau of Investigation 
director Robert Cantwell. When they showed up, they were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Popular television shows like ``America's Most Wanted'' have  
also helped, but they can highlight only a tiny fraction of all 
cases, said the U.S. Marshals' Roderick. 
</P>
<P>
	Police generally rely on chance encounters like traffic stops to  
find fugitives because so few officers are assigned exclusively to 
pursue wanted people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's quite possible for an individual ... to live pretty much  
anonymously, and unless they do something that brings them to the 
attention of authorities, they probably won't be caught,'' said 
Jack Grant of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, 
based in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, Jacques is urging more laptop computers in  
patrol cars, doubling the state's fugitive squad from six officers 
to 12 and improving coordination among state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have a system where the chances are basically like  
the lottery for a fugitive ever getting caught,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, a San Francisco Chronicle report found that  
almost 223,000 individuals are wanted on felony warrants -- 
including 2,690 for homicide, 1,470 for sexual assault, and 74,000 
for drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``These numbers are startling and disturbing and represent a  
serious defect in the criminal justice system,'' California 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan state Sen. William Van Regenmorter said the state, with  
24,280 outstanding felony warrants is also grappling with the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are tons of warrants that are unserved, some for some  
very dangerous people,'' he said. ``It's a resource issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, which has 23,600 outstanding felony warrants, most  
criminals eventually slip up with a traffic violation or a new 
crime, Cantwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the scary part to me is ... they will get caught, but how  
many more crimes will they have committed?'' he said. ``How much 
damage will they do before they get caught?''

<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A sheriff's deputy uncovered more than 1,300  
pounds of cocaine -- worth about $48 million -- during a routine 
traffic stop on Interstate 70 over the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The deputy and his drug-sniffing dog found the cocaine in the  
back of a tractor-trailer that had been weaving and running onto 
the shoulder Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a sight,'' said Putnam County Sheriff Tom Helmer.  
``When I got down there I just couldn't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver and the passenger were jailed Monday as they  
awaited arraignment. Ignacio Hernandez, 41, and Leopoldo Hinojosa, 
26, are both charged with possession with intent to distribute, 
which carries a minimum sentence of 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Estonian Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHALLANS, France (AP) -- A wet and slippery first stage of the  
Tour de France ended with a shoulder-to-shoulder sprint to the 
finish, and in the end, American Lance Armstrong was still wearing 
the race leader's yellow jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	On the winding country roads of the western Vendee region, it  
was an Estonian, Jaan Kirsipuu of the Casino team, who won the 
stage. In a furious sprint at the end, he edged out Tom Steels of 
Belgium and Erik Zabel of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	But Armstrong's strong victory a day earlier in the prologue's  
time trial was enough to keep him on top in his first Tour de 
France since overcoming testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's 124-mile stage began under pouring rain in the town of  
Montaigu. The rain eased up but then returned again, making for an 
extremely wet beginning to the three-week race. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was marked by a long breakaway by Frenchman Thierry  
Gouvenou, who left the pack at 48 miles but was overcome late in 
the race by Ludo Dierckxsens of Belgium -- who was himself overtaken 
just before the final sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing fourth was Stuart O'Grady of Australia, followed by  
Silvio Martinelli of Italy. American George Hincapie came in 
eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the pack came in together, the riders finished with the  
same times. 
</P>
<P>
	As the race began, director Jean-Marie Leblanc made a reference  
to the doping scandal that nearly shut down the event last year, 
saying that the world of cycling ``has three weeks to rehabilitate 
itself. And we are happy to contribute to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Race organizers have announced that spot drug tests will be  
taken in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs and banners along the roads on Sunday showed that the  
scandal isn't far from fans' minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ride clean, and we love you,'' read one banner.  
</P>
<P>
	``Say No to EPO,'' said another sign, referring to the doping  
agent that a number of riders have acknowledged using. 
</P>
<P>
	Other signs showed support for Richard Virenque, the French  
cycling star who is under formal investigation on doping charges 
and denies using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourist Allan Rigby of Knoxville, Tennessee, said he was  
pessimistic about efforts to stem doping in cycling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they'll stop using drugs,'' he said. ``The new  
drugs will come along faster than the tests will keep up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Alain Guerin said it was crucial that the cyclists  
stay clean. ``We need to be natural,'' he said. ``We are not 
robots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many top riders are missing from this year's Tour, including the  
defending champion, Marco Pantani, and the two previous winners, 
Jan Ullrich of Germany and Bjarne Riis of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a two-time Olympic cyclist, is now a favorite. The  
Texan won the 1993 World Championship and competed for the U.S. 
Olympic team in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that  
had spread to his lungs and brain. He underwent surgery to remove 
his right testicle and lesions from his brain, and returned to 
racing early last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But he seems to feel his rough times are over.  
</P>
<P>
	``My legs and my spirit are better than before my illness,'' he  
said Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Eurythmics Reunite for Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The rock group Eurythmics staged a mini-concert  
Monday on the River Thames to announce the band's first major tour 
in 10 years, which will benefit Greenpeace and Amnesty 
International. 
</P>
<P>
	Appropriately, band members Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart  
performed their short set on the Rainbow Warrior II, a Greenpeace 
vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are so proud to be here. This is a very noble boat,''  
Lennox told the crowd that gathered to watch the show in the shadow 
of Tower Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennox and Stewart, whose biggest hit was 1983's ``Sweet Dreams  
(Are Made of This),'' began work on a new album last year, almost a 
decade after drifting apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair plan to encourage audience members and album buyers  
each to pledge at least 10 pounds ($16) to Greenpeace and Amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're giving all the tour profits and all the merchandising  
and everything connected with the tour to the two organizations,'' 
Stewart said. ``We're going to try and get a million people to join 
and donate all our profits, so hopefully it will mean a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tour will begin in September in Germany and travel to  
France, Italy, the United States, Australia, Sweden and Denmark 
before wrapping up in Britain in December.

<HEADLINE> 'Wild Wild West' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Wild Wild West'' won the box office money  
shootout over the Fourth of July weekend, beating a posse of strong 
challengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Will Smith Western with sci-fi overtones triumphed over bad  
reviews to take in $36.8 million on its opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Daddy'' with Adam Sandler dropped to second place but  
still earned $26.4 million over the four-day holiday weekend. 
``Tarzan'' was third with $19.2 million, according to industry 
estimates released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``South Park'' feature opened to a respectable $14.8 million  
despite new tougher enforcement of the R rating, which limited the 
audience. Spike Lee's latest film, ``Summer of Sam,'' was in eighth 
place with a lackluster $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the box office handle was up 16 percent from the 1998  
Independence Day weekend, which had ``Armageddon'' as the big 
opener, easily keeping the year on a record pace, said Paul 
Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations 
Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've ever seen such a competitive marketplace  
and at the same time seen such an expansion of the audience,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wild Wild West'' had an impressive $11,011-per-screen average  
in 3,342 theaters. The loose remake of the TV series has collected 
$50.1 million since opening last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the film was far from Smith's biggest July Fourth opener.  
Both ``Men in Black'' ($51 million) and ``Independence Day'' ($50 
million) had stronger first-weekend openings. 
</P>
<P>
	``West'' also trailed ``Armageddon's'' three-day debut total of  
$36 million last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The monstrous weekend was powered, instead, by the strength of  
the holdovers: ``Big Daddy'' dropped 36 percent from the previous 
weekend -- a modest decline considering its stunning $41.5 million 
debut -- and ``Tarzan'' slipped only 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The General's Daughter'' hung onto fifth place with a tiny 4  
percent drop to $14.6 million, while ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The 
Phantom Menace'' earned another $11.7 million after a 17 percent 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Only ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' appeared to be  
losing its mojo, tumbling 41 percent in the fourth week to $10.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few disappointments was the critically mixed ``Summer  
of Sam,'' the tale of a hot summer in New York when serial killer 
David Berkowitz ran amok. The film's Friday-through-Sunday take of 
$6 million was below that of Lee's other works: ``Jungle Fever'' (a 
three-day opening of $13 million in 1991) and ``Malcolm X'' ($9.9 
million in 1992.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Summer of Sam'' was another summer setback for Disney's  
live-action film division. While the animated ``Tarzan'' flew high, 
``Instinct'' -- with Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. -- dropped 
out of the Top 10 with $785,000 for 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Wild Wild West,'' $36.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Big Daddy,'' $26.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Tarzan,'' $19.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' $14.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The General's Daughter,'' $14.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $11.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' $10.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Summer of Sam,'' $7.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Notting Hill,'' $5.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``An Ideal Husband,'' $3.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Polish Mineral Water Is Called OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- A Dutch laboratory said Monday that  
bacteria found in samples of a mineral water bottled by Coca-Cola 
in Poland was not hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
	The TNO Nutrition and Food Research Institute in The Netherlands  
identified the bacteria detected by Polish health officials as 
coliform, according to a TNO statement distributed by Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola recalled an estimated 180,000 half-liter (about 16  
ounce) plastic bottles of Bonaqa Plus brand mineral water on Friday 
after the bacteria showed up in testing. No illness was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Polish authorities had said the bacteria belonged to a broad  
group that rarely is toxic. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall of the Bonaqa Plus mineral water, a new product  
fortified with calcium and magnesium, extended a problematic summer 
for Coca-Cola in Europe. More than 200 people complained of illness 
last month from drinking Coca-Cola beverages in Belgium and France, 
leading to a costly recall of the company's products in those 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the discovery on June 25 by a Polish consumer of mold  
in a bottle of mineral water, which caused the company last week to 
withdraw all of its beverages in 0.33 liter (about 12 ounce) 
returnable glass bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	A further recall of the bacteria-contaminated Bonaqa Plus  
plastic bottles followed on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola said the mold and bacteria were not hazardous but that  
it recalled its beverages to maintain public trust in its products. 
It said returnable bottles would be washed better. 
</P>
<P>
	Production was shut down at its bottling plant in southwest  
Poland to check for the source of the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Storeowners said last week Coca-Cola products continued to sell  
normally, and consumers said they would continue to drink the 
company's beverages.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Campbell Charged With Battery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Rapper Luther Campbell was charged with  
aggravated battery today after he allegedly struck a man in the 
face with a whiskey bottle at a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the former front man of 2 Live Crew became angry  
when a man and his friends blocked the rapper's view of a show at 
Club Zen early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell began arguing with Mathieu Fabrice, then smashed a  
bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey against his face, said Lt. John 
DiCenso of the Miami Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabrice suffered cuts and a possible broken nose.  
</P>
<P>
	Campbell was taken to Miami-Dade County Jail and later released.  
</P>
<P>
	Campbell gained notoriety nine years ago when he was acquitted  
of giving an obscene performance at a south Florida nightclub after 
a federal judge declared 2 Live Crew's ``As Nasty As They Wanna 
Be'' album obscene.

<HEADLINE> Study: Internet Feeds Delusions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Internet appears to have infiltrated yet  
another aspect of modern life -- the delusions of the actively 
psychotic, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	University of South Florida researchers who published their  
findings in last month's Southern Medical Journal, cited case 
studies as evidence that fears of the Internet are replacing 
Communists, the CIA and the controlling power of radio waves as a 
frequent delusion of new psychiatric patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Every case of Internet delusion documented by the researchers  
involved people who actually had little experience with computers, 
said Dr. Glenn Catalano, the USF psychiatrist who authored the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not really surprising,'' said Catalano, 37. ``Things  
can seem especially threatening when you don't know much about 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the cases cited by the USF doctors involved a 40-year-old  
man who shot himself in the face in an unsuccessful suicide 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	He believed a friend had placed Internet bugs in his ears that  
could read his mind and control his thoughts. He also believed 
someone had placed a link between his Web page and his extremities. 
When certain keys were hit, he said, his extremities would jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalano said he has seen several other cases of  
Internet-related delusions in the last 18 months and believed an 
increasing number of new patients will suffer from these fantasies. 
Given their frequency, he said, he was surprised to discover that 
his report apparently is the first to document the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have to start asking different kinds of  
questions to determine the source of patients' paranoia,'' he said. 
``You can't just ask if someone is following you.''

	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Gary Bauer  
said Monday that Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for 
the GOP nomination, has a responsibility to take a stand against 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said Bush could influence Congress' pending vote on  
extending normal trade relations with China by coming out against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should not be rewarding China again with the thing they  
want most from us,'' Bauer said while campaigning in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said that by giving China normal trade relations --  
formerly called most-favored-nation status -- the United States 
surrenders the greatest leverage it has to end human rights abuses 
in China. 
</P>
<P>
	As the apparent leader of the pack of Republican presidential  
contenders, Bush should take the ``moral stand,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush has sharply criticized the Clinton administration for  
not acting sooner to stop China from stealing U.S. nuclear secrets, 
he has said he believes Chinese society will benefit from trade 
with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush knows China is a competitor, but he feels it's  
important for China's markets to be open to U.S. producers and 
products,'' his spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said Monday. ``It's 
important for people to remember that when we export goods, we also 
export freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House's trade policy committee gave its support Thursday to  
President Clinton's decision to extend normal relations with China 
for another year.

	CHARLES CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Many of the problems facing American  
families today can be traced to television, former Vice President 
Dan Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average teen-ager spends 1,500 hours a year watching TV,  
600 hours a year in school and 30 hours a year talking to their 
parents. I ask you, who's in control?'' Quayle asked Monday at a 
holiday picnic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Family is the number one priority, the number one issue as we  
go into the next century,'' the Republican presidential nomination 
hopeful said. ``The way to strengthen the family is to bring back 
good common sense and strong moral values.'' 
</P>

<P>
	MEREDITH, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith is hoping a wave of support  
from the nation's roughly 30 million veterans could sweep him 
toward the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But that route could be crowded. That territory already has been  
staked out by Arizona Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war for more 
than five years in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, a New Hampshire Republican, met with a handful of  
veterans at a prisoners of war memorial on the shore of Lake 
Winnepesauke on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed spending some of $18 billion in federal money  
earmarked for the United Nations, International Monetary Fund and 
other international organizations to help veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to make an appeal to the 27 or 30 million veterans,''  
Smith said. ``I will take that $18 billion and use it to get 
homeless veterans off the grates. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I'm president, if I have to, we'll put them in the White  
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that if veterans endorse him, it will give him a  
strong stance in the race for the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping Senator Smith at least puts these issues on the  
front burner,'' said Vietnam veteran Bob Jones, 53, of Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a vice chairman of a Senate committee created in 1992  
to examine the fate of soldiers missing in action in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	While Smith's proposal to help veterans was well received  
Monday, his talk about leaving the Republican party to run as a 
third-party candidate was not. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you leave the Republican party, I really feel you should  
step down from the Senate,'' said Vietnam veteran Mike Hatch, 57, 
of Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he will decide within three weeks whether to form a  
third party. He said too many Republicans -- including Texas Gov. 
George Bush, the GOP presidential front-runner -- have gone soft on 
issues like abortion and gun control. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	WOLFEBORO, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Pat  
Buchanan is dismissing Sen. Bob Smith's talk of making a 
third-party bid for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservative commentator said Monday he'd rather see GOP  
candidates unite conservatives within ``a fighting second party -- 
the Republican party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, R-N.H., has said he will decide by August whether to  
continue his presidential campaign as a Republican, or break away 
and start a new, more conservative party. 
</P>
<P>
	While campaigning in New Hampshire on Monday, Buchanan also said  
that while he and Smith are competing for the same conservative 
votes, only he has proven he can win. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary in 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can win and I have won,'' Buchanan said. He said winning a  
straw poll of conservative voters in Hopkinton on Sunday convinced 
him he can repeat his 1996 performance.

<HEADLINE> Motive Sought in Shooting Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- At times, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith looked the  
part of a skinhead -- the words ``Sabbath Breaker'' tattooed on his 
chest and his head sometimes shaven. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say he also played the part, blanketing neighborhoods and  
university campuses with hate-filled fliers mostly aimed at Jewish, 
black and Asian people. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities and acquaintances wondered Monday what would  
drive a rich kid -- described as hateful but publicly reserved and 
even ``very polite'' -- to go on a two-state shooting spree that 
would leave two people dead and at least eight wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed mad at the world,'' said Tyrese Alexander, one of  
Smith's neighbors in Bloomington, Ind., and a fellow student at 
Indiana University, where Smith had been a criminal justice major. 
``But I had no idea it would end like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, grew up in a posh neighborhood in suburban Wilmette --  
a country club world full of big houses, expensive cars and 
influence. The eldest son of a doctor and real estate agent, he 
attended New Trier High School, one of the wealthiest public 
schools in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors say his father, Kenneth, could be hard to warm to and  
even withdrawn. But Sid Condon, a 61-year-old attorney and the 
family's neighbor in Wilmette, called Smith's mother, Beverly, ``a 
wonderful person -- soccer Mom 101.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Smiths, who have two younger sons, moved about two years ago  
to nearby Northfield, into a smaller house but one with a swimming 
pool and private tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
	They have declined to talk to reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they're totally shocked and devastated,'' Condon  
said. ``They're probably in church praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hints that Smith had a streak of rebellion popped up in a high  
school yearbook, where his entry carried the slogan ``Sic Semper 
Tyrannis'' -- or ``Thus ever to tyrants.'' Those are said to be the 
words John Wilkes Booth spoke after shooting Abraham Lincoln and a 
phrase on a T-shirt worn by Timothy McVeigh the day he bombed the 
federal building in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's brushes with the law began in October 1997, when  
University of Illinois records show he was reprimanded for 
marijuana possession and for fighting in his room, including one 
report of domestic violence against a female student. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, he met with the dean of students and was put on  
``conduct probation,'' according to university records. He also 
agreed to attend counseling, an ethics class and to do community 
service, said Bill Murphy, a university spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith began that process but got into more trouble for putting  
up racist posters in his dorm and eventually was called back into 
the dean's office for allegedly peeping in dorm windows and 
carrying unspecified weapons, records show. 
</P>
<P>
	He withdrew the next day, Feb. 14, 1998, ``because he was going  
to be expelled,'' Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said a notation was put on Smith's transcript -- ``a red  
flag for anybody'' -- but he didn't know if officials at Indiana 
University, where Smith completed his sophomore year in May, had 
seen the transcripts or the notation. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard McKaig, Indiana's dean of students, said he didn't have  
access to Smith's admissions records on Monday, a holiday, but said 
his university considers applications of transfer students on 
non-academic probation, like Smith's, on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, who is black, said he and other students at Indiana  
University were well aware of Smith's racist views. Alexander said 
he even discussed Smith's views in his African-American studies 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	But it never occurred to him that Smith would turn violent.  
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed to harbor intense anger, but it was never of a  
physical nature,'' he said. ``He never lashed out at anybody. He 
just had an angry look on his face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Alexander and others said they were shocked by the  
shootings, one of Smith's ex-girlfriends seemed unsurprised by his 
violent end. Authorities say he fatally shot himself in the chin 
late Sunday as he fled police in southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is his Independence Day from the government, from  
everything,'' Elizabeth Sahr told the Daily Illini, the student 
newspaper at the University of Illinois, on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is not going to stop until he's shot dead. He's not going  
to surrender,'' she said. ``He's not going to give up until he 
leaves this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith took with him many unanswered questions, which  
investigators from a task force in the north Chicago suburbs are 
attempting to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave few clues, if any, in April, when he testified in front  
of a board considering Matt Hale's appeal for a law license. Hale 
is leader of the World Church of the Creator, a white supremacist 
group that counted Smith as a member from June 1998 until May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our number one goal is to straighten out the white man's  
thinking,'' Smith told the panel. ``We're the new minority being 
crushed left and right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a navy suit, Smith admitted he had ``considered violent  
acts to achieve racial goals, but Hale counseled me to act 
peacefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the board rejected Hale's appeal, saying his beliefs  
and character make him ill-suited to practice law in Illinois. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Mariners Ballpark Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The hot dogs are tastier, the seats more  
comfortable, the views much better and the open air glorious, 
Seattle Mariners fans said Monday at the dedication of their new 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	So what if service at the concession stands was slow and the  
relish table ill-designed? 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Ken Griffey Jr. weighed in on the side of public  
officials in a dispute over financing, a crowd estimated at 15,000 
cheered the impending return of outdoor baseball after more than 
two decades in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of who should pay for $100 million in cost overruns  
on the $517 million project seemed almost lost in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care, just as long as they play ball here,'' said Rob  
Eason of Spanaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're back to the way baseball ought to be played --  
outdoors, on the grass,'' Orlin VanWieringen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners could hardly have ordered more perfect weather for  
the festivities, a cloudless sky with a light breeze and 
temperatures edging into the 70s -- the warmest, sunniest weather in 
more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too long we have suffered with less than the best. Today  
we have the best,'' Mayor Paul Schell said. ``It's time to 
celebrate a great stadium that all of our children and our 
children's children can enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute was evident only in the lackluster applause and a  
few boos for club president Chuck Armstrong, who ignored the snub 
and proclaimed, ``What a great day out for baseball! Ain't baseball 
great?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was a last-minute stand-in for Mariners chairman John  
Ellis, who has borne most of the load in the club's demand for $60 
million in additional public funding. 
</P>
<P>
	An article Sunday in The Seattle Times said Ellis and others  
suggested the Mariners might trade Griffey or Alex Rodriguez if the 
demand was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time this team has something come up, it's always me and  
Alex to blame,'' Griffey told ESPN on Sunday. ``We love the game. 
We love playing in front of 40,000, 50,000 fans at home. Why does 
John Ellis want to make it so hard for us to bring those people 
out? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not us asking for more money here. I've been here 11  
years, Jay Buhner has been here 11 years. How much money do we have 
to defer? I deferred $5 million in my salary and offered to defer 
$10 million. They turned it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team was in Anaheim to play the Angels on Monday night, so  
the players missed the dedication.

<HEADLINE> UN Backs Faster Internet Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Global agreement on a new telephone standard will  
vastly speed up links from homes to the Internet, the United 
Nations telecommunications agency said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. firms are already offering the new standard, which enables  
speeds at least 30 times faster than the current top-of-the-line 
modems used by personal computers over ordinary copper telephone 
lines, specialists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other countries are introducing systems based on the  
standard to provide affordable access to the Internet, multimedia 
services as well as long-distance schools, the International 
Telecommunications Union said. 
</P>
<P>
	European companies are poised to enter the field, said Andrew  
Nunn of Britain, chairman of a key panel that devised the standard 
for the ITU, announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Systems based on these standards, which are effective  
immediately, will complete ``the last mile in high-speed 
subscriber-to-subscriber data communications,'' said an ITU 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The new standard is for a system known as ASDL, or Asymmetric  
Digital Subscriber Line. It can send data in one direction at up to 
7 million bits per second. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at the lower end of its speed range, around 1 million bits  
per second, the system is much faster than the 56,000 bits possible 
with current standard modems. It also far eclipses speeds possible 
with ISDN digital lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service will require new equipment at the personal  
computer end, as well at the Internet service provider and 
telephone company, but it will still be able to use the old wiring.

<HEADLINE> Posada Apologizes to Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankees catcher Jorge Posada apologized  
in person Monday for calling umpires out of shape, telling Greg 
Kosc's crew he made a mistake by popping off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said something I shouldn't have said,'' Posada said. ``There  
was a lot of frustration built up. I'm going to tell the guy I'm 
sorry. Hopefully, he's here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Kosc, the main target after leaving Sunday's game because of  
heat exhaustion, was not present when Posada visited the umpires' 
locker room before the Yankees played Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc went home for further tests, a day after being hospitalized  
on an extremely humid afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew chief Larry Barnett said Kosc would probably be out for a  
few days. Bill Miller, a regular ump in the Triple-A Pacific Coast 
League, took Kosc's place. 
</P>
<P>
	After talking to Posada, Barnett said the whole matter was ``a  
dead issue.'' The weight of umpires, however, remains a delicate 
topic in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought a lot about it all day, thinking of cute things to  
say,'' Barnett said. ``But I think the best thing for me to do is 
just to say that it's a shame you have to go through things like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done some dumb things in my life,'' said Barnett,  
retiring after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Posada was not in the starting lineup Monday night. During the  
day, temperatures in New York hit a record 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the weather got to everybody yesterday,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	Posada, who said he took water to Kosc during Sunday's game, was  
called out on strikes by the plate umpire in a 7-3 loss. Later, he 
struck back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the guys are not in shape,'' Posada said.  
``I understand it's hot, but you have to be able to go through the 
whole game. They're not prepared, they're not in shape. It's a 
shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc, 50, is a 24-year AL veteran. He's listed at 255 pounds and  
one of his hobbies is weightlifting. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he (Posada) ever got a chance to go through a workout with  
Greg, he'd see that Greg was a man,'' Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees general manager Brian Cashman talked to Posada on Monday  
about his comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``He woke up this morning and realized he'd said some things in  
the heat of battle,'' Cashman said. ``Jorge said he was going to 
apologize and I was glad to hear that. It's important that a person 
can stand up and own up to a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Posada admitted to being steamed and bothered the previous day.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was hot. We lost. I got a pitch called on me that wasn't a  
strike,'' Posada said. ``But I was wrong to say what I did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just leave it at that and not make it a big deal,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire Eric Gregg, who has repeatedly battled weight  
troubles, has been on leave for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	NL umpire John McSherry, who weighed more than 325 pounds, died  
of a heart attack on the field at Cincinnati on opening day in 
1996.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Receives NEA Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Described as ``a national treasure,''  
Hillary Rodham Clinton accepted the National Education 
Association's highest honor Monday for her commitment to public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides her work for smaller school classes and other classroom  
improvements, the president's wife has promoted childhood 
immunization and equal access to quality education for girls and 
students with special needs, NEA president Bob Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillary is a unique woman and a national treasure,'' Chase  
told 9,000 delegates at group's 137th representative assembly. 
``She has spoken passionately about the need to reduce class sizes 
and other critical issues. She is among our staunchest allies and 
dearest friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton praised the NEA's work for school reform but  
criticized school voucher programs that allow some students to use 
public funds to attend private or parochial schools, as advocated 
by many congressional Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some who say that vouchers are the way to improve  
our local schools,'' she said. ``I say they are dead wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller class sizes, high standards, parental involvement and  
adequate resources are what's needed to improve education, the 
first lady said.

	HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Singer Pat Boone said he loves  
appearing at Fourth of July parades because it gives him a chance 
to sing ``Happy Birthday'' to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like a human roman candle or firecracker,'' the

sleeves of his red, white and blue jumpsuit as he broke into song: 
``Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday, 
dear America. We thank God for you!''

<P>
	Boone was the grand marshal at the 95th annual Huntington Beach  
parade, one of the oldest Independence Day celebrations in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainer said his new video album ``American Glory'' will  
feature only patriotic songs because be believes American melodies 
promote respect for the country and good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need something like this in every American home,'' he said.  
``If we don't sing those songs, and if our kids don't learn them, 
we're going to lose them all.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Gov't Unchanged on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A central bank survey showing improved business  
confidence has not changed the government's grim outlook on the 
economy, Japan's trade minister said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good that sentiment has turned up,'' said Kaoru Yosano,  
the head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite companies' growing confidence, he said ``their  
capital investment outlook hasn't improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its quarterly ``tankan'' survey released Monday, the Bank of  
Japan said that sentiment among large manufacturing companies 
showed its biggest improvement since August 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank added, however, that companies are becoming more  
reluctant to spend. The survey showed large manufacturers plan to 
slash spending by 11 percent this year, compared to a 9.5 percent 
cut estimated in a March survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosano cited that as a reason for the official pessimism.  
</P>
<P>
	``The government will continue to view the economy in the same  
severe manner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is fighting its worst economic downturn in 50 years.

<HEADLINE> U.S., China Set for World Cup Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- After playing five World Cup games in  
two weeks, the U.S. and Chinese women won't be complaining about 
four straight days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll practically relish the break from competition.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, who have been the strongest team in the tournament,  
crisscrossed the country so often they probably have enough 
frequent flyer miles to get back home for free. The Americans 
didn't have such travel woes, but they had far more difficult 
knockout-round games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are these teams used to such a frenetic playing schedule.  
Indeed, the women will have played six games in three weeks to 
decide their title. The men play seven games in more than four 
weeks in their World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't rested very often,'' China Coach Ma Yuanan said.  
</P>
<P>
	But they didn't seem to be dragging in a 5-0 victory over  
defending champion Norway in the semifinals. That rout was the most 
impressive win in what has been a terrific year for the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	So they've earned their respite, although Ma has promised their  
practices ``will be like matches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, whose advancement to the finals has featured some  
brilliant play and some very spotty moments, particularly on 
defense, did look exhausted in their 2-0 win against Brazil on 
Sunday. Not surprisingly, coach Tony DiCicco canceled Monday's 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely were a little tired, and so was Brazil,'' U.S.  
star Mia Hamm said. ``We weren't as sharp as we can be, and maybe 
that was a little fatigue playing a part. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we've got five days between games, and we'll be ready by  
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the Chinese, who also won the prestigious Algarve Cup over  
the Americans this year before splitting two games in the United 
States, don't appear to need much work on anything, Ma decided to 
nitpick. 
</P>
<P>
	``After we led 2-0, some of the team members were making  
constant errors,'' Ma said. ``In the first half, there were two 
opportunities which the players didn't maximize. If we did, the 
game would have been easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco won't be nitpicking when he brings up the gaps in the  
defense that have given all but one U.S. opponent ample opportunity 
to score. Only the steady and sometimes spectacular work of 
goalkeeper Briana Scurry has kept the yield down to three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	He also will have the Americans working on shooting more quickly  
when they get into position. Hamm, the international career goals 
leader who hasn't scored in three games, was especially hesitant 
about shooting against the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the players who can find the back of the net  
consistently,'' DiCicco said. ``We'll be calling on them to do it 
one more time on Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One aspect in which the Americans have excelled is set pieces  
such as corner kicks and free kicks. Because of their height 
advantage over China, look for Michelle Akers and Cindy Parlow, in 
particular, to be heavily involved in those plays -- throughout the 
week of practice and in the sold-out Rose Bowl on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that by Saturday, we're going to be dying to get out  
on the field and play,'' co-captain Julie Foudy said. ``By then 
we'll have had enough practice and will want to get on with what we 
came for, the chance of winning the World Cup.''

<HEADLINE> 'Wild Wild West' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Overcoming bad, bad reviews, Will Smith's  
``Wild Wild West'' won the West and more, opening with $36.8 
million over a blistering Fourth of July weekend at the box office, 
according to estimates Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big Daddy'' with Adam Sandler dropped to second place but  
still reaped an impressive $26.4 million over the four-day holiday 
weekend, while ``Tarzan'' also remained strong with $19.2 million 
for third place for Friday through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``South Park'' feature opened to a respectable $14.8 million  
in fourth despite tougher enforcement of the R rating, which 
limited the audience. Spike Lee's latest film, ``Summer of Sam,'' 
opened to a lackluster $7.8 million in eighth place. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the box office was up 16 percent from Independence Day  
weekend last year, which had ``Armageddon'' as the big opener, 
easily keeping the year on a record pace, according to Paul 
Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations 
Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we've ever seen such a competitive marketplace  
and at the same time seen such an expansion of the audience,'' said 
Dergarabedian, noting that even though movies are recording huge 
grosses, they have struggled to remain No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, moviegoers ignored the reviews and this time flocked  
to the widely panned ``Wild Wild West,'' which had an impressive 
$11,011-per-average average in 3,342 theaters. The loose remake of 
the old TV series has collected a total of $50.1 million since 
opening last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the film was far from Smith's biggest July 4th opener.  
Comparing three-day figures (the other films didn't have four-day 
weekends), the $27.7 million for ``West'' from Friday through 
Sunday was well behind ``Men in Black,'' which had $51 million in 
1997, and ``Independence Day,'' with $50 million in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	It also trailed ``Armageddon's'' three-day debut of $36 million  
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The monstrous weekend was powered, instead, by the strength of  
the holdovers: ``Big Daddy'' dropped 36 percent -- a modest decline 
considering its stunning $41.5 million debut -- and ``Tarzan'' 
slipped only 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifth-place ``The General's Daughter'' also hung on with a tiny  
4 percent drop to gross $14.6 million, and ``Star Wars: Episode I -- 
The Phantom Menace'' cruised along with a 17 percent drop to gross 
an additional $11.7 million in sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Only ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' appeared to be  
losing its mojo, tumbling 41 percent in the fourth week with a 
$10.8 million gross. It plunged from third place to seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend got a boost from the new ``South Park: Bigger,  
Longer and Uncut,'' which got glowing reviews but had to contend 
with a post-Columbine initiative requiring IDs to be checked at the 
box office for R-rated movies. The raunchy ``South Park'' had to be 
edited several times to get reduced from an NC-17 to R. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few disappointments of the summer was the critically  
mixed ``Summer of Sam,'' about a hot summer in New York when the 
serial killer Son of Sam ran loose. Its Friday-through-Sunday 
business of $6 million was below that of Lee's bigger movies: 
``Jungle Fever'' (three-day opening of $13 million in 1991) and 
``Malcolm X'' ($9.9 million in 1992.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Summer of Sam'' was another summer setback for Disney's  
live-action film division. While the animated ``Tarzan'' flew high, 
``Instinct'' -- with Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. -- dropped 
out of the Top 10 with $785,000 for 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the leading movie list were ``Notting Hill,'' with  
Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, finishing ninth with $5.1 million, 
and ``An Ideal Husband'' with $3.4 million for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Wild Wild West,'' $36.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Big Daddy,'' $26.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Tarzan,'' $19.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' $14.8 million.  
</P>
<P>

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A leftist guerrilla group has yet to  
punish a squad leader it blames for the slayings of three American 
Indian rights activists in March, a top rebel commander said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Briceno, the No. 2 leader of the Revolutionary Armed  
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, refuted media reports that the guilty 
rebel officer had been punished, in an interview published in El 
Espectador newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC claims a rogue local squad leader carried out the  
slayings of three Americans whose bodies were found March 4 just 
across the border in Venezuela, a week after they were abducted 
while working with a Colombian Indian tribe, the U'wa. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the killings, the Clinton Administration severed all  
contacts with the guerrilla group and is demanding it hand over the 
killers to Colombian, Venezuelan or U.S. authorities. The FARC has 
refused to do so, vowing instead to apply its own system of 
``revolutionary justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many here suspect a low-ranking rebel will take the fall in the  
killing of the Americans for higher-ups in the 15,000-member rebel 
group who allegedly issued the orders. 
</P>

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori is so secretive  
about whether he will run for a third consecutive term in office 
next year that not even his children know his plans, his daughter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keiko Sofia Fujimori, the president's eldest daughter and acting  
First Lady, said in a interview published Monday in the Lima 
newspaper La Republica that she hoped her father didn't run again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my father to find a wife and spend more time with his  
children,'' said Keiko Sofia, 24, who recently graduated with a 
business degree from Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, was first elected in  
1990 as a political outsider and re-elected in a landslide in 1995, 
but his popularity has wavered in his second term. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori's 22-year marriage to Susana Higuchi ended in a bitter  
divorce in 1996. The couple have four children.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican police found the bodies of four  
suspected members of a drug cartel along a highway near the U.S. 
border, the government news agency Notimex reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies, blindfolded and cuffed, were inside an abandoned  
luxury car near the hamlet of Lucio Blanco, 20 miles south of 
Brownsville, Texas, Notimex said, quoting police. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the victims were gunmen for a former head  
of the Gulf drug cartel, and the gangland-style killing suggests it 
was carried out by other drug dealers, police said.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez already had his  
own radio and TV shows. Now he is adding a new tool to his small 
state-run media empire: a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``The President's Mail'' hit newsstands on Monday with 32 pages  
of news articles, editorials and opinion columns that Chavez says 
will serve as an alternative to the mainstream media, which he 
charges is biased in favor of the country's corrupt political 
elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez is listed as the newspaper's editor-in-chief.  
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the paper, along with the weekly call-in radio and  
TV shows that Chavez hosts on state-run channels, is part of the 
president's alleged plan to impose dictatorial rule by controlling 
key institutions and eliminating opposition voices.

<HEADLINE> O'Brien Named to US Davis Cup Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson has  
his team. Now all he has to do is figure out the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson picked Alex O'Brien on Monday to complete a roster  
that already included Pete Sampras, Jim Courier and Todd Martin. 
But the captain was mum on whether Sampras, fresh off another 
Wimbledon title, will play singles or doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll have to wait and see,'' Gullikson said at a news  
conference at the Longwood Cricket Club, where the United States 
will play its quarterfinal against Australia on July 16-18. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien of Amarillo, Texas, has eight career doubles titles,  
including one at Queen's Club last month in which he and Sebastien 
Lareau beat Australians Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge. O'Brien 
will be making his third Davis Cup appearance, with a 1-2 career 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the best-of-5 quarterfinal will advance to the  
semifinals against Russia or Slovakia on Sept. 24-26. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to roster announcement, the event celebrated the  
120th birthday of Davis Cup founder and original U.S. captain 
Dwight Davis. Shortly after graduating from Harvard University in 
1900, Davis bought a silver bowl for $750 and offered it as a prize 
for an international lawn tennis competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras originally balked at joining the team because Gullikson  
had asked for a full-year commitment. He later agreed to sign on 
but said he would play only doubles so as not to upset those who 
were there from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Martin said he would sit out singles to make room for  
Sampras, who might be the best player in tennis history. But 
Gullikson said there are other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete's feelings, Todd's feelings, Jim's feelings, Alex's  
feelings,'' the captain said. ``We just didn't want someone jumping 
in for this historic tie. ... He (Sampras) was very sensitive that 
Jim and Todd have been there every time for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision doesn't have to be made until the day before the  
matches, July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson also said he spoke recently with Wimbledon runner-up  
and world No. 1 Andre Agassi. Agassi had a falling out with the 
Davis Cup leadership over scheduling and will not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we'd love to have Andre back. He chose not to be.  
That's his personal decision,'' Gullikson said. ``My door is always 
open for him to come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody can choose to play or not play. This is America. ...  
In a perfect world, every American would make himself available at 
the beginning of every year. It isn't like that.''

<HEADLINE> Outlook on Japan Economy Said Grim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A central bank survey showing improved business  
confidence has not changed the government's grim outlook on the 
economy, Japan's trade minister said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good that sentiment has turned up,'' said Kaoru Yosano,  
the head of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite companies' growing confidence, ``their capital  
investment outlook hasn't improved,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In its quarterly ``tankan'' survey released Monday, the Bank of  
Japan said that sentiment among large manufacturing companies 
showed its biggest improvement since August 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank added, however, that companies are becoming more  
reluctant to spend. The survey showed large manufacturers plan to 
slash spending by 11 percent this year, compared to a 9.5 percent 
cut estimated in a March survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Yosano cited that as a reason for the official pessimism.  
</P>
<P>
	``The government will continue to view the economy in the same  
severe manner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya, director-general of Japan's Economic Planning  
Agency, also warned Tuesday that Japan's economic downturn -- the 
worst in 50 years -- is not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't enough good data for us to revise our judgment,''  
Sakaiya said, adding that public works will continue to be 
necessary to support the economy in light of the slowdown in 
private spending.

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Builds Winston Cup Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Dale Jarrett experienced the quickest  
four seconds in auto racing over the weekend. Next, he tries to 
survive the longest five months of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to a four-second `gas-and-go'' pit stop towards the end  
of the Pepsi 400 on Saturday, Jarrett took a lead, then held off 
several challenges, including a late run from Dale Earnhardt, to 
win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	It expanded Jarrett's lead in the Winston Cup points standings  
to 177 points over Bobby Labonte, a huge cushion as the drivers 
head into the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, no driver with the points lead after the Pepsi 400  
has failed to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good stat to know,'' said Jarrett, in pursuit of his  
first series title. ``I don't want to end that string. Without 
sounding cocky or overconfident, if we can continue doing what 
we've done, they'll have trouble catching us. But it only takes one 
race to make this a close battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, however, has been the most unlikely candidate to throw  
in a stinker this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His only bad effort came on opening week, here at the Daytona  
500, when he was involved in a multicar accident that knocked 
himself and several other contenders out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has finished out of the top 10 only once, a  
16-race stretch of consistency unlike any the 15-year veteran can 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember being involved in anything like it,'' Jarrett  
said. ``We've overcome some things where we shouldn't have finished 
in the top 10 and we did. We've done things we need to do to win 
championships. There have been days we needed all 500 miles, or all 
600 miles, to get the car right. But we continued to work on it and 
get it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This race was won thanks to crew chief Todd Parrott's decision  
to turn Jarrett's last trip to the pits into a lightning-quick, 
fuel-only stop. It lasted just four seconds -- maybe not even that 
long -- and gave him just enough fuel to complete the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Todd said we were going to come in and put four seconds worth  
of fuel in,'' Jarrett said. ``That's about as quick a four seconds 
as I've ever seen. If they had that in the NBA, they wouldn't have 
gotten a shot off in that four seconds, but it worked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coming out of the pits, Jarrett opened up a big lead on Rusty  
Wallace and the rest of the field. A pair of yellow flags tightened 
the gap, however. And when the final yellow came out at the end of 
lap 157, it was Jarrett trying to hold off Earnhardt for one more 
lap around the 2.5-mile trioval. 
</P>
<P>
	He did, then ran the last two laps of the race under yellow. So  
slim was the margin that Jarrett's car ran out of gasoline on his 
victory lap. It left some doubt as to whether he could have held 
Earnhardt off had the yellow not come out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it would have been any different,'' Jarrett  
said. ``Earnhardt wasn't getting much of a push from anybody, so I 
was able to keep him kind of where I needed to keep him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Naturally, Earnhardt disagreed. He had taken on two new tires on  
his final pit stop. It helped him move from sixth to second in the 
eight laps before the final yellow came out. 
</P>
<P>
	At the finish, he was bearing down on Jarrett, looking for his  
second straight victory on a restrictor-plate track. But The 
Intimidator, almost surely saving up steam for a challenge on the 
final lap, never got the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think within a few more laps we would have gotten by  
Jarrett,'' Earnhardt said. ``He might have run out of gas, because 
he was really close. That caution really helped him.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Needs State Help on Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Service was  
established last year to make sure dangerous people don't get their 
hands on guns, but officials say the system can't work without 
cooperation from the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI tries to weed out people with past convictions,  
outstanding felony warrants, restraining orders for domestic 
violence and other violations during its background checks for gun 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	But much of the information in state computers never reaches the  
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can only check what's in there,'' says James E. Kessler,  
Jr., head of the FBI's Clarksburg, W.Va.-based background service, 
called the National Instant Check System or NICS. ``If it's not in 
there, it's not going to get checked,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kessler said just 24 states provide information on restraining  
orders to federal authorities. Some don't provide information on 
mental illness or suspected gang participation because of privacy 
concerns. Also, states on average share less than one in five 
outstanding felony warrant records. 
</P>
<P>
	Kessler said NICS officials spend the bulk of their time dealing  
with the 5 percent of state records that arrive without 
dispositions, which tell whether a felony arrest resulted in 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts state Sen. Cheryl Jacques, who has sponsored  
legislation calling for her state to improve warrant tracking, says 
lack of cooperation can undermine the whole system. Massachusetts 
does not provide the FBI with information on restraining orders, 
and only 2,700 of the state's 70,000 outstanding felony warrants 
are in the FBI wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
	If the FBI has no record of him, someone wanted for armed  
robbery in Massachusetts ``can just go to New Hampshire, 15 minutes 
away, and purchase a gun,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kessler says the FBI has blocked 48,000 gun purchases in nearly  
2.3 million background checks nationwide since NICS was created in 
November. States have conducted more than 2.4 million of their own 
tests, but usually use the NICS along with state records. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember that this is a voluntary system,''  
Kessler says. ``We can't force states to put information in 
there.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Comedian Chris Rock says he has no interest in  
politics, despite urgings from the Rev. Jesse Jackson that he 
become more involved.

<P>
	``I'm in show business,'' Rock told TV Guide in its July 10

	Rock also reflected on the deaths of comedians Chris Farley and  
Phil Hartman, who he worked with on ``Saturday Night Live,'' 
calling them victims of ``the comedian curse.'' 
</P>

	``We're performers -- a bunch of geeks no one liked,'' he said.  
``Now, people finally like us, and we're willing to put up with a 
tremendous amount... and make ourselves miserable, to maintain it. 
Then, you know, we explode. Our wives shoot us, we OD or

<HEADLINE> Texas Doctor Kills Ex-Wife, Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTHLAKE, Texas (AP) -- A man who recently lost custody of his  
daughters shot his ex-wife to death during her morning jog Monday 
and then killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives believe Dr. Scott Chester Stone, of Tarboro, N.C.,  
hid in a wooded area to wait for his wife, Dr. Marisa Deneen 
Jackson. She and the couple's daughters, ages 6 and 8, had been 
staying in this upscale Fort Worth suburb with Stone's sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he probably knew (the morning jog) was a regular  
thing for her,'' police spokesman Robert Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
	A divorce court in North Carolina awarded custody of the girls  
to their mother last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the conditions of the custody agreement was that he  
could have the girls for six weeks in the summer,'' Finn said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, police said Stone did not tell his wife or his sister  
he was coming to Southlake.

<HEADLINE> Microphones Let Fans in on Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Duke Covone was at a New York  
Giants game with his wife not long ago. She mentioned that it would 
be interesting to hear what the players talked about on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	And that got Covone thinking.  
</P>
<P>
	Covone is a partner in Interactive Sports Signals, Inc. The  
company, headquartered in New Milford, Conn., is giving fans of the 
New Jersey Red Dogs of the Arena Football League a chance to listen 
to the players during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been putting microphones on players and renting  
headsets to spectators in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like listening to the strategy part,'' Charles McHarris, a  
44-year-old fan, said at a recent game at the Meadowlands. ``You 
can hear what the players are thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Covone started working seriously on this project in March 1998  
when he met Sebastian Failla, who worked in satellite 
communications. They spent the next year working on the plan and 
trying to sell it professional sports leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	They were joined by a third partner and began by using the  
system at Red Dogs games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to start with a venue big enough to try the system  
but not overwhelming,'' Covone said. 
</P>
<P>
	The headsets have been available at home games this season, with  
the Red Dogs getting a percentage of the profits, team spokesman 
Kevin McKearney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only hesitation we had was for the logistics,'' McKearney  
said. ``After that first meeting pretty much, we knew it was 
definitely something we would like to be involved in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up to four players wear microphones at every home game. The  
signal from the microphones is sent to tiny receivers spectators 
can rent for $10. The talk is live and uncensored, and even 
children are permitted to rent a receiver. The headset comes with a 
pamphlet warning of rough language. 
</P>
<P>
	ISS might shut the sound if a situation appears heated and the  
language profane. The sound is also turned off during huddles to 
provide security. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like living-room surround sound at your seat,'' Failla  
said. ``If somebody gets hit you feel it in your seat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what encouraged Tim Rogers, 33, of Dover, to try the  
headsets for the first time at a recent game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to hear the hits,'' the season-ticket holder said. ``I  
want to hear the oomphs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While different players are wired each game, one player used  
consistently is wide receiver Alvin Ashley, a fan favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had some good response from fans,'' he said. ``It makes  
them feel closer to the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he sometimes says hello to fans if he sees them wearing  
a headset. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the fans involved,'' he said. ``If the fans get excited,  
they get me excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a recent game, fans could hear Ashley talking on the sideline  
and running down the field. They could also hear his annoyance at a 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Covone would not say exactly how many people wear the headsets  
at Red Dogs games, but said it totals about 1 to 2 percent of the 
crowd. With average attendance at about 4,600 a game, that would 
amount to 46 to 92 fans with headsets. 
</P>
<P>
	ISS has been talking with the major professional leagues about  
the system. The company is still working out issues of play 
security as well as getting the best equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Failla envisions spectators being able to hear everything from  
trash talking during an NBA game to blitzes in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll revolutionize spectator sports,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	That's something fan Don Jordan of East Stroudsburg, Pa., would  
love. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be great to see it done at the NFL level,'' he said.  
``Can you imagine listening to the quarterback during the Super 
Bowl? It would be outrageous.''

<HEADLINE>  US Team Arrives For World Cup Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Girls cheered and chanted, waved flags and  
balloons. And that was just a warmup for the hysteria that broke 
out Monday as the U.S. soccer team arrived for the Women's World 
Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	Bemused passengers coming off the same flight from San Francisco  
were applauded as the impatient crowd at Los Angeles International 
Airport waited for such stars as Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy and Michelle 
Akers to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
	Once they did, the cheering and pushing was incessant.  
</P>
<P>
	Players and team personnel walked under an arch of yellow, red,  
green and white balloons and past a line of young girls barely 
restrained by black and gray rope. As a steel band played, girls 
wearing white World Cup T-shirts pressed yellow sunflowers into 
some players' hands and chanted ``U-S-A, U-S-A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then the race was on.  
</P>
<P>
	The players moved as a group through the United Airlines  
terminal toward the downstairs baggage claim. Girls dashed after 
them, bumping into startled travelers and TV camera crews in a mad 
scramble for autographs and photos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day has been kind of a surprise at the level of support  
and notoriety this team is experiencing,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco 
said. ``This was awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foudy captured it all on her ever-present video camera. Hamm  
slapped the hands that stretched toward her. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fun,'' said Stephany Campbell, a 10-year-old soccer  
player from Long Beach. ``I got a signature from the coach. I got 
to hug Julie and I said good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans take on China for the World Cup championship  
Saturday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Brazil and Norway will meet 
for third place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I threatened the team that if we didn't make it back here,  
that it was over,'' Foudy joked. ``I have quite a large hooligan 
section that is going to be at the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The girls, excitedly comparing autographs on their T-shirts,  
rushed outside for more close-up looks of their favorite players. 
The U.S. team finally escaped the chaos by boarding its charter 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is so exciting,'' said Leanne Segal, a 38-year-old mother  
of three girls from Pacific Palisades. ``They're being celebrated 
for who they are, which is phenomenal athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicole Amador, 10, of Wilmington, gave her sunflower to Hamm.  
</P>
<P>
	``She scores a lot of goals and she's fun to watch,'' Amador  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCicco signed autographs for the youngsters, many of whom play  
on area teams. He smiled at the whirlwind around him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never felt like Ricky Martin, but I felt like coach of a  
very, very successful team,'' he said. ``A team that's won the 
hearts of America and a team that hopefully, will win the World 
Cup.''

<HEADLINE>  United States 2, Brazil 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- As the ball floated temptingly toward  
the U.S. net, the huge crowd collectively gasped. American players 
turned and stared at the one woman who could save them. 
</P>
<P>
	And Briana Scurry did just that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Never a doubt,'' defender Kate Sobrero said after Scurry made  
the first of several spectacular saves Sunday, preserving the 
United States' 2-0 victory over Brazil and earning a berth in the 
Women's World Cup final against China. ``We know that if we need 
it, Bri is going to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans needed it before 73,123 on the Fourth of July,  
when their usual offensive fireworks often turned into duds. Scurry 
tipped that shot by Brazil's Nene from 35 yards just over the 
crossbar early in the second half. Later, Scurry barely got a hand 
on Nene's kick in the 56th minute and made a sprawling two-handed 
stop on Pretinha in the 83rd. 
</P>
<P>
	So while the attack generally sputtered as the grind of playing  
two games in less than three full days affected both sides, Scurry 
stood firm for her 52nd career shutout and third of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any game where I can do my part and get my team in the final  
of the Women's World Cup is my best game,'' said Scurry, who also 
backstopped the Americans to a 1996 Olympic gold medal, then 
streaked through the streets of Athens, Ga. -- for a few seconds -- 
in celebration. ``I definitely think today was my best effort in 
five years of playing with the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But she might need another such display in Saturday's final at  
the Rose Bowl. China routed Norway, the defending champion, 5-0 in 
the other semifinal in Foxboro, Mass., and has looked like the best 
team in the field throughout the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the United States has been inconsistent.  
</P>
<P>
	Against Brazil, which U.S. coach Tony DiCicco once again called  
``the most improved team in our sport,'' there was little flow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think fatigue probably played a part,'' said U.S. star Mia  
Hamm, who created a few scoring opportunities and was fouled in the 
penalty area, setting up Michelle Akers' 80th-minute penalty kick 
goal. ``Both teams are pretty emotional, attacking teams. We both 
had our surges where we would be in their end for 15 or 20 minutes, 
then they would be near our goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But every time the Brazilians got close, Scurry was too good.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to keep them under wraps,'' Scurry said. ``Brazil's  
going to get their chances no matter how well you play defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just know that when the shots go up, I have to be there. I  
feel I really helped our team out to win today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For once, the Americans got going quickly, thanks to a misplay  
by Brazil keeper Maravilha. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Foudy's long cross went directly to the goalie. But as she  
leaped for it, the ball went off her hands into the air and Cindy 
Parlow headed it home in the fifth minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been behind in some games and had to come back,'' Parlow  
said. ``This time, we concentrated on not falling behind and it 
made things a lot easier for us to play our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was tight until Carla Overbeck's goal kick was headed  
downfield by Akers to Hamm, who broke into the penalty area. She 
was nudged by Brazil captain Elane and went down. Referee Katriina 
Elovirta signaled the penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``FIFA should punish the referee,'' Brazil coach Wilson de  
Oliveira said. ``In such a match of importance, to have poor 
quality refereeing with so many fouls not being punished ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akers supplied the worst kind of punishment for Brazil, sending  
the ball into the right side of the net for a 2-0 edge. 
</P>
<P>
	It was over, and the Americans could celebrate their second trip  
to the World Cup final in the three times the event has been held; 
they won in 1991. Sprinting to the far end of the field, they 
congratulated Scurry, who left the stadium pumping her arms above 
her head and saluting the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Scurry who drew the salutes afterward.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was the player of the game,'' Wilson said. ``She made the  
difference.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Tours Poverty-Stricken Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TYNER, Ky. (AP) -- Ray Pennington sat in the shade of a walnut  
tree outside his tumbledown wooden house, a portable oxygen tank 
helping him breathe, as President Clinton cut a swath through 
Pennington's extended family to stand before the older man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see you,'' Clinton said, and extended his hand.  
``Well, I am too,'' Pennington said as he accepted it. A look of 
joy spread across the older man's craggy face when Clinton sat down 
beside him, sipped a Mountain Dew and chatted about the hot 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived 69 years, and this is the first time I've ever seen  
a president. It's a pleasure to meet you,'' Pennington said simply. 
</P>
<P>
	People like Pennington -- who spent his life slaughtering hogs  
and now is struggling with emphysema -- were the focus Monday as 
Clinton began a four-day, cross-country tour to promote a plan for 
drawing jobs and investment to areas that have not shared in the 
prosperity of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though this is a blessed time for America, not all  
Americans have been blessed by it,'' the president said during a 
rally on Main Street in Hazard, Ky. ``So I came here to show 
America who you are. ... It's been a hot day. But when I'm gone, I 
hope you will remember more than the president came, and you were 
hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a handful of business executives, Cabinet secretaries and  
politicians in tow, Clinton flew by helicopter to Tyner and drove 
into the Whispering Pines community, a cluster of small trailer 
homes with about 100 residents, many of them Pennington's 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington's daughter, Jean Collett, 48, escorted Clinton along  
a gravel drive that connected her small beige house with those of 
her father and her daughter, Betty Jo Brewster, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Collett quit her job at the local Dairy Queen to care for  
her newly widowed father; the family relies heavily on the $6.30 an 
hour that Mrs. Brewster's husband, Anthony, earns at a local 
electronics plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The president explained his plan to expand Medicare to Mrs.  
Collett as they walked the short distance to Pennington's home, 
which faced a large satellite dish and an above-ground swimming 
pool in Mrs. Brewster's backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who clustered along their path told Clinton they have  
a crying need for better transportation and better housing. Most of 
the homes had broken windows, some covered with cardboard or wood. 
Two large fans tilted precariously in the windows of Mrs. 
Brewster's home, blowing hot air on a sweltering 97-degree day. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first electricity was in 1961. I didn't have running water  
in a bathroom until five years ago,'' Mrs. Collett said.

	Clinton wants to extend the country's good economic times to  
places like this, from Appalachia to the Watts area of Los Angeles. 
``We have to provide incentives for people to go there,'' he said. 
``We know that government can't solve these problems alone; We know 
that we'll never get anywhere by leaving people alone either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is characterizing these areas as an $80  
billion untapped market, in terms that seem to ring of a trade 
mission to Africa or Latin America. Along the way, the business 
leaders planned to announce various investments and assistance to 
the communities they visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need help. We need hope,'' said Mayor William Gorman of  
Hazard, a depressed coal-mining town. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hazard, First Union National Bank committed $5 million in  
small business equity loans in Appalachia; BellSouth was announcing 
a partnership with the Kentucky community college system to place 
100 people in technical and customer service jobs; and Bank One was 
investing $1 million in the new Appalachian Ohio Development Fund, 
which will provide financing and technical assistance to small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Appalachia does not represent poverty, but potential,'' civil  
rights leader Jesse Jackson, who accompanied Clinton, told the 
crowd. ``You've worked hard enough, you've paid your dues enough. 
... Let Hazard share in the wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving Tyner, Clinton visited Mid-South Electronics,  
which expanded from 40 employees 10 years ago to 850 today, and 
just completed a $6 million expansion aided by a federal 
empowerment zone tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The empowerment zone did its thing,'' said Jerry Weaver,  
chairman of the plant's parent company, Mid-South Industries. He 
said the tax credit, worth about $300,000 per year, was a factor in 
the expansion. ``It gave me a good feeling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are pushing their own anti-poverty program that  
emphasizes tax breaks and other economic incentives, and House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., sent a letter to Clinton on Sunday 
seeking his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was headed next to the Mississippi Delta; East St.  
Louis, Ill.; South Phoenix, Ariz.; the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation in South Dakota, and Los Angeles. The final event is an 
Anaheim, Calif., conference focusing on getting at-risk youths into 
the workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton flew Monday night to Memphis, Tenn., the jumping-off  
spot for the Mississippi visit.

<HEADLINE> Autopsy Specialist Sees Green Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vidal Herrera's van says a lot about the man.  
</P>
<P>
	``1-800-Autopsy'' is emblazoned on the side. The vanity plate  
reads ``YSPOTUA'' -- that's autopsy spelled backward. And his 
license plate frame offers this advice: ``Autopsy techs do it with 
more rigor mortis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera is a freelance -- and very mobile -- autopsy specialist,  
charging $2,000 for his services, and a little more if he digs up 
the corpse. 
</P>
<P>
	And in true entrepreneurial spirit, he's preparing for the bulge  
of baby boomers about to usher in what he calls a golden age of 
death: The man who is known as the rolling El Muerto (``The Dead 
One'' in Spanish) is franchising his services nationally. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's 1-800-DENTIST and 1-800-FLOWERS, why not  
1-800-AUTOPSY?'' asked the 47-year-old owner of Los Angeles-based 
Autopsy/Post Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The former coroner's investigator arranges private autopsies on  
bodies from all over the world. He hires a freelance pathologist 
and assists with the grim work himself. 
</P>
<P>
	His catalogue of services includes DNA analysis, tissue  
procurement, medical photography as well as trial, television and 
movie consulting. Herrera even helped out the most notorious TV 
medical examiner show -- ``Quincy, M.E.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big part of his business involves retrieving brains and joints  
from bodies donated for medical research. He also recycles hearing 
aids, pacemakers and prostheses for use in Third World countries. 
They can't be reused in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera opened shop 11 years ago, concerned about the drop in  
autopsies amid cuts in hospital staff and health services. 
Postmortems are performed on 7 percent of hospital deaths, down 
from 42 percent in 1965, according to the Archives of Pathology and 
Laboratory Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera, who worked 20 years with the Los Angeles County  
Coroner's Office, suspects that deaths caused by foul play or 
malpractice go undetected because of the nationwide decline in 
autopsies. In fact, he said, a quarter of all cases he does are 
misdiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract autopsies like those Herrera offers are on the increase  
nationwide, and his fee is $1,500 less than the county coroner's 
office would charge for a private autopsy. Herrera expects to 
perform at least 800 this year and is about to sell franchises for 
$30,000 each -- which doesn't include $45,000 in equipment -- in 72 
American cities and 16 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe, and state in our motto, 'Mortis praesdium et vocem  
dare necesee est' -- the deceased must be protected and given a 
voice,'' he said. ``We fulfill that goal by allowing otherwise 
hidden information to come to light, even though the deceased can 
no longer speak for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saws, scalpels, specimen bottles and an Igloo ice chest for  
transporting organs are the tools of his trade. The Chevrolet van 
also has a fax machine and a cellular telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always ready to do an autopsy,'' he said, adding that he  
works seven days a week, 23 1/2 hours a day. ``We need 30 minutes 
meditation a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of Herrera's biggest supporters is Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.,  
the attorney who helped defend O.J. Simpson. ``Without fail, the 
autopsies and reports conducted by their independent pathologists 
have been extremely well prepared and thorough,'' Cochran said in a 
letter of recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	Plummeting numbers of autopsies and the aging of Baby Boomers  
mean Herrera's business is set to expand. Census figures show that 
79 million people age 65 or older will live in the United States by 
2050, up 150 percent from 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a recession-proof business,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> China Soccer Team Readies for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- China had just won 5-0, matching the  
biggest margin of defeat ever for the Norwegian women's soccer 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Could the Chinese possibly play better than they did in Sunday's  
World Cup semifinal? 
</P>
<P>
	``Very possible,'' China coach Ma Yuanen said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese -- and the Americans -- will find out Saturday when  
they meet for the World Cup title at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Two goals in the first 14 minutes Sunday gave China control. And  
Norway didn't manage a shot for the entire first half. Then the 
Chinese put three shots in the first 27 minutes of the second half 
past goalkeeper Bente Nordby, who had allowed just three goals in 
Norway's previous four games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese coach, though, wasn't satisfied.  
</P>
<P>
	``After we led 2-0, some of the team members were making  
constant errors,'' Ma said. ``In the first half, there were two 
opportunities which the players didn't maximize. If we did, the 
game would have been easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China, though, was still impressive enough to earn the nod from  
Norwegian coach Per-Mathias Hogmo. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that China beat the USA already twice, so I  
think they will be a favorite in the final,'' Hogmo said, ``but 
they will meet a very enthusiastic American team so I think it will 
be an interesting fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States must find a way to stop Sun Wen, whose two  
goals Sunday tied her for the tournament lead with Sissi of Brazil 
with seven. 
</P>
<P>
	It also will have to cope with China's team speed. In the first  
half, Zhao Lihong repeatedly sped up the left side past her 
defender and made crossing passes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese ``are very good on free kicks and corner kicks and  
the U.S. should watch out for that,'' Norway's Linda Medalen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Ailing's two goals that made the score 2-0 and 4-0 both came  
off corner kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also must beat goalkeeper Gao Hong. She had an  
easy first half Sunday, but was sharp several times in the second 
half when Norway had offensive opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Norway was the best team we played in the tournament, but we  
play with a sense of spiritual unity,'' said Gao, who has three 
shutouts as China has outscored opponents 19-2 in going 5-0. She 
has not faced a tough test since a 2-1 win over Sweden in her World 
Cup opener. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also must be careful from the start. They fell  
behind 1-0 to Nigeria in the first round and 2-1 at halftime to 
Germany in the quarterfinals. An early deficit may not be so easy 
to overcome in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	China has a 2-1 record against the United States this year. They  
last met April 25 at East Rutherford, N.J., where China won 2-1. Ma 
hopes his team can play next Saturday the way it did then. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese team has the confidence to play a very good  
game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think they'd be so strong,'' Hogmo said. ``They  
impressed me a lot.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Medicare Policy Reviewed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elderly and disabled Americans who rack up  
unusually high bills for medicines would not be rescued by Medicare 
prescription drug coverage President Clinton has proposed. Many 
others already get better drug benefits as part of retirement 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's proposed drug coverage could help many who have  
moderate drug costs and no coverage now or who buy comparatively 
expensive individual insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``How good a deal it is sort of varies, depending on what you  
have now,'' said Margaret Davis, assistant director of the 
Institute for Medicare Practice at the Mount Sinai School of 
Medicine in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal to add prescription drug coverage to  
Medicare, made public last week, would be available as an option to 
all 39 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries starting in 2002. 
People would have a one-year window to decide whether they want the 
drug benefit, either in 2002 or the year they become eligible for 
Medicare at age 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare now covers only drugs administered in hospitals or  
doctors offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who opt for the new benefit would pay a $24-a-month  
premium. In return, the government would pay half the price of 
their prescriptions up to a $1,000 annual cap on federal payments. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2008, the premium would rise to $44 a month and the maximum  
government payment to $2,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For the one-third of Medicare beneficiaries without drug  
coverage now -- including many disabled Americans turned away by 
private insurers -- the new benefit would be a modest help. 
</P>
<P>
	Prescription costs per person for Medicare beneficiaries are  
around $600 per year, on average. Under Clinton's plan, someone 
whose drugs cost that much in 2002 would pay $588 -- the $288 annual 
premium plus $300 in cost sharing -- saving $12. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum savings possible would be $712, for those with  
$2,000 or more in drug costs. About 13 percent of Medicare 
beneficiaries have drug bills that high. 
</P>
<P>
	For them, the help Clinton is offering will not go very far,  
consumer advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
	``That small percentage of people with big expenses, those are  
the people who need help the most,'' said Gail Shearer, director of 
health policy analysis for Consumers Union. ``But the problem 
politically is if you target the funds there, it's not going to be 
very popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would provide more substantial help for those  
with incomes near the poverty level, who would pay no premium or 
cost-sharing. The administration also predicts that, as a large 
purchaser, Medicare will be able to negotiate drug discounts 
resulting in savings of 10 percent to 15 percent for all 
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proposed Medicare benefit would be a step down for most  
of the 10 million retirees who get drug coverage from former 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``People covered by employer plans will be better off staying  
with the employer plans,'' said Richard Ostuw, global practice 
director for Watson Wyatt Worldwide consultants in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Most retirees who get drug coverage from large companies pay  
premiums of only a few dollars a month, cost-sharing is normally 
limited to a flat $5 to $10 charge regardless of the price of the 
prescription, and caps on insurance payments are unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Retirees would be able to keep better employer-sponsored  
benefits since the Medicare drug coverage Clinton proposes would be 
voluntary. But Republican lawmakers critical of Clinton's plan 
worry that companies may feel they no longer must offer drug 
coverage to retirees if Medicare does. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will employers drop the currently provided retiree coverage  
for drugs when a universal new benefit is paid for by the 
government?'' wonders Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House 
Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants new financial incentives to help encourage  
companies to keep offering retiree drug benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, most of the 3 million Americans who now buy  
private individual insurance to supplement Medicare, known as 
Medigap, likely would prefer the benefits Clinton has proposed. 
Premiums for Medigap policies vary widely, but the portion 
accounting for drug benefits can range from $60 to $150 a month, 
according to estimates from the insurance industry and consumer 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than double Clinton's plan. Plus, Medigap requires a  
$250 deductible before coverage kicks in. Medicare would have no 
deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	Medigap does offer higher maximum reimbursements: $1,250 or  
$3,000 a year, depending on the policy. For that reason, some 
people with high drug costs might still find Medigap attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Least certain is how Clinton's proposal would affect the 6  
million Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs. About two-thirds of HMOs 
now offer some prescription coverage as a perquoisite to attract 
older customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Clinton's plan, HMOs participating in Medicare would have  
to offer drug benefits. But it's unclear whether those that already 
do that would change their coverage.

<HEADLINE> Now, Back to the Big Celebration / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Fourth of July fireworks were nice --  
entertaining and very pretty -- but of course they lasted only a 
brief time. Now back to the stock market, where prices explode 
almost every day, all day long. 
</P>
<P>
	From that perspective, the Fourth was just a restful weekend  
respite from the frantic, yearlong, financial festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Year long? How about decade long? Since 1989, the Dow Jones  
industrial average has risen five-fold. Impressive, without a 
doubt, but consider this: Since its August 1982 low, the Dow has 
risen 14 times! 
</P>
<P>
	A celebration of this sort is historic; nothing comparable has  
ever occurred before, and in spite of an oversupply of 
free-spending, new-era investors, there's a good chance it won't 
happen again for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, it has, for the time being, ridiculed as nonsense  
some of the most fundamental, elementary, time-honored principles 
of investing, such as the role of profits in setting the price of 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Amazon.com rose 900 percent last year while earning  
nothing at all. It still hasn't, but that's okay under the new 
rule, which declares that you don't need profits if you gain market 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	If that sounds extreme and exceptional, it nevertheless is  
symbolic of what is occurring these days. What once were considered 
healthy price-to-earnings ratios, that is around 15, are now double 
that and rising. 
</P>
<P>
	PE ratios measure confidence; they indicate the number of times  
annual per-share earnings that investors are willing to pay for a 
stock. As such, they measure expectations; the higher the PE, the 
higher the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Flament, an analyst at Wright Investors' Service, has  
made detailed studies of how today's prices deviate from long-term 
norms. An example: 
</P>
<P>
	It took Microsoft nearly 10 years from its initial public  
offering in 1986, during which earnings rose about 50 percent a 
year, to grow by as much as no-profit Amazon grew in 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	High expectations aren't new, of course, nor were they back in  
the 1920s. Analyst Charles Allmon recalls a significant passaqe 
from Benjamin Graham's classic tome, ``Security Analysis,'' that 
describes the kind of thinking that existed in the 1920s, to wit: 
</P>
<P>
	``Making money in the stock market was now the easiest thing in  
the world. It was only necessary to buy 'good stocks' regardless of 
price, and then let nature take its course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eerie reminders of that sort could put a damper on the current  
celebration. But maybe not. The current market has defied almost 
all negative opinions and forecasts, including those of Alan 
Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, as newspaper readers have read again and again, is  
chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and thus 
is this country's most powerful and best known monetary figure. 
</P>
<P>
	For more than two years he has expressed doubts about the  
durability of the stock market. He has warned about irrationality 
and exuberance. And he has now emphasized his concern by raising 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing has stopped this market for more than a few days at  
a time. Perhaps, in spite of all, the marketplace has sensed a rosy 
future not evident from the usual statistical studies. Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	And maybe not. The future does not reveal its plans.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Tours Poverty-Stricken Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TYNER, Ky. (AP) -- Ray Pennington sat in the shade of a walnut  
tree outside his tumbledown wooden house, a portable oxygen tank 
helping him breathe, as President Clinton cut a swath through 
Pennington's extended family to stand before the older man. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see you,'' Clinton said, and extended his hand.  
``Well, I am too,'' Pennington said as he accepted it. A look of 
joy spread across the older man's craggy face when Clinton sat down 
beside him, sipped a Mountain Dew and chatted about the hot 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived 69 years, and this is the first time I've ever seen  
a president. It's a pleasure to meet you,'' Pennington said simply. 
</P>
<P>
	People like Pennington -- who spent his life slaughtering hogs  
and now is struggling with emphysema -- were the focus Monday as 
Clinton began a four-day, cross-country tour to promote a plan for 
drawing jobs and investment to areas that have not shared in the 
prosperity of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though this is a blessed time for America, not all  
Americans have been blessed by it,'' the president said during a 
rally on Main Street in Hazard, Ky. ``So I came here to show 
America who you are. ... It's been a hot day. But when I'm gone, I 
hope you will remember more than the president came, and you were 
hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a handful of business executives, Cabinet secretaries and  
politicians in tow, Clinton flew by helicopter to Tyner and drove 
into the Whispering Pines community, a cluster of small trailer 
homes with about 100 residents, many of them Pennington's 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennington's daughter, Jean Collett, 48, escorted Clinton along  
a gravel drive that connected her small beige house with those of 
her father and her daughter, Betty Jo Brewster, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Collett quit her job at the local Dairy Queen to care for  
her newly widowed father; the family relies heavily on the $6.30 an 
hour that Mrs. Brewster's husband, Anthony, earns at a local 
electronics plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The president explained his plan to expand Medicare to Mrs.  
Collett as they walked the short distance to Pennington's home, 
which faced a large satellite dish and an above-ground swimming 
pool in Mrs. Brewster's backyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents who clustered along their path told Clinton they have  
a crying need for better transportation and better housing. Most of 
the homes had broken windows, some covered with cardboard or wood. 
Two large fans tilted precariously in the windows of Mrs. 
Brewster's home, blowing hot air on a sweltering 97-degree day. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first electricity was in 1961. I didn't have running water  
in a bathroom until five years ago,'' Mrs. Collett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to extend the country's good economic times to  
places like this, from Appalachia to the Watts area of Los Angeles. 
``We have to provide incentives for people to go there,'' he said. 
``We know that government can't solve these problems alone; We know 
that we'll never get anywhere by leaving people alone either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is characterizing these areas as an $80  
billion untapped market, in terms that seem to ring of a trade 
mission to Africa or Latin America. Along the way, the business 
leaders planned to announce various investments and assistance to 
the communities they visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need help. We need hope,'' said Mayor William Gorman of  
Hazard, a depressed coal-mining town. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hazard, First Union National Bank committed $5 million in  
small business equity loans in Appalachia; BellSouth was announcing 
a partnership with the Kentucky community college system to place 
100 people in technical and customer service jobs; and Bank One was 
investing $1 million in the new Appalachian Ohio Development Fund, 
which will provide financing and technical assistance to small 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Appalachia does not represent poverty, but potential,'' civil  
rights leader Jesse Jackson, who accompanied Clinton, told the 
crowd. ``You've worked hard enough, you've paid your dues enough. 
... Let Hazard share in the wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving Tyner, Clinton visited Mid-South Electronics,  
which expanded from 40 employees 10 years ago to 850 today, and 
just completed a $6 million expansion aided by a federal 
empowerment zone tax credit. 
</P>

	``The empowerment zone did its thing,'' said Jerry Weaver,  
chairman of the plant's parent company, Mid-South Industries. He 
said the tax credit, worth about $300,000 per year, was a factor in 
the expansion. ``It gave me a good feeling,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are pushing their own anti-poverty program that  
emphasizes tax breaks and other economic incentives, and House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., sent a letter to Clinton on Sunday 
seeking his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was headed next to the Mississippi Delta; East St.  
Louis, Ill.; South Phoenix, Ariz.; the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation in South Dakota, and Los Angeles. The final event is an 
Anaheim, Calif., conference focusing on getting at-risk youths into 
the workforce.

<P>
	Clinton flew Monday night to Memphis, Tenn., the jumping-off  
spot for the Mississippi visit.

<HEADLINE> Top Sprinters Endorse Drug Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Maurice Greene and Ato Boldon, the two hottest  
sprinters on the IAAF circuit, said Monday that their goal was to 
keep track and field drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
	They expressed full support for all anti-drug measures.  
</P>
<P>
	``We love drug tests,'' said Greene, the world champion and  
world record-holder in the 100-meter dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene and his training partner Boldon offered their strong  
stand against drugs during a press conference for Wednesday's 
Golden Gala meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, who beat Greene in the 100 at the Athletissima meet in  
Lausanne, Switzerland, last week, will run his favorite distance, 
the 200, on Wednesday. Greene will compete in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, will face Olympic champion Michael  
Johnson, who will be in a 200 for the first time in six weeks. 
Johnson missed the 200 at the U.S. Championships last month because 
of injury. He is coming off a season best of 43.92 in the 400 at 
Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Gala is the second of the seven-meet Golden League  
series, which awards a $1 million jackpot. The jackpot will be 
divided equally among all athletes who win the same discipline in 
all seven meets. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon won the 200 in the series' first meet at Oslo, Norway,  
but was disqualified for stepping on the line.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Garth Brooks will shed his twang and assume  
an alter ego that will have him singing pop songs for an upcoming 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said he will play doomed fictional pop star Chris Gaines  
in ``The Lamb,'' scheduled for release next year, the Los Angeles

</P>
<P>
	Brooks will also release a collection of the fictional artist's  
greatest hits in September. Fans of the 37-year-old singer may not

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Lower at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday as  
traders stayed cautious after central bank intervention the 
previous day. Japanese stocks fell marginally. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.17 yen at midday, down 0.41 yen from late  
Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 11.21 points,  
or 0.06 percent, to close the morning session at 18,123.85. On 
Monday, the average closed up 202.59 points, or 1.13 percent, 
finishing at 18,135.06 -- its highest closing level since September 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign exchange, the dollar traded in a narrow range, its  
downside limited amid wariness following the Bank of Japan's 
greenback-buying Monday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, financial markets in New York were closed Monday for a  
national holiday, leaving a dearth of news to affect trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 124.81 yen, down  
from 125.57 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices dropped slightly on profit-taking,  
especially in blue-chip issues. The Nikkei average had gained 3.5 
percent in the three sessions prior to Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the recent pace of gains was fast, a brief pause was  
natural,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But traders predicted the fall in stock prices would be limited.  
``Many investors want to buy actively if the Nikkei index nears the 
18,000 mark,'' Hatae said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the average surged after the Bank of Japan's  
quarterly ``tankan'' survey showed that business sentiment had 
improved in the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 0.78 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,485.80. 
The TOPIX closed up 26.42 points, or 1.81 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.6300  
percent from Monday's finish of 1.6100 percent, driving its price 
down to 101.48 yen from 101.66 yen.

<HEADLINE> AL All-Star Starters Are Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra, backed by Boston's high-tech  
campaigning, was elected to the All-Star game Monday. Four 
Cleveland Indians benefited from more traditional methods to gain 
their starting spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who lead the majors in attendance, will send Jim  
Thome, Roberto Alomar, Kenny Lofton and Manny Ramirez to the 
All-Star game July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the biggest shakeup of the final week, Garciaparra passed  
the Yankees' Derek Jeter and Cleveland's Omar Vizquel to start at 
shortstop in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably as shocked as you guys,'' Garciaparra said.  
``It's an honor. It's nice when it's at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer, said last  
Thursday none of the Internet votes had been counted until the last 
week. Fans were allowed to vote 22 times on the Internet -- the 
average number of home games for each team during the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra apparently benefited from Boston's aggressive  
campaigning on-line. Garciaparra, who trailed Jeter by 30,655 votes 
last week, finished with 1,089,974. Jeter was second with 1,069,528 
and Vizquel was third with 1,038,362. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans are going to vote for who they want to see,'' Jeter  
said. ``I don't think you can go wrong with a number of shortstops 
in our league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome (1,364,692) will be at first base, Alomar (2,793,891) at  
second. Lofton (1,676,595) and Ramirez (1,898,430) join leading 
vote-getter Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go out there and have some fun, enjoy a little time  
off,'' Lofton said. ``It's a mental break from the action of the 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey is the leading All-Star vote-getter for the fourth  
straight year and seventh time overall. Elected to start for the 
10th consecutive time, he got 2,918,055 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans want to see their favorite players and guys they think  
are deserving of going. So when they choose you, it's an honor,'' 
Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the AL starting lineup: Texas' Ivan Rodriguez  
(1,897,774) at catcher, Baltimore's Cal Ripken (1,285,728) at third 
base and Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco (1,664,282) at designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've come full circle,'' said Canseco, who made the team for  
the first time since 1992. ``I went from being the best baseball 
player in the world, hands down by far at one point, to more or 
less almost an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the nine starters also started last year's game. Ramirez  
took the place of Texas' Juan Gonzalez, who said he won't play this 
year because he is not starting, and Garciaparra made it ahead of 
Seattle's Alex Rodriguez. There was no DH last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken will make his 17th consecutive All-Star appearance and  
16th straight start. Ripken, who led balloting in 1992 and '95, 
ties Rod Carew as the only players elected to start 15 times -- in 
1988 Alan Trammell was elected but got hurt and Ripken started in 
his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of uncertainty at the start of the year, with  
my father passing away and a major injury,'' Ripken said. ``I was 
able to heal up physically, and it looks like I was able to heal up 
mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez will make his eighth straight All-Star appearance and  
Alomar was elected for the eighth time. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop was the most competitive position, with the three  
teams actively campaigning. Yankees manager Joe Torre argued 
Jeter's case through the media, the Red Sox stumped for Garciaparra 
on the Internet and the Indians flashed nightly scoreboard messages 
at Jacobs Field urging fans to push Vizquel over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it was the modern technique, and Garciaparra's  
performance, that won out. Garciaparra is hitting .366, with 14 
homers and 57 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering Monday, Jeter was second in the AL with a .377 average  
and has 14 homers and 58 RBIs. Vizquel is batting .336 average with 
two homers, 35 RBIs and 17 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's to say who should start,'' Garciaparra said. ``When I  
look at Derek, looking at what he's doing this year, it's 
unbelievable. If you ask me, I believe he deserves to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will have no starters for the second straight year.  
Torre will manage the AL team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just that different cities do different things,'' Torre  
said. ``I think they do more politicking and lobbying in other 
ballparks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey gets $100,000 bonus for getting elected and having the  
most AL votes, and will get an additional $25,000 if he's the major 
league leader. Ripken also gets a $100,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, Garciaparra, Canseco, Lofton, Ramirez, Rodriguez and  
Thome each get $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	NL starters will be released Tuesday and reserves for both  
leagues will be announced Wednesday.

	LONDON (AP) -- Centrica PLC, owner of British Gas, plans to buy  
Britain's Automobile Association for 1.1 billion pounds ($1.76 
billion), creating a business that offers a full range of services 
for home and car owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Monday must be approved by AA members but is  
expected to be completed by the end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The AA is the country's leading motoring organization and  
provides breakdown services for 9.5 million drivers. It earned a 
pretax profit in 1998 of 19.7 million pounds ($31.5 million) on 
sales of 627 million pounds ($1 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Centrica sells gas and electricity to homes and businesses. It  
posted an operating profit last year of 208 million pounds ($333 
million) on sales of 7.48 billion pounds ($11.97 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies said they have similar operations in terms of  
marketing, phone call-in centers and management structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the acquisition offers clear benefits to both  
organizations,'' Centrica chief executive Roy Gardner said in a

<HEADLINE> Tomjanovich To Miss Oly. Qualifying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Rudy Tomjanovich of the Houston  
Rockets is recovering from ``extreme physical exhaustion'' and 
won't coach the United States during an Olympic qualifying 
tournament this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital, and  
Rockets team doctor Jim Muntz suggested that he take about a month 
off from work, according to team spokesman Tim Frank. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown will replace Tomjanovich  
for the tournament in Puerto Rico on July 14-25, according to USA 
Basketball. But Tomjanovich apparently will still coach the U.S. 
team at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been given no indication by USA Basketball that this  
will affect Rudy's status for 2000,'' Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Monday night at the Rockets' training  
center in Houston, Tomjanovich looked healthy but was low-key. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed and I'm going to do my best to recharge  
myself and get ready for the coming season,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USA team, which begins training Tuesday, includes San  
Antonio's Tim Duncan and New York's Allan Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which has won gold medals at the last two  
Olympics, must finish among the top two teams in the 10-team 
tournament to earn a berth in the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomjanovich led a team of CBA and college players to a bronze  
medal at last summer's world championships in Greece. That team 
didn't have NBA players because of the lockout and wasn't expected 
to do that well. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who along with Purdue's Gene Keady and Kentucky's Tubby  
Smith were named as assistants, has served on three USA Basketball 
coaching staffs.

<HEADLINE> Total Fina in Hostile Bid for Elf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French oil group Total Fina launched an unsolicited  
takeover bid on Monday for Elf Aquitaine. If successful, the 
combination would be the world's fourth largest oil company in 
terms of market capitalization. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Total Fina said it was offering Elf shareholders  
four Total Fina shares for three Elf shares. The offer, worth 42 
billion euros ($42.94 billion), is conditional upon 66.7 percent 
acceptance by Elf shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	But Elf said it considered Total Fina's 4-for-3 share swap offer  
a hostile bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``This offer has not been the subject of any study or  
discussions with Elf's management and is therefore considered as 
being hostile,'' the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Elf doesn't believe the Total Fina offer is in its  
shareholders' best interests, pointing out that the value of Elf 
shares has doubled over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elf management has continued to successfully follow a clear  
strategy over the past several years directed towards the creation 
of value and the development of the company's core businesses,'' 
Elf said. The Elf board will meet to discuss the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina Chairman Thierry Desmarest said: ``Joining the two  
companies will allow us to achieve pretax synergies expected to 
aggregate 1.2 billion euros ($1.17 billion) over a three-year 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina added that the successful integration of the two  
groups ``would produce very strong earnings growth of at least 20 
percent a year, assuming a constant environment, over the coming 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be Europe's third largest oil group after  
Royal Dutch Shell and BP Amoco. It would likely enjoy strong growth 
in oil output and be better able to compete with American and 
European rivals, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups have been under pressure to increase their  
critical mass amid rapid recent consolidation in the sector in the 
United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf, once the French state's largest concern, was privatized in  
1994. Total Fina is the product of Total's merger earlier this year 
with Belgium's Petrafina.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally higher  
Monday, with the key indexes both in Tokyo and Hong Kong rising to 
over 20-month highs on the back of record gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose  
202.59 points, or 1.13 percent, finishing at 18,135.06 -- its 
highest closing level since Sept. 25, 1997, when the index closed 
at 18,341.96. On Friday, the average closed up 71.72 points at 
17,932.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks rose after a Bank of Japan survey showed business  
sentiment has improved. Prices were also boosted by Friday's gains 
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a 
record-high 11,139.24 points, up 72.82. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank survey showed a rise in confidence at large Japanese  
businesses over the past three months -- the biggest advance since 
August 1994 -- prompting some investors to buy yen. Surveyed 
companies predicted that optimism will improve further by the time 
of the next survey in September, encouraging investors. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar was quoted 122.58 yen in  
late-afternoon trading, up 1.50 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and 
above its level late Friday in New York of 121.01 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks surged for a second straight session.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chip rose 322.16 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 
14,506.74, its highest level since Oct. 8, 1997. On Friday, the 
index had soared 652.44 points, or 4.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors continued to buy blue chips in reaction  
to Friday's gains on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks have been climbing since last week following a  
small interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which 
hinted that it won't raise rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares also closed sharply higher, with the main  
index surging 3.2 percent on expectations that the government will 
maintain low interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 29.42 points to to  
962.84, its highest close since May 14, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed slightly higher as bargain-hunting  
in laggard plastic and construction stocks offset profit-taking in 
technology issues. The market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 
29.80 points, or 0.3 percent, to 8,593.35. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed slightly lower in  
absence of foreign buying. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index 
slipped 1.12 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,140.80. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, boosted by the latest  
cut in the Philippine central bank's key overnight rates and 
favorable June inflation data. The 30-company Philippine Stock 
Exchange Index rose 42.95 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,621.67. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed higher, propelled by  
enthusiastic investor sentiment spilling over from Friday's record 
rally on Wall Street. The All Ordinaries Index rose 49.2 points, or 
1.6 percent, to 3,078.1. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Profit-taking pushed the main index slightly down.  
The Composite Index fell 1.44 points to 847.06. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower as the market  
succumbed to profit-taking. The Straits Times Index fell 11.01 
points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,211.44. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed lower. The Composite  
Index fell 5.394 points, or 0.8 percent, to 665.14. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices ended marginally lower on  
profit-taking. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index slipped 0.18 
point to 533.15.

<P>
	Thunderstorms rolled across the upper Great Lakes and northern  
New England on Monday, and hot, damp air covered much of the East. 
</P>
<P>
	An area of strong thunderstorms and heavy rain spread from  
northern Minnesota into northern sections of Wisconsin and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 7 inches of rain fell Sunday and Monday around northern  
Minnesota's cities of Hibbing and Virginia, and flooding forced 
residents from their homes and swamped roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusting to 80 mph knocked down power lines and trees.  
Authorities evacuated 14 injured people from the Boundary Waters 
Canoe Area. 
</P>
<P>
	West of that area of rough weather, scattered showers and a few  
thunderstorms moved across North Dakota into northwestern 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area of thunderstorms and locally heavy rain moved  
across northern sections of New York, Vermont and New Hampshire 
into Maine, where high wind uprooted large trees and ripped down 
power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a train was going right through our house. The  
floor was rumbling right under our feet,'' said Sherry Chase of 
Moscow, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a few showers and thunderstorms developed over parts  
of Arizona and New Mexico, and along the Gulf Coast from Texas to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Isolated thunderstorms were possible over parts of Arkansas,  
eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure over the Southeast produced hot, humid weather  
over most of the region east of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperature records for the date included 103 at Newark, N.J.;  
94 at Portland, Maine; 101 at New York City; and 102 at 
Washington's National Airport. Bridgeport, Conn., hit 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a  
morning low of 24 at Stanley, Idaho, to an afternoon high of 103 at 
Newark.

<HEADLINE> 9 Feared Dead in Minn. Boat Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAYPORT, Minn. (AP) -- A fourth body was found today as divers  
searched a dark, murky river for the victims of a weekend collision 
between two speedboats. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to nine people may have been killed, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
	Washington County Sheriff Jim Frank said authorities still  
weren't sure how many people were aboard the two boats when they 
collided early Saturday on the St. Croix River. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth body floated to the surface, a Washington County  
sheriff's dispatcher said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Divers looking for other victims were having to feel their way  
across the river bottom, the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's like ``swimming in chocolate pudding,'' said Steve Porter,  
a volunteer diver. ``We're doing everything by feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two bodies were recovered Saturday and the third wasn't found  
until Sunday evening, after the discovery of two pieces of boat 
debris on the river bottom helped searchers locate the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	Both boats apparently were traveling in the same direction  
toward Hudson, Wis., when they collided shortly after 1 a.m. on 
Saturday. They reportedly had left an access area near P.D. 
Pappy's, a popular bar and restaurant in Stillwater, before 
colliding a few miles down river. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fourth of July is one of the busiest boating days of the  
year on the St. Croix, which runs along the Minnesota-Wisconsin 
state line. 
</P>
<P>
	The first three victims recovered were identified as Michael Jon  
Flamang, 31, and Steven Langer, 30, both of Apple Valley, Wis.; and 
Scott DeVille, 33, of Dresser, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Flamang and Langer were riding in the smaller boat, while  
DeVille is believed to have been piloting the other craft, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger of the two craft, worth between $80,000 and $100,000,  
was so new it wasn't registered, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	A National Transportation Safety Board team was assisting the  
investigation.

<HEADLINE>  Steels Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-NAZAIRE, France (AP) -- The Tour de France sank below sea  
level on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-rider crash on a narrow spit of land ensnared some of the  
top riders during the second stage of cycling's premier event. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill happened on the Passage du Gois, which connects a  
small island to the mainland in the coastal Atlantic Vendee region. 
The strip is no more than two car lengths wide and is usually 
submerged by water. It is closed during high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	The picturesque ocean causeway proved treacherous for such  
favorites as Alex Zulle, Michael Boogerd and Ivan Gotti. They lost 
valuable minutes when they were trapped behind the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's racing began under brilliant skies, with the 109-mile  
stage won in a final sprint by Tom Steels of Belgium. Lance 
Armstrong of Texas lost the overall lead to Estonia's Jaan 
Kirsipuu. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American, Jonathan Vaughters, fractured his chin in the  
crash and had to drop out of the race. Vaughters and Armstrong both 
ride for the U.S. Postal Service team. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, recovering from testicular cancer, is second overall.  
He is in excellent position for Sunday's time trial and the later 
mountain climbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to stay out of trouble until the real race begins  
on Sunday with the time trial,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu earned bonus points in winning two of the day's three  
sprints. In third and fourth place were sprinter Mario Cipollini of 
Italy and Germany's Erik Zabel. 
</P>
<P>
	In another strong showing for U.S. Postal, George Hincapie came  
in sixth and is seventh overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughters was taken to a hospital in Nantes, as was Marc  
Wauters, who also is out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash wasn't the first of the day -- there was an earlier  
mishap at 21 miles involving 30 riders. 
</P>
<P>
	With the beginning of the summer holiday for many of the French,  
thousands of vacationers lined the roads. They set up folding 
chairs and elaborate picnic tables along the road and leaned out of 
balconies in small villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the occasional anti-drug banner -- ``Say No to EPO'' --  
many fans showed support for French cycling star Richard Virenque. 
He is under investigation for last year's race that was nearly cut 
short because of the drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allez Richard -- We Forgive You,'' said one banner held by two  
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Race organizers say there will be spot drug tests during the  
coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong won the world championship in 1993 and competed in the  
Olympics in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that  
had spread to his lungs and brain. He had surgery to remove his 
right testicle and brain lesions, and returned to racing early last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday he thought the drug scandal was ``exaggerated and  
overblown.'' He also complained of the tactics by French police 
during last year's drug busts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think that nobody here has anything to hide,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada Contract Offer Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- Air Canada's 5,100 flight attendants have rejected  
the airline's last contract offer and are prepared to go on strike 
this week if negotiations fail, union officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers voted 89.2 percent to reject the company's last  
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pamela Sachs, president of the Air Canada branch of the Canadian  
Union of Public Employees, said the vote should send a strong 
message to the airline about the flight attendants' determination. 
</P>
<P>
	Key issues in the contract dispute include pension benefits and  
health and safety matters. Wages are not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline faces a strike deadline of midnight Wednesday night.  
Air Canada said its planes will be grounded if there is a strike or 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Cooke, an airline spokesman, said negotiations are  
continuing and held out hope that the matter might be settled 
before the deadline.

<HEADLINE> East Swelters in Hot, Muggy Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A wave of record heat and sticky, humid air enveloped the  
eastern third of the nation Monday, wilting people who had to be 
outside and shifting air conditioners into electricity-sucking 
overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
	The air ``feels like a warm, wet blanket,'' said Amanda Finley,  
22, in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking numerous showers,'' said Iris Robinson of Newark,  
N.J., where the temperature hit a record 103 degrees. ``I didn't 
really get any sleep last night. All you could do was just lay 
still and don't talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service posted heat advisories from the  
Mississippi Valley all the way to the East Coast, warning that the 
combination of humidity and high temperatures would create heat 
indexes of up to 110 and more. It was the third advisory day in a 
row for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Reds and Astros played an afternoon baseball game in  
Cincinnati, a thermometer stuck in the artificial turf at Cinergy 
Field registered 154 degrees, highest in at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperature records started falling a few minutes after noon,  
with Portland, Maine, reaching 94. New York City and Atlantic City, 
N.J. rose to a record 101, Bridgeport, Conn., registered 100 for 
the first time and Philadelphia tied its record at 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Raleigh-Durham, N.C., hit 100 -- but it wasn't a record there.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Flag Acres Zoo in Rensselaer County, N.Y., owner Harry  
VonHaggin fed his monkeys popsicles and made giant ones for bears 
by freezing fruit chunks and water in 5-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a luxury that they enjoy, and for the bears, it's a  
source of entertainment, too,'' VonHaggin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mercury hit a record 102 at Washington's Reagan National  
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hotter than at home. I expected it to be cooler here,''  
said Douglas Napo, an exchange student from the African nation of 
Togo. 
</P>
<P>
	And just west of Washington, a heat index of 115 was forecast in  
West Virginia's eastern panhandle. ``It's been 101 degrees in the 
shade on our porch thermometer,'' Angie Hott said before noon in 
Berkeley Springs, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston Mayor Thomas Menino declared a heat alert and urged the  
elderly to use community centers as ``cooling sites.'' 
Philadelphia's heat hot line was swamped with phone calls, mostly 
from older residents without air conditioning or their concerned 
relatives. Hospitals around Michigan reported a small number of 
heat-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	With air conditioners cranked up to full blast, many utilities  
asked customers to turn off unnecessary lights and appliances to 
conserve electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	The utility Conectiv, which serves parts of Delaware, Maryland  
and New Jersey, had scattered heat-related outages that blacked out 
several hundred customers, along with record demand that could 
force brownouts in some areas, said spokesman Vince Jacono. 
</P>
<P>
	In parts of New York, there were reports of roads buckling,  
backing up traffic for those returning home from the holiday 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Theria Williams of Columbus, Ohio, had a simple goal once she  
returned to her air-conditioned home after some necessary shopping: 
``Eating something else besides barbecue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Easterners got a little sympathy in the Southwest, where the  
summer sun pushes desert temperatures above 100 daily. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be 115 degrees here but it's more tolerable because of  
the lower humidity,'' former New Yorker Andrew Deschapelles said in 
Phoenix, where the forecast high was 108. ``Ninety-five degrees in 
the summer in New York is the most miserable thing on Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And there wasn't much sympathy at all from the Pacific  
Northwest, where Pendleton, Ore., cooled to a record low of 44 on 
Monday and Seattle barely warmed to 70 for the first time since 
mid-June.

<HEADLINE> Physicist Pans Nuke Lab Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- Rooting out spies should be done  
quietly, unlike recent Congressional probes at nuclear weapons 
labs, according to the man who helped design the hydrogen bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Teller, the physicist sometimes called the ``Father of  
the H-bomb,'' is skeptical of the spy hunt that has consumed 
Capitol Hill and shaken the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 
which he helped establish in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to find out about spies should be handled very, very  
quietly, and that is the exact opposite of what has happened,'' 
Teller told the Sacramento Bee in Sunday's editions. ``I would hope 
the Congress in Washington would be one-tenth as careful about not 
spreading secrets as the labs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Findings presented last week by an Energy Department security  
oversight team showed troublesome security gaps at Livermore, 
including inadequate monitoring of access to the unclassified 
computer system and deficiencies in the security force's response 
to potential terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson directed the firing  
of a scientist at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico because the man 
had been under investigation since 1996 for allegedly sharing 
nuclear secrets with China. The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, has not been 
charged with any crime and has denied giving nuclear secrets to 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	No one would accuse Teller, 91, of being soft on national  
security. His Lawrence Livermore workers made the first 
miniaturized atomic warhead for firing from a Polaris submarine in 
the 1950s. He directed the lab from 1958 to 1960, and retained 
close ties as the lab developed warheads for the Poseidon, Spartan 
and Minuteman missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	And Teller's 1954 testimony against his one-time Manhattan  
Project atomic bomb colleague, J. Robert Oppenheimer, contributed 
to Oppenheimer's career-ending loss of security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Now emeritus director of the Livermore lab, the Hungarian-born  
Teller takes exception to a House proposal that would impose a 
moratorium on lab visitors from ``sensitive'' foreign countries. 
Teller, whose extensive collaborations often were with fellow 
foreign-born scientists, called that ``the opposite direction'' 
from the one labs should go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attempting to keep secret what is not secret interferes with  
our obtaining information in other countries,'' Teller said, adding 
that ``peace can be assured through cooperation.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tours Poverty-Stricken Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAZARD, Ky. (AP) -- Going where Wall Street traders never tread,  
President Clinton embarked today on a four-day tour of some of the 
nation's poorest areas, bringing a message of hope for the needy 
and of opportunity for corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to extend the country's good economic times to its  
inner cities and rural areas -- from Appalachia to Watts -- which the 
administration is selling as an $80 billion untapped market to 
interested business executives and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time of prosperity, if we can't find a way to give  
every single hardworking American family a chance to participate in 
the future we're trying to build for our country, we'll never get 
around to doing it,'' Clinton told an ebullient crowd at the Perry 
County Courthouse in this mountain hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 2,000 people waving tiny American flags waited hours in  
blazing heat to glimpse the president. More than half a dozen 
fainted in the 95-degree temperature and were carried away by 
emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
	His visit starting today to communities in six states, designed  
to highlight legislation that would help leverage corporate 
investment in impoverished areas, has the trappings of a trade 
mission to Africa or Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of corporate chieftains are accompanying Clinton and  
several Cabinet secretaries as they scout out what programs and 
ideas have helped plant the seeds of growth in regions where the 
economic boom has yet to take root. 
</P>
<P>
	The business leaders and government officials also are  
delivering specific promises of investment and assistance to areas 
where Wall Street's wealth has yet to trickle down. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, accompanied by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and  
Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton, toured the Whispering Pines trailer park 
of Tyner, Ky., and a small business that is a beneficiary of a 
Kentucky community development corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	At the trailer park, Clinton discussed his proposal for  
significant changes in Medicare with one resident, Jean Collett, 
who quit her job as manager of a Dairy Queen to care for her 
emphysema-stricken father. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Pennington, using a respirator, was sitting outside his  
small house when Clinton walked up, shook his hand and said, ``I'm 
glad to see you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I am too,'' Pennington replied. ``I've lived 69 years  
and this is the first time I've ever seen a president. It's a 
pleasure to meet you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president sat down next to Pennington and they chatted for  
several minutes, surrounded by members of the extended family and 
Clinton's delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hazard, First Union National Bank committed $5 million in  
small business equity loans in Appalachia; BellSouth announced a 
partnership with the Kentucky community college system to place 100 
people in technical and customer service jobs; and Bank One said it 
was investing $1 million in the new Appalachian Ohio Development 
Fund, which will provide financing and technical assistance to 
small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Clinton's pitch is a '90s answer to the persistent  
challenge of poverty. In the 1960s, they said, government offered 
handouts, while in the 1980s the rich got richer and the less 
well-off were expected to reap some of the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to encourage corporations to invest in these ``new  
markets'' with an eye on their bottom lines, just as they do in 
developing countries abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of money to be made out there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone is impressed.  
</P>
<P>
	Liberal Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who two years ago traveled  
in many of the same areas Clinton will visit, thinks the poverty 
tour comes too late in the president's administration to make any 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Clinton administration has abandoned many of the  
most important economic justice concerns,'' Wellstone said. ``I'd 
say it's a little late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are pushing their own anti-poverty program that  
emphasizes tax breaks and other economic incentives, and House 
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., sent a letter to Clinton on Sunday 
seeking his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office, said  
the administration was reviewing the GOP plan. She said the 
president's initiative ``features serious involvement with the 
private sector. If, in fact, the speaker is moving in this 
direction we applaud his effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some trips find Clinton surrounded by well-heeled men and women  
in business attire, sitting down to a $10,000 fund-raising lunch. 
This week he will rub elbows with folks who earn don't earn that 
much in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll visit places with boarded-up stores and unpaved roads,  
whose residents live in crowded shacks without plumbing, where 
health care is hard to find and unemployment runs many times the 
national average of 4.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the itinerary, Hazard, Ky.; the Mississippi Delta; East St.  
Louis, Ill.; South Phoenix, Ariz.; the Pine Ridge Indian 
Reservation in South Dakota, and Los Angeles. The final event is an 
Anaheim, Calif., conference focusing on getting at-risk youths into 
the workforce.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Raps Southern Africa on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- A U.S. deputy secretary of commerce  
on Monday chided southern African countries for balking at economic 
cooperation. His remarks drew a rebuke from South Africa's trade 
minister, who called for more debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. official, Robert Mallett, told an economic conference  
that members of the Southern African Development Community should 
integrate their economic and trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The global economy is here. And unlike Europe you don't have  
40 years to get your act together,'' Mallett said at an economic 
conference sponsored by the Swiss-based World Economic Forum, a 
non-governmental group that fosters business cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallett said that unless there is a ``clear cohesion between  
private and public sectors'' to overcome the gridlock on economic 
integration, investors will perceive Africa as ``just not ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's trade and industry minister, Alec Irwin,  
responded that Mallett's ``bravado doesn't help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that the region's countries were grappling with  
emergence from colonial rule and that liberalizing trade rules 
would take time. He also said that many governments were burdened 
with heavy debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
	This, he said, could be overcome by a comprehensive debt relief  
program from the Group of Seven richest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the G7 to be cautious on debt (relief) is criminal,''  
Irwin added. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 nations in the southern African grouping have for years  
tried to reduce tariff barriers, ease customs red tape, improve 
transportation and promote foreign investment, with little success. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem is that South Africa, which has concluded its own  
trade pact with the European Union, has an economy that is 10 times 
that of the other 13 members combined. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 800 political and business leaders are attending the  
conference, which aims to foster economic growth in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp. said  
it will launch a $350 million investment fund aimed at improving 
the telecommunications, utilities and transportation in southern 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	OPIC President George Munoz said he hoped the fund would attract  
a further $650 million from investors in the region.

<HEADLINE> Julia Roberts Playing Activist Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Seven years ago, Erin Brockovich was an  
unemployed, struggling single mom. Now her life is about to be 
depicted by Julia Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	In her next movie, the star will portray Ms. Brockovich, a  
research assistant who in 1992 began helping attorney Ed Masry win 
a $333 million settlement against Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Masry and Ms. Brockovich represented 650 people who blamed PG&AMP;E  
for a contaminated water supply that they say caused cancer and 
other illnesses in their small desert community of Hinkley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is ``a story of a twice-divorced woman, three kids, no  
child support, who comes to my office as a secretary,'' Masry said. 
``She rises up to the occasion and helps put together this massive 
toxic case and at the end gets a few million dollars in bonus, and 
is very successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, titled ``Erin Brockovich,'' begins filming on Tuesday  
with ``Sex, Lies and Videotape'' director Steven Soderbergh. Masry 
will be portrayed by Albert Finney.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Suspect's Church Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- It styles itself as a religion, but the  
World Church of the Creator -- to which alleged racist killer 
Benjamin Nathaniel Smith once belonged -- has no altar and no place 
of worship. 
</P>
<P>
	Its leader is a skinny 27-year-old who reaches dues-paying  
members mainly through an Internet site dripping with racism and 
maintained from a swastika-adorned room in his parents' East Peoria 
home. An Israeli flag serves as his doormat. 
</P>
<P>
	All that's needed to join the church is $35. For that, members  
get a 25-page manual offering loyalty oaths and a glossary of terms 
like ``Rahowa'' -- an acronym that stands for ``Racial Holy War'' 
and is used as a greeting by members. 
</P>
<P>
	Followers also can read an Internet newsletter in which Smith,  
21, was profiled last November as ``Creator of the Month'' for his 
efforts to distribute racist literature. 
</P>
<P>
	To its critics, the church amounts to a loosely connected -- but  
dangerous -- group of racists and hate-mongers. Mark Potok, a 
researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Monday that 
the church is thought to have 46 chapters and several hundred 
active members. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a religion for and created by sociopaths,'' Potok  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatewatch.org, which monitors hate sites on the Internet, says  
the church has the fastest-growing Internet presence among racist 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The group dates back to 1973, when it was formed by Ben Klassen,  
a Florida real estate man from Ukraine who became wealthy after 
inventing an electric can opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Klassen wrote tracts of explosive racism, urging whites to push  
blacks, Jews and other ``mud races'' off the face of the planet. 
After one group member was convicted of beating a black sailor to 
death in a Florida parking lot, Klassen committed suicide, 
swallowing four bottles of sleeping pills in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The church seemed to disappear until the appearance of Matt  
Hale, who was made ``Pontifex Maximus'' -- an ancient Roman title 
meaning Supreme Leader -- in 1995 on a Montana ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hate-group monitors say they believe the church has grown under  
Hale's recruiting efforts from East Peoria and with his use of the 
Internet. Since Smith's death, the Web site has been shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Hale, Smith joined in 1998, but allowed his  
one-year membership to lapse in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Potok and others believe the World Church of the Creator is  
responsible for encouraging violence like the two-state shooting 
spree that left two dead and at least eight wounded, and ended in 
Smith's suicide late Sunday in Salem, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	While the church's Web site included a note saying it does not  
condone violence, it also called for a racial holy war and 
extermination of non-whites. Members have been convicted of murder, 
beatings and conspiracies to bomb NAACP offices and black churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hale and his group are not building bombs, but they are  
building bombers, creating shooters,'' Potok said. ``Hale is saying 
he's not responsible, but Hale is a hypocrite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hale said he urges church members to stay within the law.  
Blaming the shootings on his group, he said, is akin to blaming the 
pope for abortion clinic bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, an Illinois state hearing board rejected Hale's  
appeal for a law license. The board said Hale's beliefs and 
character make him ill-suited to practice law, and unable to follow 
the state's rules of conduct for lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had testified for Hale before that board in April.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our number one goal is to straighten out the white man's  
thinking,'' he told the panel. ``We're the new minority being 
crushed left and right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith admitted he had ``considered violent acts to achieve  
racial goals, but Hale counseled me to act peacefully.''

<HEADLINE> Man Tries To Make Cyberspace Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHAWNEE, Kan. (AP) -- Attention Mary Tyler Moore! Rob Moritz is  
holding onto your name. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, actually your Web name. The 47-year-old Moritz is a kind  
of Internet Good Samaritan, spending his own time and cash to 
register famous names online. He then hands them over to the 
celebrity, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do unto others what you would like to have done unto you,''  
says Moritz, a former youth minister who travels abroad to speak to 
religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Moritz began buying up the names out of his duplex in suburban  
Kansas City after he first logged onto the Internet several years 
ago. Much of what Moritz saw was the misuse of celebrity names -- 
and much of that was pornographic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anywhere in the world, someone could type in demimoore.com and  
you'd come up on a site that had links to several things, one of 
them hardcore pornography,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moritz decided to take the information highway's high road by  
giving away stars' names. His mission: protect cultural icons from 
Web exploitation, which he says makes the Web safer for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	He has steadily built a stable of monikers with .com at the end  
-- Billy Crystal, Faye Dunaway, Nick Nolte, to name a few. He even 
collected political A-listers like Richard Gephardt, Oliver North 
and Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
	The names fit in Internet addresses after the www and end after  
a period, referred to as ``dot.'' Perhaps the best known is .com, 
but .net and .org are also common. 
</P>
<P>
	Such addresses are some of the most potentially lucrative pieces  
of online real estate, an easy-to-remember location for fans to 
connect with celebrities and their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Moritz and his Friend to Friend Foundation have registered at  
least 300 celebrity names, of which about 40 have accepted the 
gesture. Moritz pays $70 for each name to Network Solutions Inc., 
an Internet domain name clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The process is often called cybersquatting or, say critics of  
the registering practice, ``virtual hostage-taking.'' Unlike 
Moritz, some people buy celebrity domains and post their own 
content -- often pornographic -- and lure traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Most squatters simply register the domain name and put it up for  
bid. Monica Lewinsky's recently went on the block with a minimum 
starting price of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty serious exploitation,'' Moritz says. ``It  
doesn't seem right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the celebrities who have accepted their addresses from  
Moritz have sent him thank-yous. ``Dharma and Greg'' star Jenna 
Elfman sent $150, Moritz said. Paul Anka sent an autographed CD, 
while Peter Falk mailed an original sketch of his ``Columbo'' 
character. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a wonderful thing you have done,'' Jeff Bridges wrote in  
a posting. ``I appreciate it so much, as I'm sure other people 
you've done this for do too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The celebrities learn of Moritz either through word of mouth, or  
Moritz's efforts to contact their agents. Stars such as Jason 
Alexander, Jane Pauley and Mia Farrow have yet to pick up their Web 
names. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the celebrity agrees to the transfer, Moritz mails the  
paperwork to the star, who must then pay $70 to re-register the 
site under their own name. 
</P>
<P>
	Online users who punch in the name of a celeb who hasn't picked  
up their domain from Moritz -- marytylermoore.com, for instance -- 
would be automatically steered to his site, friendtofriend.com, 
which mostly features links to other electronic commerce sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Any funds generated through celebrity donations or the links at  
his Web site pay for Moritz's office and home expenses. He said he 
``hasn't even come close'' to recouping his initial investment, and 
won't say how much he has paid out for the addresses, though simple 
math suggests at least $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Moritz denies using the unclaimed celebrity names to draw  
traffic to his own site. He noted that friendtofriend.com includes 
a ``Great Causes'' link, which can connect surfers with agencies 
like the American Red Cross and Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet experts say Moritz's giveaways are a refreshing rarity  
in the sometimes cutthroat online realm. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a person who is farsighted enough to know that those  
names will be used,'' said Carol Baroudi, author of ``Internet for 
Dummies.'' ``They're fortunate someone else didn't get to it 
first.''

	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- The Calgary Flames have signed  
unrestricted free agent defenseman Steve Smith to a two-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 36, came out of retirement a year ago and helped solidify  
the Flames' young defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms were not disclosed, but Smith is believed to

</P>
<P>
	In 69 games last season, Smith had one goal and 15 points, with  
a plus-three rating.

<HEADLINE> Watercrafts Bring Fun, Danger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ON LAKE LANIER, Ga. (AP) -- After being injured several times on  
dirt bikes, Rick Dennis decided to switch to something he thought 
was safer but just as exciting -- a water jet-powered personal 
watercraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the physical challenge,'' said Dennis, coasting to a  
stop after skimming the lake at 40 mph on his Yamaha Wave Runner 2. 
</P>
<P>
	But these increasingly popular small craft -- which include  
Kawasaki's Jet Ski brand -- may not be as safe as Dennis thought 
they were. Although they make up less than 10 percent of all 
registered boats, PWCs account for 36 percent of vessels involved 
in accidents, according to Coast Guard statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4,070 accidents in 1997 included 1,812 injuries and 84  
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last week, there had been 36 boating accidents this year  
on Lake Lanier, the nation's busiest man-made lake, with 19 
involving PWCs. Fifteen people were hurt in the PWC crashes on the 
lake 45 miles north of Atlanta, including a woman whose jaw was 
broken last month when her 14-year-old son lost control and ran 
over her in knee-deep water. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get into a boating accident with a conventional boat,  
you have a measure of protection,'' said Mark Williams, the chief 
park ranger for the Corps of Engineers at Lake Lanier. ``By the 
nature of the way PWCs are operated, with quick turns and high 
speeds, and the fact you have no real protection,'' he said, 
there's a greater potential for injury. 
</P>
<P>
	PWCs can hit speeds as high as 60 mph, and they can rapidly spin  
360 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	And since their direction is controlled by their water jets  
rather than by rudders, PWCs can't be steered unless they have 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something we see all the time is someone heading right for a  
dock or someone else and kill the throttle, but then they can't 
steer out of the way and crash,'' said state Department of Natural 
Resources ranger Stephen Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	And they're easily accessible.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can go out and buy one of these things for under $10,000,  
and that puts a lot of unqualified people out there,'' said Dale 
Clayton, a DNR ranger stationed on Lake Lanier. 
</P>
<P>
	The average cost is less than $7,000 and rentals also are widely  
available even to first-timers. 
</P>
<P>
	Any new PWC comes with a safety training video, and operators in  
most states are required to wear a life jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia recently strengthened its boating laws to require PWCs  
to stay 100 feet from other boats. However, they can still jump 
other boats' wakes, one of the most popular maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our approach is that these are boats, and as with any other  
kind of boat, it requires a sense of responsibility on everybody's 
part,'' said Larry Lambrose, executive director of the Personal 
Watercraft Industry Association, which reports 1997 sales of $1.1 
billion. ``We are talking about giving access to boating to a whole 
other population out there, and usually, these accidents occur 
within the first hour of operation, when people don't know how to 
operate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a lifelong fisherman, Bill White knows all too well what  
happens when newcomers get on their PWCs, saying he's had lines cut 
and tangled and nearly been tipped over by people buzzing him. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why he's taking it extra careful on his new PWC.  
</P>
<P>
	``I used to hate them, but then I made the mistake of trying my  
brother-in-law's out,'' White said, astride his gold Bombardier 
Sea-Doo. ``Then I got hooked. But I made sure to learn all about 
them, and anyone who gets on this thing is going through a 
checklist. I'm not going to be part of any statistics.''

<HEADLINE> Aretha Franklin To Open Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Aretha Franklin isn't usually an opening act, but  
this is no ordinary concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Queen of Soul has agreed to sing the national anthem to kick  
off the Three Tenors concert at Detroit's Tiger Stadium on July 17. 
She may even join Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Carreras and Placido 
Domingo for an encore. 
</P>
<P>
	``What could be better in Detroit than having Aretha Franklin  
sing the national anthem?'' said Frank Stella, a friend of 
Pavarotti's and a board member of the Michigan Opera Theatre.

<HEADLINE>  A Closing Act at Wimbledon for Graf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Steffi Graf has said farewell to  
Wimbledon and the French Open. All that remains is her final 
goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no wave, no acknowledgment to the 14,000 fans after  
her 6-4, 7-5 loss to Lindsay Davenport in Sunday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	She said afterward this was her final match at the All England  
Club, but her conduct on Centre Court gave nothing away. Graf did 
not want a public display to detract from Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it was her day and I wanted to keep it that way and not  
take anything away from her,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she won't be back, but said little else about her  
future as she spoke in a soft, measured voice. Playing the U.S. 
Open is in doubt, she said, although she plans to play ``several 
more tournaments,'' with word on her future coming in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not comment on anything other than that. I have not had  
enough time to think about those things,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	When and where her final tournament will come -- or if Graf  
remains true to her word -- is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
	Her compatriot Boris Becker said the same thing about Wimbledon  
two years ago, only to return this year and lose in the fourth 
round. This time he promised he'd played his last Wimbledon -- 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Becker said 99.9 percent and he was back two years later,''  
said NBC commentator John McEnroe, adding this ``is by no means a 
definite guarantee as far as I'm concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was Graf's first loss in a Wimbledon final since 1987 -- the  
first time she reached the championship match. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old German has won seven Wimbledon singles titles,  
two short of Martina Navratilova's record of nine. Her 22 Grand 
Slam tournament singles titles are also two shy of Margaret's 
Court's record 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lot of fun but, I guess, yes, there's going to be  
a certain time when I've got to move on with something else in my 
life,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm a little sad about everything, which is normal  
for the moment,'' she said. ``But I still think that I feel ... a 
winner getting out of this tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, Graf won the French Open, then announced it was her  
last appearance at Roland Garros. At Wimbledon, she made her mind 
up before the two-week grass-court event to make this her last. A 
victory would not have changed things. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a decision and, you know, I've been pretty sure about it  
for a long time,'' she said. ``It's not something I just thought 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WTA Tour guide devotes one page to most players, two to  
stars like Monica Seles. Graf gets three. The WTA Tour also put out 
a two-page synopsis of her major injuries and illnesses and listed 
21 -- almost equaling her Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the turned professional in 1982, she's had right foot  
surgery twice, with other operations on her right hand, left knee, 
left foot and sinuses. She's also had a herniated disc and broken 
her right toe and right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a lot of injuries in the last several years, and that  
has something to do with all of this,'' said Graf, who played the 
final with her left thigh wrapped and pulled out of mixed doubles 
with McEnroe because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first Grand Slam tournament title was the French Open in  
1987. In '88 she won the Grand Slam -- Wimbledon and the Australian, 
French and U.S. Opens -- and the next year again reached all four 
finals, losing only in the French. Three other times she won three 
of the four major tournaments ('93, '95, '96). 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries have hurt. So have personal problems.  
</P>
<P>
	Her father, Peter, was released from prison in April 1998 after  
serving 15 months for tax evasion handling his daughter's tennis 
winnings, which are $21 million going into this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf pointed to her '92 victory over Monica Seles and her '91  
win over Gabriela Sabatini as her two most memorable Wimbledon 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through a lot of struggles during a certain period,''  
Graf said, alluding to problems surrounding her father. ``The one 
match that I played against Gaby for me was personally a big one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While her father was serving prison time, Graf underwent left  
knee surgery in June 1997, keeping her out of Wimbledon and the 
next three major tournaments. She returned last year, but was 
knocked out in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the last few weeks have been pretty amazing,'' she  
said. ``Who would have thought I would be doing so well? It's 
obvious that I'm disappointed about losing the final, but I do have 
to say ... it been tough getting there, but it's also been ... 
great here.''

<HEADLINE> Hershiser Back on One Day of Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At age 40, Orel Hershiser will have a first  
Tuesday: starting with just one day of rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets reshuffled their pitching rotation following  
Monday's 2-1 win over Montreal, and Hershiser (8-5) will start 
against Carl Pavano (6-6) instead of rookie of Octavio Dotel (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Hershiser allowed four homers for the second time in  
484 career appearances, giving up six runs and six hits in 2 2-3 
innings during a 7-6 win over Atlanta. He made 52 pitches, and 
Tuesday would have been his regular day to throw. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets manager Bobby Valentine said giving Masato Yoshii and his  
ailing knee an extra day between starts was the reason for the 
reshuffle, but it's logical to assume he didn't want Dotel pitching 
against the New York Yankees on Sunday in the final game before the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever Bobby says is what happened,'' Hershiser said, trying  
to diffuse any possible controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	While he's never started twice in three days, Hershiser came  
back on three days' rest against the Mets in Game 3 of the 1988 NL 
championship series after starting the opener, then saved Game 4 
for the Los Angeles Dodgers the following night. 
</P>
<P>
	He then came back on just two days' rest, pitching a five-hit  
shutout to beat the Mets 6-0 in Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thank God I have an arm that can bounce back and shut  
out the Mets with two days rest,'' Hershiser said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine approached him about another quick turnaround before  
Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was, `This is a possibility. Can you do it?' '' he recalled  
the manager saying. Hershiser's response was: ``Whatever you 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser seemed to take it in stride. Starters, he said, long  
to be everyday players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting because you get to do something you never do,''  
he said, ``unless you get bombed as a starter and get right back 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the change, Dotel will pitch Wednesday against Dan Smith  
(1-1) and Yoshii (6-7) will close out the series against the Expos 
on Thursday instead of Al Leiter (7-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter, who beat the Yankees on June 6 to end the Mets'  
eight-game losing streak and start them on a 20-8 stretch, will 
open the Subway Series on Friday, followed by Rick Reed (6-3) and 
Hershiser.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Sues U.S. for $181 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba took the United States to court on Monday,  
seeking damages it says Cubans have suffered in a U.S.-backed dirty 
war stretching over four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings opened Monday morning at the Palace of the  
Revolution -- the seat of Cuba's communist government -- rather than 
in a regular courtroom, demonstrating the political importance that 
President Fidel Castro is placing on the legal process. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings will show ``the sick hostility signified by U.S.  
policy toward Cuba,'' the Communist Party workers' daily 
Trabajadores predicted Monday in a front-page story. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Cuban government is using the hearings to make a  
political point, it appeared unlikely the lawsuit would result in 
any damages being paid. There are no American funds in Cuba that 
can be frozen and seized. 
</P>
<P>
	No U.S. representative attended the court proceedings. And the  
U.S. government did not respond to the claim within 20 working days 
as required by Cuban law, said Juan Mendoza, one of Cuba's 
attorneys in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal team hopes to show how U.S. policies have damaged  
Cuban society over the past 40 years, Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people are expected to testify before the hearings  
finish July 22. Huge piles of written evidence also are expected to 
be presented. 
</P>
<P>
	The first witness before the five-member tribunal was Anibal  
Velaz Suarez, the retired former head of State Security for central 
Cuba during the early 1960s. He testified about ``the barbaric 
bloody acts that the CIA committed with the bandits'' in the years 
after Castro's 1959 rise to power, including killings of members of 
the new revolutionary government. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in late May in Havana, asks for $181 billion  
in compensatory and punitive damages for the deaths of 3,478 Cubans 
and permanent physical damage to 2,099 more people in a variety of 
acts ranging from the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 to the bombing 
of Havana hotels in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs include the National Association of Small  
Farmers, the Federation of Cuban Women, the Communist Workers of 
Cuba and the Federation of University Students -- all mass 
organizations associated with Cuba's communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba's lawsuit appears to be Havana's answer to another lawsuit  
in the United States. In that case, a federal judge in Miami has 
ordered Cuba to pay $187 million to the families of three Americans 
killed in 1996 when Cuban military jets shot down two small private 
planes off the island's coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men, members of the Miami Cuban exile group Brothers  
to the Rescue, were among four shot from the sky by Cuban MiGs 
while on a mission searching for Cuban rafters. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the exile group have said the pilots were always in  
international territory, but the Cuban government has insisted that 
they invaded Cuban airspace. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban authorities remain infuriated by the American lawsuit, as  
well as attempts to seize Cuban funds from telephone companies 
operating long distance phone service between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba would need strong international backing in any attempt to  
force U.S. payment, perhaps from an international court. 
</P>
<P>
	New York attorney William H. Schaap, attending the hearings as a  
legal observer for the Center for Constitutional Rights and the 
National Lawyers Guild, said the case raises significant issues -- 
comparable to issues he said are raised by U.S. military attacks in 
Yugoslavia and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a legitimate complaint under international  
law,'' he said. ``But the sad thing is that international law is no 
longer respected.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Plans New Budget To Help Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will  
submit a supplementary budget to Japan's parliament this week 
designed to combat growing unemployment, a government spokesman 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 520 billion yen ($4.2 billion) budget aims at creating more  
than 700,000 jobs for Japan's growing wave of unemployed and foster 
corporate competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is expected to approve the plan at a regular  
cabinet meeting Thursday and submit it to Parliament for approval 
the same day, Nonaka said. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in May from a  
record-high 4.8 percent in March and April. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties have raised no objections to the budget,  
which covers the year ending March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently Japan was mired in its longest postwar recession.  
However, last month the government announced that the economy grew 
at an annual rate of 7.9 percent in the first quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	About half of that growth came from generous government spending  
packages introduced last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, politicians and business leaders worry that further  
supplementary budgets will be needed to keep the economy from 
slipping back into recession next year.

<HEADLINE> CDC Diverts Chronic Fatigue Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Congress, responding to thousands of citizen  
appeals, set aside $22.7 million to study chronic fatigue syndrome. 
Federal researchers assured lawmakers they would investigate the 
mysterious disease, then used millions to study other illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	At least $8.8 million, 39 percent of the funds earmarked for  
CFS, was spent on other research, including measles and polio. 
Government auditors say they cannot determine what happened to an 
additional $4.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists say some officials at the Centers for Disease Control  
and Prevention don't believe CFS is a real disease, never intended 
to study it and merely paid lip service to the malady in testimony 
to lawmakers pressing for action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been amazing with the CDC how much some of the scientists  
are concerned more about politics than science. They want to 
protect their careers. That's why they put forth the token 
effort,'' asserts Kim Kenney, executive director of the Chronic 
Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients diagnosed with CFS say they become so tired they can't  
perform even the simplest tasks. One sufferer, Michelle Akers, a 
star on the U.S. women's soccer team for more than a decade and now 
playing in the World Cup, is sometimes unable to work out with the 
team and often plays only half a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The symptoms of CFS -- muscle and joint pain, headaches and  
memory loss -- are difficult to measure, and attempts to pinpoint 
its cause have failed. Much like Gulf War Syndrome, CFS is not 
completely understood by the health community, and it's usually 
diagnosed by ruling out other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are sometimes reluctant to accept diseases  
characterized by such elusive symptoms, acknowledges Dr. Peter 
Rowe, director of the Chronic Fatigue Clinic at the Johns Hopkins 
Children's Center in Baltimore. ``Lupus is an example. It wasn't 
until better blood testing that recognition improved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC's alleged misappropriation of funds came to light last  
year when a researcher in the department assigned to CFS blew the 
whistle. An audit released May 10 by the inspector general for the 
Department of Health and Human Services confirmed his allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``CDC officials provided inaccurate and potentially misleading  
information to Congress concerning the scope and cost of CFS 
research activities,'' the audit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the CDC was not legally prohibited from using CFS funds  
elsewhere, agencies tend to follow Congress' recommendations to 
avoid offending the lawmakers who control their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	That may be where part of the problem lies, some say.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most politicians aren't very smart researchers, and most  
researchers aren't very smart politicians, so you've got a real 
dilemma,'' says Dr. John Renner, president of the National Council 
for Reliable Health Information. ``Spending money wisely is what's 
got to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his complaint to Congress, Dr. William Reeves, a branch chief  
in the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases, accused Dr. 
Claire Broome, then-acting CDC director, of providing false 
information to Congress when she testified that part of the 1996 
CFS research money was spent on a new laboratory in Reeves' 
department. No such laboratory was built. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves also said the division director, Dr. Brian Mahy,  
transferred funds from the CFS program to research areas he deemed 
more important. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahy has refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the subcommittee that  
handles the CDC budget, says the problem is not that chronic 
fatigue money was used for other research, but that CDC officials 
lied about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no problem if they had come back to us and said look,  
they don't think there is any good research we can follow here, 
this is not good use of the money,'' Porter says. 
</P>
<P>
	Renner, however, notes that researchers are under pressure to  
appease lawmakers. If a CDC official told Congress that CFS was not 
worthy of research, he says, ``they probably would have shot the 
guy the next day at sunrise out in front of the Capitol building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Porter acknowledges the political pressure on researchers but  
says it is sometimes justified. 
</P>
<P>
	``CDC is a publicly funded institution of the government and it  
has to respond to some degree to the concerns of the people of this 
country, and those people are represented in Congress,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the audit, CDC director Jeffrey Koplan says the  
agency will share a CFS spending plan with Congress and nonprofit 
groups and add training for budget managers and staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC denies the funding diversions arose from a lack of  
interest in chronic fatigue syndrome, says spokeswoman Barbara 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot more a question of the accounting of the ways the  
funds were spent as opposed to diverting the funds,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reeves, the whistle blower, scoffs at the idea the problem  
lay with poor accounting. For more than a year, he says, he 
internally reported the diversion of funds and was ``basically told 
to shut up.''

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Youths Favor WWII Era Jeeps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KALAW, Myanmar (AP) -- Checking the oil on the Jeep he's driven  
as a rural taxi for 30 years, Khin Maung Than explains why he turns 
away city slickers who keep showing up offering big money for it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what these Jeeps are worth -- they're priceless,'' he  
says, lighting a cheroot. ``They're very hardy and easy to fix. 
Nothing is better for the roads around here. In the city, Jeeps are 
just a new fad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Myanmar, also known as Burma, is experiencing Jeep mania.  
</P>
<P>
	Car-crazy young people are rediscovering the World War II  
workhorses that still ply potholed backwaters like Kalaw. They're 
customizing the old U.S. Army road warriors into the flashiest 
rides this long-isolated country has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The love affair is rooted in Myanmar's role as a battleground,  
impoverishment that followed a military coup in 1962, and an uneven 
surge in wealth this decade after younger generals ditched 
socialism for a more open economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Every morning, Khin Maung Than pulls his Jeep into the taxi  
stand in Kalaw, a hill station where British colonists escaped hot 
summers, and packs in a dozen passengers heading to market 25 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	This past year, he's been approached by brokers offering up to  
300,000 kyats, or about $850. He always refuses, though it's a lot 
of cash in Myanmar and 10 times what he paid for the Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
	His Jeep is in original condition. But it wouldn't stay that way  
long if someone like Maung Thura got his hands on it. 
</P>
<P>
	In his sarong and baseball cap, Maung Thura looks like any  
ordinary 27-year-old bachelor in Yangon, the capital 250 miles 
southeast of Kalaw. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has money by virtue of his aunt, who owns the biggest  
lottery shop. And the loosened economy means that for the first 
time, the affluent young like him have lots of imported cars and 
parts to spend it on. 
</P>
<P>
	Maung Thura spent $1,100 on an old Jeep in original condition  
down to the three-speed transmission. It's now worth five times 
that, and only the body and frame remain. 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped in a Toyota turbo-diesel engine with a five-speed  
gearbox and power steering. The body is tarted up with metallic 
blue paint, flared fenders, chrome roll bar and alloy wheels. 
There's a chrome crash bar and fog lights -- though Yangon never 
gets fog. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could never have done this five years ago,'' Maung Thura  
says. ``There were no engines, no spare parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he has one of the coolest cars in town. Dozens more  
made-over Jeeps are also turning heads, as are another new youth 
favorite, customized Volkswagen Beetles. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to make sure no one hanging out in the tea shops misses him  
coming, Maung Thura cranks rap music out of huge speakers tucked 
under velour bucket seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Girls are always asking for rides,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Due to historical accident and necessity, Myanmar probably has  
more Jeeps, in both wartime and early civilian versions, running on 
original parts than anywhere 
</P>
<P>
	The first Jeeps arrived when Myanmar was a battleground of the  
China-Burma-India theater. The spunky four-wheel-drives earned an 
unmatched reputation for ruggedness in the mountains and rice 
paddies. 
</P>
<P>
	Civilians snapped them up after the war. Many became taxis on  
the northern roads between Mandalay and the Chinese border, 
stomping ground of hill tribes, smugglers and opium lords. 
</P>
<P>
	After 1962, the military government cut Myanmar off from the  
world. Cars became scarce when mechanics couldn't keep old clunkers 
going. Even six years ago, Yangon's streets seemed virtually empty 
of cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Upcountry, the tough Jeeps survived. They were the only vehicles  
that could handle the increasingly crumbling roads, and new parts 
could be turned out on simple lathes if originals wore out. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowadays, Yangon suffers worsening traffic jams from fleets of  
recently imported Toyotas and Nissans. Newer pickups outnumber 
Jeeps as taxis in the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jeeps remain prized.  
</P>
<P>
	In Pyin Oo Lwin, a hill station once known as Maymyo, car broker  
Tun Lin, 26, owns the Jeep everyone envies. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the opposite path from Maung Thura and equipped his 1942  
model in full GI regalia. Painted olive drab, the Jeep has a spade 
and ax mounted on the fender and jerry can of gasoline and spare 
tire on the back. A metal carbine case hangs on the dash. Only the 
M-1 is missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Are Jeeps the best American technology he's ever seen? The reply  
says a lot about Myanmar this past half-century: 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only American product we know.''

<HEADLINE> France's Total Fina Wants Rival Elf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- In the latest wave of oil merger activity, France's  
largest oil company Total Fina SA launched a $43 billion hostile 
takeover bid Monday for rival Elf Aquitaine SA in a move that, if 
successful, would create the world's fourth leading oil company in 
terms of market share. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid was a further sign of the new aggressive mood in French  
business, but wasn't welcomed by Elf, whose board said the offer 
had ``not been the subject of any study or discussions.'' It 
claimed the deal, which it will study, was not in its shareholders' 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina is offering Elf shareholders four Total Fina shares  
for three Elf shares. The all-stock offer is conditional upon 
shareholders holding at least two-thirds of outstanding shares 
accepting the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company would be Europe's third largest oil group, after  
Royal Dutch Shell AG and BP Amoco PLC, and would likely enjoy 
strong growth in output and be better able to compete with its U.S. 
and European rivals, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For middle-sized oil companies such as Total and Elf, this is  
the only way to compete with the big industry players,'' said 
Hugues de la Presle, an analyst at Standard and Poor's in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this year, a hostile takeover bid by one French company  
for another was all but unheard of. But the Total Fina move follows 
the continuing hostile takeover fight by French bank Banque 
Nationale de Paris SA for rivals Societe Generale SA and Paribas 
SA. 
</P>
<P>
	``French business leaders are feeling a little more brave,'' De  
la Presle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina and Elf have been under pressure to increase in size  
amid rapid recent consolidation in the sector in the U.S. and 
Europe. Exxon Corp. plans to acquire Mobil Corp., creating the 
world's largest oil company, while BP Amoco plans to purchase 
Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Total Fina is a product of the industrywide consolidation,  
the result of Total SA's acquisition of Belgium's Petrofina SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf in particular has been considered too small to develop  
current exploration assets to their full potential, and for 
long-term expansion. Earlier this month, Elf lost a battle to buy 
Saga Petroleum, Norway's third largest oil company. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierre Terzian, editor of Petrostrategies, a Paris-based  
petroleum weekly, said that Elf's failure played a part in the 
timing of Monday's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group is a little demoralized and there have also been  
recent strikes by workers,'' he said. ``If Total had waited, the 
situation could have been very different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terzian said that, although a successful resolution looked  
``difficult,'' he believed it would reap rich rewards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two companies complement each other greatly. For example,  
Total is strong east of the Suez, and Elf is strong in West 
Africa,'' he said. ``Also, production is going to increase in 2001, 
or before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the combination would make the company the world's  
leading downstream presence in West Africa, expanding further Elf's 
vast portfolio there. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf, at the time the French state's largest concern, was  
privatized in 1994. The French government no longer has an equity 
stake, but retains a so-called golden share, allowing it to veto 
any takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
	It said late Monday, however, that since the merger would not  
threaten national oil supplies, it does not plan to block the bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not up to public powers to judge a deal between two  
private companies,'' French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer represents a 15 percent premium for Elf shareholders  
compared with Friday's closing price, and a premium of around 20 
percent of the average price over the last six months.

<HEADLINE> AL All-Star Starters Are Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra and four Cleveland Indians  
proved there are different ways to successfully campaign for an 
All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Red Sox went to the Internet to get Garciaparra  
elected as the American League's starting shortstop Monday. The 
Indians used the highest attendance in the majors to send nearly 
half their lineup to Fenway Park on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just that different cities do different things,'' said AL  
manager Joe Torre, whose World Series champion New York Yankees had 
no starters elected for the second straight year. ``I think they do 
more politicking and lobbying in other ballparks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians, who also have the best record in baseball, will  
start Jim Thome (1,364,692) at first base, Roberto Alomar 
(2,793,891) at second, and Kenny Lofton (1,676,595) and Manny 
Ramirez (1,898,430) in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	They also had four second-place finishers and David Justice was  
the fourth outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the biggest shakeup of the final week, Garciaparra  
overcame a 30,655-vote deficit to pass the Yankees' Derek Jeter and 
Cleveland's Omar Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably as shocked as you guys,'' Garciaparra said.  
``It's an honor. It's nice when it's at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer, said last  
Thursday none of the Internet votes had been counted until the last 
week. Fans were allowed to vote 22 times on the Internet -- the 
average number of home games for each team during the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra apparently benefited from Boston's aggressive  
campaigning on-line. Garciaparra finished with 1,089,974 votes, 
20,466 ahead of Jeter (1,069,528). Vizquel was third with 
1,038,362. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans are going to vote for who they want to see,'' Jeter  
said. ``I don't think you can go wrong with a number of shortstops 
in our league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Griffey Jr. is the leading All-Star vote-getter for the  
fourth straight year and seventh time overall. Elected to start for 
the 10th consecutive time in the outfield, he got 2,918,055 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fans want to see their favorite players and guys they think  
are deserving of going. So when they choose you, it's an honor,'' 
Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the AL starting lineup: Texas' Ivan Rodriguez  
(1,897,774) at catcher, Baltimore's Cal Ripken (1,285,728) at third 
base and Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco (1,664,282) at designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've come full circle,'' said Canseco, who made the team for  
the first time since 1992. ``I went from being the best baseball 
player in the world, hands down by far at one point, to more or 
less almost an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the nine starters also were picked by fans last year.  
Ramirez took the place of Texas' Juan Gonzalez, who said he won't 
play this year because he is not starting, and Garciaparra made it 
ahead of Seattle's Alex Rodriguez. There was no DH last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez will make his eighth straight All-Star appearance and  
Alomar was elected for the eighth time. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken will make his 17th consecutive All-Star appearance and  
16th straight start. Ripken, who led balloting in 1992 and '95, 
ties Rod Carew as the only players elected to start 15 times -- in 
1988 Alan Trammell was elected but got hurt and Ripken started in 
his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of uncertainty at the start of the year, with  
my father passing away and a major injury,'' Ripken said. ``I was 
able to heal up physically, and it looks like I was able to heal up 
mentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop was the most competitive position, with the three  
teams actively campaigning. Torre argued Jeter's case through the 
media, the Red Sox stumped for Garciaparra on the Internet and the 
Indians flashed nightly scoreboard messages at Jacobs Field urging 
fans to push Vizquel over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it was the modern technique, and Garciaparra's  
performance, that won out. Garciaparra is hitting .366, with 14 
homers and 57 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeter is second in the AL with a .372 average and has 14 homers  
and 58 RBIs. Vizquel is batting .336 average with two homers, 35 
RBIs and 17 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's to say who should start,'' Garciaparra said. ``When I  
look at Derek, looking at what he's doing this year, it's 
unbelievable. If you ask me, I believe he deserves to start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey gets $100,000 bonus for getting elected and having the  
most AL votes, and will get an additional $25,000 if he's the major 
league leader. Ripken also gets a $100,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, Garciaparra, Canseco, Lofton, Ramirez, Rodriguez and  
Thome each get $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	NL starters will be released today and reserves for both leagues  
will be announced Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Las Vegas Becoming Fugitive Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP)-- The bloody-minded misfits who butchered a Kansas  
family and inspired the book ``In Cold Blood'' ended their run from 
the law here, hoping to score some cash by passing bad checks in 
the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A disgraced New Jersey prosecutor who skipped out on his fraud  
sentencing headed this way, too, as did a Southern California 
couple wanted in the strangling of a teen-age drug snitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminals on the lam seem drawn to Las Vegas' neon-lined  
boulevards and tawdry motels, with their promise of anonymity and a 
fast buck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real easy to get lost here,'' says Al Cervantes, a Las  
Vegas police sergeant who heads a multiagency task force assigned 
to put the cuffs on fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
	Cervantes' Criminal Apprehension Team Squad, a 10-member unit  
composed of FBI agents and local police, arrested 835 fugitives 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the FBI doesn't break down the locations of the  
14,000-plus fugitive arrests its agents make each year, Las Vegas 
has more than its share, says agency spokesman Kevin Caudle. ``It 
certainly is a hot spot,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being the capital of legalized sin, this city has other  
attractions for a criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas, population 1.3 million, gets 500,000 tourists in the  
average week. More than 4,000 people move in each month. ``It's a 
pretty transient community,'' Cervantes notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``And gaming attracts the fugitive element,'' adds Sgt. Robert  
Duvall of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police fugitive section. ``Las 
Vegas has always been thought of as a place for an easy buck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was that way in December 1959 when Richard Hickock and Perry  
Smith rolled into town after a murder spree that claimed four 
members of the Herbert Clutter family in Holcomb, Kan. ``In Cold 
Blood'' author Truman Capote wrote that the pair saw the casinos as 
a prime spot to ``hang some paper'' -- pass bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Bissell, a high-profile New Jersey prosecutor with a  
secret life, headed for the bright lights when he fled sentencing 
on corruption, tax fraud and other charges in 1996. He ended up in 
Laughlin, Nev., a casino town 60 miles from here. With U.S. 
marshals closing in on his hotel room, he put a gun in his mouth 
and pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there was the night in March 1998 the fugitive squad caught  
up with Michael Martinez and Florence Noriega, wanted in Southern 
California in the slaying of a teen-ager who informed on a drug 
ring. The boy was tortured and strangled and his girlfriend raped, 
shot and left for dead in a drain pipe in a forest. 
</P>
<P>
	As six officers wearing body shields swarmed through the door of  
the second floor room, Martinez reached for a 9 mm handgun and 
Noriega tried to grab a sawed-off rifle. Surprise carried the day, 
Cervantes said, but ``it was pretty hairy.''

<HEADLINE> 1899 Predictions of America Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A century ago this summer, a boundlessly  
optimistic, militarily triumphant and relatively prosperous America 
began to face the rapidly approaching 20th century with totally 
fearless predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Americans envisioned the last century of the millennium as  
a century of peace and universal brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
	Others saw snares in the rapid advance of technology.  
</P>
<P>
	The most jingoistic saw the United States inflating until it  
held sway over both American continents, moving all the way south 
as well as all the way north. 
</P>
<P>
	In their enthusiasm, few heeded the cautionary words of British  
historian James Bryce, who warned in 1893 that ``the coasts of 
history are strewn with the wrecks of predictions ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the 20th century opened, the United States had 45 states and  
76 million citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following an extended economic depression, the nation's  
leaders boasted the first treasury surplus in six years, a new 
overseas empire and the opportunities for progress through 
technology,'' writes historian Richard A. Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fall of 1900, President McKinley, the commander in chief  
who had presided over the defeat of Spain, the liberation of Cuba 
from Spanish rule and the occupation of the Philippines, would be 
elected to a second term. New York Gov. Theodore Roosevelt, the 
self-promoting hero of San Juan Hill, would come to Washington as 
McKinley's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, who is the historian of the U.S. Senate, noted in a paper  
delivered before the American Political Science Association in 1997 
that the optimism was layered with the turmoil of swift 
industrialization, large-scale immigration, territorial expansion, 
social unrest and political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chauncey Depew, a New York Republican, said in 1899 that he  
feared the productive energies released by the power of invention, 
steam engines and electricity would create a massive surplus 
``which endangers the health, happiness and lives of the people of 
Europe and America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker noted that even Bryce, predictably abandoning his fear of  
prediction, warned that the first 30 years of the new century would 
produce increasingly scarce natural resources resulting in soil 
exhaustion, high food prices, depressed wages, social unrest and 
``pernicious experiments in legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But most commentary on the future tended to be hopeful.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times concluded that as the 19th century had seen  
``vast strides'' in scientific advancement and ``the application of 
the forces of nature to the service of man,'' the new century would 
witness a cooperative United States and Europe moving toward ``an 
ultimate harmony of interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Tribune editorialized on Jan. 1, 1901, that the 20th  
century would blossom into ``a century of humanity (bringing) a 
keener realization of the brotherhood of man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now at peace with the world, and it is my fervent  
prayer that if differences arise between us and other powers they 
may be settled by peaceful arbitration and that hereafter we may be 
spared the horrors of war,'' McKinley said in his inaugural 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	There seemed to be no suspicion that the new century would so  
vastly expand the concept of ``the horrors of war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The futurists indulged themselves at McKinley's inaugural,  
looking ahead a century to the inaugural of 2001, 
</P>
<P>
	They predicted a century of ``aeroplanes'' and even  
``aero-yachts'' two years before the Wright Brothers demonstrated 
the practicality of manned flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Their vision, applied with at least a pinch of humor, was  
spelled out in the official program for McKinley's inaugural on 
March 4, 1901. 
</P>
<P>
	It included a federal union of 118 states stretching over the  
entire land mass of North and South America. The new president 
would hail from the state of Ontario. His middle name would be 
McKinley. He would propose in his inaugural address that work begin 
at once to shift the direction of the Arctic current off Labrador 
``to allow the gulf Stream to change the climate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a little more than six months from that day of hope, the  
cutting edge of time drew blood. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley was assassinated. Theodore Roosevelt became president  
and the future changed, as it often has, in truly unpredictable 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
	Historian Bryce, who later became British ambassador to  
Washington, could have repeated himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we can ever say of the future is that it will be unlike  
the present.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> World Cup Final is a Sellout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Women's World Cup soccer final between  
the United States and China is sold out and more than 85,000 people 
are expected Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``With a sellout of the final, our biggest day is still yet to  
come,'' said Marla Messing, president of the organizing committee. 
``I think we can say that the tournament has been a smashing 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doubleheader in Pasadena also features the third-place game  
between Norway and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd expected Saturday would be a record for a women's  
sporting event, Messing said. The current record is 78,972 for a 
World Cup doubleheader at Giants Stadium on June 19. 
</P>
<P>
	For the tournament, an average of more than 35,000 have attended  
the matches, including more than 22,000 for games not involving the 
United States.

</P>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Antonino ``Tony'' Alessi Sr., founder of the  
nation's largest importer of Greek olives, died Friday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Alessi established the Alessi Vigo Importing Co. in 1947. He  
first operated it out of his garage but eventually it grew into a 
multimillion-dollar family business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, now run by his sons, Tony Jr. and Fred, also  
imports olive oil, Greek peppers, cheese and pasta.

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Xavier Gelin, a French actor and a mainstay of  
popular French cinema for more than three decades, died Friday of 
cancer. He was 53. 
</P>
<P>
	Gelin was the son of French film stars Daniel Gelin and Daniele  
Delorme. 
</P>
<P>
	He played supporting roles in more than 20 films, including  
Gerard Oury's 1973 comic hit ``The Adventures of Rabbi Jacob'' with 
Louis de Funes. 
</P>
<P>
	He also starred in Claude Lelouche's ``Adventure, It's  
Adventure'' and ``The Devil by the Tail'' by Philippe de Broca. 
</P>
<P>
	Other hits include Claude Pinoteau's ``The Slap'' and ``The  
Party-2'' and ``A Simple Story,'' directed by Claude Sautet.

<P>
                           *Mark Sandman    	
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Mark Sandman, the lead singer of the Boston rock  
band Morphine, died Saturday of a heart attack at a concert outside 
Rome. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandman collapsed on stage in front of several thousand  
spectators at a music festival just before midnight. He was not 
known to have a heart condition or any other major health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandman, known for his deep, murky baritone, played bass and  
wrote all of Morphine's songs. Morphine is a guitar-less trio that 
includes Dana Colley on saxophone and Billy Conway on drums. 
</P>
<P>
	The group started out playing loft parties and bars around  
Boston and Cambridge, Mass., in the early 1990s and built a solid 
cult following. Morphine released five albums: ``Good,'' ``Cure for 
Pain,'' ``Yes,'' ``Like Swimming'' and ``B-Side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morphine has gotten heavy airplay on college radio, and its  
songs have appeared on soundtracks for the films ``Get Shorty,'' 
``Beautiful Girls'' and ``Postcards From America,'' as well as on 
the TV series ``Homicide: Life on the Street.''

<HEADLINE> Hershiser Back on One Day of Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eleven years later, Orel Hershiser has a chance  
to show whether he's still the ``Bulldog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser, who made five starts and one relief appearance during  
a 16-day span in the 1988 postseason, will have a career first 
tonight: starting with just one day of rest. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's doing it at age 40, on a night when it's expected to be  
close to 100 degrees with high humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting because you get to do something you never do,''  
he said, ``unless you get bombed as a starter and get right back 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Hershiser allowed four homers for the second time in  
484 career appearances, giving up six runs and six hits in 2 2-3 
innings during the New York Mets' 7-6 win over Atlanta. He made 52 
pitches, and today would have been his regular day to throw. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Mets manager Bobby Valentine reshuffled his pitching  
rotation following Monday's 2-1 win over Montreal and Hershiser 
(8-5) will start tonight in place of rookie Octavio Dotel (1-1) 
against Carl Pavano (6-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said giving Masato Yoshii and his ailing knee an extra  
day between starts was the reason for the change, but it's logical 
to assume Valentine didn't want Dotel pitching against the New York 
Yankees on Sunday in the final game before the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever Bobby says is what happened,'' Hershiser said, trying  
to diffuse any possible controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	While he's never started twice in three days, Hershiser started  
three times on three days' rest and once on two days' rest during 
the 1988 postseason, and even made a relief appearance the day 
after a start. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NL championship series against the Mets, he failed to get  
a decision in Game 1 on Oct. 4 or Game 3 on Oct. 8, but then 
relieved in Game 4 on Oct. 9 before tossing a five-hit shutout that 
led the Los Angeles Dodgers to victory in Game 7 on Oct. 12. And 
during Game 5, he warmed up in the bullpen without getting in. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on Oct. 16, he pitched a three-hit shutout against Oakland  
in Game 2 of the World Series. He closed out the Dodgers' last 
World Series title with a four-hit 5-2 win in Game 5 on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thank God I have an arm that can bounce back and shut  
out the Mets with two days rest,'' Hershiser said after he was 
voted Most Valuable Player of both the playoffs and the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser was nicknamed ``Bulldog'' by Dodgers manager Tommy  
Lasorda for his determination. He ended the regular season with a 
record 59 consecutive scoreless innings, and including the 
postseason allowed five earned runs in his final 101 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine approached him about another quick turnaround before  
Monday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was, `This is a possibility. Can you do it?' '' he recalled  
the manager saying. Hershiser's response was: ``Whatever you 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the change, Dotel will pitch Wednesday against Dan Smith  
(1-1) and Yoshii (6-7) will close out the series against the Expos 
on Thursday instead of Al Leiter (7-6). 
</P>
<P>
	Leiter, who beat the Yankees on June 6 to end the Mets'  
eight-game losing streak and start them on their winning ways, will 
open the Subway Series on Friday, followed by Rick Reed (6-3) and 
Hershiser.

<HEADLINE> Japan Business Sentiment Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Major Japanese companies are growing more confident  
about the economy though a growing number are reluctant to spend 
more, according to a closely watched survey released Monday by the 
Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	In its quarterly ``tankan'' survey, the Bank of Japan reported  
that sentiment among large manufacturers showed the biggest 
improvement since August 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, stocks surged to their highest level in more than a  
year and a half as the report raised hopes that the long ailing 
economy was on the mend. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism rose among small- and medium-sized manufacturers as  
well, marking the first time since November 1996 that the bank's 
index for business sentiment improved for all companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses were more optimistic about future conditions,  
predicting they would improve by the next survey in three months, 
the BOJ said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey ``clearly shows that the economy has hit bottom,''  
said Takashi Imai, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations, a powerful business group. 
</P>
<P>
	The growing confidence follows a surprise economic growth spurt  
and a drop in unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's gross domestic product -- the measure of all goods and  
services produced within its borders -- grew 1.9 percent for the 
first quarter of the year after more than a year of recession. The 
unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent in May from a record high of 
4.8 percent the previous two months. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the benchmark Nikkei Stock Average added 202.59  
points, or 1.13 percent, to close at 18,135.06 -- its highest close 
since Sept. 25, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the survey showed improvement from the one in March,  
there were troubling signs as well. 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of companies were still pessimistic about economic  
conditions and a growing number said they planned to cut capital 
investment in the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed large manufacturers were planning to slash  
spending by 11 percent this year, compared to an estimated cut of 
9.5 percent in the March survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital spending ``went in the wrong direction,'' said Ken  
Landon, a senior currency strategist at Deutsche Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	To measure business sentiment, the tankan survey calculates the  
percentage of firms that forecast economic conditions will improve 
minus the percentage that predict conditions will worsen. A 
negative number means pessimists outnumber optimists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest report, the index among large manufacturers  
reached minus 37 -- still negative, but a higher number than in the 
previous survey, when the figure came to minus 47. 
</P>
<P>
	The index of business sentiment has not entered positive  
territory since September, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank surveyed 9,366 companies for the latest report. A  
central bank official estimated that about 80 percent of the 
respondents answered the survey after the announcement of growth in 
the gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Control Utah Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUREKA, Utah (AP) -- Winds died down and temperatures cooled  
Monday, allowing 400 firefighters to get a handle on a fire that 
has burned more than 61,400 acres of dry grass and trees in central 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews carried water by hand up steep mountain areas that  
water-dropping helicopters could not reach. The fire, burning in 
pinion pine, cheat grass and juniper trees since Friday, was 
expected to be controlled by Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, near the neighboring towns of Eureka and Mammoth,  
about 55 miles south of Salt Lake City, twice drove residents from 
their homes over the weekend. No one was injured and only three 
abandoned shacks burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began in a patch of grass along some railroad tracks  
and was fanned by 50 mph wind gusts and hot, dry weather. It spread 
when a tanker truck containing 11,000 gallons of diesel fuel 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of firefighters also fought wildfires of around 3,000  
acres each in dry areas of central and southern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, firefighters also battled an 8,000-acre fire spanning  
western Colorado and eastern Utah. The massive blaze -- two fires 
that were pushed together Sunday afternoon by hot winds -- was 
fueled by tinder-dry sage, pinion pine and juniper. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winds are the driving force right now,'' Lynn Kolund, fire  
management officer for the Bureau of Land Management in Grand 
Junction, Colo. ``The winds plus the remote and difficult terrain 
are really keeping us from getting a hold of this one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, a controlled burn that got out of  
control and consumed 2,000 acres was mostly contained. Two dozen 
homes in the mountain hamlet of Lewiston were damaged, at a cost of 
$1.6 million.

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Thunderstorms rolled across the upper Great Lakes and northern  
New England on Monday, and hot, damp air covered much of the East. 
</P>
<P>
	An area of strong thunderstorms and heavy rain spread from  
northern Minnesota into northern sections of Wisconsin and 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 7 inches of rain fell Sunday and Monday around northern  
Minnesota's cities of Hibbing and Virginia, and flooding forced 
residents from their homes and swamped roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusting to 80 mph knocked down power lines and trees. Late  
Monday, authorities evacuated 14 injured people from the Boundary 
Waters Canoe Area after very strong winds swept through. 
</P>
<P>
	West of that area of rough weather, scattered showers and a few  
thunderstorms moved across North Dakota into northwestern 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Another area of thunderstorms and locally heavy rain moved  
across northern sections of New York, Vermont and New Hampshire 
into Maine, where high wind uprooted large trees and ripped down 
power lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like a train was going right through our house. The  
floor was rumbling right under our feet,'' said Sherry Chase of 
Moscow, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, a few showers and thunderstorms developed over parts  
of Arizona and New Mexico, and along the Gulf Coast from Texas to 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Isolated thunderstorms were possible over parts of Arkansas,  
eastern Oklahoma and eastern Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure over the Southeast produced hot, humid weather  
over most of the region east of the Mississippi River. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperature records for the date included 103 at Newark, N.J.;  
94 at Portland, Maine; 101 at New York City; and 102 at 
Washington's National Airport. Bridgeport, Conn., hit 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from a  
morning low of 24 at Stanley, Idaho, to an afternoon high of 103 at 
Newark.

<HEADLINE>  China 5, Norway 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOXBORO, Mass. (AP) -- China coach Ma Yuanan doesn't expect the  
Wo,0573men's World Cup final to be a repeat of his team's Fourth 
of July humbling of Norway.  
</P>
<P>
	He'd be happy enough if it was a repeat of April 25.  
</P>
<P>
	That's the last time China met the United States team that it  
will face again in Saturday's World Cup gold medal game in 
Pasadena, Calif. And China won that one 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``China has beaten the U.S.A. already twice (this year),''  
Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said Sunday after China shut out the 
Norwegians 5-0 at Foxboro Stadium to advance to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they will be the favorites in the final. But they will  
meet a very enthusiastic U.S. team. So I think that will be an 
interesting fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liu Ailing and Sun Wen scored two goals apiece -- scoring once  
each in the first 14 minutes to give China control early on a hot, 
sweaty night. The Chinese took a 3-0 lead six minutes into the 
second half on Liu's second goal, which was assisted by Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	And Norway still hadn't gotten a shot on goal.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to dictate the way the game was played,'' China  
goalkeeper Gao Hong said. ``We play with a sense of spiritual 
unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was enough to win by the biggest margin in World Cup  
semifinal history and match the largest defeat in Norway soccer 
history. The loss left the Norwegians out of the final for the 
first time in the three World Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no possibility to show our best'' because of the early  
deficit, said Norway defender Linda Medalen, whose team will play 
for third place against Brazil, a 2-0 loser to the United States 
earlier Sunday in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship game will be a rematch of the 1996 Olympic gold  
medal game that the United States won 2-1. Since then, the teams 
have met six more times, with the United States holding the 
advantage, three games to two, with one tie. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no doubt that the United States is one of the  
strongest teams in the world,'' the Chinese coach said. ``But the 
Chinese have played them three times (this year) and hold a 2-1 
advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans will have a tough time if China dominates the ball  
as it did Sunday in stopping Norway's 10-game World Cup winning 
streak -- a streak that dates to the final of the 1991 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a hard game'' for the Americans, said the  
34-year-old defender, who is one of three Norway players remaining 
from the 1991 team. ``The two best teams are in the final, no doubt 
about that. ... I look forward to seeing (it).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gao, the Chinese keeper, was rarely tested in the first half  
when Norway was outshot 11-0. The Norwegians had a 12-9 shooting 
advantage in the second half as they substituted and strategized to 
increase their offense, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, China closed in often on Norwegian keeper Bente  
Nordby, scoring on its first two chances with goals by Sun in the 
third minute and Liu in the 14th. 
</P>
<P>
	Six minutes into the second half, Liu scored again with a  
12-yard left-footed volley after a Norwegian defender tried to 
clear a corner kick into the box. Fan Yunjie made it 4-0 in the 
65th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun also scored on a penalty kick after a hand ball in the box  
in the 72nd minute to tie Sissi of Brazil for the tournament lead 
with seven goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hasn't thought about that (the scoring lead) at all,'' Sun  
said through an interpreter. ``Her whole outlook has been to play 
with the team and to win.''

<HEADLINE> New Mariners Ballpark Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The hot dogs are tastier, the seats more  
comfortable, the views much better and the open air glorious, 
Seattle Mariners fans said Monday at the dedication of their new 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	So what if service at the concession stands was slow and the  
relish table ill-designed? 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Ken Griffey Jr. first weighed in on the side of  
public officials in a dispute over financing, a crowd estimated at 
15,000 cheered the impending return of outdoor baseball after more 
than two decades in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of who should pay for $100 million in cost overruns  
on the $517 million project seemed almost lost in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care, just as long as they play ball here,'' said Rob  
Eason of Spanaway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're back to the way baseball ought to be played --  
outdoors, on the grass,'' Orlin VanWieringen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners could hardly have ordered more perfect weather for  
the festivities, a cloudless sky with a light breeze and 
temperatures edging into the 70s -- the warmest, sunniest weather in 
more than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``For too long we have suffered with less than the best. Today  
we have the best,'' Mayor Paul Schell said. ``It's time to 
celebrate a great stadium that all of our children and our 
children's children can enjoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute was evident only in the lackluster applause and a  
few boos for club president Chuck Armstrong, who ignored the snub 
and proclaimed, ``What a great day out for baseball! Ain't baseball 
great?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was a last-minute stand-in for Mariners chairman John  
Ellis, who has borne most of the load in the club's demand for $60 
million in additional public funding. 
</P>
<P>
	An article Sunday in The Seattle Times said Ellis and others  
suggested the Mariners might trade Griffey or Alex Rodriguez if the 
demand was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time this team has something come up, it's always me and  
Alex to blame,'' Griffey told The News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash., on 
Sunday after a phone call from ESPN. ``We love the game. We love 
playing in front of 40,000, 50,000 fans at home. Why does John 
Ellis want to make it so hard for us to bring those people out? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not us asking for more money here. I've been here 11  
years, Jay Buhner has been here 11 years. How much money do we have 
to defer? I deferred $5 million in my salary and offered to defer 
$10 million. They turned it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team was in Anaheim to play the Angels on Monday night, so  
the players missed the dedication.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Forgo Pay When Out of Tex. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush says he'll go off  
the Texas payroll when he's out of state campaigning for the 
Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bush is out of Texas for an entire day, Republican Lt. Gov.  
Rick Perry becomes acting governor under state law and receives an 
additional $316.01 a day, the same amount as Bush's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the lieutenant governor is paid in my absence, I don't  
think it's appropriate for the taxpayers of Texas to pay my salary 
twice,'' said Bush, who receives $115,345 a year as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry only gets the additional salary if Bush is out of state  
for a full day -- from midnight to midnight, according to the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The change announced Monday is retroactive. Bush, the  
front-runner for the GOP nomination, will reimburse the state 
$2,212.07, representing the salary he received during the seven 
days he campaigned outside Texas last month, according to the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from celebrating Fourth of July in New Hampshire Sunday,  
Bush will leave Austin again today to make campaign swings through 
Denver, Salt Lake City, and Portland, Ore. He's set to return 
Thursday night or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first stop in Denver, Bush will receive the  
endorsement of several of the state's key Hispanic leaders, 
including some Democrats, his campaign reported. Later in the 
evening, he will attend a fund-raising reception that is expected 
to add more than $150,000 to his already record-setting campaign 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign stops have included fund-raisers throughout Iowa  
and Florida. In California last week he announced his campaign has 
collected a record $36.25 million in its first six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-term governor also reported he has no personal debts and  
a financial portfolio that includes at least $7 million in U.S. 
Treasury notes and a diversified trust worth at least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush has pledged to go without his gubernatorial salary  
while campaigning out of state, he will continue using bodyguards 
from the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Bush is elected president, the state will continue to  
provide security until he leaves the Governor's Mansion for the 
White House, said Tom Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department 
of Public Safety.

<HEADLINE> Reconstructing the Shooting Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The sun set and the Sabbath had just begun as a  
group of Orthodox Jewish worshippers headed to synagogue. A 
stranger stepped out of a shiny blue Taurus. Soon, the staccato of 
gunfire shattered the night, bullets whizzing past one man's head. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter had calmly approached a group of men and boys  
wearing traditional black hats and long black coats, aimed a pair 
of semiautomatic handguns and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	He got back into his car and slowly drove through the North Side  
neighborhood. He turned the corner, shooting two more men. A block 
south, two more. He drove on a few blocks, stopping three more 
times, all the time shooting from his car -- shattering the glass on 
the passenger side. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 15 minutes Friday night, six Jews were wounded; one was  
hit in his back as he threw his young son to the ground, then 
covered him with his own body. The driver was gone -- without 
uttering a word. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon police had a sketch: A white man in his 20s, medium build,  
short, dark brown hair, driving a '90s model Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
	The hunt was on.  
</P>
<P>
	It was the beginning of what police say was a three-day rampage  
by a white supremacist who targeted minorities in two states over 
the Fourth of July weekend; he is suspected of killing a black 
former basketball coach and a Korean graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended Sunday night with a third death on a quiet rural road,  
235 miles south of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, authorities say, the person killed was the suspected  
gunman -- Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21. Smith, who had the words 
``Sabbath Breaker'' tattooed across his chest, was well-known to 
authorities for distributing hate-message leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County sheriff's deputies say they chased Smith after he  
carjacked a minivan in southern Illinois; he shot himself twice as 
he was pursued, they say, then a third time -- in the chest -- as he 
struggled with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over,'' Sheriff Gerald L. Benjamin declared  
Monday. ``I don't know what caused this but it's very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Once the shootings began, it took just 17 minutes before he  
struck again. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was fatal.  
</P>
<P>
	The scene was a tranquil tree-lined street in north suburban  
Skokie, where Ricky Byrdsong, a 43-year-old former Northwestern 
University basketball coach, had been walking with his son and 
daughter, about a block from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say at least seven shots were fired at Byrdsong; he was  
hit once in the back and died in surgery hours later. His children 
were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The final shots that evening came at 9:20 p.m. in the northern  
suburb of Northbrook, about 15 miles from where the men were 
attacked outside the synagogue. This time, police say, an 
Asian-American couple honked their car horn at a slow-moving light 
blue Taurus in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Four shots were fired, but no one was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Chicago police began piecing together the shootings  
with ballistic reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the shooter had .22-caliber and .380-caliber  
semiautomatics; they said at least 32 bullets and shells were 
recovered, but perhaps as many as 50 shots were fired -- all within 
one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	By Saturday, mourners were coming to the Byrdsong home; a  
makeshift memorial of flowers, cards and teddy bears was forming at 
the shooting scene. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, the gunman had moved on.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, there were more ominous reports of a man in a blue  
Taurus taking aim at black men walking down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the scene was 175 miles south of Chicago, in the  
state capital, Springfield. Three black men reported being shot at 
in two separate instances. One was hit in the buttocks; the others 
weren't injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two hours later, 35 miles away, a black minister in  
Decatur was shot in the arm and the hip, and investigators believe 
it was the same gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly before midnight, another 50 miles away, a gunman pulled  
up to six Asian-American men standing or a corner near the 
University of Illinois campus and fired three or four shots, 
according to police. A 22-year-old graduate student of Taiwanese 
descent was hit in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman moved on again ---- this time, apparently, crossing  
state lines. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	It was a steamy July Fourth and the minister of the Korean  
United Methodist Church was preparing for Sunday Sabbath services 
in Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard bang, bang, bang, bang,'' Byungchill Hahn recalled  
with tear-filled eyes. ``I thought it was a firecracker with the 
Fourth of July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not.  
</P>
<P>
	The minister ran out to find Won-Joon Yoon, a 26-year-old  
doctoral student in economics, collapsing on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, authorities knew the name of their suspect.  
</P>
<P>
	It was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, a young man who had been a  
member of the World Church of the Creator, a white supremacist 
organization in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith -- who sometimes liked to use the first name ``August''  
because he thought Benjamin sounded too Jewish -- attended the 
prestigious New Trier High School. His father and mother -- a doctor 
and a real estate agent -- now live in Northfield in a home with a 
tennis court and swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had a troubled past: While attending the University of  
Illinois, records show he was reprimanded for pot possession; he 
also put up racist posters and allegedly was peeping into window 
and carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he distributed white supremacist leaflets around the  
school, Chicago's North Shore, where his family lives, and Indiana 
University in Bloomington, which he attended as a criminal justice 
major after leaving Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he had tucked fliers on car windshields on Bloomington  
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The date?  
</P>
<P>
	The Fourth of July.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	It was late Sunday, the end of a weekend of terror.  
</P>
<P>
	A minivan had been carjacked at a truckstop in southern  
Illinois, police said, by a man who resembled Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A deputy spotted the vehicle. Soon, the chase was on.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith shot himself three times, the last two while struggling  
with deputies after he crashed into a small building. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions of how and why this happened have just begun, but  
others already see a message in this tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan Loeb, Midwest counsel for the Anti-Defamation League,  
which has monitored Smith for more than a year, said this incident 
demonstrates the power of a hateful message. 
</P>
<P>
	``His rhetoric was fairly inflammatory, but until this episode,  
it was substantially rhetoric,'' he said. ``What it tells you is 
the consequences of words can be fairly significant, the 
consequences of hate and screed can be very, very destructive.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Hurt in Chemical Plant Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAMERCY, La. (AP) -- Explosions rocked an aluminum plant early  
Monday, spraying a red mist containing a corrosive chemical over 
residential areas and sending dozens of people to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosions at the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Co. plant  
shook houses and broke windows. Authorities told residents to stay 
indoors and close their windows for nearly seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounded like 10 shotguns fired all at once,'' said Cline  
Cockburn, who was taking a bath when the explosions shook his 
house, about 600 yards from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents complaining of nausea and respiratory problems swamped  
the emergency room at St. James Parish Hospital. All were treated 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen workers were treated in a hospital, with four taken to  
burn units. Another worker suffered eye injuries and one underwent 
surgery for cuts. The others were released. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser spokeswoman Susan Ashe said the cause of the explosions  
was under investigation. The plant was shut down indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosions occurred in a part of the plant where electricity  
is generated and where bauxite, a reddish and clay-like aluminum 
ore, is mixed with a liquid form of sodium hydroxide, a caustic 
chemical. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosions blew a cloud of the mixture into the air --  
speckling cars, homes and people who happened to be outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Cockburn said he first rinsed off his house and dog, then hosed  
off his normally reddish truck and his wife's car. ``My wife's car 
wasn't silver anymore. It matched mine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Jones was finishing up the long Fourth of July weekend  
with friends at a bar about a mile from the plant. His arms and 
clothes were speckled with the red mixture and his vehicle looked 
like it had been driven on a muddy road.

<HEADLINE> Stock Profits Used for Buying Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- It used to take decades of scrimping and  
saving to buy a dream house. In the midst of Wall Street's bull 
market, investors are shaving years off that waiting time and 
ditching their piggy banks. 
</P>
<P>
	With stock prices climbing by double digits in each of the past  
four years, people in their 20s and 30s are using proceeds from 
profit-swollen stock portfolios for down payments for increasingly 
luxurious homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there another way to do it?'' joked Dan Summers, a  
35-year-old engineer at Silicon Valley-based laser maker Visx. He 
cashed in his company stock options for a four-bedroom home in 
Northern California. ``The stock went up, so I had the money to 
buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market's advance, underpinned by the booming economy  
and the growth of high-tech and Internet companies, has given more 
Americans the means to buy bigger and better homes. But financial 
experts and mortgage brokers warn that some homeowners might find 
they can't afford to keep those homes if the market heads south. 
</P>
<P>
	An April spot survey by the California Association of Realtors  
showed about 15 percent of customers in the nation's most populous 
state bought their homes with money from stocks, stock options and 
401(k) plans. 
</P>
<P>
	No comparable figures exist for previous years. But census  
numbers show that a decade ago, only 4 percent of new home buyers 
nationwide used profits from investments or the sale of real estate 
to buy new homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend may be most apparent in California, the home of many  
high-tech companies that have gone public and enriched their 
employees. But investors across the country who have poured money 
into stocks and mutual funds in recent years -- sending the overall 
value of the stock market to $13 trillion from $1 trillion in 1982 
-- are also benefiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Anderson, president of Cornerstone Mortgage Corp. in  
Denver, and Pretam Fuqua, a real estate agent in Los Angeles' San 
Gabriel Valley, said they have seen doctors, nurses, attorneys, 
teachers, even a jockey cash in stocks from mutual funds and 
retirement plans to buy their houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is looking at an increase in stock ownership,'' said  
Fred Flick, a vice president of economic research at the National 
Association of Realtors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Betsey Twigg, a Virginia real estate agent, said so many of her  
customers use stocks for seed money that it has become part of her 
company's standard contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another store of wealth,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	But some financial pros worry that these homebuyers, having seen  
the Dow Jones industrial average rise more than 7,000 points over 
the past five years despite several big downturns, may have a false 
sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people may be overbuying,'' Anderson said. He said  
customers sometimes overstate income, counting on as-yet-unrealized 
stock profits to get big mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buyers see stocks as a source of quick cash if they need to  
act quickly in case interest rates go up,'' said Susan Ratliff, a 
real estate agent in Pasadena. But using stock market earnings to 
pay a mortgage can be a formula for disaster if Wall Street suffers 
a protracted decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``People assume it'll just keep going,'' said Mark Cowan, a Visx  
regional service manager who used stocks for a down payment but can 
handle the mortgage with his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people that just got out of school are living in the  
million-dollar house and driving the Porsche around, these are 
people that could be broke at 30.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new money, a tight housing market and favorable interest  
rates have led to bidding wars for homes in some parts of the 
country, particularly where high-tech businesses are clustered. 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Mendell, a San Francisco-area real estate agent with  
several clients in Silicon Valley, recently offered about $60,000 
over the asking price for a $459,000 house. Six other offers beat 
his. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 18 months since Summers bought his home for $298,000 --  
having sold half his stock holdings for the down payment -- its 
value climbed $52,000 to $350,000. He gets letters from real estate 
agents every week asking him to consider selling.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most mortals would have serious indigestion  
after just a tiny fraction of Steve Keiner's hot dog feast. 
</P>
<P>
	But after winning the annual Nathan's July Fourth hot dog-eating  
contest by wolfing down 20 1/4 franks and buns, Keiner did something 
even more mind-boggling: He ate a couple more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel great,'' said the 317-pound Keiner, of Egg Harbor  
Township, N.J. ``And one other thing: They were simply delicious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keiner, 50, downed the dogs in 12 minutes on Sunday to beat  
134-pound Hirofumi Nakajima of Japan, who'd won the contest the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the Zen approach,'' Keiner said, acknowledging his  
competitor's cultural influence. ``I went down a path that the hot 
dog was one with me, and I was one with the universe. Could I get 
some french fries now?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keiner, an electrical inspector, wrapped himself in the American  
flag and posed for pictures after winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are tears of joy in Coney Island!'' said publicist  
George Shea, who gave a running commentary throughout the 
all-you-can-eat dogfight. ``The belt is back in America!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was referring to a mustard-yellow weightlifter's belt that  
goes to the annual event's winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Two contestants tied for second, coming within a mouthful of  
winning, at 20 hot dogs apiece. Nakajima placed fourth, downing 
only 19 franks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad, terrible,'' said Nakajima, 24, via an interpreter.  
``I don't want to look at a hot dog right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nakajima, a former noodle-eating champion, said he was retiring  
from eating contests. ``I'm done,'' he said. ``That's it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contest has been held on Independence Day at the Nathan's  
flagship store nearly every year since 1916. 
</P>
<P>
	Many contestants dipped their hot dogs in a lubricating water  
bath before eating them, but Keiner said he comes from the purists' 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried that once,'' he said, ``but it ruins the bouquet.''  
</P>
<P>
	Like spectators at an air show morbidly poised for disaster to  
strike, the crowd watched with slightly nauseous fascination as the 
men competed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was waiting for someone to vomit,'' said Stacey Simcox, as  
she ate her own hot dog -- just one -- after the winner was 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
	And of course no event in New York is complete without a  
protest. This one had vegetarians handing out fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty disgusting spectacle,'' said Alex Press of New  
York. ``We love animals.''

<HEADLINE> Group Rejects David Duke's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A Confederate heritage group seeking the  
return of Gen. Robert E. Lee's portrait to a tourist attraction is 
getting some unwanted support from former Ku Klux Klan leader David 
Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke said Monday he plans to visit the former Confederate  
capital July 15 to weigh in on the Lee controversy and urge whites 
to preserve their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black people are organized to do what they want,'' Duke said.  
``It's important for white Southerners to organize or this kind of 
thing is going to happen again and again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brag Bowling, a Sons of Confederate Veterans brigade commander,  
said Duke would only ``make the situation worse. The last thing 
Richmond needs is racial strife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The portrait of Lee was removed from a history exhibit at  
Richmond's Canal Walk just before the project's June 4 grand 
opening. A black member of City Council said the portrait was 
offensive to many blacks and threatened to organize a boycott of 
the riverfront development. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sons of Confederate Veterans and others, some holding  
Confederate flags or wearing stars-and-bars lapel stickers, 
protested the removal. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of city leaders has since recommended that a  
different Lee portrait illustrating the Confederate hero's ties to 
Richmond be added to the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowling said he fears Duke's involvement will switch the focus  
back to race and undermine the proposed compromise.

<HEADLINE> Sempati Air Is Declared Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An airline that was partly owned by  
the youngest son of ex-President Suharto was declared bankrupt on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sempati Air had been Indonesia's third largest airline before it  
ceased operations in June 1998, the victim of Asia's financial 
meltdown and huge debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of its white and blue jetliners have been parked on the  
tarmac of Jakarta's international airport for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Among its stockholders are Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra,  
Suharto's son, and the ex-President's golfing buddy and business 
adviser Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Commercial Court declared Sempati bankrupt at its  
own request -- the first such ruling since the court was set up last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Victor Hutabarat said one of the reasons supporting the  
airline's bankruptcy application was that Sempati has no cash flow 
to operate or repay debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The court supported Sempati's argument that its financial  
decline was largely due to the rupiah's fall against the U.S. 
dollar, which increased the airline's operating costs while hitting 
its rupiah-denominated revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutabarat said the company had tried to save the business by  
injecting fresh capital, but the decline of the Indonesian economy 
had thwarted attempts to turn the airline around. 
</P>
<P>
	The demise of the airline is the latest in a series of financial  
blows for the Suharto family, which is fending off allegations of 
corruption since the resignation of Suharto after riots and 
protests last year. Suharto, like many Indonesians, uses a single 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics claim the former leader, now 78, misused his power  
during his 32-year authoritarian rule to enrich his offspring and 
cronies. 
</P>
<P>
	So far an official government inquiry into Suharto's personal  
wealth has come up with no evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tommy, 37, has become the first member of Indonesia's former  
first family to face trial for graft. He is accused of taking part 
in a shady land deal related to another part of his sprawling 
business empire.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar climbed Monday to a one-and-a-half  
month high against the yen after intervention by Japan's central 
bank. Tokyo's main stock index closed sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.58 yen in late-afternoon trading, up 1.50  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and above its level late Friday in 
New York of 121.01 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average added 202.59 points, or 1.13 percent,  
finishing at 18,135.06 -- its highest closing level since Sept. 25, 
1997, when the index closed at 18,341.96. On Friday, the average 
closed up 71.72 points to 17,932.47. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, a senior government official confirmed in  
an unusually quick admission that the Bank of Japan stepped into 
markets to weaken the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we took action in the markets,'' said Haruhiko Kuroda,  
head of the international bureau at the Finance Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank reportedly made several rounds of interventions  
following the release of the BOJ's closely-watched ``tankan'' 
quarterly survey of corporations, which showed business sentiment 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that confidence at large Japanese businesses  
posted its biggest advance since August 1994 -- prompting some 
investors to buy yen. Surveyed companies predicted that optimism 
will improve further by the time of the next survey in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese financial authorities, concerned the yen's rise would  
slow the nation's economic recovery, sold yen to buy between $1 
billion and $2 billion, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad, and  
reduces dollar-denominated earnings at Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the government may be unable to stem a rise in the yen,  
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential for a yen rise is fairly large after the  
improved tankan data,'' said Shigeru Hashimoto, a senior trader at 
Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.90 yen and 122.87 yen in Monday's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 125.57 yen, up from  
123.86 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices surged on the tankan result as well  
as the record high Wall Street closing on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 717.38 million shares, up from 705.03 million shares 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered retreaters 712 to 503, while 117  
issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 26.42 points, or 1.81 percent, to 
1,486.58. The TOPIX closed up 12.75 points, or 0.88 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government bond fell to  
1.6150 percent from Friday's finish of 1.6600 percent, driving its 
price up to 101.61 yen from 101.21 yen.

<HEADLINE> Penney's Pulls 'Offensive' T-Shirts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLANO, Texas (AP) -- There'll be no more trash-talkin' about  
women at J.C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
	After a feminist group complained, the department store chain  
announced it is pulling a line of basketball-themed T-shirts aimed 
at young men with lines that include: ``Your game is as ugly as 
your girl,'' and ``You like that move? So does your girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``trash talk'' line of apparel, manufactured by AND1  
Basketball, is offensive to women, said the leader of the group 
that complained. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a put-down of girls in the process of putting down a  
sports opponent,'' said Martha Burk, president of the Center for 
Advancement of Public Policy in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strong implication is that girls are the property of boys  
to be traded like baseball cards,'' she said. ``It's an insulting, 
dehumanizing thing, and we have enough incivility in society 
without this gender-based stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burk said several people contacted her group to complain  
about the shirts, and that she later denounced the apparel in the 
center's newsletter, ``The Washington Feminist Faxnet,'' which is 
faxed to several thousand people around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	J.C. Penney Co. Inc. spokeswoman Stephanie Brown said the  
Plano-based retailer got enough complaints that it will no longer 
carry shirts that specifically target women. Other AND1 apparel 
will still be available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put the T-shirts out thinking we wouldn't have a problem,''  
Brown said. ``But we are having some concerns coming our way, and 
they are valid concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burk said she welcomed Penney's decision and will target  
other retailers, including Footlocker and Just for Feet, that still 
carry the shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with AND1, based in Pennsylvania, were not available  
for comment Monday. A recorded phone message said their offices 
were closed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The company produces dozens of shirts with phrases such as  
``Turn on the disposal, your game's garbage.'' Most of them have 
nothing to do with gender. 
</P>
<P>
	In a recent interview with Sports Illustrated, company president  
Seth Berger said, ``Trash talk is a crucial element of basketball, 
part of what makes it great and gives it flavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is not the first time that J.C. Penney has pulled T-shirts  
from the racks. In April, customer concerns led to the removal of 
shirts featuring South Park, the Comedy Central show about 
foul-mouthed grade-school children.

<HEADLINE> Freight Trains Collide in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Two Union Pacific freight trains  
crashed head-on early Monday, derailing nine engines, spilling 
about 10,000 gallons of fuel and injuring two crewmen who leaped 
from each train before impact. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured crewmen was in serious but stable condition  
with a broken ankle and cuts. The other man had minor bruises. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary investigation indicated one train operator ran a  
red light, police Sgt. Mitch Spike said. Sgt. Patrick Williams 
estimated that the trains were traveling between 15 mph and 20 mph. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed higher Monday, with oil,  
telecommunications and chemical stocks leading. 
</P>
<P>
	Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index extended gains with a 1.9 percent  
advance, and earned itself a new record high. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street was closed for a public holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Energy index registered its biggest percentage  
gain on record, up 4.3 percent, after the Paris-Brussels group, 
Total Fina, made a hostile share bid for smaller French rival Elf 
Aquitaine with a view to creating the world's fourth leading oil 
company in terms of market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf closed up 22 percent, at EUR177.30. Total Fina ended up 50  
cents at EUR128.50. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris CAC 40 index ended 1.7 percent higher, Milan's MIBtel  
index rose 1.9 percent, and Madrid's IBEX-35 index was up 1.5 
percent. London's FTSE-100 index was up 1.5 percent, just short of 
a new closing record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid comes after a major appreciation this year in the oil  
price, but some oil sector investors reckon corporate strategies 
are unaffected by that. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil-influenced Oslo bourse was more subdued, the All-Share  
index rising only 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical stocks also were buoyed by London press reports that  
local stock BOC Group is ripe for merger. BOC is seen as a takeover 
target for Paris rival L'Air Liquide. 
</P>
<P>
	Automotives' rebound Monday was helped by rumors that tiremaker  
Continental could replace chemicals group Hoechst in Germany's 
Xetra DAX, when the index's composition is revised July 20.

<HEADLINE> Group Rejects David Duke's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A Confederate heritage group fighting to  
return Gen. Robert E. Lee's portrait to a downtown tourist 
attraction is getting some unwanted support from former Ku Klux 
Klan leader David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke said Monday he plans to visit the former Confederate  
capital July 15 to weigh in on the Lee controversy and urge whites 
to preserve their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black people are organized to do what they want,'' Duke said.  
``It's important for white Southerners to organize or this kind of 
thing is going to happen again and again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brag Bowling, a Sons of Confederate Veterans brigade commander,  
said Duke would only ``make the situation worse. The last thing 
Richmond needs is racial strife.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The portrait of Lee was removed from a history exhibit at  
Richmond's Canal Walk just before the project's June 4 grand 
opening. A black member of City Council said the portrait was 
offensive to many blacks and threatened to organize a boycott of 
the riverfront development. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sons of Confederate Veterans and others, some holding  
Confederate flags or wearing stars-and-bars lapel stickers, 
protested the removal of the portrait. 
</P>
<P>
	A committee of city leaders has since recommended that a  
different Lee portrait illustrating the Confederate hero's ties to 
Richmond be added to the floodwall gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowling said he fears Duke's involvement will switch the focus  
back to race and undermine the proposed compromise.

<HEADLINE> Investigator Arrests Spur Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The company was known as ``Dirty Deeds Done  
Cheap'' and ``Phantom Investigations,'' and clients included 
private investigators, the media and companies checking out the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	If authorities are correct, James and Regena Rapp and their  
employees lied and schemed to get detailed personal information -- 
bank and telephone records and credit-card bills -- on the JonBenet 
Ramsey murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple's recent indictment on racketeering charges has  
spurred concern over the apparent ease in which that information 
was obtained. The Rapps' company billed itself as an ``information 
broker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a question of identity and privacy,'' said Tara Lemmey,  
president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization that tracks the Internet and privacy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, it's a case of fraud. We already have good fraud  
laws on the books. The larger question is, should people have the 
right to get information on another person,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rapps did not return a phone message seeking comment Monday.  
Court records listed no attorney for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Their arrests followed a sting operation by the Colorado Bureau  
of Investigation to recover information in the Ramsey case. 
JonBenet, 6, was found strangled and beaten in her Boulder home on 
Dec. 26, 1996. No arrests have been made, though her parents have 
been described as being under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Rapps and their employees at TTI telephoned  
companies to ask for copies of personal records, claiming to be 
that person. The copies were faxed to a phone number that routed 
the documents to TTI, according to a Jefferson County grand jury 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents seized last month were the cellular phone  
records of John and Patsy Ramsey, credit card bills, banking 
records for Ramsey's former company, Access Graphics, and records 
of his plane trips. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment also says the Rapps obtained information about  
the Ramsey investigation itself. Included in the court case file is 
a letter purportedly from John Ramsey to McGuckin Hardware, asking 
for information about credit card purchases by his wife for $46.31 
and $99.88 just weeks before their daughter's body was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Police reportedly believe the cord and duct tape used to kill  
JonBenet likely had been purchased by Mrs. Ramsey at the store. The 
Ramseys, who have moved to an Atlanta suburb, have maintained their 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the indictment, TTI worked out of a strip mall  
office in Aurora and had more than 1,200 subscribers. On a typical 
day, the company got more than 100 calls or faxes requesting 
confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
	In the sting, an agent set herself up as a target to see what  
TTI could find out about her. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought we'd run it up the flagpole. She was surprised by  
the details they found,'' Brown said. ``It came back exactly what 
her phone bill was and bank balance statement was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators paid $460 for the information.  
</P>
<P>
	Pam Russell, a spokeswoman for Jefferson County prosecutors,  
said investigators are trying to determine whether whether 
supermarket tabloids and other publications bought information 
about the Ramsey case from the Rapps. If they knew the information 
was stolen, they could face charges. 
</P>
<P>
	She said no major publications have been identified so far. CBI  
agent Robert Brown said authorities were not targeting the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain things in our lives that are personal and  
private -- our finances, who we call, who we talk to,'' he said. ``I 
can't even get this information without a warrant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemmey said that with the proliferation of computers and  
databases, personal information given in confidence isn't always 
kept private. 
</P>
<P>
	``People assumed the information they provide will only be used  
for a driver's license or to buy a dishwasher,'' she said. ```They 
need to know that the information is now being used for other 
things.''

<HEADLINE> Sports Agent Denies Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A sports agent under investigation for  
allegedly giving cash to former college football stars at Florida, 
South Carolina and LSU before their eligibility expired denied 
making illegal payments to entice players to sign with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Agent William ``Tank'' Black, in a formal response to the NFL  
Players Association's disciplinary complaint accusing him of 
recruiting violations, produced statements and affidavits from six 
players all denying any illegal payments were made to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Black and attorney Leonard Mungo will deliver the response,  
which was obtained by The Associated Press on Monday, to the NFLPA 
on Tuesday. Neither Black nor Mungo would comment on the response 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Statements from former Gators players Ike Hilliard, Reidel  
Anthony, Mike Peterson and Jacquez Green and affidavits from former 
Gator Fred Taylor and former LSU running back Kevin Faulk all 
denied payments were made. Black represents all those players 
except Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Another former Florida player, Johnny Rutledge, has admitted  
publicly that he accepted $500 per month from Black and that he and 
former Gators Jevon Kearse and Reggie McGrew all made sworn 
statements admitting the same. The three players and Peterson 
initially signed with Black, but later fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	Black's response referred to statements given under oath in  
April by Rutledge, Kearse and McGrew stating they, in fact, had not 
accepted any money. 
</P>
<P>
	NFLPA attorney Richard Berthelsen said Monday he was not aware  
of any written statement from the players exonerating Black. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only statement I'm aware of is one Johnny Rutledge has  
made to the contrary,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFLPA alleged that Black and an employee, Alfred Twitty,  
provided payments to former Florida and South Carolina players and, 
``on information and belief,'' to former players from LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	Black's reply included a sworn affidavit from Twitty, who said  
he does not recruit athletes for the agent and has never given 
money or anything of value to induce players to sign with Black. 
Twitty is a former football player at North Carolina A&AMP;T who joined 
Black's agency, Professional Management Inc., in 1996. He works out 
of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	In his response, Black goes point by point through the eight  
allegations brought by the NFLPA when it issued the complaint May 
19. The most serious allegations involve providing cash and cars to 
former college players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black has not done anything wrong or broken any rules,'' the  
response reads. ``Yet, the NFLPA has singled out Black and marked 
him as though he has been tried for and convicted of a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union could revoke his license if it finds him guilty.  
</P>
<P>
	University of Florida police are also investigating Black. He  
would face up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine if found 
guilty of violating the state's agent law. 
</P>
<P>
	In his response to the NFLPA, Black also produced bank records  
and sworn statements from car dealers showing that he did not 
arrange to buy automobiles for former Florida players before their 
eligibility expired. 
</P>
<P>
	Black submitted a notarized statement from a Mercedes dealer in  
Columbia stating that Rutledge spent three hours on the car lot on 
Jan. 4 -- two days after Florida's final game in the Orange Bowl -- 
shopping for a car. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank statements show Rutledge took a loan for $69,527 the same  
day to purchase a 1999 Mercedes S420V. 
</P>
<P>
	Black also submitted a statement from a Lexus dealer in Columbia  
who said he sold McGrew a car on Jan. 6. Records from the same bank 
show a loan dated Jan. 6 to McGrew for $60,998. 
</P>
<P>
	Black submitted records of a $66,350 loan taken out by Peterson  
on Jan. 4 to buy a 1998 Landrover. 
</P>
<P>
	He also provided records regarding the purchase of a Mercedes  
for Kearse. Black claims the $133,000 car was bought in Atlanta on 
Dec. 31, but never made it into Kearse's possession until after the 
Orange Bowl. Motor vehicle records in Florida show Kearse owned the 
car before the bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can get a lot of documentation showing how you  
legitimately purchased cars for college players,'' said Berthelsen, 
who had not seen the response as of Monday. ``But the heart of this 
case is about paying cash to college athletes. How does he get 
around that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the reply, Black claims the union and other agents started a  
conspiracy to force him out of business. Those are the same type of 
claims Black made in a federal lawsuit he filed against the NFLPA 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Berthelsen said there was no such conspiracy.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Kerrey Endorses Bill Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLIVE, Iowa (AP) -- Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley said  
Monday he gains invaluable insight from an experienced former 
Democratic presidential candidate in collecting the endorsement of 
Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very, very good day for the Bradley campaign,'' he  
said. ``We got a big boost today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley and Kerrey formally announced the endorsement in  
Nebraska and in Iowa, where precinct caucuses launch the 
presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey has ``been through this process before, he's run for  
president of the United States before,'' said Bradley. ``He 
understands the difficulty of getting your arms around a country as 
big and diverse as this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey's endorsement makes him the second current senator to  
back Bradley, joining Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. Bradley is the only 
announced opponent of Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement by the two-term Nebraska senator and former  
governor isn't surprising. He has had tensions with the Clinton 
administration, and was close to Bradley when they were Senate 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Any differences with Clinton and Gore were papered over during  
Monday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm endorsing Bill Bradley for president not because I dislike  
Al Gore, I like Al Gore a lot,'' said Kerrey. ``For me the choice 
is between two friends, the choice is between two able leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most polls have shown Gore with a solid lead in the race for the  
Democratic nomination, although Bradley is lurking as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992,  
and flirted with the idea of running again in 2000. In bowing out, 
he cited Bradley's presence in the race as a reason, arguing that 
Democrats were being offered a choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a leader on race, he's been a leader on some of the  
most contentious issues of our day,''' said Kerrey. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey has campaigned frequently in Iowa, and built a network of  
supporters that could be helpful to Bradley. About 100 people 
gathered for a sweltering backyard barbecue to hear Kerrey's 
endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Kerrey's backing comes from those impressed with his  
military background, including his award of the Medal of Honor for 
heroism in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of fake celebrities in the world today, but  
Bob Kerrey is a genuine American hero,'' said Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	In acknowledging the endorsement, Bradley vowed to stick with  
his policy of not accepting political action committee money. ``I'm 
trying to do this differently. I'm not doing any of the 
legal-illegal loopholes in the campaign finance laws,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that stance, Bradley has raised more than $11 million,  
compared with Gore's $18 million, which has helped his campaign 
gain credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Omaha, Bradley said Kerrey's role in his campaign  
would be ``as large a role as he chooses,'' but he did not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked, Kerrey all but ruled out being Bradley's running  
mate, saying that out of fairness to Nebraskans, he preferred to 
focus on his race for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be difficult, but not impossible'' to run  
simultaneously for the vice presidency and the Senate, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush To Forgo Pay When Out of Tex. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush said Monday that he will  
forgo his gubernatorial salary -- $316.01 a day -- when he campaigns 
outside Texas for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bush is out of state for an entire day, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry  
is elevated under state law to acting governor and paid an 
additional $316.01 a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the Lt. Governor is paid in my absence, I don't think  
it's appropriate for the taxpayers of Texas to pay my salary 
twice,'' said Bush, who is paid $115,345 a year as governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry only gets the additional salary if Bush is out of state  
the entire day -- from midnight to midnight, according to the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The change announced Monday is retroactive. Bush, the  
front-runner for the GOP nomination, will reimburse the state 
$2,212.07, representing the salary he received during the seven 
days he campaigned outside Texas last month, according to the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from celebrating Fourth of July in New Hampshire on  
Sunday, Bush will leave Austin again Tuesday to make campaign 
swings through Denver, Salt Lake City, and Portland, Ore. He 
returns Thursday night or Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	While Bush has pledged to go without his gubernatorial salary  
while campaigning out of state, he will continue to use bodyguards 
supplied by the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing security concerns, Bush aides and state officials decline  
to say how many guards travel with the governor or how much it 
costs Texas taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Department of Public Safety has always protected the  
state's governor,'' said Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	While traveling with Bush, the bodyguards fly on the governor's  
plane, which is paid for by the campaign, according to Bush's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Vinger, Department of Public Safety spokesman, said the  
state has had to increase the pool of officers trained for Bush's 
security as his travel schedule intensified. Part of the increase 
goes to Lt. Gov. Perry, who becomes eligible for bodyguards when 
Bush is out of town and he steps in as acting governor, Vinger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Bush is elected president, the state will continue to  
provide security until he leaves the Governor's Mansion for the 
White House, Vinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be with the governor as long as he is governor,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Is Star in Education Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Humongous Entertainment is building a reputation for doing  
education software right and pricing it fairly. This probably means 
they'll sell a lot of Blue's 123 Time Activities, a 
Windows-Macintosh CD-ROM aimed at preschoolers and priced at 
$19.99. 
</P>
<P>
	For those living without benefit of toddlers, Blue is a dog. A  
blue dog, not unexpectedly, who stars in Blue's Clues, a preschool 
television show by Nickelodeon. Her mission here involves pre-math 
skills and is aimed at the 3- to 6-year age group. 
</P>
<P>
	The central theme is that of a backyard fair. Blue helps the  
child complete various activities, which are rewarded in Blue 
Dollars that may be exchanged for prizes in the prize tent. 
</P>
<P>
	The educational concepts being delivered include pattern  
recognition, weight and measurement, simple addition and 
subtraction, sorting and classifying, prediction and estimation. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this comes in a giggle-centric, kid-smart way that is a  
visual and auditory delight. The animations are charming and 
simple, with bold, bright backgrounds. And the user interface 
accurately reflects the needs of the target audience. Directions 
are clear, cursors and navigation icons are large and easy to find. 
Instructions may be repeated simply by moving the cursor over the 
animation that first gave them. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the activities are slam-dunk easy. In one card game  
against a teddy bear, the idea was to match either the shape or the 
number until you matched out all five cards dealt you. Three 
triangles, for example could be ``matched'' by one triangle (same 
shape) or three squares (same number). If you had no matches in 
your hand and less than five cards, you had to draw from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	I thought it sounded simple. Then the bear won. Twice. My ego  
wouldn't risk a third try and I didn't have a toddler handy, so 
that part of the software remains unconquered. I will let it be 
known, however, that I was a standout on the number lines at 
``Mother May I?'' 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements are modest. For the Windows herd, Pentium 90  
or better, 16 megabytes of RAM, quad-speed CD-ROM. Macintosh users 
face the same memory and CD-ROM requirements, and should be running 
at least a 90 megahertz Power PC and System 7.5.3. Sound capability 
is assumed for both machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Humongous Entertainment's products are widely available at  
retail. If you live where the bears are unlikely to start retailing 
software, it's also available on line at humongous.com, or by 
telephone at (800) 499-8386.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Millions sweltered as record heat with high  
humidity wilted the East today. Heat advisories were posted by the 
National Weather Service from the Mississippi Valley to the East 
Coast. High temperatures and humidity created heat indexes of up to 
110 and more. Temperature records for the date included 103 at 
Newark, N.J.; 94 at Portland, Maine; 101 at New York City; and 102 
at Washington's National Airport.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Linked to Anti-Minority Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- The head of the World Church of the Creator  
said his group's rhetoric of racial hatred could not have been a 
motive for the shooting spree by a former member. 
</P>
<P>
	Styled as a religion, the Church of the Creator is run by  
aspiring lawyer Matt Hale from his parents' home in a middle class 
neighborhood of East Peoria. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with The Associated Press from his  
office -- a room where an Israeli flag serves as a doormat and 
swastikas adorn the walls -- Hale insisted that members of his 
church follow the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always encouraged our members to be legal. I've certainly  
never encouraged violence,'' Hale said. ``People have their own 
free will. They do what they please.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, police said Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, linked to the  
death of two men during a two-state shooting spree that targeted 
minorities, shot himself and later died. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 21, was a criminal justice student at Indiana University  
when he paid $35 in dues to become a member of the church from June 
1998 to May 1999. Smith didn't renew his dues, but his dormitory 
address is still listed as an Indiana contact on the hate group's 
Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsletters and other church literature advocate a white racial  
holy war on ``mud races,'' blacks and Jews to further the expansion 
of the white race. Most group literature also include notices that 
violence is not condoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale said blaming the shootings on the church was ``the same as  
people accusing the Pope of being behind all those abortion clinic 
bombings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police and the Anti-Defamation League, however, have linked the  
church to violence. Members were convicted for the beating death of 
a black sailor and investigated for conspiracies to bomb gay, black 
and Jewish institutions on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the hate literature and the calls to action on their  
Web site really walk a very fine line between just ignorant speech 
and inciting harmful actions, violent conduct,'' said John 
Fernandez, mayor of Bloomington, Ind., who was briefed on Smith and 
the church by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	To Harlan Loeb, counsel for the ADL, the World Church of the  
Creator is all about ``gutter-level racism and bigotry.'' There is 
no church building, no physical presence beyond Hale's Web site and 
his home office. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1973 by Ben Klassen, a former Florida state lawmaker  
born in the Ukraine and raised in Canada, the church attracted 
neo-Nazis and skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
	After church members were convicted of the murder of the black  
sailor in Florida -- prompting the victim's family to file a lawsuit 
seeking $1 million from the church -- Klassen sold off group 
property and swallowed four bottles of sleeping pills to kill 
himself in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Thought leaderless and defunct since Klassen's death, the  
organization has undergone a revival since Hale was elected 
Pontifex Maximus -- an ancient Roman title meaning ``supreme 
leader'' -- on a Montana ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale, 27, attracted national attention earlier this year when he  
agreed to hire famed Jewish lawyer Alan Dershowitz in an attempt to 
win his law license. Twice now Hale has been deemed unfit by state 
hearing panels to become a lawyer in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	A violinist with degrees in music, political science and law,  
Hale is overseeing a widespread recruiting drive. He established 
regional branches in Montana, California and Florida and claims 
there are as many as 3,000 members nationwide, a number which is 
hard to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	In a special report on the organization, the Anti-Defamation  
League called the reappearance of Klassen's group under Hale's 
leadership a ``disturbing development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``While the newly resurrected COTC might be small in numbers,  
the organization is compensating with an aggressive barrage of 
mailings and recruiting efforts,'' the report states.

<HEADLINE>  Fireworks, Heat Mark East's Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands watched along the city's riverfront as  
splashes of stunning fireworks dotted the sky, capping a day of 
free concerts, foot races and enveloping summer heat throughout the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York crowd turned Manhattan's FDR Drive into a giant,  
paved viewing stage, dragging coolers and lawn chairs onto the 
normally bustling roadway to snag the show's best views. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 52 tons of fireworks exploded over the East River in  
celebration of the nation's 223rd birthday. ``It's exciting to come 
here to see the big fireworks,'' said an awed Rachel Laing, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the nation, there was something else that awed  
Independence Day revelers -- the heat. Parades, fireworks and 
backyard barbecues all came with a furnace-like dose of brow-wiping 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	In humid Boston, a crowd of 500,000 watched Boston Symphony  
Orchestra Music Director Seiji Ozawa conduct Tchaikovsky's ``1812 
Overture'' while cannons boomed and fireworks lit the Charles 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	During a choral performance, U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
read words composed in 1963 by his late brother, President John F. 
Kennedy. ``Our most basic common link is that we inhabit this small 
planet,'' he told the cheering, jubilant crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fort Dix, N.J., less than 500 ethnic Albanian refugees  
remained to celebrate their last weekend in a resettlement village. 
The village, designed for those who fled Kosovo, is scheduled to 
close within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were urged to stay cool in Philadelphia as the heat  
index rose to 110 degrees, the National Weather Service said. Early 
in the day, 112 people born on Independence Day since 1900 gathered 
for a ``Photo of the Century'' in front of Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia roasted under record-breaking heat, with a new Fourth  
of July high of 97 degrees at Dulles International Airport. On the 
west lawn of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello in Charlottesville, 87 
people were sworn in during traditional naturalization ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time  
to decide to be a U.S. citizen,'' said Carmen Aguilar, a native of 
Venezuela. ``This is the very best decision of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbecuers also braved temperatures in the mid-90s in Michigan,  
where National Weather Service forecaster Fred Keyes found hope in 
cool front projected to arrive Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could cool us -- cool, that's a relative word, isn't it? --  
into the 80s,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The South wasn't much cooler. In Atlanta, 82-degree heat  
blanketed paradegoers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we leave here without passing out, we're going to rest at  
home before going to see some fireworks,'' said Deborah Anderson as 
she watched festivities with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	In Augusta, Ga., about 50 people saluted hundreds of tattered  
and faded old American flags before dousing them in kerosene and 
setting them ablaze, the method recommended for destroying old 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaches were packed from Maine to Miami. An estimated 200,000  
sun worshippers crammed into Los Angeles to bask atop the Southern 
California sand. 
</P>
<P>
	Festivities in the City of Angels also included a convention by  
Mensa, the national high-IQ group, and a music festival by L.A. 
Friends of Tibet, a group advocating liberation of the 
Chinese-occupied nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone who didn't get much time off this holiday weekend was  
Bill Ronayne, owner of West Brandywine Valley Heating &AMP; Air 
Conditioning of West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone's ringing off the hook,'' Ronayne said. Residents  
with ailing air conditioners, Ronayne said, ``want their cooling 
back on, and they want it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still others decided to do the unthinkable: They went running.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of New Yorkers took part in a charity run through  
Central Park -- on a day where the city's heat index hit 111 
degrees. Barbecues and outdoor concerts followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have air conditioning in my apartment, so this is just  
as good,'' said Shirley Hawn, 40, of Manhattan, while she sat in a 
folding chair fanning herself.

index rose to 110 degrees, the National Weather Service said. Early 
in the day, 112 people born on Independence Day since 1900 gathered 
for a ``Photo of the Century'' in front of Independence Hall.

<P>
	Virginia roasted under record-breaking heat, with a new Fourth  
of July high of 97 degrees at Dulles International Airport. On the 
west lawn of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello in Charlottesville, 87 
people were sworn in during traditional naturalization ceremonies.

	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time

	Barbecuers also braved temperatures in the mid-90s in Michigan,  
where National Weather Service forecaster Fred Keyes found hope in 
cool front projected to arrive Tuesday.

<P>
	``That could cool us -- cool, that's a relative word, isn't it? --

<HEADLINE> Collapsed Caddie Condition Upgraded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- The news keeps getting better for Garland  
Dempsey, the caddie who collapsed during the third round of the 
Western Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey, 51, was upgraded to guarded but stable condition  
Monday, said Karen Callahan, the health supervisor at Palos 
Community Hospital. He remains in the hospital's intensive care 
unit, Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey's family has requested that no other information be  
released. 
</P>
<P>
	It's still not clear why Dempsey, John Maginnes' longtime  
caddie, collapsed as he walked off the 15th tee Saturday, though he 
had been taking medication for pancreatitis. The temperature was in 
the 90s, with the humidity making it feel more than 100 degrees at 
the Cog Hill Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know his heart stopped, I know he stopped breathing,''  
Maginnes said. ``But I honestly don't know what happened. This was 
a shock. This was not an expected thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes and Dempsey had just left the 15th tee when Maginnes  
said he heard Dempsey make a noise and the bag drop. He turned 
around to see Dempsey on the ground. Matt Moore, an ABC spotter, 
performed CPR until paramedics arrived. Paramedics used a 
defibrillator to restore Dempsey's pulse, then put him into an 
ambulance and took him to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Maginnes continued playing, saying Dempsey would have been mad  
if he quit, and finished in sixth place. Patrick Fitzgerald, a 
caddie who was working for ABC as a spotter, carried Maginnes' bag 
for the rest of the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Victim: Gunman Had 'Predator' Look </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- The minister of the Korean United  
Methodist Church broke down in tears as he spoke of one of his 
parishioners, a 26-year-old doctoral student he watched die on the 
Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Minister Byungchill Hahn was preparing for services Sunday  
morning when shots rang out in front of his church. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard bang, bang, bang, bang. I thought it was a firecracker  
with the Fourth of July,'' Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran outside just in time to see Won-Joon Yoon collapse on the  
sidewalk, apparently the last victim in a white supremacists' 
shooting spree that targeted minorities in Indiana and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you possibly imagine that kind of thing happening at  
the church?'' said Pyung Ho Kim, who had been walking with Yoon. 
``If the church is not safe, what is? I still don't believe that 
I'm alive. It could've been me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI and police officials reported late Sunday night that the  
suspect in the shootings, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, shot himself to 
death during a high-speed chase near Salem, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Smith had shot and killed a black man in Illinois on  
Friday and also wounded six Orthodox Jews. He was suspected of 
firing at an Asian-American couple and shooting at blacks and 
Asians in Springfield, Ill., and Champaign-Urbana, Ill.. 
</P>
<P>
	While the suspect was still at large Sunday night, many minority  
students in Bloomington expressed fear over the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	One black student, Joel Ligue, 22, who is from the Ivory Coast,  
was sitting on a lawn in front of his dorm waiting for the 
fireworks display to begin at the football stadium several blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a scared person,'' he said. ``I'm too scared to go to the  
fireworks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Jewish victims of Friday's shootings said he is used  
to being stared at by people unfamiliar with his faith, but he saw 
something more unnerving in the eyes of the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the sense he was enjoying himself,'' the man told the  
Chicago Sun-Times from his hospital bed. ``He had this predator 
look to him. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old man asked that his name not be used for fear of  
retribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Another hospitalized victim, Gideon Sapir, 34, said he was a  
former captain in the Israeli army and found it ironic that he was 
shot while walking home from a synagogue in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (the gunman) didn't say anything, and I had no opportunity  
to see him,'' Sapir told Israeli Army radio. ``I wasn't trying to 
see who it was, I was trying to get out of the line of fire and 
protect my children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the shots were fired from inside a light blue Fort  
Taurus that stopped in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pushed down my son who was near me, I turned around and lay  
down on top of him,'' Sapir said. ``Apparently as I was turning 
around, I was hit by a bullet.''

<HEADLINE>  Czech Sets Decathlon World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Tomas Dvorak wasn't completely  
satisfied after breaking Dan O'Brien's world decathlon record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech star was upset by a costly mistake in the final  
1,500-meter event Sunday that left him just short of the ``magical 
barrier'' of 9,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a couple of points and I would have had 9,000, but at  
least I'll have some motivation for next time,'' Dvorak said after 
competing in 90-degree weather at Strahov stadium. ``The conditions 
were exceptionally good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In smashing O'Brien's mark by 103 points with 8,994 points in  
the European Cup event, Dvorak had a legitimate shot at becoming 
the first decathlete to accumulate 9,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He needed to run the 1,500 in 4 minutes, 36.34 seconds, more  
than six seconds slower than his best of 4:29.69. To tie O'Brien's 
record, Dvorak needed to run a comfortable 4:53.87. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished in 4:37.20 after making a mistake in the second lap.  
</P>
<P>
	``We slowed down a bit and we got punished,'' Dvorak said. ``I  
had enough power in the last lap, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had performed beyond 9,000 points, I would have had a  
message for O'Brien, but now it's better to shut up,'' Dvorak 
added, sipping champagne. ``I will take a week off now and then 
prepare for the World Championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien set the previous record of 8,891 in 1992 at Talence,  
France, after failing to qualify for the U.S. team for the 
Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak, 27, had a previous best of 8,837 points in his 1997  
World Championship victory in Athens, Greece. He was the bronze 
medalist in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak was 75 points behind O'Brien's record pace after the  
first five events Saturday. The Czech star set three personal bests 
Saturday, with a time of 10.54 seconds in the 100 meters and marks 
of 25 feet, 11 inches in the long jump and 55-0 in the shot put. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cleared 6-8 1/4 in the high jump and ran the 400 in 48.08  
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Dvorak won the 110 hurdles in 13.73 seconds and had  
personal bests of 158-6 1/2 in the discus and 237-3 in the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
	After clearing 16-0 3/4 in the pole vault, Dvorak was still 76  
points behind O'Brien's pace. The Czech star passed up three 
attempts at 16-4 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saved my energy for the javelin,'' said Dvorak, who earned  
925 points for the strong javelin effort to move 72 points ahead of 
O'Brien's record pace entering the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic won the men's European Cup combined event  
with 25,375 points, ahead of Germany and Spain. Russia won the 
women's title with 18,625 points, ahead of France and Poland.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Gives Bounce to Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Tennis has some zip again.  
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon, like the French Open a month ago, injected new life  
into the sport when it needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
	The All England Club provided the stage for the coronation of a  
new female champion (Lindsay Davenport), the farewell of an old 
champ (Steffi Graf) and the emergence of potential future champs 
(Alexandra Stevenson, Jelena Dokic and Mirjana Lucic). 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon also confirmed the untouchable grass-court mastery of  
Pete Sampras, as well as the remarkable renaissance of Andre 
Agassi, who energizes the men's game like no other player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andre brings out the best in me,'' Sampras said after blasting  
Agassi in straight sets Sunday for his sixth Wimbledon crown. ``He 
elevates my game to a level that is phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phenomenal sums up Sampras' 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 victory, a virtuoso  
display of serving, volleying and shotmaking that was arguably the 
best performance ever on Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Renshaw is the only man with more Wimbledon titles  
(seven), and that was back in the 1880s. At 27 years old, Sampras 
looks certain to surpass that record as well as the mark for total 
Grand Slam championships (12), which he now shares with Roy 
Emerson. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many more times Sampras can win Wimbledon, Agassi  
said, ``For the next four years -- as many times as he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras will be chasing the Grand Slam record two months from  
now at the U.S. Open, a tournament he has won four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to do it where it all started for me in 1990,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sampras is the best player ever to pick up a racket at  
Wimbledon, there is still debate whether he's the greatest ever, 
period. Sampras has never won the French Open, or even reached the 
final of the clay court classic. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Sampras' idol, Rod Laver, won the French twice.  
Bjorn Borg did it six times. And Agassi won the French four weeks 
ago to become only the fifth man in history to win all four Grand 
Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Open is the toughest test in tennis, where baseline  
play and physical stamina are the key ingredients. Neither is 
Sampras' strong point. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the lawns of Wimbledon, where the rallies are few and the  
serve-and-volley dominates, Sampras is invincible. He's slightly 
less omnipotent on the hard courts of Flushing Meadow, where the 
higher bounce gives players like Agassi a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want another shot at him and I want another shot at him this  
summer,'' Agassi said. ``I want another shot at him in the finals 
of the U.S. Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men's tennis suffered in recent years from a shortage of  
personalities and a lack of a compelling rivalry. Now, with Agassi 
back at the top after climbing back from No. 141, he could provide 
Sampras with the foil he needs. 
</P>
<P>
	But can they maintain a long-running rivalry matching Borg vs.  
McEnroe and McEnroe vs. Connors? 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's the start,'' Sampras said, ``but it's difficult to  
have a consistent rivalry because the game is so strong today. It's 
really hard to have two or three guys playing each other all year 
round. The game is not like it was 15 years ago when the top four 
were so much better than everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, who has finished the year at No. 1 for a record six  
years in a row, fell to No. 2 behind Agassi in the new rankings 
released Monday. But Sampras has other priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game for me right now is to do well at the majors,'' he  
said. ``Grand Slams are always going to be the reason why I'm going 
to be playing this game in my early to mid-30s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, in what sounds like wishful thinking, thinks Sampras'  
move from Florida to California may wind up cutting his career 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a hunch L.A. will break him down before his body  
does,'' Agassi said. ``If he starts getting comfortable on the 
lifestyle and changes his priorities, it's different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Living in California hasn't hurt Davenport, who punished Graf  
6-4, 7-5, in the women's final, adding the Wimbledon title to the 
U.S. Open championship she won last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The match marked the end of seven-time champion Graf's Wimbledon  
career. But it marked a breakthrough for Davenport, who had always 
struggled on grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at someone like Lindsay as inspirational,'' McEnroe  
said. ``We had Andre at the French, and he lifted the spirits of 
the tennis world. But to see somebody like Lindsay, who wasn't 
known as the best athlete, shows you can do it the old-fashioned 
way: hard work, dedication, love for your sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport was virtually overlooked throughout the tournament as  
the spotlight fell on younger, more glamorous players such as Venus 
Williams and Anna Kournikova. 
</P>
<P>
	The down-to-earth Davenport has never courted publicity or  
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the greatest thing to get attention for winning  
tournaments, and for being a good person and for being normal,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of attention was paid to Stevenson, the 18-year-old  
American who became the first player in Wimbledon history to come 
out of the qualifying rounds to reach the women's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that, the world learned that Stevenson's father is  
basketball great Julius Erving. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson wasn't the only new face. Dokic, a 16-year-old  
qualifier, stunned No. 1 Martina Hingis in the first round before 
losing to Stevenson in the quarters. And Lucic, the 17-year-old 
Croat, pushed Graf to three sets in the semis. 
</P>
<P>
	After some lean times, tennis should have plenty of storylines  
to follow in the months and years to come.

<HEADLINE> Scurry: Wall-to-Wall Goalkeeper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Brazil's sharpshooters and China's  
precisionists don't scare Briana Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, she practices against the best front line in the  
world, so why worry during games? 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans have had little to worry about in front of their  
goal during the Women's World Cup. They've yielded only three 
scores on their way to the finals, one a ball they put into their 
own net. 
</P>
<P>
	While there have been enough breakdowns by defenders and  
midfielders to concern coach Tony DiCicco, he doesn't have the same 
anxiety about his goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a former goalie and a goalie coach, I can really appreciate  
what Bri does,'' DiCicco said as his team began preparations for 
Saturday's final against China. ``She challenges shooters, she 
plays the angles well, she knows where to be. And she's a leader on 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a team that has a lot of scoring ability and presses  
the attack, and having her back there gives us the freedom to that. 
I can't say enough about her or how much confidence we have in 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry has three shutouts in this tournament and 52 for her  
career. She joined the national team in 1994 and a year later was 
the No. 1 keeper as the Americans finished third in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	She backstopped the United States to the gold medal at the 1996  
Olympics, making headlines not for her habit of undressing 
shooters, but for her promise to streak through the streets of 
Athens, Ga., if the team won. It did, and off she went. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this World Cup, some pointed to Scurry and the defense as  
being suspect. While the backline has made several errors, Scurry 
has been solid. Or, as her teammates call her, ``The Wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We as defenders are going to make mistakes,'' U.S. captain  
Carla Overbeck said. ``Knowing that Bri is back there makes all the 
difference ... Bri is a calming force. She is extremely athletic. 
She's very dependable. She's the best keeper in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scurry laughs when she hears such praise. But when the  
27-year-old goalie from Dayton, Minn., plays as she did in the 
semifinals -- six saves, most on difficult shots -- Scurry probably 
deserves such adulation 
</P>
<P>
	``The best?'' she asked. ``People say that? When I play well, I  
am, when I don't, I'm not. I don't know. It might be true. I'm on 
the best team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps. The Chinese are 2-1 against the Americans and have  
looked sensational in the World Cup. They will provide the final 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans are confident their wall can match up with China's  
Great Wall, goalie Gao Hong. And that Scurry can handle China's 
best finishers, Sun Wen and Liu Ailing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Scurry works out every day against some formidable players,  
stopping shots by Mia Hamm, Michelle Akers and Shannon MacMillan. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why I don't let things bother me in a game,'' she said.  
``The pressure they put on a goalie in practice is great 
preparation. When you've practiced against them, the game is 
actually easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Scurry enjoyed a hard day's work, right?  
</P>
<P>
	``Nah, that's not good to me,'' she said. ``I'd rather have a  
boring game. I'd rather not have any shots to stop.''

<HEADLINE> Singapore OKs Home Tech Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore has changed its regulations to allow  
high-tech entrepreneurs to set up businesses in their homes, the 
government announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of Singapore's ``technopreneurship'' drive to  
make the city-state an information technology hotbed like Silicon 
Valley in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``These home offices could be the equivalent of home garages in  
the United States that have spawned many high-tech enterprises, 
like Apple Computer,'' the government said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Singapore's 3.2 million people live in high-rise public  
housing blocks, which previously were subject to strict bans on 
commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
	Would-be entrepreneurs now may apply to the National Science and  
Technology Board for permission to set up companies in their homes, 
the board said in the statement, which was issued jointly with the 
Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Housing and Development 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The businesses' main activity should be related to information  
technology, integrated circuit design, Internet software or a 
similar field, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore earlier this year announced plans to set up a $1  
billion venture capital fund to boost high-tech development. 
</P>
<P>
	The wealthy island republic is Southeast Asia's most highly  
developed country and enjoys one of the world's highest standards 
of living. The government has recently been pushing computer 
technology and electronic commerce as ways to make the country more 
competitive.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Boat Crash Death Toll at Five </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Two more boat crash victims found; officials call off search    	
</P>
<P>
	BAYPORT, Minn. (AP) -- The death toll from a weekend boating  
accident rose to five Monday as divers pulled two more bodies from 
the murky St. Croix River. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities called off the search for more victims, saying all  
five people reported missing after Saturday's collision have been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses earlier had said as many as nine people may have been  
aboard the two pleasure boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies found Monday included those of two 26-year-old men.  
The three other confirmed victims, all men in their early 30s, were 
found on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both boats apparently were traveling in approximately the same  
direction toward Hudson, Wis., when they collided shortly after 1 
a.m. on Saturday.

<HEADLINE>  Czech Sets Decathlon World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Tomas Dvorak wasn't completely  
satisfied after breaking Dan O'Brien's world decathlon record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech star was upset by a costly mistake in the final  
1,500-meter event Sunday that left him just short of the ``magical 
barrier'' of 9,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a couple of points and I would have had 9,000, but at  
least I'll have some motivation for next time,'' Dvorak said after 
competing in 90-degree weather at Strahov stadium. ``The conditions 
were exceptionally good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In smashing O'Brien's mark by 103 points with 8,994 points in  
the European Cup event, Dvorak had a legitimate shot at becoming 
the first decathlete to accumulate 9,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He needed to run the 1,500 in 4 minutes, 36.34 seconds, more  
than six seconds slower than his best of 4:29.69. To tie O'Brien's 
record, Dvorak needed to run a comfortable 4:53.87. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished in 4:37.20 after making a mistake in the second lap.  
</P>
<P>
	``We slowed down a bit and we got punished,'' Dvorak said. ``I  
had enough power in the last lap, but it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had performed beyond 9,000 points, I would have had a  
message for O'Brien, but now it's better to shut up,'' Dvorak 
added, sipping champagne. ``I will take a week off now and then 
prepare for the World Championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien set the previous record of 8,891 in 1992 at Talence,  
France, after failing to qualify for the U.S. team for the 
Barcelona Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak, 27, had a previous best of 8,837 points in his 1997  
World Championship victory in Athens, Greece. He was the bronze 
medalist in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak was 75 points behind O'Brien's record pace after the  
first five events Saturday. The Czech star set three personal bests 
Saturday, with a time of 10.54 seconds in the 100 meters and marks 
of 25 feet, 11 inches in the long jump and 55-0 in the shot put. 
</P>
<P>
	He also cleared 6-8 1/4 in the high jump and ran the 400 in 48.08  
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Dvorak won the 110 hurdles in 13.73 seconds and had  
personal bests of 158-6 1/2 in the discus and 237-3 in the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
	After clearing 16-0 3/4 in the pole vault, Dvorak was still 76  
points behind O'Brien's pace. The Czech star passed up three 
attempts at 16-4 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saved my energy for the javelin,'' said Dvorak, who earned  
925 points for the strong javelin effort to move 72 points ahead of 
O'Brien's record pace entering the 1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic won the men's European Cup combined event  
with 25,375 points, ahead of Germany and Spain. Russia won the 
women's title with 18,625 points, ahead of France and Poland.

	East Swelters in Hot, Muggy Weather  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Record heat and sticky, humid air enveloped the  
eastern third of the nation today. Temperature records started 
falling a few minutes after noon, with Portland, Maine, reaching 
94. Raleigh-Durham, N.C., hit 102. New York City and Atlantic City, 
N.J., rose to a record 101. In separate holiday weekend incidents, 
two young children -- one in Omaha, Neb., another in Masontown, Pa. 
-- died of heat exposure.

	Ecuador Taxi Strike Causes Emergency  
</P>
<P>
	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador declared a state of emergency  
today after striking taxi drivers blocked traffic in major cities 
to protest gas price increases. Police detained 43 drivers who had 
formed blockades in the cities of Quito and Guayaquil, snarling 
traffic and forcing thousands of people to wait for the few buses 
that circulated. The strike comes as this poor South American 
nation of 12 million people faces its worst economic crisis in 
decades.

	Suicide Bomber Injures 17 in Turkey  
</P>
<P>
	ADANA, Turkey (AP) -- A 19-year-old Kurdish woman flashed the  
``V'' for victory sign today before detonating bombs strapped to 
her body outside a Turkish police station, killing herself and 
injuring 17 people. It was the third major attack blamed on Kurdish 
guerrillas since a Turkish court sentenced Kurdish rebel leader 
Abdullah Ocalan to death June 29 for treason and separatism. The 
assailant was identified as Rusen Tabanci. The Anatolia news agency 
said she was a Kurdish rebel wanted by security forces.

	Blair Pushes Northern Ireland Plan  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- British Prime Minister Tony  
Blair appealed to Northern Ireland's major Protestant party today 
to back his plan to rescue the troubled peace accord and accept 
Sinn Fein as government partners. Amid rising political tensions, a 
Protestant mob clashed with police in the main Catholic district of 
Portadown early Tuesday. There were no immediate reports of serious 
injury.

	Minn. Boat Crash Death Toll at Five  
</P>
<P>
	BAYPORT, Minn. (AP) -- The death toll from a weekend boating  
accident rose to five as divers pulled two more bodies from the 
murky St. Croix River. The bodies were those of two 26-year-old 
men. The three other confirmed victims, all men in their early 30s, 
were found on Saturday and Sunday. The two pleasure boats 
apparently were traveling in approximately the same direction 
toward Hudson, Wis., when they collided shortly after 1 a.m. on 
Saturday.

	Motive Sought in Shooting Spree  
</P>
<P>
	SALEM, Ill. (AP) -- Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, targeted  
minorities in an shooting spree that killed two and injured at 
least eight others before killing himself, investigators said. But 
authorities and acquaintances wondered Monday what would drive a 
rich kid -- described as hateful but publicly reserved and even 
``very polite'' -- to go on such a two-state shooting attack. 

</P>
<P>
	Hopes High for Cystic Fibrosis Drug  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Studies of three drugs called ``gene assist  
therapies'' are in the early stages of an experiment to see if they 
will attack the cause of deadly cystic fibrosis rather than just 
treat its symptoms. If they work, patients could expect more normal 
lives by using a daily medicine to control the genetic defect that 
causes cystic fibrosis, which attacks patients' lungs with a thick 
mucus.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Will Smith's ``Wild Wild West'' roped in  
about $36.8 million in movie ticket sales over the Fourth of July 
holiday weekend. ``Big Daddy'' with Adam Sandler came in second at 
the weekend box office, while ``Tarzan'' was third. The ``South 
Park'' feature opened to a respectable $14.8 million in fourth 
despite tougher enforcement of the R rating, which limited the 
audience.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On the hottest day of the season, Brian McRae  
pushed home the go-ahead run with a double-play grounder in the 
eighth inning, and the New York Mets beat Montreal 2-1. New York, 
which has come from behind in seven of its last nine victories, is 
still struggling at the plate. Still, the Mets have won 20 of their 
last 28, including 10 of 13 at home. Montreal has lost four 
straight and nine of 12.

<HEADLINE> New Stars Emerge at Wimbeldon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Wimbledon had all its usual traditions  
-- rained out days, long lines of people waiting for tickets, Pete 
Sampras winning again. 
</P>
<P>
	And the stately All England Club this year also showcased  
another new group of young talented women. 
</P>
<P>
	Two qualifiers -- 18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson and 16-year-old  
Jelena Dokic -- emerged from virtual obscurity to make their mark 
and reach the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, amid a storm of publicity about the identity of her  
father and her mother's allegations of racism and lesbianism, got 
to the semis by beating Dokic, who had stunned everyone by ousting 
No. 1 Marina Hingis in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, whose father is basketball great Julius Erving,  
crumbled 6-1, 6-1 in the semis to the eventual titlist, Lindsay 
Davenport. But the 6-foot-1 American showed she has the power game 
to be a major force on the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirjana Lucic, a 17-year-old from Croatia, also made it to the  
semis, but lost to Steffi Graf after taking the first set. Now 
living in Florida, Lucic has escaped from a stormy relationship 
with her father and has recaptured the amazing form she showed in 
1997 when she won her first tournament after turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Venus Williams, now 19, underlined her own potential by ousting  
Anna Kournikova and gaining the quarters, only to lose to Graf in 
probably the highest quality match of the women's championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hingis went out in the first round, Wimbledons of the  
near future could very likely be dominated by the young Swiss star, 
Davenport, Williams, Stevenson, Dokic, Lucic and maybe Kournikova. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of the newcomers coincided with the departure of two  
old favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	Boris Becker had already announced it would be his last  
Wimbledon, but he didn't go quietly. The three-time titlist, who 
last won in 1989 and is now playing on a part-time basis, powered 
through three rounds before losing to second-seeded Rat Rafter to 
take one more final standing ovation, including from the Royal Box. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's departure was a little less grand, mainly because she  
only announced it after she had lost 6-4, 7-5 in the women's final 
to Lindsay Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old German, who had won seven titles and came here  
on the back of a French Open triumph a month ago, said she wouldn't 
be returning. She said that at Roland Garros, too, and organizers 
of the U.S. Open, which takes place in late August-early September, 
are awaiting further word from a player who has won 22 Grand Slam 
singles titles and is two short of Margaret Court's record. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Becker and Graf next year, Wimbledon certainly will seem  
different. 
</P>
<P>
	But, while the women's title seemingly has several leading  
contenders, who is strong enough to take the men's championship 
from Sampras? 
</P>
<P>
	By beating Agassi on Sunday, the 27-year-old Californian has won  
six titles in seven years, and his latest performance was probably 
his best. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sampras, especially on grass, is getting better, what chance  
do his rivals have? 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Henman, rated by Sampras as a future Wimbledon champion,  
took the first set off the defending titlist, but his game deflated 
under the pressure of the big-serving world No. 1 and he lost to 
the American in the semifinal for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Philippoussis also took the first set against Sampras in  
the quarters but was forced to withdraw with a knee injury early in 
the second, so his chances of beating the American can't be judged. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Rafter, the second-seeded Australian, was outplayed by  
Agassi in the semifinal and didn't get to face Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	However much they all fancy their chances, Sampras shows no sign  
of giving up his title and certainly has no plans to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game to me right now is to do well at the majors,'' he  
said. ``Grand Slams are so much more at stake than being No. 1, and 
I feel I've done that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grand Slams are always going to be playing this game in my  
early to mid-30s, whenever I call it a day.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect in Shooting Spree Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ill. (AP) -- A white supremacist suspected of targeting  
minorities in a deadly two-state drive-by shooting spree committed 
suicide by shooting himself three times as officers pursued him. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, led officers on a slow-speed  
pursuit late Sunday after he ditched his blue Ford Taurus and 
carjacked a minivan at gunpoint at a gas station in the southern 
Illinois town of Ina, Marion County Sheriff Gerald L. Benjamin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman who was driving the minivan and her 13-year-old  
daughter escaped without injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after entering Salem, about 35 miles north of Ina, Smith  
shot himself under the chin. The minivan then went off the left 
side of the road and hit a small, abandoned building, causing the 
air bag to inflate. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith refused officers' orders to put his hands up, so several  
entered the van. As he struggled with five sheriff's deputies and 
police officers who tried to subdue him, Smith shot himself in the 
chest and leg. None of the officers fired and Smith didn't appear 
to shoot at them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was still combative even after being handcuffed and put in an  
ambulance but said nothing, police said. He bled to death from the 
chest wound a short time later in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over,'' Benjamin said. ``I feel sorry for his  
parents and the victims and their relatives. I don't know what 
caused this but it's very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had been heading toward a crowd of about 2,000 people  
gathered two miles down the road for Independence Day festivities. 
``Our main target was to get him stopped before he got there, but 
fortunately he did that for us,'' Deputy Todd Garden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed during the drive-by spree, including  
former Northwestern University men's basketball coach Ricky 
Byrdsong, who was black, and a Korean student in Bloomington, Ind. 
At least eight others were wounded, one seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they believed Smith began his drive-by killing  
spree in Chicago on Friday by wounding six Orthodox Jews leaving 
synagogue. Within an hour, Byrdsong was shot to death in nearby 
Skokie and two Asian-Americans were shot at, but not hit, while 
driving in Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter also fired at Asians and blacks in two Illinois  
cities on Saturday, seriously wounding one man, before the 
Bloomington shooting on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities also believe the gunman also wounded a black  
minister in Decatur, Ill., on Saturday, but they were waiting for 
ballistics tests to confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
	A .22-caliber handgun and a .380-caliber handgun found with  
Smith were consistent with the guns used in the shootings. 
Authorities were trying to trace the source of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a member of the World Church of the Creator, a  
white-supremacist organization, and distributed anti-minority and 
anti-Semitic literature while a student at Indiana University in 
Bloomington.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Raps Southern Africa on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURBAN, South Africa (AP) -- A U.S. deputy secretary of commerce  
on Monday chided southern African countries for balking at economic 
cooperation. His remarks drew a rebuke from South Africa's trade 
minister, who called for more debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. official, Robert Mallett, told an economic conference  
that members of the Southern African Development Community should 
integrate their economic and trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The global economy is here. And unlike Europe you don't have  
40 years to get your act together,'' Mallett said at an economic 
conference sponsored by the Swiss-based World Economic Forum, a 
non-governmental group that fosters business cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallett said that unless there is a ``clear cohesion between  
private and public sectors'' to overcome the gridlock on economic 
integration, investors will perceive Africa as ``just not ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's trade and industry minister, Alec Irwin,  
responded that Mallett's ``bravado doesn't help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He argued that the region's countries were grappling with  
emergence from colonial rule and that liberalizing trade rules 
would take time. He also said that many governments were burdened 
with heavy debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
	This, he said, could be overcome by a comprehensive debt relief  
program from the Group of Seven richest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the G7 to be cautious on debt (relief) is criminal,''  
Irwin added. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14 nations in the southern African grouping have for years  
tried to reduce tariff barriers, ease customs red tape, improve 
transportation and promote foreign investment, with little success. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem is that South Africa, which has concluded its own  
trade pact with the European Union, has an economy that is 10 times 
that of the other 13 members combined. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 800 political and business leaders are attending the  
conference, which aims to foster economic growth in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp. said  
it will launch a $350 million investment fund aimed at improving 
the telecommunications, utilities and transportation in southern 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	OPIC President George Munoz said he hoped the fund would attract  
a further $650 million from investors in the region.

<HEADLINE>  Fireworks, Heat Mark East's Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands watched along the city's riverfront as  
splashes of stunning fireworks dotted the sky, capping a day of 
free concerts, foot races and enveloping summer heat throughout the 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York crowd turned Manhattan's FDR Drive into a giant,  
paved viewing stage, dragging coolers and lawn chairs onto the 
normally bustling roadway to snag the show's best views. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 52 tons of fireworks exploded over the East River in  
celebration of the nation's 223rd birthday. ``It's exciting to come 
here to see the big fireworks,'' said an awed Rachel Laing, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the nation, there was something else that awed  
Independence Day revelers -- the heat. Parades, fireworks and 
backyard barbecues all came with a furnace-like dose of brow-wiping 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	In humid Boston, a crowd of 500,000 watched Boston Symphony  
Orchestra Music Director Seiji Ozawa conduct Tchaikovsky's ``1812 
Overture'' while cannons boomed and fireworks lit the Charles 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	During a choral performance, U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
read words composed in 1963 by his late brother, President John F. 
Kennedy. ``Our most basic common link is that we inhabit this small 
planet,'' he told the cheering, jubilant crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fort Dix, N.J., less than 500 ethnic Albanian refugees  
remained to celebrate their last weekend in a resettlement village. 
The village, designed for those who fled Kosovo, is scheduled to 
close within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were urged to stay cool in Philadelphia as the heat  
index rose to 110 degrees, the National Weather Service said. Early 
in the day, 112 people born on Independence Day since 1900 gathered 
for a ``Photo of the Century'' in front of Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia roasted under record-breaking heat, with a new Fourth  
of July high of 97 degrees at Dulles International Airport. On the 
west lawn of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello in Charlottesville, 87 
people were sworn in during traditional naturalization ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time  
to decide to be a U.S. citizen,'' said Carmen Aguilar, a native of 
Venezuela. ``This is the very best decision of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbecuers also braved temperatures in the mid-90s in Michigan,  
where National Weather Service forecaster Fred Keyes found hope in 
cool front projected to arrive Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could cool us -- cool, that's a relative word, isn't it? --  
into the 80s,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The South wasn't much cooler. In Atlanta, 82-degree heat  
blanketed paradegoers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we leave here without passing out, we're going to rest at  
home before going to see some fireworks,'' said Deborah Anderson as 
she watched festivities with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	In Augusta, Ga., about 50 people saluted hundreds of tattered  
and faded old American flags before dousing them in kerosene and 
setting them ablaze, the method recommended for destroying old 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaches were packed from Maine to Miami. An estimated 200,000  
sun worshippers crammed into Los Angeles to bask atop the Southern 
California sand. 
</P>
<P>
	Festivities in the City of Angels also included a convention by  
Mensa, the national high-IQ group, and a music festival by L.A. 
Friends of Tibet, a group advocating liberation of the 
Chinese-occupied nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone who didn't get much time off this holiday weekend was  
Bill Ronayne, owner of West Brandywine Valley Heating &AMP; Air 
Conditioning of West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone's ringing off the hook,'' Ronayne said. Residents  
with ailing air conditioners, Ronayne said, ``want their cooling 
back on, and they want it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still others decided to do the unthinkable: They went running.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of New Yorkers took part in a charity run through  
Central Park -- on a day where the city's heat index hit 111 
degrees. Barbecues and outdoor concerts followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have air conditioning in my apartment, so this is just  
as good,'' said Shirley Hawn, 40, of Manhattan, while she sat in a 
folding chair fanning herself.

	More than 52 tons of fireworks exploded over the East River in  
celebration of the nation's 223rd birthday. ``It's exciting to come 
here to see the big fireworks,'' said an awed Rachel Laing, 10. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the nation, there was something else that awed  
Independence Day revelers -- the heat. Parades, fireworks and 
backyard barbecues all came with a furnace-like dose of brow-wiping 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	In humid Boston, a crowd of 500,000 watched Boston Symphony  
Orchestra Music Director Seiji Ozawa conduct Tchaikovsky's ``1812 
Overture'' while cannons boomed and fireworks lit the Charles 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	During a choral performance, U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
read words composed in 1963 by his late brother, President John F. 
Kennedy. ``Our most basic common link is that we inhabit this small 
planet,'' he told the cheering, jubilant crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fort Dix, N.J., less than 500 ethnic Albanian refugees  
remained to celebrate their last weekend in a resettlement village. 
The village, designed for those who fled Kosovo, is scheduled to 
close within a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were urged to stay cool in Philadelphia as the heat  
index rose to 110 degrees, the National Weather Service said. Early 
in the day, 112 people born on Independence Day since 1900 gathered 
for a ``Photo of the Century'' in front of Independence Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia roasted under record-breaking heat, with a new Fourth  
of July high of 97 degrees at Dulles International Airport. On the 
west lawn of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello in Charlottesville, 87 
people were sworn in during traditional naturalization ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived in the United States for 19 years and I took time  
to decide to be a U.S. citizen,'' said Carmen Aguilar, a native of 
Venezuela. ``This is the very best decision of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbecuers also braved temperatures in the mid-90s in Michigan,  
where National Weather Service forecaster Fred Keyes found hope in 
cool front projected to arrive Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That could cool us -- cool, that's a relative word, isn't it? --  
into the 80s,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The South wasn't much cooler. In Atlanta, 82-degree heat  
blanketed paradegoers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we leave here without passing out, we're going to rest at  
home before going to see some fireworks,'' said Deborah Anderson as 
she watched festivities with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	In Augusta, Ga., about 50 people saluted hundreds of tattered  
and faded old American flags before dousing them in kerosene and 
setting them ablaze, the method recommended for destroying old 
flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaches were packed from Maine to Miami. An estimated 200,000  
sun worshippers crammed into Los Angeles to bask atop the Southern 
California sand. 
</P>
<P>
	Festivities in the City of Angels also included a convention by  
Mensa, the national high-IQ group, and a music festival by L.A. 
Friends of Tibet, a group advocating liberation of the 
Chinese-occupied nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone who didn't get much time off this holiday weekend was  
Bill Ronayne, owner of West Brandywine Valley Heating &AMP; Air 
Conditioning of West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``The phone's ringing off the hook,'' Ronayne said. Residents  
with ailing air conditioners, Ronayne said, ``want their cooling 
back on, and they want it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still others decided to do the unthinkable: They went running.  
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of New Yorkers took part in a charity run through  
Central Park -- on a day where the city's heat index hit 111 
degrees. Barbecues and outdoor concerts followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have air conditioning in my apartment, so this is just  
as good,'' said Shirley Hawn, 40, of Manhattan, while she sat in a

<HEADLINE>  Wimbledon Gives Tennis a Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Tennis has some zip again.  
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon, like the French Open a month ago, injected new life  
into the sport when it needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
	The All England Club provided the stage for the coronation of a  
new female champion (Lindsay Davenport), the farewell of an old 
champ (Steffi Graf) and the emergence of potential future champs 
(Alexandra Stevenson, Jelena Dokic and Mirjana Lucic). 
</P>
<P>
	Wimbledon also confirmed the untouchable grass-court mastery of  
Pete Sampras, as well as the remarkable renaissance of Andre 
Agassi, who energizes the men's game like no other player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Andre brings out the best in me,'' Sampras said after blasting  
Agassi in straight sets Sunday for his sixth Wimbledon crown. ``He 
elevates my game to a level that is phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phenomenal sums up Sampras' 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 victory, a virtuoso  
display of serving, volleying and shotmaking that was arguably the 
best performance ever on Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie Renshaw is the only man with more Wimbledon titles  
(seven), and that was back in the 1880s. At 27 years old, Sampras 
looks certain to surpass that record as well as the mark for total 
Grand Slam championships (12), which he now shares with Roy 
Emerson. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how many more times Sampras can win Wimbledon, Agassi  
said, ``For the next four years -- as many times as he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras will be chasing the Grand Slam record two months from  
now at the U.S. Open, a tournament he has won four times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to do it where it all started for me in 1990,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sampras is the best player ever to pick up a racket at  
Wimbledon, there is still debate whether he's the greatest ever, 
period. Sampras has never won the French Open, or even reached the 
final of the clay court classic. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, Sampras' idol, Rod Laver, won the French twice.  
Bjorn Borg did it six times. And Agassi won the French four weeks 
ago to become only the fifth man in history to win all four Grand 
Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Open is the toughest test in tennis, where baseline  
play and physical stamina are the key ingredients. Neither is 
Sampras' strong point. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the lawns of Wimbledon, where the rallies are few and the  
serve-and-volley dominates, Sampras is invincible. He's slightly 
less omnipotent on the hard courts of Flushing Meadow, where the 
higher bounce gives players like Agassi a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want another shot at him and I want another shot at him this  
summer,'' Agassi said. ``I want another shot at him in the finals 
of the U.S. Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Men's tennis suffered in recent years from a shortage of  
personalities and a lack of a compelling rivalry. Now, with Agassi 
back at the top after climbing back from No. 141, he could provide 
Sampras with the foil he needs. 
</P>
<P>
	But can they maintain a long-running rivalry matching Borg vs.  
McEnroe and McEnroe vs. Connors? 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's the start,'' Sampras said, ``but it's difficult to  
have a consistent rivalry because the game is so strong today. It's 
really hard to have two or three guys playing each other all year 
round. The game is not like it was 15 years ago when the top four 
were so much better than everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, who has finished the year at No. 1 for a record six  
years in a row, fell to No. 3 behind Agassi and Australia's Patrick 
Rafter in the new rankings released Monday. But Sampras has other 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game for me right now is to do well at the majors,'' he  
said. ``Grand Slams are always going to be the reason why I'm going 
to be playing this game in my early to mid-30s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agassi, in what sounds like wishful thinking, thinks Sampras'  
move from Florida to California may wind up cutting his career 
short. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a hunch L.A. will break him down before his body  
does,'' Agassi said. ``If he starts getting comfortable on the 
lifestyle and changes his priorities, it's different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Living in California hasn't hurt Davenport, who punished Graf  
6-4, 7-5, in the women's final, adding the Wimbledon title to the 
U.S. Open championship she won last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The match marked the end of seven-time champion Graf's Wimbledon  
career. But it marked a breakthrough for Davenport, who had always 
struggled on grass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at someone like Lindsay as inspirational,'' McEnroe  
said. ``We had Andre at the French, and he lifted the spirits of 
the tennis world. But to see somebody like Lindsay, who wasn't 
known as the best athlete, shows you can do it the old-fashioned 
way: hard work, dedication, love for your sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport was virtually overlooked throughout the tournament as  
the spotlight fell on younger, more glamorous players such as Venus 
Williams and Anna Kournikova. 
</P>
<P>
	The down-to-earth Davenport has never courted publicity or  
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's the greatest thing to get attention for winning  
tournaments, and for being a good person and for being normal,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of attention was paid to Stevenson, the 18-year-old  
American who became the first player in Wimbledon history to come 
out of the qualifying rounds to reach the women's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that, the world learned that Stevenson's father is  
basketball great Julius Erving. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson wasn't the only new face. Dokic, a 16-year-old  
qualifier, stunned No. 1 Martina Hingis in the first round before 
losing to Stevenson in the quarters. And Lucic, the 17-year-old 
Croat, pushed Graf to three sets in the semis. 
</P>
<P>
	After some lean times, tennis should have plenty of storylines  
to follow in the months and years to come.

<HEADLINE>  Steels Wins Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-NAZAIRE, France (AP) -- Ocean crossings can be treacherous.  
</P>
<P>
	Just ask a few top riders at the Tour de France, who stayed too  
far behind the pack during Monday's second stage and lost precious 
minutes when they got caught behind a crash on a narrow ocean 
causeway. 
</P>
<P>
	Tour officials no doubt included the Passage du Gois, which  
connects a small island to the mainland in the coastal Atlantic 
Vendee region, on the itinerary because it is quaint and 
picturesque. 
</P>
<P>
	But the causeway, which is submerged by water at high tide and  
only open part of the day, didn't seem so quaint for Alex Zulle, 
Michael Boogerd and Ivan Gotti, who never caught up to a group of 
50 or so riders that broke away from the pack after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	It also wasn't friendly to American Jonathan Vaughters of the  
U.S. Postal Service team, who fractured his chin in the crash and 
had to retire from the race. Marc Wauters also abandoned with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was won in a final sprint by Tom Steels of Belgium,  
and the second-place finisher was Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia, who 
took over the yellow jersey from Lance Armstrong because of bonus 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong remained in second place overall, and in excellent  
position to come on strong in the areas where he excels: a time 
trial on Sunday, and the later mountain climbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to stay out of trouble until the real race begins  
on Sunday with the time trial,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	In third and fourth place were sprinter Mario Cipollini of Italy  
and Germany's Erik Zabel. 
</P>
<P>
	The pivotal crash at the Passage du Gois wasn't even the first  
of the day; an earlier mishap at 21 miles involved 30 riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of vacationers lined the roads all through the  
109-mile stage, which came at the beginning of many French people's 
summer holiday. Many set up folding chairs and elaborate picnic 
tables along the road, or leaned out of balconies in small villages 
to join in the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the occasional anti-doping banner -- ``Say No to EPO''  
-- many fans showed support for French cycling star Richard 
Virenque, under formal investigation for doping during last year's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allez Richard -- We Forgive You,'' said one banner held by two  
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a two-time Olympic cyclist, is now a favorite. The  
Texan won the 1993 World Championship and competed for the U.S. 
Olympic team in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that  
had spread to his lungs and brain. He underwent surgery to remove 
his right testicle and lesions from his brain, and returned to 
racing early last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday that he thought the doping scandal was  
``exaggerated and overblown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think that nobody here has anything to hide,'' he  
said in an interview, complaining of over-aggressive tactics during 
last year's drug busts by French police.

<P>
	SAINT-NAZAIRE, France (AP) -- With some top riders caught behind  
a crash on an ocean causeway, Tom Steels of Belgium won the second 
stage of the Tour de France on Monday and Lance Armstrong of Texas 
lost the overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American, Jonathan Vaughters, fractured his chin in the  
crash and had to retire from cycling's showcase race. Estonia's 
Jaan Kirsipuu was second in Monday's stage and took the leader's 
yellow jersey from Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill happened on the Passage du Gois, which connects a  
small island to the mainland in the coastal Atlantic Vendee region. 
The strip of land is no more than two car lengths wide and is 
closed during high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	The road proved treacherous for such favorites as Alex Zulle,  
Michael Boogerd and Ivan Gotti. They lost valuable minutes when 
they were behind the 10-rider crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughters and Armstrong both ride for the U.S. Postal Service  
team. Armstrong, recovering from testicular cancer, is second 
overall. He is in excellent position for Sunday's time trial and 
the later mountain climbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to stay out of trouble until the real race begins  
on Sunday with the time trial,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu earned bonus points in winning two of the day's three  
sprints. In third and fourth place were sprinter Mario Cipollini of 
Italy and Germany's Erik Zabel. 
</P>
<P>
	In another strong showing for U.S. Postal, George Hincapie came  
in sixth and is seventh overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughters was taken to a hospital in Nantes, as was Marc  
Wauters, who also is out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash wasn't the first of the day -- there was an earlier  
mishap at 21 miles involving 30 riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of vacationers lined the roads through the 109-mile  
stage, which came at the beginning of the summer holiday for many 
of the French. 
</P>
<P>
	Vacationers set up folding chairs and elaborate picnic tables  
along the road and leaned out of balconies in small villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the occasional anti-drug banner -- ``Say No to EPO'' --  
many fans showed support for French cycling star Richard Virenque. 
He is under investigation for last year's race that was nearly cut 
short because of the drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allez Richard -- We Forgive You,'' said one banner held by two  
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Race organizers say there will be spot drug tests during the  
coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong won the world championship in 1993 and competed in the  
Olympics in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>

had to retire from the race. Marc Wauters also abandoned with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was won in a final sprint by Tom Steels of Belgium,  
and the second-place finisher was Jaan Kirsipuu of Estonia, who 
took over the yellow jersey from Lance Armstrong because of bonus 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong remained in second place overall, and in excellent  
position to come on strong in the areas where he excels: a time 
trial on Sunday, and the later mountain climbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to stay out of trouble until the real race begins  
on Sunday with the time trial,'' Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	In third and fourth place were sprinter Mario Cipollini of Italy  
and Germany's Erik Zabel. 
</P>
<P>
	The pivotal crash at the Passage du Gois wasn't even the first  
of the day; an earlier mishap at 21 miles involved 30 riders. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of vacationers lined the roads all through the  
109-mile stage, which came at the beginning of many French people's 
summer holiday. Many set up folding chairs and elaborate picnic 
tables along the road, or leaned out of balconies in small villages 
to join in the action. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the occasional anti-doping banner -- ``Say No to EPO''  
-- many fans showed support for French cycling star Richard 
Virenque, under formal investigation for doping during last year's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allez Richard -- We Forgive You,'' said one banner held by two  
young children. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a two-time Olympic cyclist, is now a favorite. The  
Texan won the 1993 World Championship and competed for the U.S. 
Olympic team in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1996, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that  
had spread to his lungs and brain. He underwent surgery to remove 
his right testicle and lesions from his brain, and returned to 
racing early last year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Monday that he thought the doping scandal was  
``exaggerated and overblown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to think that nobody here has anything to hide,'' he  
said in an interview, complaining of over-aggressive tactics during 
last year's drug busts by French police.

<HEADLINE> Workers Injured in La. Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAMERCY, La. (AP) -- A blast that was heard for miles shook an  
aluminum plant early today, injuring at least 15 workers and 
prompting authorities to tell residents to stay indoors and close 
their windows. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no immediate reports of fatalities at the Kaiser  
Aluminum and Chemical Co. plant, said Lt. Mike Edmonson, a 
Louisiana State Police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5:15 a.m. blast caused a natural gas leak and sent a red  
substance identified as bauxite flying into the air, Edmonson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have reports it was seen up to a mile away,'' Edmonson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities were warning residents not to touch the substance,  
which looks like red mud, Edmonson said. Bauxite is the claylike 
ore from which aluminum is obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant is about a mile from a residential area and about 40  
miles west of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	WJBO-AM reported that 20 workers were taken to hospitals for  
treatment, but Edmonson know of only 15 people injured. The 
injuries ranged from severe burns to difficulty breathing and eye 
irritation, the radio station reported.

<HEADLINE> Overweight Soldiers File Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUNSWICK, Maine (AP) -- Roger Sablone Jr. spent years cramming  
himself into his tiny Navy bunk, bumping his skull on bulkheads and 
working in the cramped engine room of a nuclear-powered submarine. 
</P>
<P>
	After 10 years of service, the 6-foot-2, 240-pound sailor was  
told he was too big for his job. And when the Navy kicked him out 
for being overweight, it also took $9,200 of his re-enlistment 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Sablone, 31, of Homestead, Fla., is among 15 soldiers,  
sailors and airmen from Maine to Alaska suing to get their money 
back. The case, which was certified as a federal class-action 
lawsuit in Maine, has been transferred to the U.S. Court of Federal 
Claims in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Its outcome could be far-reaching: Between 1990 and 1996, the  
Army alone forced more than 14,000 from its ranks for being 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy, has the right to discharge sailors who fail fitness  
tests three times in a four-year period. The suit doesn't dispute 
that, instead attacking the military over the enlistment or 
re-enlistment bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pentagon spokesman referred questions about the suit to the  
Justice Department, where spokeswoman Chris Watney declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Feldman, a lawyer for the servicemen, said the Navy's  
only grounds for recouping the bonuses are misconduct, failure to 
perform duties or voluntary separation. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, you can throw me out at any time if you think I'm  
overweight,'' Feldman said. ``But don't take my bonus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All plaintiffs received honorable discharges upon being  
dismissed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sablone said he joined the Navy when there was no weight  
requirement. Later, a 225-pound standard was put in effect for his 
height; it then dropped to 215 pounds, and ultimately 211 pounds, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a five-year stint aboard the USS Atlanta, he failed  
physical training tests in 1996 and 1997 before being dismissed 
last year at a weight of 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sablone expected to receive a severance package that included  
money from unused leave. But he ended up receiving a check for 
$1,700 after the Navy subtracted $9,200 in bonus money. 
</P>
<P>
	Others have fared worse. Thomas Fryer, 29, of Colchester, Conn.,  
a 6-foot sailor forced from the Navy in 1997 for his 255-pound 
weight, continues to make $66 monthly payments on the $1,500 he 
still owes the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically got out of the Navy without money. I got  
nothing,'' he said. ``They really put me in a bad situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To right the situation, Fryer said, the Navy should at least  
warn in enlistment contracts that it will seek to recoup the 
bonuses if a sailor is discharged over the weight requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't change the policy, they should change the  
contract,'' Fryer said. ``It's completely misleading and illegal.''

<HEADLINE> Ill. Shooting Suspect Kills Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ill. (AP) -- A white supremacist who targeted minorities  
in a deadly Fourth of July weekend shooting spree in two states 
fatally shot himself as officers grappled with him after a chase, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, 21, was being pursued Sunday after he  
carjacked a van at gunpoint in rural Marion County, Ill., said Doug 
Garrison, an FBI spokesman in Indianapolis. No one was hurt in the 
carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Marion County Sheriff Gerald L. Benjamin said today that Smith  
apparently shot and wounded himself twice as officers pursued the 
van in a slow-speed chase. The van then crashed and Smith shot 
himself a third time when he was struggling with sheriff's 
deputies. He said that the final shot appears to have hit Smith in 
the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the shots were fired by him,'' Benjamin said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's over,'' he added. ``I feel sorry for his parents  
and the victims and their relatives. I don't know what caused this 
but it's very sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe Smith began his drive-by killing spree in  
Chicago on Friday, when a black former college basketball coach was 
fatally shot and six Orthodox Jews were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooter also fired at Asians and blacks in two Illinois  
cities, on Saturday, seriously wounding one man, and fatally shot a 
Korean man Sunday outside a church in Bloomington, Ind., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two guns found with Smith were consistent with the shootings and  
the body had a tattoo on the chest that said ``Sabbath Breaker'' -- 
which Smith was said to have sported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like our guy,'' Garrison said, adding that the FBI  
must double-check the fingerprints of the body with those of 
Smith's to make sure. Authorities also were attempting today to 
trace the source of the guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was a member of the World Church of the Creator, a white  
supremacist organization, and distributed anti-minority and 
anti-Semitic literature while a student at Indiana University. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, based in East Peoria, Ill., is led by Matt Hale, who  
said Smith was a member from June 1998 until May 1999 and never 
showed any predilection for violence 
</P>
<P>
	``When I spoke to him he never gave any inkling of being able to  
do this,'' Hale said before Smith apparently took his life. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI had not been investigating Smith until the last couple  
of days. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was known to police in Chicago and police in Bloomington  
but not to the FBI,'' Ken Kaiser, special agent in charge of FBI, 
said today. Witnesses did not see anyone with Smith, but the 
investigation into whether he acted alone was continuing, Kaiser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harlan Loeb, Midwest counsel for the Anti-Defamation League,  
said his organization has had Smith ``on our radar screen for quite 
some time, which is particularly tragic for someone so young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington Police Chief Jim Kennedy said officers had  
questioned him twice at his apartment in the past, related to the 
pamphlets he was passing out, because some people had complained 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing we could've arrested him for was  
littering,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman struck outside a synagogue in Chicago on Friday  
evening, the start of the Jewish Sabbath. The same shooter is 
believed to have killed Ricky Byrdsong, the black former basketball 
coach at Northwestern University, a half-hour later as he walked 
with his children in nearby Skokie, and later fired at an 
Asian-American couple in the suburb of Northbrook. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Saturday the same blue Taurus was seen at shootings in  
Springfield, 200 miles southwest of Chicago, and Champaign-Urbana, 
135 miles south of Chicago. In the first attack, the gunman fired 
on two black men Saturday morning, but no one was hit, Chicago 
Police Cmdr. William Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday evening, six men of Asian descent were standing on  
a corner near the University of Illinois when three or four shots 
were fired, Hayes said. A 22-year-old graduate student, whose name 
wasn't released, was hit in the leg and was listed in serious 
condition today at Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's attack, Won-Joon Yoon was hit twice in the back and  
killed outside Korean United Methodist Church in Bloomington, which 
is roughly 130 miles southeast of Urbana. Witnesses told police 
that after firing into the crowd, the shooter sped off, running 
several lights. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was apparently parked at the corner and waited for these  
people to come out of church and then fired,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said .380-caliber shell casings -- the same kind  
found in some of the Chicago shootings -- were also found at the 
scene of the Indiana attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year on the Fourth of July, Smith tucked white supremacist  
fliers under windshields around Bloomington. Asked whether the 
shootings this weekend were related to Independence Day, 
Bloomington Police Capt. William Parker said, ``It raises questions 
in our minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith also passed out similar hate literature when enrolled at  
the University of Illinois. The Daily Illini reported that Smith 
attended the school from 1996 through 1998 before being expelled. 
Urbana police said he had been in trouble with campus police for 
drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith attended Indiana University from the summer of 1998  
through the spring of 1999, and he is believed to have moved to the 
Chicago area in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The towns he's hit, he's either lived there or been enrolled  
in college at each of the towns,'' Parker said.

<HEADLINE> Garcia Nears Ryder Cup Berth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *AP Sports Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sergio Garcia keeps moving closer to a spot on the  
Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	And a number of people -- Colin Montgomerie and U.S. captain Ben  
Crenshaw among them -- think the 19-year-old Spaniard should 
represent Europe in Brookline, Mass., on Sept. 24-26. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia won the Irish Open on Sunday, his first pro title in only  
his sixth tournament. He earned enough Ryder Cup points to put him 
18th on the list of European team contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if he does not make the automatic top 10, he could be one  
of captain Mark James' two extra picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Mark James thinks I'm up to it, I'll be glad to play,''  
Garcia said Sunday after finishing with a 7-under 64 and winning by 
three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am playing well and if I can help the team I would love to  
play in Boston,'' Garcia added. ``But there is a long time until 
September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia showed up for practice for this week's Loch Lomond  
tournament sporting a shaved head. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I turned pro I said that when I had my first big victory  
I would cut my hair like this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has Loch Lomond and seven more tournaments to make the top  
10. And by the way he's been playing in his six tournaments, it 
appears he has the game to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Since placing as the highest amateur at this year's Masters,  
Garcia tied for third at the Byron Nelson Classic in May and 11th 
at the Memorial tournament three weeks ago. On the PGA European 
Tour, he has placed 25th, 20th, 19th and now first. 
</P>
<P>
	Crenshaw is convinced he'll see Garcia at Brookline.  
</P>
<P>
	``A kid like this is extra special,'' Crenshaw said. ``There's  
no question in my mind he'll be in the European team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie, who leads Europe's Ryder Cup points list, said a  
month ago James should put Garcia in the team and play him 
alongside Masters champion and fellow Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just give Sergio to Olly and let him go,'' Montgomerie said.  
</P>
<P>
	Other big names in the top 10 are Olazabal, Darren Clarke, Lee  
Westwood and Bernhard Langer and James himself, although the 
captain won't play. But former Ryder Cup stars such as Nick Faldo 
and Ian Woosnam have virtually no chance of making the 10 and will 
need to be among the captain's choices to make the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's first triumph came on the day Tiger Woods regained his  
No. 1 ranking with a three-stroke victory at the Western Open. 
Woods has won three of his last four tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladbrokes rate Woods a 7-1 shot to win the British Open, with  
David Duval at 10-1, Montgomerie at 16-1 and Davis Love III, Ernie 
Els and Westwood at 20-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The odds on John Daly even showing up are slim.  
</P>
<P>
	The British Open winner at St. Andrews in 1995, Daly's game is  
so erratic he pulled out of this week's Loch Lomond tournament. He 
finished with rounds of 81 and 74 at the Irish Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no confidence now and I'm tired,'' Daly said at Druid's  
Glen. ``I don't think I would find that confidence at Loch Lomond 
so I've decided to go home. I'm pretty sure I'm out of the Open too 
because Carnoustie is hardly the place to go when you're not 
playing good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly's late entry at the Irish Open prompted speculation he  
appeared only to collect the $160,000 in appearance money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately appearance money is part of the European Tour,''  
Clarke said. ``It's going to be very difficult to clamp down on it, 
but I think it would be much better to see it going into the prize 
fund.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Shipping Companies Plan Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch storage, distribution and  
shipping companies Royal Pakhoed NV and Royal Van Ommeren NV on 
Monday announced they plan to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, which had combined sales of 3.3 billion euros  
($3.2 billion) in 1988, tried but failed to join forces last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which will create a new company to be named Vopak,  
is expected to be completed by the end of October, the companies 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Vopak will focus on combining storage, distribution and shipping  
activities into integrated services for the chemicals, oil and gas 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakhoed and Van Ommeren said they expect the merger to result in  
cost-cutting but did not give details. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakhoed will have a 63.4 percent stake in the new company, while  
Van Ommeren will hold the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said corporate offices will be combined in a new  
headquarters in Rotterdam, leading to an unspecified number of job 
losses.

<HEADLINE> Toddler Dies After Hiding in Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MASONTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A toddler playing hide-and-seek with his  
older sisters died from apparent heat exposure when he hid in the 
family car. 
</P>
<P>
	Cody Anthony Britt, who turned 2 last month, was pronounced dead  
yesterday afternoon, Fayette County Coroner Phillip Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters, age 6 and 3, had asked their parents if they could  
play hide-and-seek at the home about 40 miles south of Pittsburgh. 
After playing for a short time, the girls could not find Cody and 
the family began searching, Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	The small boy had ducked down in the passenger seat, and family  
members did not see him the first time they looked in the car. But 
on a second search, they opened the passenger door and the boy 
tumbled out, Reilly said. Cody had been inside the car for at least 
an hour, with outside temperatures in the high 90s, and the boy's 
asthma condition made the heat particularly dangerous, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The death is being treated as an accident, Reilly said. An  
autopsy was scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Senate a Haven for Senior Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Ernest Hollings, 77, last year handily  
defeated a challenger exactly half his age to extend his record of 
being a junior senator longer than any man in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Carolina Democrat has been in the Senate for 33 years,  
going back to the Johnson administration. Still, he is far 
outranked by his 96-year-old Republican colleague Strom Thurmond, 
who entered the Senate in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nation that puts a premium on youth, the Senate remains a  
bastion of senior power. Including Thurmond and Hollings, 13 of the 
100 members are older than 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them are Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., 81; William Roth, R-Del.,  
77; Jesse Helms, R-N.C., 77; and John Chafee, R.I., 76. Both of 
Hawaii's senators, Democrats Daniel Inouye and Daniel Akaka, are 
74. 
</P>
<P>
	Even seniority must bow to political control. In the years when  
the Democrats were the majority party, Hollings was chairman of the 
Senate Commerce Committee and wielded more power than Thurmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, 75, who entered the Senate in 1968,  
recently celebrated his 12,000th vote, still well behind Senate 
record-holder Byrd, who has cast his ayes and nays more than 15,000 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The word Senate derives from the Latin for counsel of elders,  
said Senate historian Donald Ritchie, and particularly in the 20th 
century, with the advent of direct elections and the entrenchment 
of the seniority system, it is not uncommon for senators to serve 
well into their senior years. 
</P>
<P>
	Theodore Green of Rhode Island was 93 when he retired in 1960,  
the record before Thurmond, and John Stennis of Mississippi retired 
in 1988 at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike House members who have to run for re-election every two  
years, senators have six years to sink political roots in their 
states, making them extremely difficult to unseat, said Notre Dame 
professor Robert Schmuhl, who studies Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are able to toss their weight around over that longer  
period of time to the benefit of people in their state,'' he said. 
Also, ``senators of a certain age have a strong appeal to those who 
are roughly their own age,'' other seniors who turn out at the 
polls in higher percentages than other age groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The average age of the Senate actually dipped slightly after the  
1998 elections, to 58, with the election of such youngsters as 
Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., and Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., now both 38. 
The average age in the House is 52. 
</P>
<P>
	But gray power dominates where it counts, among the committee  
chairmen. The average chairman's age is 67, even though Thurmond, 
in a nod to youth, this year ceded his seat as Armed Services 
Committee chairman to Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who is 72. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of seven of the plus-70 crowd are up next year, and  
four have indicated they will run for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I've got a pain in my body I don't know about it,'' Byrd  
said in a recent interview with The Intelligencer of Wheeling, 
W.Va. ``Why would I quit? If it's God's will and West Virginia's 
will, then I'll be re-elected,'' he said of his decision to seek an 
eighth term. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, would be 79 at the  
beginning of his sixth term in 2001. He said Delaware voters should 
consider ``the experience, the seniority and, yes, the power that 
we have earned together.'' Both he and Byrd are shoo-ins for 
re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii's Akaka and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., 71, are also  
expected to run again. Three others -- Chafee, 75-year-old Frank 
Lautenberg, D-N.J., and 72-year-old Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. 
-- are retiring at the end of their terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're in your 70s and you don't want to press that too long,  
do you?'' the four-term Moynihan said in announcing his decision to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Those sentiments were echoed in 1997 when former Sen. John  
Glenn, D-Ohio, then 75, revealed that he would not seek a fifth 
term. ``There is still no cure for the common birthday,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a year later, at age 77, America's first man to orbit  
the Earth rocketed back into space aboard the space shuttle as the 
world's oldest astronaut.

<HEADLINE> Actor Hoskins Surprised by Noriega </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bob Hoskins, who plays Manuel Noriega in an  
upcoming cable TV movie, found the former Panamanian dictator more 
layered than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I read the script, my impression of Noriega was the  
same as everyone else's -- that he was a monster, a trumped-up 
little dictator,'' Hoskins told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a lot more complex and interesting than that,'' he said.  
``But it's not my job to make a judgment whether the guy is good or 
evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 56-year-old British actor stars in ``Noriega: God's  
Favorite,'' scheduled to be shown later this year on Showtime. He 
and other cast members are working for modest salaries on the $5 
million project, which is being filmed in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	Noriega's dictatorship was toppled when the United States  
invaded Panama in 1989. He continues to serve time in Miami on 1992 
federal money laundering and drug trafficking convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge recently reduced his sentence, possibly making Noriega,  
65, eligible for release by 2007.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Food Company To Buy GNC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Dutch food maker Royal Numico is acquiring  
General Nutrition Companies Inc., a leading producer of vitamins 
and other nutritional supplements, for $1.75 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, under which Royal Numico will also assume roughly $760  
million in debt, creates what the two companies called the largest 
firm in the world devoted exclusively to nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies plan to jointly market products that Numico has  
developed, including nutritional supplements for athletes and heart 
patients. The two companies will retain their own names, and no 
jobs losses are expected as a result of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Matt Patsky of the Boston investment firm Adams,  
Harkness &AMP; Hill Inc. said the acquisition marked an unusual 
emphasis on research in the nutrition business, where companies 
have often relied on marketing existing products, rather than 
rolling out new ones, in order to build up their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
	Numico research director Albert Eenink stressed this aspect of  
the deal in an interview with the AP. ``We have in the pipeline a 
lot of products that could both benefit the GNC business and the 
company in Europe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While GNC will benefit from Numico's research, Numico can take  
advantage of GNC's distribution and advertising, said Gary Giblen, 
an analyst for Bank of America Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Numico ``really is an excellent research firm but not one  
that's particularly worldly in bringing stuff to the U.S. or other 
parts of the world,'' Giblen said. ``It's the simple and perfect 
marriage of marketing and research and distribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GNC shareholders will receive $25 per share for their stock, a  
slight premium over GNC's closing price of $22.87 1/2 Friday on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. Stock markets were closed Monday in observance 
of Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
	GNC is expanding a Greenville, S.C. manufacturing plant to help  
meet an anticipated boost in sales because of the deal, said Bill 
Watts, GNC's president and chief executive. Watts said the 
expansion would likely mean new jobs, but he didn't know how many. 
</P>
<P>
	GNC announced in June that it was buying an 8 percent stake in  
drugstore.com, an on-line prescription retailer, a move intended to 
build its strengths in advertising and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Numico, a major supplier of baby food in Europe, earned a profit  
of $180 million on sales of $1.6 billion last year. The company 
employed 10,500 people in more than 40 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	GNC had a 1998 profit of $90 million on sales of $1.4 billion.  
The Pittsburgh-based company employed 13,800 people in more than 
4,000 stores in all 50 states and 25 foreign markets.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Makes an Amazing Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-NAZAIRE, France (AP) -- His comeback is astonishing.  
</P>
<P>
	Less than three years ago, Lance Armstrong was diagnosed with  
testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he is not only riding again. He is an early favorite to win  
the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Texan won the race prologue by a convincing  
seven seconds. Armstrong lost the leader's yellow jersey during 
Monday's second stage but he remained in second place overall. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, he is in excellent position to exploit his strong  
points: time trials and mountain climbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Monday, Armstrong spoke of the crisis his sport  
has gone through since a drug scandal almost destroyed the Tour de 
France last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been exaggerated and overblown,'' he said. ``It's been  
open season on cycling. Why haven't French officials looked at 
other sports?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At this time last year, the Tour was thrown into chaos when  
French customs officials caught Team Festina trainer Willy Voet 
with a stash of performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	French authorities intensified their crackdown, even raiding  
team hotels as cyclists slept between stages. Eleven people remain 
under official investigation, which in France is a step short of 
being charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said the French police tactics were out of line.  
</P>
<P>
	``There were clearly some violations of human rights last  
year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As to whether problems will continue this year, he said, ``I'd  
like to think that nobody here has anything to hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, ``There are no saints. This is 1999. There is sex  
in the White House. There are IOC scandals. It's not a perfect 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong won the 1993 world championship and competed for the  
U.S. Olympic team in 1992 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But in October 1996, he was diagnosed with cancer. He underwent  
surgery to remove his right testicle and lesions from his brain. 
Intensive chemotherapy followed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gorski, general manager of the U.S. Postal Service team,  
thinks Armstrong's strong comeback will have a big impact on 
cycling in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lance almost died,'' Gorski said. ``America embraces heroes.  
This is the most important story in cycling since Greg LeMond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeMond won the Tour three times, and Armstrong is well aware of  
the comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be really hard to recapture that magic,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he knows some fans in the United States are paying attention  
to the Tour, and maybe that will lift cycling's popularity among 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listen, I've got to be realistic -- cycling will never be  
football, baseball or basketball,'' he said. ``It's too 
misunderstood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, if American cyclists can get even a minute of TV  
coverage because of their accomplishments on the Tour de France, 
``That's big, that's significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Armstrong says he feels good, even better than before  
his illness. He says he just wants to stay out of trouble -- and out 
of crashes -- until Sunday's time trial in Metz, in northern France, 
and then look toward the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time trial, and the mountains -- that's when the real race  
begins,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Woods Takes Victorious Walk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- The last time Tiger Woods made a victorious  
walk up the 18th fairway at the Western Open, thousands of fans 
broke through the security ropes to follow him. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods headed for the green with a sea of people in tow, just  
wanting to be close to him, just wanting to bask in ``Tigermania'' 
if only for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Woods took his victory walk alone. Maybe it was the  
tighter security. Maybe his victory was anticlimactic after leading 
the second and third rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe Tigermania is finally settling to a low roar.  
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, I don't think so,'' he said when asked  
if the near-hysteria that followed him in 1997 will ever be 
repeated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the fact I was new to the scene. I came out new and  
fresh. Most fans don't pay attention to amateur golf,'' he said. 
``Then, when I came on the scene, the huge endorsement numbers got 
everyone's attention. Then coming out and winning twice in seven 
weeks and getting my card that way, getting the Tour championship, 
people kind of took notice of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning the Masters by 12. Being a person of color, doing that  
at a tournament that historically has denied access. So a lot of 
different subplots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods, who regained the No. 1 world ranking with his victory  
at the Western, can still draw a crowd. The rest of the field 
Sunday at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club played in relative 
obscurity. Relative, that is, because those were about the only 
people paying attention to the other golfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people lined every hole he played. People staked  
out spots at upcoming holes hours ahead of time. There were cheers 
of ``C'mon, Tiger!'' and ``Go get 'em, Tiger!'' after every drive 
and every hole. Marshals repeatedly had to ask fans to stop walking 
or talking, reminding them others were still playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that people would be pulling for Tiger big-time,'' said  
Mike Weir, Woods' playing partner Sunday. ``I just had to block 
that out and play my own game and not pay attention to what he was 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Woods has been doing lately is playing his best golf since  
1997 -- even better, actually. Despite steamrolling through the 
Masters and winning three other tournaments that year, he was 
horrified when he looked at videotapes of his swing. So he ripped 
it apart, changing just about everything. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to make the changes second nature to his game showed.  
Though he held the No. 1 ranking and led the tour with 13 top-10 
finishes, he ``only'' won one PGA Tour event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being No. 1 in the world and not winning like I was doing in  
'98, that's not that great,'' he said. ``I was having consistent 
finishes, but also changing my game. And I knew it was going to 
take me awhile, so I understood that. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I liked winning,'' he said. ``I don't like going home and  
knowing that somebody beat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he's already won three PGA Tour events. Including a  
tournament in Germany, he's won three of his last four starts. He 
also leads the PGA Tour with 10 top-10 finishes this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The long, jaw-dropping drives are still there. His bunker game  
is vastly improved, and his putting is stronger, too. And his 
killer competitiveness is as sharp as ever. When Weir pared his 
lead to one stroke with a birdie on No. 7, Woods responded by 
rolling the ball within 8 inches of the pin on his second shot and 
then making the putt for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	Weir, who missed his own birdie putt, never threatened again.  
</P>
<P>
	``The key is just keep hitting good shots and give yourself a  
chance at some putts,'' Woods said. ``I'm rolling the rock well. 
I'm controlling my trajectory, driving it pretty good. Overall, my 
game is coming around. I like it. I'm very pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He now takes his new and improved game to the British Open,  
which begins July 15. With the way he played this past weekend, 
Weir said Woods must be among the favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	If Woods wins, all those predictions of someday becoming the  
best golfer ever -- the talk that dogged him after the Masters -- 
probably will return. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice,'' he said. ``But if it doesn't work out, it  
doesn't work out. But I know one thing: I'm going to try.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Jet Mark Gastineau Is Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former New York Jets defensive end Mark  
Gastineau was arrested Monday for violating an order of protection 
in an ongoing domestic dispute, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gastineau, 42, surrendered at a Queens precinct stationhouse and  
remained in custody awaiting arraignment on a charge of criminal 
contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-NFL star allegedly violated a court order on June 22 by  
going to his wife's Queens home, where he repeatedly rang the 
doorbell and refused to leave, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gastineau was sentenced last October to three months probation  
after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge for hitting 
his wife. He had been arrested a month earlier for hitting his 
then-fiancee, Patricia Schorr, at a Manhattan apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gastineau was charged with misdemeanor assault, menacing and  
criminal possession of a weapon. The court complaint said the 
weapon was a glass cocktail table with which he threatened to hit 
Schorr. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of Gastineau's guilty plea, Schorr said she had  
married him in late September. She also refused to cooperate in the 
prosecution of her husband.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Thrives at University Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Olympic hopeful Mark  
Warkentin picked up two more golds Monday and cracked the 
University Games record for the men's 800-meter freestyle by nearly 
four seconds, leading the U.S. swimming team to victories in five 
of the day's six events. 
</P>
<P>
	But Olympic champion Anita Nall finished fourth and out of the  
medals in the women's 200 breaststroke, the event in which she 
shattered the world record twice in one day at the 1992 U.S. 
Olympic trials. It was her first taste of international competition 
since the 1995 Pan-American Games, because she has suffered blood 
pressure problems. 
</P>
<P>
	She won a gold, silver and bronze at the 1992 Summer Games in  
Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like forever ago,'' Nall said of her Olympic  
triumphs. ``I would have liked to have gone a little faster today, 
and been in the top three. But I'm not disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her time of 2:33.00 was more than four seconds off her 1992  
world record and a second behind winner Yuko Sakaguchi of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Warkentin cut about six seconds off his personal best time,  
winning the 800 free in 8 minutes, 0.81 seconds. He held off 
Italy's late-charging Andrea Righi and eclipsed the mark of 8:04.80 
set by Canada's Thurlough O'Hare at the 1993 University Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety minutes later, he anchored the U.S. team to victory in  
the 4x200 freestyle relay in 7:27.33. Ukraine was second in 
7:28.49. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking the 200 free as a late fill-in on Sunday, Warkentin  
is shooting at five golds here. He'll race the 400 free, his best 
event, on Wednesday, and the 1,500 free on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ask some of the coaches I've been around and they'll tell you  
this meet was a long time due,'' Warkentin said. ``I have been 
waiting for big drops in my time and I knew it was going to come. 
It was just a matter of what meet and it happened to come here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Somensatto (200 butterfly), Beau Wiebel (400 individual  
medley) and Kimberly Black (200 freestyle) won the other U.S. golds 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women opened defense of their 1997 basketball gold  
medal by beating China 107-89, despite losing point guard Brandi 
McCain, who strained her right knee driving to the basket with one 
second left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina's LaQuanda Barksdale led six Americans in double  
figures with 15 points. China's Lijie Miao led all scorers with 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men's team improved to 3-0 here, and stretched its  
University Games winning streak to 35 games overall, by thrashing 
the Czech Republic 102-43. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, world champion Svetlana Khornika posted the top  
scores in three of four events to win the women's gymnastics 
all-around title, while Ukraine's Alexander Beresh won the men's 
all-around gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Americans pulled out with injuries. Heather Renee Brink was  
taken to the hospital for X-rays after suffering what appeared to 
be a broken foot during the floor exercise, her second discipline. 
Mohini Bhardwaj withdrew before action started Monday because she 
aggravated an elbow injury in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining American, UCLA's Heidi Louise Moneymaker, finished  
16th of 24 women.

<HEADLINE>  Iran Museum Houses Hitler Paintings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A Tehran museum holds two  
watercolor paintings by Adolf Hitler, given decades ago by the 
Fuhrer himself to the Iranian ambassador to Germany, the museum's 
curator said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mohammad Reza Javaheri said the paintings show scenes of the  
Austrian capital of Vienna, where the 18-year-old Hitler applied to 
study art, but was rejected. The paintings are owned by the 
government foundation Bonyad Mostazafan, which runs the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both paintings have been authenticated by two European  
experts,'' the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted 
Javaheri as saying. The works have never been appraised, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The foundation does not intend to sell the paintings. They  
will remain in its collection,'' he said, according to the 
Dubai-monitored broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings, both watercolors on paper, measure 23 1/2 inches by  
nearly 20 inches and show two mansion-like monuments of Vienna, 
sources told the Associated Press by telephone from Tehran, 
speaking on the customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitler presented the paintings to Hassan Esfandiari, the Iranian  
ambassador to Germany during Hitler's rule, Javaheri said. Iran was 
sympathetic toward Germany during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bonyad Mostazafan gained the paintings after the 1979  
Islamic revolution, when the clerical government seized billions of 
dollars in assets owned by the ousted shah and his cronies and gave 
them to the newly created foundation.

	The paintings, both watercolors on paper, measure 23 1/2 inches by  
nearly 20 inches and show two mansion-like monuments of Vienna, 
sources told the Associated Press by telephone from Tehran, 
speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.

	Hitler presented the paintings to Hassan Esfandiari, the Iranian  
ambassador to Germany during Hitler's rule, Javaheri said. Iran was 
sympathetic toward Germany during World War II.

	The Bonyad Mostazafan gained the paintings after the 1979  
Islamic revolution, when the clerical government seized billions of 
dollars in assets owned by the ousted shah and his cronies and gave 
them to the newly created foundation.
