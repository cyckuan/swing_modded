CHAMPIONSHIP MOLD COULD FIT LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Man the barricades, here comes the purple-and-gold
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Widely favored to lead the Western Conference when the season
began lo these several weeks ago, the Lakers have been reduced to a
level where an NBA title would be not simply an upset but downright
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   If they get to the NBA Finals, let alone win it all, they'll
rewrite the book on building a champion.
</P>
<P>
   The book says you build a team with youth, plug holes with
veterans and give it a season to fit together. And hope Michael
Jordan isn't in the league when it does.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers built a team with youth, filled holes with veterans,
gave it a season to fit together, tore it up by switching to a
rookie head coach and signing Dennis Rodman, figured out in a month
that Rodman probably didn't belong but took another month to cut
him, changed three-fifths of the lineup in the Glen Rice trade, and
gave it 10 games to fit back together. Fortunately Michael Jordan
(begin ital)isn't(end ital) in the league, so anybody's got a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Even a team whose season has taken more turns than a low-speed
police chase?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability to get there if we play our best
basketball and continue to improve in each round,'' coach Kurt
Rambis said at the Lakers' last practice session before their
first-round opener against the Houston Rockets today at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis on ``capability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To expect the team to get there, with the number of changes
we've made and the lack of developmental time we've had, I think is
unrealistic for this ballclub,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis on ``expect.''
</P>
<P>
   So don't say we never allowed the Lakers a pre-playoffs excuse.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, an excuse might be out of line. It's not as
if a team burdened by elements of the Lakers' unorthodox
preparation has never won the NBA title, just not in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the year the Rockets followed one surprise title with
another in the first post-Jordan era, Houston went into the
playoffs as the No.6 seed in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are No.4 seeds this year.
</P>
<P>
   In '95, shortly before the season's halfway point, the Rockets
made a major trade, giving up Otis Thorpe to get Clyde Drexler and
Tracy Murray from Portland. Thorpe had been their one true power
forward and they missed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of messed up the team for a while,'' said Robert
Horry, a Rocket then and a Laker now.
</P>
<P>
   The trade, and injuries to Horry, Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon,
threw the Rockets into a slump that dropped them in the seedings.
Only at the season's very end did they establish some momentum.
</P>
<P>
   A jarring trade. A midseason slump. A late surge. Sound
familiar?
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets beat higher-seeded Utah, Phoenix and San Antonio
before sweeping Orlando and Shaquille O'Neal to win the title.
</P>
<P>
   Role models for the Lakers?
</P>
<P>
   ``So much stuff is similar,'' Horry said of the '95 Rockets and
the '99 Lakers _ making allowances for the fact there was no Rodman
or Rambis in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The practical similarity being that those Rockets, playing well
in April, were No.6 seeds in name only, and these Lakers, winners
of their last four games by a 16-point average, are stronger than
No.4.
</P>
<P>
   But the quintet that will walk onto the Forum court at 2:30
today _ O'Neal, Rice, Kobe Bryant, Derek Fisher and trade
acquisition J.R. Reid _ has been together for barely three weeks.
In the Lakers' group-therapy sessions, they're up to the ``Hi, my
name is Glen'' stage of familiarization.
</P>
<P>
   To which the Rockets' Charles Barkley said: Big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of talent, and they're playing well,''
Barkley said of the Lakers, though he also could be talking about
the Rockets, who've won three in a row. ``What happened during the
regular season doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley had a chance to say I told you so, having questioned the
Lakers' Western Conference-favorite's status before they and the
Rockets opened the regular season Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they were the favorite and (now) they're not
the favorite,'' Barkley said Saturday before the Rockets practiced
at the Forum. ``You all were swinging on their vines, like L.A.
people have a tendency to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Overrate the locals? Us?
</P>
<P>
   ``They obviously thought they were overrated, or they wouldn't
have made so many changes,'' Barkley said of the Lakers' front
office.
</P>
<P>
   With the home-court advantage in the first-round, best-of-five
series, they'll beat Houston, which went 1-11 on the road against
playoff-bound teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'll have to hold onto their recently acquired
confidence for three more rounds to win the championship. Don't
start rewriting that book just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult road, but it's not an impossible road,''
Horry said.
</P>
<P>
   Horry speaks as one who's been up a similar road before _ but
not quite as steep as this. &QL;

COMMERICAL SIGNAGE IN BASEBALL: JUST GET USED TO IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Red Sox executive Larry Cancro has news for all those
fans who think baseball has become too commercialized, what with
billboards all over outfield walls and someday, perhaps,
advertising on player uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Green Monster _ the ultimate symbol of that bastion of
baseball tradition _ Fenway Park, has its roots in commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Monster wasn't built to keep balls in the park,'' Cancro
said. ``It was built as an advertising opportunity. It used to be
plastered with ads.''
</P>
<P>
   His point: Commercialism has always been a part of sport and
always will be, especially as sports franchises seek new sources of
revenue to meet rising player payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   The never-ending battle for more revenue became a public issue
locally a week ago when Tom Schieffer resigned as Rangers
president. Sources said Schieffer had a philosophical conflict with
owner Tom Hicks over baseball's future. Schieffer much preferred
marketing the game's tradition; Hicks is a renowned financier
looking for all avenues to raise revenue, including adding signage
at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   But sports team officials here and elsewhere, along with
sports-marketing and media executives, agree that increased venue
advertising at ballparks and arenas, more commercials during
televised games and even advertising patches on player uniforms are
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing to stop the trend, experts say, unless demand by
corporate sponsors declines or club owners decide to cut back
because all that advertising is becoming unsightly. That's not
likely, though, except in extreme cases, because clubs depend on
the extra revenue to cover the ever-larger player payrolls needed
to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sports facilities might never take on tacky names or bear
inappropriate advertising, but other than that there are few
restraints.
</P>
<P>
   Commercialism, Rangers vice president of marketing Charles
Seraphin said, ``has become kind of a whipping boy among people who
really haven't thought it through. There's concern about the
proliferation of corporate advertising in sports. But the reality
is that it's been around for a long time, and it's been done
tastefully and not detracted from the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People make a big deal out of it now when they see a rotating
ad sign board behind home plate,'' said Rick Burton, director of
the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon
College of Business. ``They talk like it's ruined the sanctity of
the game. But outdoor signs have been around for 75 years. It's
like, `C'mon kids ...' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey dasher boards, once ad-free, are now covered with
advertising. Even the ice surface bears advertising messages, such
as the Dr Pepper, GTE and Bud Light signs on the ice at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball arenas feature rotating sign boards at the press
table, often changing ads every few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Outfield fences at major-league stadiums, pristine for many
years, carry ads everywhere except for the prohibited area in
center field. Ads there could affect a hitter's vision, baseball
officials say. Baseball parks also have ads on dugout walls, on
upper-deck facades and on bullpen walls.
</P>
<P>
   At The Ballpark in Arlington, signs have sprouted this year in
the dugouts (New Era), along the left-field wall (Armitron) and on
the outfield fence (New Dodge).
</P>
<P>
   Football stadium advertising signs are confined to the upper
decks so as to not be part of ground-level TV shots. That is a
requirement of the National Football League, which doesn't want
visual conflicts between its national corporate sponsors and the
local sponsors of individual clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the increased advertising, particularly at
ballparks and arenas, is clear, said Roger Noll, a professor of
economics at Stanford University. The idea, he said, is to reach
people watching the game at home with the advertising message as
well as those sitting in the stands. Only 20,000 or 50,000 people
might see an ad on an outfield wall, along a dasher board, or on a
player's jersey. But millions can see an ad if it appears in the
background of a TV broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of money you can get from \Rstadium ad signage\S
has gone up dramatically in the last few years,'' Noll said. ``TV
advertising has become so expensive that this is a lower cost way
to get on the broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   While the focus of the furor over commercialization is on venue
advertising, fans are likely to see more advertising on TV, too.
In-game features could see more ``brought-to-you-by'' ads, for
example. Also, thanks to new technology, telecast sponsors can
project ad messages onto blank areas at a stadium (on the
center-field fence, for example) so that viewers at home see an
advertisement that fans at a game cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors typically buy all-inclusive advertising
packages from pro sports teams which might include stadium signage,
TV and game program advertising and promotional tie-ins. The value
of each element, therefore, is difficult to break out, but a
major-league team, for example, could earn anywhere from a few
million dollars a year from stadium advertising to $20 million,
depending on the size of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Those millions can help pay the salaries of several players,
maybe even make the difference between a winning team and a loser.
Seraphin says baseball executives weigh that reality when deciding
how much advertising to allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked a baseball fan to choose between having a
pristine field and a team that loses 100 games,'' Seraphin said,
``or a stadium with some advertising and a club with a shot to go
to the World Series, they'll choose the advertising 100 out of 100
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan concern over increased commercialism centers on aesthetics.
The most common complaint is that all that advertising cheapens the
look of the ballpark and the sport itself.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a competitive concern about the increased
commercialization. Club officials said that the more successful
teams in the larger markets will earn far more revenue from stadium
and TV advertising than smaller market clubs, widening the growing
financial gap.
</P>
<P>
   Now that commercialism in sport is growing, fans shouldn't
expect it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no end to it,'' says Bob Dorfman, a sports analyst with
the advertising agency Foote, Cone, Belding/San Francisco. ``What
happens is with each new threshold we cross _ signs on fences or
logos on uniform sleeves _ the purists raise hell. But then
everybody eventually gets used to it, they stop complaining, and
there it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, though, fans might have already become accustomed
to increased commercialization. Red Sox executive Cancro said he
received a letter of protest a few years ago from a Boston fan
angry about the placement of giant Coca-Cola bottles on light
towers high above the left-field wall at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Was he upset that the advertising monstrosity was ruining the
sanctity of one of baseball's cathedrals?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, Cancro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mad,'' Cancro said, ``because he said it blocked his
view of the Citgo sign behind the wall.''

Based on Derby performance, Menifee should win Preakness 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
FORT WORTH, Texas _ Prairie Bayou finished second in the 1993
Kentucky Derby, but those who studied the race carefully knew his
performance deserved an asterisk in the history books.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was so clearly the best horse in the Derby that his trainer,
Tom Bohannan, almost had an anxiety attack getting the 3-year-old
gelding up to the Preakness Stakes, where he blew away the
competition in the second leg of racing's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   A relieved Bohannan explained later that he had never felt such
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the only way Prairie Bayou could get beat was if I
screwed him up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Preakness is seldom that easy, but an important key to
handicapping the race at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore is always
to accurately decipher the two minutes of hysteria known as the
Kentucky Derby. The best horse often doesn't win the Derby because
of pace or traffic problems, but the Preakness can be a more
form-fitting race.
</P>
<P>
   A close study of the Derby is particularly crucial this year
because, at this writing, a dozen of the 19 starters in last
weekend's Derby are being considered for the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 Derby, Prairie Bayou had a 19-horse field to
navigate, too. He started far back in the pack, then streaked
around seven horses on the Churchill Downs stretch turn despite
racing eight-wide. He was fanned 10-wide into the lane to lose all
momentum, yet still doggedly passed seven more horses in the final
quarter-mile to lose by only 21/2 lengths to Sea Hero, who had
benefited from a brilliant ground-saving ride by Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic example of Derby misfortune
occurred in the centennial running of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Little Current came away from the gate last in a
record 23-horse field at Churchill Downs. Along the way, the colt
was bounced and squeezed and jostled. Turning into the stretch, he
was in a hopeless position: 17th place and 171/2 lengths behind the
leader. Yet Little Current passed a dozen horses in the last
quarter-mile and wound up only 61/2 lengths behind winner
Cannonade.
</P>
<P>
   Professional race watchers couldn't get enough of Little
Current. He not only won the Preakness convincingly, but he
captured the Belmont Stakes, too.
</P>
<P>
   A similar trip spoiled Risen Star's hopes in the 1988 Derby; he
also rebounded by taking the Preakness and the Belmont. Snow Chief
faded badly after unwisely pressing a torrid pace in the 1986
Derby, and he, too, won in the Preakness. The list of Derby victims
turned Preakness heroes goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   This year's demolition Derby yielded mishaps, too, although
perhaps not as many as originally believed.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the stewards head-on view of the Kentucky Derby
obtained from Churchill Downs shows that eight horses had traffic
trouble of varying degrees during the race, and others were surely
intimidated by the cramped quarters created by a huge field and a
slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, however, runner-up Menifee wasn't among the
horses in trouble, as originally believed.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee passed a dozen horses in the stretch, despite being
compromised by slow fractions. But footnotes from the original
Daily Racing Form and Equibase chart reported Menifee was ``checked
in traffic on the turn'' and ``raced behind a wall of horses''
entering the stretch, and the head-on replay doesn't justify that
analysis. Menifee resembled Gale Sayers as he darted between and
among rivals through the long stretch. Although jockey Pat Day was
forced to pick his spots carefully and perhaps delay his closing
run, films show that the colt never had his forward progress
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the official chart was revised on Thursday, and both
references to Menifee's traffic trouble were deleted.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, a neck ahead of Menifee as the long-shot winner of
the Derby, was three-wide around both turns and somehow remained
clear of any bumping and grinding. So did Cat Thief, Prime Timber,
Worldly Manner and Vicar.
</P>
<P>
   The worst Derby trips clearly belonged to General Challenge,
Adonis, Three Ring and First American.
</P>
<P>
   With any good fortune at all, Adonis and First American almost
certainly will turn in better performances in the Preakness.
General Challenge and Three Ring aren't running.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to post-race commentary from Bob Baffert and jockey
Kent Desormeaux, one would have thought the other filly in the
Derby, Excellent Meeting, had been mugged at gunpoint. She did have
a worse trip than Menifee _ she was crowded at the start and had to
wait briefly while crowded again around the stretch turn _ and she
ran commendably to be fifth. But she actually saved ground around
the clubhouse turn, so her trip was hardly a Shakespearean tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Got Even, who ran 14th, was sandwiched from both sides
in the bumping around the first turn. But that doesn't qualify as a
nightmarish trip, either. He held his position despite the bumps
and was simply outrun on the backstretch and the second turn.
</P>
<P>
   After perusing the videotape, it appears that Menifee, who
started from post No. 18, was the best horse in the Derby, not
because of a troubled trip, but rather the pace disadvantage he
nearly overcame.
</P>
<P>
   Because the first six furlongs were run in a slow 1 minutes,
12.52 seconds, the Derby's early leaders should have been too fresh
for Menifee to rush past them in the stretch as he did. That makes
his effort a remarkable one.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Menifee is caught in a bad spot in the expected 14-horse
Preakness field, he should join Prairie Bayou, Risen Star and the
other unlucky Derby losers who gained redemption in Baltimore.

STARS' TRIUMPH TRULY A FRIGHTENING SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars never seemed to get a grip on this wild, at
times wacky, hockey night.
</P>
<P>
   But the series _ all Ed Belfour excursions aside _ somehow
remains semi-firmly in their grasps this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   On the winged heels of Joe Nieuwendyk, the Stars oozed past the
St. Louis Blues in 8 1/2 minutes of overtime last night, 5-4, to
take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven playoff matchup.
</P>
<P>
   For Stars fans, that was the sudden and happy ending to what,
for the longest time, seemed like a Hitchcock movie.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Alfred Hitchcock, not the other guy.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it was like what you'd expect to see When Hockey
Goes Bad.
</P>
<P>
   Goalies freak out. Power plays turn into fire drills. Your
leading scorer starts thinking he's a shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams deserved to win. No _ wait. Both teams deserved to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The home team's power play wanderings continued. Despite the
return of Derian Hatcher, heretofore in NHL drydock, the Stars'
defensive play was ... well ... choppy. The officiating was fickle
and, as usual, whistles turned mute in the extra period.
</P>
<P>
   But that apparently wasn't enough for the Stars, who added
lapses of poor positioning and Belfour's poorest night of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope I never see that kind of game again,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Hitch's head likely added another layer of gray one particular
play 11 minutes into the third period. With the Stars on the
so-called power play, St. Louis' Mike Eastwood suddenly found
himself with the puck at center ice and with a clear path down the
left side toward Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, perhaps to practice something he once saw Tara
Lipinski do, Belfour sashayed out to greet the puck. He was all the
way to the red dot when he tumbled _ spreadeagled, so to speak _
onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Most fortunately, Eastwood couldn't bring the puck back under
control, to hit the yawningly empty net. Defenseman Darryl Sydor
was able to plug the hole until Belfour got back on his skates and
returned.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd oohed nervously. Nobody really expected the
score to stay tied, 4-4, until overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one revved-up hockey game,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   It started innocently enough, with both sides missing early
rushes and Jamie Langenbrunner's blast finally finding the net for
the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final seconds of the opening period, the Blues' Pavol
Demitra let loose from just inside the blue line, and the puck
somehow squirted through Belfour's legs. It knotted the game, 1-1,
and ended a Belfour shutout string that had reached 151 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie the Eagle never quite found the coop after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was a tough day for the goaltenders,''
Hitchcock said. ``There were a lot of odd-man rushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock declined to agree that Belfour seemed to get a tad
frayed at the edges after the first two St. Louis goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it affected Eddie at all,'' Hitch said. ``Right
now you're just looking at trying to win hockey games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was just a lot of tenacity. Some of each team _
\RPierre\S Turgeon for St. Louis, Nieuwendyk for us _ were able to
control the game. And when you have that, it is difficult on any
goaltender, because you're always on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the top-skilled players were really controlling the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Controlling,'' in this case, should be viewed as a relative
term. There was so much loose play on both ends, every puck that
slid near either Belfour or the Blues' Grant Fuhr was prompting a
gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock blamed it on both teams' forwards forcing the action
and creating problems for the opposing defensemen. Well, yes and
no. The puck seldom found its way into the corners.
</P>
<P>
   But typical of the night, Mike Modano cost the Stars a two-man
disadvantage in the second period when he was sent to the box for
``closing his hand on the puck.'' In layman terms, he had lost his
stick and, with the puck at his feet, scooped it and seemed to try
to whistle it down to second base. The penalty ended up helping St.
Louis to a go-ahead goal.
</P>
<P>
   But so it went. Nobody expected either goalie to linger long
into overtime. And Nieuwendyk, who has been a difference-maker
throughout the playoffs, took care of that.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, this best-of-seven series remains firmly in their mitts
this morning. But don't show the tape to Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred _ or the other guy.

FUHR SHOULDERS BLAME FOR BLUES' LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ St. Louis played well enough to steal Game 2 from a
beatable-looking Stars bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Blues goalie Grant Fuhr said his play best explains why Dallas
escaped with a 5-4 overtime victory instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well enough to win,'' Fuhr said. ``I don't think I
played well enough to win. That's the bottom line. If I play well
tonight, that's an easy win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr faced 25 shots, stopping 20 of them.
</P>
<P>
   No. 25 came 8:22 into overtime, with Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk
firing a wrist shot past Fuhr to end Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Blues players and coaches were left frustrated and annoyed.
Playing good enough to win had failed to earn them a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we deserved better,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville
said. ``We had the higher quality chances, and we didn't capitalize
at the right moments. Certainly, we proved we've got a chance
against these guys. It's not a hopeless situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Blues defenseman Chris Pronger: ``Definitely, it was there
for the taking. We let it slip a way a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had chance after chance after chance to bury an
unusually loosey, goosey Stars bunch.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange situation midway through final period of
regulation, Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor was all that stood in the
way of a Blues goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' usual goaltender, Ed Belfour, had fallen down while
trying to play a loose puck. As he scrambled to get back, Sydor
minded net while Blues center Mike Eastwood wheeled behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the drama, St. Louis was unable to get a shot.
</P>
<P>
   So while Fuhr blamed himself, his Blues teammates were willing
to shoulder a bit of that load, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant has been winning some hockey games for us, and he's been
making some big saves. Tonight, too,'' Blues center Pierre Turgeon
said. ``He kept us in the game. We had some chances to score, but
we didn't put it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   He, in his mind, played poorly. He said goal No. 1 by Stars
winger Jamie Langenbrunner, a slapper that just trickled between
his legs, was stoppable along with Nieuwendyk's game winner that
sailed under his glove hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just gave him a little too much room,'' Fuhr said of
Nieuwendyk. ``I saw it, but he shot it up in a spot that's hard to
get at. If I'm on my angle like I need to be then he doesn't have
that spot to aim for.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Nieuwendyk: ``Fuhrsy is a good goaltender, and normally I
like to stay away from his glove hand because I know how good it
is. ... But I kind of like taking that kind of shot, too, and I was
just able to get it by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock summed it up best when he
said:,''It was a tough night for goaltenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour struggled as much, but St. Louis failed to finish.
</P>
<P>
   As for Fuhr, Quenneville hardly looked alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhr hadn't exactly played stellar hockey to open the Phoenix
series. But in the final three games, when the Blues had to win or
go home, he was spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuhrsy is a competitive guy, and he knows his game pretty
well,'' Quenneville said. ``He'll bounce back from something like
that. He'll be the guy when it counts. That's for sure.''

COLORADO RAPIDS QUENCH BURN IN SHOOTOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ At the very least, all four of the Burn's home games
this season have been exciting.
</P>
<P>
   And until last night's game against Colorado, the Burn had
boasted a perfect home record to go along with those performances.
But a 2-1 shootout victory by the Colorado Rapids, after an
88th-minute equalizer from Burn forward Jason Kreis, ended that
streak for the Burn. The game also ended Colorado's all-time
winless streak at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn (4-4) still hasn't lost in regulation this season, but
last night's game was the fourth shootout loss. That didn't take
the sting out of having nothing to show for a second-half offensive
upswing that accounted for a team-high 21 total shots to offset a
sluggish start for the Burn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really becoming way too much a part of the game for me,''
Burn coach Dave Dir said after the shootout. ``We played 90
minutes, and all of the strategy goes into who's taking the kicks.
I decided to just put that aside and play for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy prompted Dir to make three second-half
substitutions for an offensive boost. Two of those were midfielder
Ted Eck _ one of the Burn's most consistent shootout candidates _
and newly acquired forward John Jairo Trellez, another solid
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The third subsitute, forward Dante Washington, benched in the
first half when Trellez made his first Burn start, provided the
most significant punch. With two minutes remaining, Washington had
one of the grittiest plays of the game in assisting Kreis's goal.
He collected a cross from Mark Santel, but was unable to get a shot
off, slotted the ball over Rapids goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann and
past defender Marcelo Balboa to Kreis, who slammed it into the net
to tie it at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Burn had less luck in finding its scoring touch after
regulation ended. Only midfielder Leonel Alvarez managed a goal off
Hahnemann, who recorded three shootout saves.
</P>
<P>
   Burn goalkeeper Matt Jordan came up big as well, with three
shootout saves of his own. In regulation, however, Jordan was
defenseless against a Colorado set piece _ a perfectly placed
corner kick from Limpar Anders to Paul Bravo for a header into the
net. Including last night's game, three of four regulation goals
against the Burn have come off corner kicks or free kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't disappointed with how I played,'' said Jordan. ``But
as a team we need to get sharper on set pieces. That's really the
only way we've gotten scored on this year. That's something we have
to keep practicing and working on.'' / nn

STARS' BELFOUR PROVES HUMAN IN OVERTIME VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ AND MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Ed Belfour, almost superhuman for the first five
postseason games, returned to mere mortal status last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars goalie gave up four goals, including three in the
second period. He hadn't allowed more than two in any of the first
five games.
</P>
<P>
   But even on a night when he was human again, Belfour was good
when he needed to be. He shut out the St. Louis Blues in the third
period and didn't allow a goal in overtime, allowing Joe Nieuwendyk
to score the game-winner in the Stars' 5-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to stay with it and stay positive,'' said Belfour,
who stopped seven shots in the third period and another three in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour entered the game with a 1.18 goals-against average, best
in the NHL postseason.
</P>
<P>
   He had a shutout streak of almost 132 minutes, which he extended
to 150 minutes, 28 seconds by shutting out the Blues for most of
the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The streak ended when the Blues' Pavol Demitra scored with 33
seconds remaining in the period. It was a soft goal, one Belfour
saw all the way but still let trickle between his legs and over the
line. Still, he is entitled to the occasional mistake, isn't he?
</P>
<P>
   However, that one goal that shouldn't have been opened the
floodgates for the three-goal second period.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour is a temperamental goalie. In the past, mistakes have
unnerved him. But Stars coach Ken Hitchcock wasn't overly concerned
going into the third period and the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it affected Eddie at all,'' he said.
 &LR; subheds:America's funniest videos  &LR; body:Belfour did have a faux
pas in the third period that could have cost the Stars the game. He
strayed from his crease to play a puck, but caught his skate in a
rut on the ice and fell down. The Blues, trying to kill a power
play, had a chance for a shorthanded goal but didn't score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to laugh about that when you win,'' Belfour said.
``Guys were saying that there was a sniper in the crowd.''
 &LR; subheds:Chambers hurt  &LR; body:Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers
injured his knee late in the second period and did not return after
``locking'' ankles with the Blues' Chris Pronger.
</P>
<P>
   The oft-injured Chambers said he couldn't tell how severe the
injury is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it's a new one for me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to be X-rayed today.
</P>
<P>
   Before the injury, Chambers had played 13 minutes and 27
seconds, more than Richard Matvichuk and just 19 seconds fewer than
Sergei Zubov. It was clear the Stars' coaching staff was working
hard to use Chambers, who had been exceptional in the absence of
Derian Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a player where the more \Rtime\S you give him, the better
he plays, and the less he plays, the more he distances himself from
the group,'' Hitchcock said before the game. ``We've got to find a
way to get him in \Rthe game\S as much as possible.''
 &LR; subheds:Hatcher returns  &LR; body:Stars captain Derian Hatcher gave
himself mixed reviews in his first game back after a seven-game
suspension for a hit on Jeremy Roenick that broke the Phoenix
Coyotes forward's jaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little hesitant more than anything,'' Hatcher said.
``As the game went on I was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher was credited with four hits _ but only one after the
first period _ as well as a shot and a blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give the guy a break,'' Stars forward Brett Hull
said. ``He's nervous. He doesn't want to come into the lineup and
have things go wrong.''  &LR; subheds:Suspensions served  &LR; body:Stars
winger Pat Verbeek and St. Louis winger Jamal Mayers each sat out
last night's game because of suspensions handed out by the NHL
after slashing incidents in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek, who had just returned after missing seven games with a
knee injury, is expected to return for Game 3. However, its unknown
on what line he will play.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock played Verbeek on a line with Joe Nieuwendyk in
Verbeek's one game back. Hitchcock returned to the second line of
Nieuwendyk, Benoit Hogue and Jamie Langenbrunner last night and
that line clicked for two goals. Hitchcock broke up the line in the
third period, though, as he moved Hogue back to centering the line
of Mike Keane and Grant Marshall.  &LR; subheds:Record sellout  &LR; body:The
Stars played host to 17,001 fans last night, their sixth
consecutive playoff sellout and their 41st consecutive Reunion
Arena sellout _ a record for Reunion Arena. The old record was 40
games, set by the Mavericks in the 1986-87 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have set a total attendance record of 693,225 this
season.

<P>
   After Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk had major surgery on the
anterior-cruciate ligaments in both knees last May, Cooper told
Nieuwendyk it would be at least one year before he would completely
recover. A year and one day later, Nieuwendyk appeared to be back
to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars center celebrated the anniversary of the most
debilitating operation of his career one day late last night as he
an assist and two goals, including the overtime game-winner in a
5-4 Stars victory in front of a record sellout crowd of 17,001 at
Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it would be one year before I felt any good,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``I feel pretty good tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was actually off by a few weeks. Nieuwendyk has felt good
throughout the playoffs. His performance last night gave him a
team-leading five goals and two assists for seven points in six
games. He's the biggest reason the Stars have won all six of their
playoff games and have a 2-0 series lead on the Blues in the
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals heading into Game 3
tomorrow in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever the Stars needed a hero in these playoffs, last
night was it. Goalie Ed Belfour had his worst game of the
postseason, allowing four goals on 34 shots, including two-long
distance goals that helped rev up a tired Blues team. The Stars'
defense also had its worst game, despite a strong return by
suspended captain Derian Hatcher. And the Stars' power play
continued to strike out, going 0-for-4 to drop the Stars' NHL-worst
power play to 2-for-33.
</P>
<P>
   But Nieuwendyk wasn't about to let that stand in the way of a
Stars victory. He set up Jamie Langenbrunner with a slick pass for
the first goal of the game at the 7:50 mark of the first period
then gave the Stars new hope with a second-period tying goal after
the Blues had taken a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And he saved his biggest show of heroics for his NHL-leading
third game-winning goal of the playoffs. After being sprung on a
rush by defenseman Sergei Zubov's pass, Nieuwendyk faded to the
right on his off wing and then fired a left-handed snap shot that
buried itself in the far upper corner of the goal at the 8:22 mark
of overtime.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just a shot that invigorated the crowd and took the
pressure off his teammates, it also stuck a dagger into a Blues
team that really thought it had stolen Game 2 and taken home ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, it was there for us today,'' Blues captain Chris
Pronger said.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Joel Quenneville added: ``I thought we deserved better. We
had the higher quality chances.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nieuwendyk finished his chances. The overtime shot was a
mirror image of Nieuwendyk's second-period goal and also a mirror
image of a third-period shot he took that caromed off the cross
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk also went 13-11 in the faceoff circle, continued to
play physically in front of the net and continued to be a spark for
a series of wingers who are seeing success on his line. So far,
Langenbrunner, Pat Verbeek Benoit Hogue and Dave Reid have been
benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the line has played very well,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``But Nieuwendyk is the catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Nieuwendyk, who missed all but the first game of
last season's playoffs after wrenching his knee on a hit by San
Jose Sharks defenseman Bryan Marchment, is ``making up for lost
time.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are simply amazed at his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it is, he's playing unbelievable right now,'' said
Hatcher, who returned from a seven-game suspension to play a
team-high 31 minutes and 39 seconds. ``Whatever reason he's doing
it, he needs to keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nieuwendyk was the clear leader, he was not without some
help. Langenbrunner had a goal and an assist. Mike Keane and Grant
Marshall brought an intense physical presence, and Zubov chipped in
two assists and was a plus three.
</P>
<P>
   That helped the Stars run off a franchise-record six consecutive
playoff victories and also helped them push their career playoff
record to 105-105. It also helped defeat a Blues team that saw a
one-goal, two-assist performance from injured leader Pierre Turgeon
and a two-goal night for winger Pavol Demitra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everyone that Game 2 was the most important for the
home team, and now we still have home ice advantage,'' Hitchcock
said. ``Even if \Rwe lose the next two games and\S it comes down to
a three-game series, we still have two at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Quenneville added, though, that the Blues are not through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we've proved we've got a chance against these
guys,'' he said. ``It's not a hopeless situation.''

HOFFMAN LEARNING HOW TO JUGGLE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Glenn Hoffman went from Dodgers manager to bullpen
coach during the winter and sometimes it is hard to tell which is
the more important job.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is responsible for monitoring the arms and the psyches
of the Dodgers relievers. He said Alan Mills, who allowed a
game-winning grand slam Friday night, has developed the resolve to
shake off a poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the year, he had a really bad outing and that stayed
with him for a little while,'' Hoffman said. ``But he was new to
the team and he didn't have the confidence he has now. He knows
there are going to be nights like that. I also know he is more
comfortable being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday night, the April 9 game vs. Colorado was the only
time Mills allowed a run. He pitched two-thirds of an inning that
night and gave up two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Mills entered Friday's game with nine consecutive scoreless
innings. Until Antonio Osuna can pitch regularly after developing
more bone spurs in his right elbow, Mills is the only hard-throwing
right-hander in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Antonio is so important,'' said Hoffman, a former
shortstop who also managed five seasons in the minors. ``He gives
us the option of using two hard throwers and a left-hander before
we get to (Jeff) Shaw. The most important thing out there is that
guys know their roles. It's a juggling act during a season, so
there has to be a lot of communication. I never worked with
pitchers this directly. It's a great education.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting time: Jose Vizcaino acknowledges he struggled in spring
training after learning Mark Grudzielanek had been given the
starting shortstop job. Vizcaino had it last year until a badly
sprained right ankle ended his season June 21.
</P>
<P>
   But with Eric Young (right calf) sidelined for the fourth
consecutive game Saturday night, Vizcaino played second, his sixth
straight start and 12th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need E.Y. in there, but I am ready when they need me,''
said Vizcaino, who is 15 for 46 (.326) at the plate in games he
starts. ``When I am not playing, I still stay ready and I think
that preparation has helped me the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Todd Hundley doubled in the fourth inning to extend
his hitting streak to seven games. During that stretch, Hundley is
batting .417 (10 for 24) and has raised his average from .141 to
.231. He also has five doubles and two homers. But none of it has
come from the right side. The switch-hitting Hundley is hitless in
nine at-bats right-handed this season.... Dodger Stadium always has
been a pitchers' park but not this season _ 40 home runs were hit
in the first 13 games, an average of 3.1 per game. That is up from
1.8 in 1998.

ROOKIE RESCUES RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANGELS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The weekend easily could have become an exercise in
bemoaning what was lost. Instead, while Mo Vaughn struggles along
with the rest of the ailing Anaheim Angels, the Red Sox have seized
the opportunity to highlight what is still here and what may be
arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Righthander Juan Pena's coming-out party Saturday afternoon was
almost as sensational as Pedro Martinez's 15-strikeout command
performance the night before. The 21-year-old Dominican rookie, who
grew up not far from Martinez in Santo Domingo before moving to
Miami as a teen, held the Angels to three hits _ including a Vaughn
single _ over six innings, walked one, and struck out eight to
emerge as a 6-1 winner in his big-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not comparing their stuff, but in terms of maturity, he
reminds me of an 18-year-old Doc Gooden,'' said Red Sox bullpen
coach John Cumberland, who last season at Pawtucket taught Pena his
slider and 15 years ago was Gooden's pitching tutor with the Mets.
``They have the same kind of mental toughness. (Pena) has a quiet
cockiness. He's very confident in himself and his ability to pitch
in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena, called up Friday night only because Bret Saberhagen went
on the disabled list and starting only because Tim Wakefield was
needed in the bullpen, became the first Sox pitcher to win his
debut since Vaughn Eshelman beat the Yankees May 2, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, winners of three straight games after losing six of
eight, had a dozen hits, including three apiece by Troy O'Leary and
Jose Offerman, breaking open a 2-1 game with four runs in the sixth
off starter Tim Belcher (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary began the surge with a double, Offerman singled home two
runs, and Scott Hatteberg (single), in his first game back from the
disabled list, and John Valentin (double) drove in the other runs.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a
line-drive single off Belcher's shoulder in the second inning and
scored the Sox' first run on a bases-loaded sacrifice fly by Darren
Lewis, back after serving a three-game suspension. O'Leary's
two-out single in the third scored Reggie Jefferson, who had been
hit by a pitch, and gave him a team-best 20 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen Juan pitch, but I'm happy for him _ I know how
hard it is to establish yourself and win that first game,'' said
reliever Derek Lowe, who spelled Pena and breezed through three
scoreless innings of one-hit relief. ``He certainly didn't look
nervous. He came out and threw a lot of first-pitch strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena, who throws a variety of off-speed pitches, including a
split-fingered fastball, curve, and slider, did not allow a hit
until Darin Erstad's two-out double in the third scored Jeff Huson,
who had drawn the Angels' only walk. He set down six more in
succession until Matt Walbeck grounded a two-out single in the
fifth, an inning that ended with Lewis making a nice running catch
of Huson's drive to left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's opposite-field single against an overshifted infield
with two out in the sixth was Anaheim's only other hit off Pena.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fabulous,'' Hatteberg said. ``I can't think of one
pitch we'd take back. He threw whatever he wanted. It was fun to
catch because you could use your imagination. He could throw all of
his pitches on different counts. There were no parameters to do
whatever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when Mo came to the plate, he didn't change his game plan
for anybody. He did a great job of not giving in to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Pena so effective, Cumberland said, is his motion.
``He hides the ball very well,'' said the coach. ``It's so hard to
pick him up. He's not overpowering, but he uses his fastball very
effectively to get outs with his breaking stuff. I had no doubts
the kid could go out and do what he did today.''
</P>
<P>
   In two games against the Red Sox this weekend, the Angels have
one run and 10 hits. In their last six games, they've scored just
nine runs and collectively are batting .180 (35 for 194). Vaughn,
who has just resumed playing first base after injuring his ankle in
a fall into the visitors' dugout in his first game as an Angel, is
flailing along with his teammates; he has one single and four
whiffs in eight at-bats here, and is 3 for 19 on the team's trip.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Angels are on the disabled list, including outfielder Tim
Salmon, who led the team in home runs and RBIs until spraining his
left wrist last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everyone we face is Cy Young,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``We're striking out eight times a game. That's
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro Martinez? I can understand that. Pena, no. I don't have
an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   For one afternoon, at least, Pena was the answer for the Sox.
Beyond that, manager Jimy Williams refused to be drawn into making
any future commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We savor today,'' he said. ``Let's enjoy today for what it's
worth. The kid had a great first game.''

THERE WAS NO (PIT) STOPPING SAWYER

 200-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Jeff Green knew it. Elton Sawyer did, too.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly most everyone in the crowd of 28,000 at New
Hampshire International Speedway for Saturday's NASCAR Busch Series
200 race was well aware Green had the car to beat.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious in the way Green blew past Sawyer on the third
lap and pulled away from the field; in the way he grabbed the lead
back midway through the race after loaning it briefly to Dale
Earnhardt Jr. after a pit stop; and in the way he led 150 of the
race's first 173 laps.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on Green's way to Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer passed up a pit stop when the leaders went in for tires
and gas with 27 laps remaining. Sawyer took the lead from Buckshot
Jones and held off Green down the stretch through a series of
restarts after three late-race caution flags.
</P>
<P>
   For Sawyer, it was his second Busch Series win in 303 career
starts and first since 1994. He won with an average speed of
103.220 miles per hour and collected $45,435.
</P>
<P>
   Green was second and earned $28,875 and Jeff Purvis caught Randy
LaJoie for third place on the last lap. Casey Atwood was fifth
behind LaJoie.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer actually figured he had a third-place car behind Green
and Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, the series points leader in a chase that has
tightened considerably, got caught on the outside with seven laps
to go and ended up in the wall between Turns 3 and 4. Instead of
picking up a top-10 finish, Earnhardt was 34th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff and Junior were quick,'' Sawyer said. ``I led the laps
early and Jeff went by me and he was just gone. They were
incredibly fast.''
</P>
<P>
   But they were no match for Sawyer _ the husband of racer Patty
Moise, who is without a ride this season _ and crew chief Rick
Viers at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer was running 10th when Viers made the call to stay on the
track while Green and Earnhardt and the other leaders pitted for
fresh tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think anyone would stay out,'' Green said. ``I
was kind of surprised. But I needed new tires. And if things had
gone the way we had planned, I probably would have been able to get
to the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there were way too many cautions.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Green was unable to get his new tires heated up to
make a good enough run at Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Sawyer, who finished a career-best fifth in the standings last
year, will take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost with cars that were very dominant and you lead a
bunch of laps,'' he said. ``This one we'll chalk up to maybe we had
a third-place car but we took home the trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   And chalk it up to perseverance, too.
</P>
<P>
   While Sawyer ran well at the start and was in the top three for
the first half of the race, he then ran into a rough spot in his
Lysol Ford.
</P>
<P>
   He missed second gear on a restart on Lap 108 and then drove too
hard into a corner on the same ugly lap and quickly slipped back to
12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have gotten disastrous,'' Sawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't. He battled back and before long was celebrating
his first win in five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt continues to top the Busch Series standings, but his
lead went from 95 points to 19. Earnhardt has 1,482 points, Matt
Kenseth 1,463, and Sawyer 1,453. Green jumps from sixth to fourth
with 1,330 . . . Adam Petty finished 24th after starting 39th and
retained his lead in the Busch rookie standings over Tony Raines,
who was 13th . . . Green, who hasn't had full-time rides the last
couple of seasons and was 32d last week, could not be too
disappointed with his runner-up finish. ``We've been in contention
to win every race this year,'' he said. ``I let us down last week
and we lost a bunch of points. I still feel we're in the hunt to
win this championship and we're still in the hunt to win a bunch of
races before the season is over.''

PENA GETS CAREER OFF GROUND

 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One game and the kid's already a legend. He's the stuff
of major league mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one-year-old Juan Pena made his major league debut for
the Red Sox Saturday and beat the Anaheim Angels, 6-1, with six
innings of three-hit, one-walk, eight-strikeout pitching.
</P>
<P>
   As Sox debuts go, it was something less than Billy Rohr's
one-hitter against the Yankees in 1967, but it was still pretty
good. And it got even better when the Red Sox told everyone that
Pena worked with the Fort Myers grounds crew last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters went to Pena and asked about raking the infield,
mowing the lawn, and putting the tarp over the diamond. We thought
he might be able to help Joe Mooney between starts. Juan wasn't
having any part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there working on baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He must have done some fine work. The Dominican righty was 8-10
(including a no-hitter) and led the International League with 146
strikeouts last year, but didn't have much of a chance to make the
Boston rotation this spring. He was in the visitor's clubhouse in
Durham, N.C., Thursday when he got the call to The Show. Instead of
hurling against the Durham Bulls Friday night, he was to start
Saturday at Fenway against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a performance. Pena fanned Mo Vaughn (swinging) on
four pitches to complete a 1-2-3 first. He didn't give up a hit
until the third and turned the game over to Derek Lowe after the
Sox made it 6-1 in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw a lot of first-pitch strikes,'' said Sox manager Jimy
Williams. ``He got his breaking ball over. There was a lot of
deception out there. He showed composure and mound presence. The
kid had a great first game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena doesn't pop the catcher's mitt like his countryman, Pedro
Martinez, but his mixed bag of curves, changeups, and
split-fingered fastballs kept the Angels off balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said all along that we had a lot of depth on this staff,''
said proud pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``This is a tribute to our
scouting and our system.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena moved from the Dominican to Miami when he was 16 and was
drafted by the Red Sox in the 27th round of the 1995 June draft
(the month he turned 18). He pitched four seasons of minor league
ball before the Sox invited him to spring training in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen him before,'' admitted Williams. ``I wasn't
sure who he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena pitched only seven innings (giving up four hits and no
runs) before he was cut in Florida. He was 3-1 with Pawtucket when
the call came Thursday. Tim Wakefield was in the bullpen, Bret
Saberhagen was bound for the disabled list, and the Sox needed an
emergency starter.
</P>
<P>
   Nice start. Williams would not say what's next for the kid
(``let's savor today''), but he'll be hard to send down after this
performance.
</P>
<P>
   While Pena politely answered questions about his extraordinary
introduction, pitchers and ex-pitchers in the Sox clubhouse
recalled their first appearances in the big leagues:
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen: ``I was in the bullpen and Dick Howser brought me in
to face the Yankees (in 1984). I don't even remember who the hitter
was, but Don Slaught was catching and I threw a curveball which I
thought was a strike but it went back to the backstop because
Slaught had called for a pitchout. So my first pitch in the big
leagues went to the backstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan: ``I had a 1-2-3 inning of relief against Houston. It
was Larry Dierker's no-hitter. I knocked him down with a pitch in
the eighth inning, and all the fans were booing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Corsi: ``It was in 1988 and I was with the A's in relief in
Milwaukee. Rob Deer, the first batter, hit a double off a hanging
slider. Then I balked. I also had a walk and a strikeout, but I
didn't give up a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield: ``I beat the Cardinals, 3-2, in 1992. It was a
complete game and I struck out 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez: ``I was with the Dodgers and had been in the bullpen
for 12 days and we were losing, 8-0, and we had made seven errors.
They called for John Candelaria but he said, `No, I'm not gonna
pitch.' That's what got me in. I pitched two innings. I did good.''
</P>
<P>
   Pena did even better Saturday. Memo to Globe readers: Learn some
Spanish. If Ramon Martinez comes back and Pena stays around, the
Sox could be working toward baseball's first all-Dominican pitching
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't tell Juan Pena he worked for the grounds crew. He
wasn't mowing the lawn. He was mowing down the Angels.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Walter Zenga could save neither the
Revolution nor himself Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. Zenga departed midway
through the second half with a strained right groin, and the
Revolution held on for a 0-0 regulation-time tie against the Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution did gain something from the match _ a point
from the shootout, their first at Foxboro Stadium this season. And
they discovered a viable backup to Zenga in Jeff Causey, who kept
the defense organized and allowed the Revolution to coordinate the
attack late in the match.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution have struggled at home, they remained tied
for third place with Tampa Bay with 7 points in seven games. Now,
they face three successive road matches with Zenga questionable,
but they can likely count on the return of players such as John
Harkes from injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 0-0 game is never fun for a forward,'' Revolution striker
Joe-Max Moore said. ``But we can only improve. I'd like to see what
we will be like when we are 100 percent. We could be an exciting
team, but nobody has seen it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution did demonstrate resourcefulness, and they are
fortunate that other teams in the conference are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hoping to get some 3-point victories and separate
ourselves a little bit,'' Moore said. ``We've done it before on the
road, and that could put us at the top of the standings.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami clogged the midfield and counterattacked with lone striker
Diego Serna. The tactic was effective in the first half, as Serna
was stopped by some shirt-tugging from behind and a controversial
offside call.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution improved their midfield play in the second half,
as Edwin Gorter played his first full game of the season. Gorter
lined a 30-yard blast off the left post in the 85th minute, and
substitute Jamar Beasley threatened on the left side late in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution's best chance might have been a Kris
Kelderman shot that was cleared off the line by John Maessner in
the 11th minute of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which remained in last place with 5 points in eight
games, absorbed the Revolution's early pressure. And the Revolution
simply did not display the midfield coordination to break down a
resolute and well-organized defense.
</P>
<P>
   An early play typified the Revolution's inability to penetrate
through midfield: Johnny Torres and Mike Burns failed to connect on
a give-and-go at the halfway line, and the Revolution surrendered
possession instead of breaking on what would have been a dangerous
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Fusion threatened as Serna crashed through the
Revolution defense but was pulled down from behind by Brian Dunseth
in the ninth minute. This was the type of foul only the home team
or veteran players are usually allowed. But Dunseth, returning to
his best position in central defense, gained the benefit of the
doubt from referee Bob Sheker.
</P>
<P>
   Serna set up Maessner in the 29th minute, but Zenga saved with
the bottom of his feet. In the 43d minute, Serna sent Nelson Vargas
through, but again Zenga blocked the shot, and Serna sent the
rebound high and wide.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of Zenga's trouble came early in the second half,
when he scuffed a goal kick, which nearly resulted in a Miami goal,
but Burns recovered to stop Serna in front of the goal. Causey
entered in the 67th minute and soon saved a Vargas shot. He then
deflected a Serna header off a Vargas cross and punched away the
rebound in the 88th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Dos Santos scored the deciding goal in the shootout, the
first shootout victory for the Revolution this season.

TAKING CHANCES A RISKY BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When it comes to risk-taking, the Bruins will not be
confused with riverboat gamblers. Club Casino this is not.
</P>
<P>
   Their defensive game is a trap. On the attack, they emphasize
methodical puck control, not skate-and-shoot. If all the world is
racing to the craps tables, they're looking for the bingo hall,
where the payout can be huge and the risk mere pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe none of that makes for great tape at 6 and 11, but in 1999
the Bruins are one step closer to the Stanley Cup than they've been
since 1994. From conservatism comes reward.
</P>
<P>
   High-end risk, by the Bruins' definition, was Kyle McLaren
giving up his defensive post in Thursday night's series opener with
the Sabres. As Jason Allison swooped behind the net, McLaren
meandered down from the blue line, anticipating a pass as Allison
turned out from behind the right post.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest,'' said McLaren, ``I thought he was going to
throw it to me sooner. For a second, I didn't know what he was
doing, and I'm thinking, `OK, what am I gonna do now?' ''
</P>
<P>
   He could have done the safest thing of all: Retreat to the blue
line and give up the opportunity. He could have pressed even deeper
in the zone, but that would have increased the chances of Buffalo
breaking out two-on-one or three-on-two.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if that happens,'' mulled McLaren, ``I'm going to get that
look, I'm going to get that stare that we're all familiar with.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the cobalt-piercing glare, with a word or two
tossed in, from coach Pat Burns. Had the puck eluded McLaren, the
Sabres easily might have turned it up ice and cashed in for a 1-1
tie. In that case, McLaren's skate back to the bench would have
been his own dreadful trek up Heartbreak Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching Jason, trying to see if he sees me,'' recalled
McLaren. ``You've got to make that eye contact, hope that you see
each other, and if you don't know . . .''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know, it's probably going to mean trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going for offense there,'' said McLaren. ``I was
kinda out of position, sort of the wrong spot at the wrong time.
Sometimes, if the chance is there, I'll take it. Usually, I'll
circle and go back to the point.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, McLaren stayed put and Allison saw him. In a
flash, the feed came out front and McLaren swatted it toward the
net as he simultaneously made his turn for the blue line. Parked at
the left post, Dmitri Khristich banged McLaren's shot/pass past
Dominik Hasek for the 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The risk won out over reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do that sometimes,'' said Allison. ``There's a
difference between gambling and being stupid. You can gamble if the
chances of it working are 70-30 and not 30-70. A situation like
that, he's got to go. Now, if he's coming in there hoping that I
can get the puck through three of their guys, well then that's not
a good decision. But that play, you have to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will take a 1-0 series lead into Sunday's matinee at
the Vault. For the remainder of the series, much will be made about
the teams' growing hate for each other, the one-on-one
confrontations won and lost, the battle of the goalies, and all the
usual fabric that comes with playoff hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting always draws a lot of attention, because there is more
of it at this time of year and two bodies colliding at high speed
brings out the barbaric best in all of us. No matter how many suits
and ties and bottles of chardonnay we see in the Vault's lower
bowl, some of that old Garden thunder always returns when a Bruin
pastes someone against the boards.
</P>
<P>
   What ultimately wins games, however, is the far more subtle risk
factor, which fits hand in hand with a team's talent and skill
level.
</P>
<P>
   Was there much risk in Guy Lafleur racing down the wing at warp
speed and cranking off those feathery, lethal slappers? Not unless
they were 3 inches off net, banged off the rearboards, and got
turned up ice. Most of the time, as we know, they dotted the top
corners for spectacular goals.
</P>
<P>
   Risk decreases as skill increases. If your team has enough
talent, enough skaters and shooters, then no one much worries about
the defenseman sinking low in the play. Paul Coffey made his share
of mistakes when he played on those great Oilers teams of the '80s,
but they generally got erased in the tidal wave of goals scored by
Mssrs. Gretzky, Messier, Kurri, and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston's first-round series with Carolina, Don Sweeney scored
a critical goal, also with an uncharacteristic dash (shall we say
``gamble''?) down from the blue line. Burns has his backliners
conditioned to think defense first and foremost, but when
conditions are right, they can jump into the play. He'll save that
stare if the odds are right, even if the results turn out wrong. He
has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston defensemen will have to jump up more in this series
than we're accustomed to seeing. Sweeney, McLaren, and Ray Bourque
won't be counted on to join the rush or force the puck, but with
Hasek in net, ultimately the time will come when they'll have to
play the odds, be cautiously aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be gambling, but it's the playoffs, and the time will
come when the chance not taken is the greatest risk of all.

TAYLOR EXPECTS SHARPER EDGE FROM SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If you were to encounter Tim Taylor in street clothes,
he would seem the picture of an English teacher _ intelligent,
soft-spoken, articulate.
</P>
<P>
   If you encounter him on the ice, you are more apt to feel him
before you see him. A quick stab from a stick in your shin, a
secret slash to the ankle, a sneaky maneuver during a faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins' top defensive center talks about most aspects
of pro hockey, he is serious and analytical. When he talks about
getting under the skin of opponents, however, he is almost gleeful.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the 1996-97 Stanley Cup-winning Detroit Red
Wings and learned what it is to go after an opponent with the
ferocity of a jungle cat. Taylor now is doing his best to pester
the always-aggravating Buffalo Sabres in the Eastern Conference
semifinals against Boston, which resume Sunda with Game 2 at the
FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said it was too soon for there to be any
playoff-style hatred between Boston and Buffalo. He believes it
will come, perhaps as soon as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to see a personal battle? Watch Colorado and
Detroit,'' said Burns. ``I don't think we have any personal
battles. It's too early in the series. This is what playoffs are
all about. As the series goes on, as you play more games, the hate
factor comes into effect.''
</P>
<P>
   It took almost no time at all for familiarity to breed contempt
in the Bruins' opening-round series with the Carolina Hurricanes,
less than one period even.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to be a tough series but I think the
first 10 minutes of the first game developed the rivalry pretty
quick,'' said Taylor. ``You'd think one or two games and then it
would start, especially teams that don't play each other a whole
bunch. But the chippiness brought the rivalry out.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has had some hard-fought rivalries with other foes when
he was with the Wings. He and then-Chicago defenseman Chris
Chelios, now with Detroit, did big-time battle when they faced each
other in the postseason. He also was fighting tooth and nail with
Colorado's Claude Lemieux, another favorite villain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically everyone who comes across your path in playoff
time,'' said Taylor, suppressing a smile. ``You just try to play as
hard as you can and get away with as much as you can, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that first game against Carolina, I battled with (Keith)
Primeau a little bit. As the series went on and got more fierce,
he'd come at me a little harder. Early in Game 5, he hit me twice
good a couple of times. That just carried on in games as they
progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the series progresses, the hits become harder and they
become more intent on you noticing they're there. Early, it's
bumping and hitting to try to get the puck, later it's trying to
put you through the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob DiMaio, Taylor's linemate, said there was a great deal of
emotion early in the Carolina series that lasted throughout. He
expects it to develop with Buffalo, too. He and his teammates
already have seen things that they don't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like to hit, bang and crash, same as we do,'' said
DiMaio. ``They're not a fun team to play against and they have a
lot of guys who can get under your skin. A couple guys have taken a
few shots at Ray (Bourque) and that doesn't sit well with guys in
here. You can pick one and they all seem the same as that one. They
all seem to play the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the first game against the Sabres was more of a
feeling-out process, whereas the Carolina series was a dogfight
practically from the opening moment. However, after the last couple
of days, he can sense that things are starting to heat up between
Boston and Buffalo. He said the emotion, the ferocity, the
desperation, and the iron wills of everyone are likely to make for
a long, exhausting series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're standing in the way of what we want and we're standing
in the way of what they want and that's to go on to the next
round,'' he said. ``When someone tries to take that away from you,
you're obviously going to go after them in a good fight.''

AMERICA LOSING GAS STATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For 20 years, Mike Donley was the ramrod of the
pump islands and repair bays at his Union 76 station on Burbank
Boulevard in suburban Van Nuys. He relished the title.
</P>
<P>
   Then on a springtime Monday last year, he simply walked away
from the grease and the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Does he miss it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremendously,'' said Donley, who now works for a company
developing auto repair-related software. ``I can honestly say that
I actually envisioned me staying on until I was old and gray and
receiving that plaque as the oldest living 76 dealer. It was a very
hard decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case in matters of business, economics trumped
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Career moves like Donley's have been the rule rather than the
exception for most of this decade across California's service
station landscape.
</P>
<P>
   While the state's population _ and the number of drivers _ has
increased, the number of places to buy gasoline has declined. In
1991, there were 10,600 service stations scattered across
California, the nation's biggest gasoline market. That number had
shrunk to 9,490 by last year, according to state statistics.
</P>
<P>
   And this trend is not likely to reverse itself anytime soon,
industry analysts and officials say, as refiners wrestle with
daunting environmental costs, dealers grow weary of thin profit
margins and the industry consolidates even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline is not a growth industry in Los Angeles,'' said Don
Gunness, retail manager for Chevron Products Co., a unit of San
Francisco-based Chevron Co., one of the region's dominant
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Los Angeles area market is in a state of flux. Some
companies like Tosco Corp., Exxon Corp. and Unocal Corp. have
scaled or are scaling back operations, while companies like
Atlantic Richfield Co. and Chevron Corp. expand their presence.
</P>
<P>
   Further consolidation is likely, though. Texaco and Shell have
formed a marketing alliance that operates through an Equilon
subsidiary, so some of those stations in the same market area could
be closed or change nameplates.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon wants to buy Mobil, but federal regulators are expected to
require the companies to sell gasoline stations, refineries,
pipeline interests and other assets as conditions of approving the
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Arco is being bought by BP Amoco. And while there is little, if
any, overlap of their service stations in the Southern California
market, some analysts question whether the new, British-based owner
will be as committed to being the low price leader, and thus the
market share leader, as has been Arco's management.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, Texaco, the third-largest U.S. oil company, and
Chevron Corp., the fourth-largest, were reported to be talking
about a merger. These discussions are still in the early stages and
an agreement may not be reached for months, if at all, a source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it creates a situation that may eventually lead to a
blurring of brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these two come together, they will give the three other
supermajors a run for their money,'' said Fadel Gheit, an analyst
at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry's biggest landscape shifts occurred Dec. 22,
the deadline for the upgrade of buried gasoline storage tanks to
meet federal Environmental Protection Agency standards. Oil
companies had about 10 years to comply with the rule, and many
stations continued operating right up to the deadline, then closed
their doors for good. Their owners cited the cost _ potentially
hundreds of thousands of dollars per facility _ as reason No. 1 for
closing down.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than 800 stations nationwide closed in December,
then the number doubled in January, according to the widely read
Lundberg Letter, which tracks gasoline prices and related
developments. In February, the closures dropped back to a little
more than 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government delivered another kick out the door to marginal
gasoline retailers, leaving the landscape even more ripe for
super-tough street competition,'' publisher Trilby Lundberg wrote
in an April edition. ``The impact of the December 1998 deadline
will be felt for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lundberg conservatively estimates that 8,760 stations closed
during 1998 and the first quarter of this year. Nearly 1,600
stations went out of business between Dec. 17, 1998, and Jan. 22 of
this year. That's a shuttering of 1percent of the nation's service
stations in a one-month period centered around the federal
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The final count could go even higher because Lundberg notes that
her estimates do not cover many rural areas where closures were
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Unocal 76 facilities took a double hit.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they have to deal with the underground tank issue,
the stations had been bought by Tosco Corp. in 1997 and the new
owner embarked on a streamlining mission.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five stations, many of them franchised operations, closed
last year in California because of the federal rules requiring tank
upgrades. Additionally, seven stations quit pumping gas but the
mini-mart facilities remained open.
</P>
<P>
   Tosco closed 30 stations in 1997 because of duplication in the
immediate market.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason why there is a decline in sites is basically the
environmental regulation. They have become increasingly strict, and
independent business owners are taking a look at those costs in
what is a very marginal business and determining that the
expenditure is not feasible for them,'' said Julie Igo, a
spokeswoman at Tosco Marketing Co.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that property values have been rising, so station
operators can sell their sites at a profit rather than take on
expensive environmental remediation costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them are franchised and independent business owners
and just couldn't justify the cost of making these improvements,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of properties sport ``For Sale'' or ``For Lease''
signs these days.
</P>
<P>
   Others encircled by chain link fences, like several Chevron
stations throughout the San Fernando Valley, are in the midst of
complete remodelings as companies try to make over their image in a
highly competitive marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is an expensive proposition, costing $1 million or
more per station, said Chevron's Gunness.
</P>
<P>
   The company's major remodeling program has been going on for the
past five years and the company has added about 100 stations in the
Los Angeles area during that time.
</P>
<P>
   The company owns all new stations it builds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economies are better than a dealer-owned station. Chevron
enjoys the full gross margin on the products it sells,'' Gunness
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, service is being factored out of the operating
equation of service stations. It is more profitable and less costly
to operate mini-marts, fast-food facilities and carwashes than to
staff full-service islands or service bays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still researching what the future retail offerings for
the customer will be. We don't think this market is standing still
with the traditional convenience store. We're going to have to
enhance it and make future improvements,'' Gunness said.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be a case of less is more.
</P>
<P>
   One Texaco dealer, who asked not to be identified, said some
operators have already been told they will be switching to the
Shell brand or their stations will be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will close uneconomical sites and you haven't seen that
yet. All you have seen is the closing of sites that had
environmental costs associated with it,'' the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials were in Las Vegas for meetings last week and
unavailable for comment, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Donley, the former Unocal dealer, agreed that economics _
his _ was the reason he sold out last year. Today the new owner is
operating a self-service mini-mart facility.
</P>
<P>
   Donley decided the rent structure implemented by Tosco was not
working to his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you lower your profit margin and go for volume you could
actually lower your rent. What I saw over the years was the profit
margin got smaller and smaller, and the rents kept getting
increased,'' Donley said.
</P>
<P>
   Selling out was his best reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a couple of bucks, not enough to retire, paid off my
bills and moved on. There are guys in the Valley that have thrown
their keys under the door and walked away,'' he said.

FRUSTRATION BEDEVILING THIS ANGEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Somehow you knew the mood Mo Vaughn would be in. When
he was with the Red Sox, losing hurt him deeply. That hasn't
changed now that he's in the visiting clubhouse at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's 6-1 Red Sox victory over the Angels, Vaughn
greeted reporters with the grim face and cliches that always seemed
to get the message across when he played for Boston. He said he is
dealing with ``reality,'' which is to say it is a long season and
he is just starting to get comfortable after missing action because
of an injury sustained in Anaheim's opening game. He said the
Angels must stay ``focused,'' getting the most out of the players
they have until injured veterans Jim Edmonds, Gary DiSarcina, and
Tim Salmon can play regularly.
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn, coming back to Boston and going 1 for 8 over the
series' first two games _ both Red Sox wins _ has not been the
worst of it. He's more disappointed that the Angels are falling
behind in the American League West and he is not able to stop the
slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big personal thing,'' said Vaughn, perhaps the
most-watched man in Boston this weekend. ``My main concern right
now is the ball club. We've got to do things on a consistent basis
to be successful. This division is so crazy.'' Indeed, Saturday's
loss dropped Anaheim to 13-18 and last place, but no team in the
West is having a good year _ Texas, Oakland, and Seattle all are
hovering around .500.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn hasn't allowed the fanfare surrounding his return to
Fenway to change his focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weekend hasn't been a distraction,'' he said.
``Personally, I won't worry about my game too much. I work too
hard; it will flow. Being a part of this team, you have to do some
things to get some positive action going on. That's what we all
have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Vaughn is by no means satisfied with the numbers he's
compiled since coming back from a severely sprained ankle. Vaughn
has hit safely in 12 of his 17 games as an Angel, but he is batting
.258 and in the last five games, all on the road, he is 3 for 19.
The load for a team leader can get heavy, especially on a weekend
in your old hometown. Fortunately for Vaughn, he's been down tough
roads before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming in here that I haven't been swinging the bat the
way I wanted,'' said Vaughn. ``But things will come in time. It's
part of the game, and you go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn certainly didn't catch a break in his first post-Sox
appearance at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro Martinez is not a good guy to have to face when you're
coming back,'' he said of Friday night's 0-for-4, two-strikeout
game.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since Vaughn has had to carry so much of
the load. In Boston, he had the help of other veterans and could
lead the younger players by example. But the Angels, without
Edmonds, DiSarcina, and Salmon, have few answers for a Cy Young
pitcher like Martinez. Saturday, they were stymied by a long, lean
rookie named Juan Pena. Vaughn got one of the three hits off the
righthander, but he also struck out twice.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim manager Terry Collins refuses to allow his team to use
injuries as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are supposed to be major leaguers,'' he said.
``Major leaguers make adjustments _ I don't care who they are.
Today I believe I watched about seven (Boston) hits to the opposite
field. I saw guys from the other team making adjustments at home
plate. We're just not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to (Angels coach) Rod Carew talk about approaches.
He's talking to a wall. We're striking out eight times in a game.
That's ridiculous. Pedro Martinez? I can understand that. Pena,
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn agrees with his manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to make adjustments,'' he said. ``A guy like Pena
likes to move the ball away from the plate. You have to go out
there and get the ball where it is pitched. It took me to my third
at-bat to do something different. But that's the key to hitting.
It's not just adjusting game by game or at-bat by at-bat. It should
be pitch by pitch. You have to do something different to make
things happen. By the time we did it, it was much too late.''

OFFERMAN'S A NICE PICKUP 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-OFFERMAN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For Jimy Williams, it constituted a speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what you get,'' the Red Sox manager was saying
after Saturday's 6-1 victory over the Anaheim Angels at Fenway
Park. ``And what we see is someone who is very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally that would be enough for Williams, who tends to keep
his answers economical, if not informational. But in this instance,
Williams liked the subject matter: the success of second baseman
Jose Offerman through the first month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done everything we have asked him to do,'' said Williams
after watching Offerman raise his average to a team-high .368 with
a 3-for-4 afternoon that included two RBIs and a walk. ``We asked
him to DH, to play first, to play second. And he's been productive
in everything we asked of him. He's been nothing but a positive
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which should provide a degree of satisfaction for the Red
Sox, who were met with considerable skepticism when they signed the
30-year-old veteran away from the Kansas City Royals, with a $26
million contract through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman has been the Red Sox' most consistent player. He leads
the team in average, hits, doubles (he leads the league), stolen
bases, total bases, and multihit games. He has had at least one hit
in 25 of the Red Sox' 29 games and has had 14 multihit games.
</P>
<P>
   All of this he has done with the label of ``not being Mo
Vaughn,'' which was stitched to Offerman when he signed as Boston's
marquee free agent acquisition as Vaughn headed west to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try to compare myself with him,'' said Offerman,
repeating a mantra he has used since he joined the Red Sox last
Nov. 13. ``Mo Vaughn left. I didn't come here to replace him. I'd
love to have him on my team, there is no question about that. But
he's not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were surprised to be near the top of the American
League in batting average, Offerman shook his head. ``I'm doing
what I've been doing the past three years,'' he said. ``I'm not
surprised at all. I've been able to get on base. Any time I can do
that, I'm pleased with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He should be. He has been more than advertised, a steady hitter
who can play a variety of a positions for a team that has needed
all the production he has provided.
</P>
<P>
   If there was an extra sense of satisfaction with Vaughn in the
house this weekend, Offerman has not noticed it. ``I'm not out to
prove anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, at least, he proved that he is what the Red Sox said
they wanted when they signed him: a catalyst for offense.
</P>
<P>
   He led off the Boston first with an infield single off starter
Tim Belcher. He added another single in the third and capped his
performance with a two-run single to right in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said,'' said Williams, closing out his Offerman
monologue, ``nothing but positives from the young man. We couldn't
ask for more.''

OUTSIDE CHANCE FOR CREDIBILITY SQUANDERED 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After all of its hype and hoopla about radical change
following the Salt Lake scandal, the International Olympic
Committee is playing into the hands of skeptics who claimed the
Lords of the Rings would never really reform themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The all-outsider ethics panel that was supposed to handle the
remaining Salt Lake payoff cases promptly bounced the two most
delicate (South Korea's Kim Un Yong and Australia's Phil Coles)
back to the IOC's executive board, claiming it had enough to do
drawing up an ethics code. And the IOC 2000 commission, which was
supposed to have two dozen members split between Lords and global
luminaries, has ballooned to 80 _ 44 of them IOC members and
another 10 either international federation presidents or national
Olympic committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're saying is, we only trust people with our own
DNA,'' says John Hancock president (and chief IOC critic) David
D'Alessandro. ``It's all about Olympic cousins. What's happening
here is what usually happens when you marry your cousin. You get
cross-eyed results.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC insists that the reform commission's 26-member executive
board _ half Lords, half outsiders such as former United Nations
secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali, former US Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, and Nobel laureate Oscar Arias Sanchez _
will have the real power in changing everything from how the IOC is
structured to how Olympic host cities are picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real calls and shaping of things will be done by the
executive board,'' insists vice president Richard Pound of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Coles case has created an uproar Down Under, with critics
demanding that he resign from his post on the Sydney organizing
committee board as embarrassing revelations keep popping up. First,
it was Coles getting a Super Bowl junket from the Salt Lake people.
Then he and his ex-wife got $6,000 in jewelry from the Athens
people. Now, Coles is accused not only of funneling his personal
dossiers on fellow IOC members to the Salt Lake bidders but also of
trying to sabotage Melbourne's 1996 bid by giving advice to
Atlanta. ``There are certain people out to get me,'' says Coles,
who vows to soldier on . . . The abrupt departure of US Olympic
Committee business chief John Krimsky after 13 years and the
arrival of International Management Group as marketing hired gun
shows how dire the sponsorship issue has become. The USOC and Salt
Lake Organizing Committee were already running behind schedule
because they couldn't agree on their OPUS partnership deal until
two years ago. Then the payoff scandal stopped them cold; OPUS has
raised only $13 million since last June. Though several deals are
said to be in the pipeline, they're still more than $350 million
short of their goal . . . After nearly five months of rough
headlines, the Salt Lake organizers finally get to release some
balloons Saturday. They'll not only unveil their mascot (which
they'd planned to do in February) but also start the 1,000-day
countdown clock to 2002 . . . After the traditional global search,
SLOC chief Mitt Romney chose former Bain Capital cohort (and fellow
BYU alum) Fraser Bullock to be his chief operating officer.
``Another white male Mormon wasn't first preference,'' Romney
conceded to SLOC's trustees. But given SLOC's battered image and
fiscal woes, Romney wanted a seasoned manager (Bullock now runs a
Utah merger-and-acquisition firm) whom he knew well.

</P>
<P>
   Encouraging showing so far by the US men's ice hockey team at
the World Championships in Norway. After cruising through the
prelims, the Yanks lost to defending silver medalist Finland by
only a goal and should make the medal round if they beat the
Canadians Sunday. It's already a dramatic upswing from last year,
when a patchwork post-Olympic squad finished 12th and had to
survive a relegation tournament to stay in the A pool. The roster,
the usual blend of non-playoff NHLers, European clubbers, and
collegians, includes former Bruin Ted Donato, Boston College's
Brian Gionta and Mike Mottau, and Eagle alum David Emma plus Boston
University product Scott Lachance . . . This from the Twilight
Zone: Whose face appears on the Canadian media guide for the World
Championships? Steve Chiasson, the Carolina defenseman who died in
a car crash hours after the Hurricanes were ousted by the Bruins
last week. Chiasson played for Team Canada last year . . . Pleasant
opportunity to mingle with New England Olympians over cocktails and
hors d'oeuvres at Wednesday evening's ``Gathering of Olympians'' in
Weston. The event at Regis College's fine arts center (6-9 p.m.) is
open to the public, and tickets ($25, partially tax-deductible)
will be available at the door . . . First US team for next year's
Olympics will be chosen next month when synchronized swimming holds
its trials. Odds-on favorites in duet (there's no solo event) are
Anna Kozlova, who wore a nose clip for the Unified Team (ex-USSR)
in 1992, and Tuesday Middaugh. Banned from the trials is Bill May,
who woulda been a contendah with partner Kristina Lum if he hadn't
been born male. FINA, the international federation, still insists
synchro is for women only . . . Looks as though women's bobsledding
and skeleton sledding (i.e. headfirst luge) for both genders will
be added to the 2002 Winter Games program in June. The
international federation has given thumbs-up and SLOC agrees. All
that remains is for the IOC to go along.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Inspiring comeback by Boston triathlete Karen Smyers, who made
the US team for this summer's Pan American Games after two
injury-plagued years. ``This was great for my psyche,'' said the
37-year-old Smyers, who sliced a hamstring in a freak household
accident in 1997, then was hit by a semi truck while biking last
year . . . How far have the US males slipped in beach volleyball
since they went 1-2 in the Atlanta Olympics? The victory by
14th-seeded Ian Clark and Bill Boullianne in the recent Mexican
Open was the first by Americans in 29 international events since
1996 . . . After being ripped by women's soccer fans for not
showing the 1996 Olympic final between the US and China, NBC has
promised to broadcast ``virtually every second'' of every US
women's soccer, basketball, and softball contest from Sydney next
year. Not necessarily in network prime time, of course. Odds are
they'll be on CNBC or MSNBC, but that will still include most
American households . . . Olympic rings for figure skater Kristi
Yamaguchi and hockey player Bret Hedican (now of the Florida
Panthers), who met at the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. Wedding
date is July of next year . . . Brochures for ticket-and-travel
packages for the Sydney Olympics are now available from Cartan
Tours, the California-based firm that is the official US agent for
the Games. Call 1-800-818-1998 or check www.cartan.com.

DODGERS' BROWN STOPS MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown has been good, he just hasn't been
Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, that all changed with an 8-1 victory over the
Florida Marlins that reminded the crowd of 36,595 at Dodger Stadium
just why Brown is on the short list of the game's top pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   He limited the Marlins to three hits and a late-inning run
before giving way to closer Jeff Shaw in a game that was close
until the Dodgers scored six runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In his first six starts, Brown had a 3.32 ERA but was not
dominant. In his last start, he allowed six runs in six innings in
a loss to Philadelphia's Curt Schilling that broke a Dodgers
winning streak at five games.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Brown (3-2) wasn't being mentioned with Schilling,
John Smoltz and Pedro Martinez as baseball's best right-handers.
Even though some might say beating the lowly Marlins should come
with a disclaimer, Brown's name is back on the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley, the long- struggling catcher, extended his hitting
streak to seven games with a double and two singles. During that
stretch he has raised his average from .141 to .256.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a battery with some charge.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White added three RBI, and if that wasn't enough,
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek had a bases-loaded single that scored
two runs in the eighth inning. Grudzielanek entered the eighth with
just two hits in 33 at-bats with runners in scoring position and
had stranded two runners earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also got a productive night from third baseman
Adrian Beltre, who doubled and scored the first run and drove in
the second. With all the big-name talent on this club, second-year
third baseman Beltre has become one of the most consistent players
on the Dodgers. In his last 24 games, Beltre is 29 for 77 (.377)
</P>
<P>
   The six runs in the eighth came off a Florida relievers Antonio
Alfonseca and Vic Darensbourg.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, it was a pitching duel that featured former
teammates from the 1997 World Series champion Marlins. Florida
starter Livan Hernandez (1-4) allowed two runs and nine hits in
seven innings. He struck out seven and did not walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   But facing a vintage Brown gave the Marlins little chance of
repeating Friday night's late-inning victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were coming off that painful loss, when Marlins
rookie Bruce Aven beat them with a pinch grand slam. Saturday was
exactly the kind of game the Dodgers hired Brown to pitch. One loss
to the lowly Marlins upset the team. Any more would be too many.
</P>
<P>
   Although Luis Castillo opened the game with a base hit, Brown
clearly had his sinking fastball. He retired the next three on
ground balls and got 14 overall in eight innings. He allowed a
one-out opposite-field double to Cliff Floyd with one out in the
fourth but retired the next 10 batters in order.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive out came in the sixth inning when
Castillo rolled a bunt 10 feet beyond home plate. Brown ran it down
and threw an off-balance strike to first for the out. He fell to
ground and rolled in the grass after the play, receiving a huge
ovation from the crowd.

BYU SWEEPS TO TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The final showdown in the NCAA Men's Volleyball
Championship between the nation's top two teams never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a short spell in Game 3, second-ranked and No. 2 seed
Long Beach State barely showed any semblance of staging a serious
attempt to challenge top-ranked Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   What worked for the 49ers back in March, when they took the
Cougars by surprise and stunned them in Provo, Utah, was all but
missing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This time BYU kept the 49ers out of the match, with 24 team
blocks and overall more aggressive play, to avenge its only loss of
the season, 15-9, 15-7, 15-10, in the national championship match
in front of 8,026 at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the way we wanted it to end,'' team captain Matt Prosser
said. ``The ball just bounced their way tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who concluded their season 22-4, had their lowest
offensive output of the season, hitting .156 and were outblocked by
12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't our night tonight,'' Long Beach coach Ray Ratelle
said. ``We didn't do anything particularly good. Everything seemed
to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Tournament most valuable player Ossie Antonetti, who had 22
kills, 13 digs, and six blocks ran around the court hugging the
trophy while as many as 20 BYU fans jumped over the press tables to
join the Cougars in celebration before being toted off.
</P>
<P>
   Antonetti kept the pressure on the 49ers in Game 1 with nine
kills, and Ryan Millar had five of his 15 kills and five of his 13
blocks to help the Cougars win the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach had 13 errors in that game and hit a paltry .129.
</P>
<P>
   It got progressively worse for the 49ers in the second game,
when they matched their number of kills with 14 errors to hit .000.
</P>
<P>
   As he had on other occasions during the season, Ratelle subbed
Neil Mason for Dave McKienzie after the 49ers top hitter committed
an attack error that gave the Cougars a 8-3 edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely want to change things up when things are going
bad,'' said McKienzie, who led the 49ers with 19 kills, but
struggled offensively with a .115 hitting percentage. He set an
NCAA record 58 kills and hit .302 in the five-game winner at BYU
earlier in the season. ``We were hoping to get a momentum change.''
</P>
<P>
   It never came in that game, but it seemed possible in Game 3
when returned energized from a five-minute break and scored the
first seven points. But then BYU woke up from its stupor and made
incremental steps to hold the 49ers and tied the score, 7-7. They
took the 11-10 lead on a kill by Millar and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a matter of time, getting back into it,''
Millar said.
</P>
<P>
   For the 49ers, the match ended the way it pretty much started.
Off cue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, a little out of sync,'' setter Chris Seiffert
said. ``WE just never got a long run going. We hd one good run in
the entire match. We weren't jelling. We didn't put plays together
consistently. It was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   BYU, which leads the nation in hitting, had a .308 attack. The
49ers had 43 hitting errors, twice as many as BYU.
</P>
<P>
   Lambourne had 1 3 kills, 11 digs and six blocks, while Steve
Hinds had 14 kills, only one error, and 12 digs and five blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought for a long time that we had a good team,'' BYU
coach Carl McGown said. ``I think that tonight we had six players
on the court that played every well. There was no one star.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way BYU played tonight, they probably could have beaten us
even if we'd played well,'' Ratelle said.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach's season, however, has been marked by incredible
rallies. In their first match against BYU, they rallied from a
14-12 deficit in the fifth game to upset the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   The comebacks that had saved them in so many other matches,
never happened in this match.
</P>
<P>
   ``As hard as we tried the more things went wrong,'' McKienzie
said. ``Maybe it's not our year, but we worked real hard and we
didn't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were seeking the program's second national
championship. Overall, it was a successful season for the 49ers,
who began it ranked seventh in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really disappointing, but realistically this team
achieved more than any team I've ever had,'' Ratelle said, choking
up. ``We hope to now build on this success.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA NOTES: McKienzie and Seiffert made the all-tournament team
along with Millar and Antonetti, the MVP, from BYU, Scott Lane from
Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne, and Jose Quiones from Penn State. ...
The 49ers will hold their team banquet next Saturday at Papa's
Western BBQ and Saloon in Long Beach. Tickets are $25 for adult and
$15 for children 5-12. To make reservations, call Therese Butler,
(714) 842-9094. Tuesday is the deadline. ... The match will be
replayed on ESPN2 May 13 at 11 a.m.

IT WASN'T LONG BEACH'S NIGHT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Cosby has an old comedy routine in which he plays a
football referee at the coin flip before the Battle of Little Big
Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby flips the coin. General Custer wins, and says ``we will
receive.'' And he did, from the entire Sioux Nation.
</P>
<P>
   That was the way things went for Long Beach State's men's
volleyball team Saturday in the NCAA title game against BYU, and
you'll forgive the 49ers if they don't laugh. It hurts to lose a
national title game in any fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But the perspective that comes from time will allow them to
realize some things are unavoidable. There's no good or proper way
to catch an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   BYU won in three games, 15-9, 15-7 and 15-10, dominating most
every aspect of the game while the 49ers did nothing right, or at
least nothing right with any frequency. If that alone wasn't enough
abuse, the 49ers had to hear the passionately pro-BYU crowd of
8,026 in UCLA's Pauley Pavilion crow and exult. The BYU fans evens
co-opted 49er cheers, intimidating the 49er fans into silence.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Ratelle had nothing but nice things to say about the
Cougars, but he couldn't help but note the match went into a
serious nosedive early and that his team played perhaps its worse
game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were seriously discombobulated (SP?), with wrong
players in the wrong place receiving the wrong pass. ``We were so
out of synch,'' he said. ``They're a great team, but everything
that happened was on our side of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   As the third set began to go in BYU's direction, the 49ers were
reduced to prayer. ``You just desperately try to hang on,'' Ratelle
said, ``hope things turn around, maybe string things out long
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   What the 49ers did best Saturday was take the hit on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   At game's end, one could find Jim Polster clapping his hands in
preparation for the next point, which didn't exist. David
McKienzie, who plays hard and feels deeply, put his hands on his
knees and glared in defiance at the BYU celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Faber couldn't bring himself to believe the match was
over, so he pulled his jersey over his head and kept walking back
to the court, seemingly hoping someone would say there had been a
mistake and the game would keep going.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my heart, I knew we would win,'' Faber said. ``That's what
is so frustrating. There's no quit in this team. Even when things
looked worst, we still thought we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like BYU did anything different than they did when the
two teams met during the regular season, the 49ers winning that
match in five games. BYU attacked with 6-8 Ryan Millar in the
middle and All-American Ossie Antonetti and Steve Hinds from the
wings.
</P>
<P>
   Game one turned when BYU scored off three stright blocks. The
49ers self-imolated in the second, with six service errors and
McKienzie trying to overcome the flow with sheer force.
</P>
<P>
   ``As hard as I would try, things just continued to go wrong,''
said McKienzie, who bounced at least three spikes off BYU domes,
one catching Antonetti full in the face and bouncing ten rows up
into the stands. ``At least they go home with some scars.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the 49ers ran off to a 7-0 lead in the third, their
play was still choppy. Once BYU got back into the game, the scent
of the kill was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of solace available to make up for the loss. The
49ers began the season as just one of the many contenders from the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, with a young team that lacked
any break out star. They might be the first team in NCAA Final Four
lore without a first-team all-conference selection.
</P>
<P>
   (And before we let BYU slip out of town, something needs to be
noted: They may be only the second team outside the state of
California to win a NCAA volleyball title, but they did it with
nine Californians on their roster. There should be a NCAA rule that
teams have at least one homegrown player. BYU has zero players from
Utah. The closest you get to Utah on this roster is a reserve from
Muskogee, Oklahoma. Plus, I'm willing to bet 80 percent of the BYU
fans were from their zealous SoCal alumni base and were seeing
their first volleyball match.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, this team achieved more than any team I've ever
had,'' said Ratelle, who won a NCAA title in 1992. ``When you look
at all the parts of the season, it was quite a performance.''
</P>
<P>
   And they return all six starters for 2000 and add three new
recruits. The 49ers may begin next season ranked No. 1 in the first
preseason poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it wasn't our year. All I know is that we're all back,''
said McKienzie. ``There were bigger and better teams than us this
year.'' He hit the rewind button. ``Well, there were bigger
teams.''

BROWN STOPS MARLINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Brown has been good, he just hasn't been
Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, that all changed with an 8-1 victory over the
Florida Marlins that reminded the crowd of 36,595 at Dodger Stadium
just why Brown is on the short list of the game's top pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   He limited the Marlins to three hits and a late-inning run
before giving way to closer Jeff Shaw in a game that was close
until the Dodgers scored six runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   He threw the nasty sinker and overpowering pinpoint fastball
that made the Dodgers lust after him last December. And when it was
over, there were no cartwheels. Brown knows this is why he's here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt outstanding tonight,'' he said. ``I moved the ball well
inside and out.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first six starts, Brown had a 3.32 ERA but was not
dominant. In his last outing, he allowed six runs in a loss to
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling that broke a Dodgers winning streak
at five games.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Brown (3-2) wasn't being mentioned with Schilling,
John Smoltz and Pedro Martinez as baseball's best right-handers.
Every time his name came up, so did his record $105 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for him because I think a lot of the time he feels the
weight of the world is on his shoulders,'' manager Davey Johnson
said. ``He certainly is strong enough to handle it. He gave us a
great pitching performance tonight. He's been upset with himself
because he's been missing spots, but I haven't seen much to
complain about. Kevin thinks he has to do it all. He doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though some might say beating the lowly Marlins should come
with a disclaimer, Brown's name is back on the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   So is Todd Hundley's. Finally.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers scored only two runs until the eighth,
long-struggling catcher Hundley extended his hitting streak to
seven games with a double and two singles. During that stretch, he
has raised his average from .141 to .256.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a battery with some charge.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White added three RBI, and if that wasn't enough,
shortstop Mark Grudzielanek had a bases-loaded single that scored
two runs in the eighth. Grudzielanek entered the inning with just
two hits in 33 at-bats with runners in scoring position and had
stranded two runners earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also got a productive night from third baseman
Adrian Beltre, who doubled and scored the first run and drove in
the second. With all the big-name talent on this club, Beltre, the
second-year third baseman, has become one of the most consistent
players on the Dodgers. In his last 24 games, Beltre is 29 for 77
(.377)
</P>
<P>
   The six runs in the eighth came off Florida relievers Antonio
Alfonseca and Vic Darensbourg.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, it was a pitching duel that featured former
teammates from the 1997 World Series champion Marlins. Florida
starter Livan Hernandez (1-4) allowed two runs and nine hits in
seven innings. He struck out seven and did not walk a batter. But
facing a vintage Brown gave the Marlins little chance of repeating
Friday night's late-inning victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched good today, all my pitches were working,'' Hernandez
said. ``I went pitch for pitch with Kevin Brown, but unfortunately
he is the best pitcher in the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were coming off that painful loss when Marlins
rookie Bruce Aven beat them with a pinch grand slam. Saturday was
just the kind of game the Dodgers hired Brown to pitch. In the
eighth, he blew away Aven, making him look more like a guy who has
played in 24 big-league games.
</P>
<P>
   Although Luis Castillo opened the game with a base hit, Brown
clearly had command of his sinking fastball. He retired the next
three on ground balls and got 14 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who did not walk a batter, allowed a one-out
opposite-field double to Cliff Floyd with one out in the fourth but
retired the next 10 batters in order.
</P>
<P>
   He left after eight innings for pinch-hitter Dave Hansen. Brown
had made 106 pitches, but 21 came in the eighth inning when Derrek
Lee tripled and scored on a ground out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't made those pitches, I'm sure he would have stayed
in,'' pitching coach Charlie Hough said. ``To me he has thrown this
hard all season. But tonight his control was great. That was the
difference. That was the real Kevin Brown.''

   RAMSEY - ATLANTA _ When will it end? This week, a judge
overseeing the JonBenet Ramseygrand jury struck down a request for
television cameras in any initial courtroom proceedings, saying no
indictment was imminent. But that was just the latest in a series
of no comments and mixed signals regarding the conclusion of the
grand jury's work. Those believing the grand jury is wrapping up
note that the group has gone to meeting once instead of twice a
week, and that the jury alternates have been sent home. Also, the
district attorney from a neighboring county, who lent a prosecutor
to the grand jury, said he has reason to believe he'll be getting
the guy back by the month's end. But speculation continues to
swirl, especially considering that the grand jury was recently
extended for up to six months. Meanwhile, friends of the Ramseys
say they are taking it all in stride, and remain confident in their
innocence. (Schneider, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   PRAYER _ COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo. _ This parched mountain valley
at the foot of Pikes Peak is the new epicenter of American power
evangelism. At its core is an unprecedented urgency about prayer.
It radiates from dozens of Christian ministries such as the
conservative Focus on the Family, major promoters of the National
Day of Prayer, as well as the newly opened World Prayer Center,
Intercessors International and the Promise Keepers, farther south
in Boulder. As the millennium comes to a close, their message has
penetrated sanctuaries throughout the country, including churches
in the Miami Valley. (Lyles, Dayton Daily News)

   KOSOVO-CASUALTIES-0510 _ SPANGDAHLEM, Germany _ Like no other
major conflict in history, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia is
being fought to save lives and combat repression. With
humanitarian, not strategic, goals at its core, the mission is
perilously undermined every time an allied bomb kills or injures
civilians, as has happened at least eight times since the bombing
began March 24. The latest such incidents ? inadverdent hits on the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and a hospital and residential complex
in the Serbian city of Nis _ are precisely the kinds of disasters
that have the potential to galvanize and even inflame global
opinion against the air campaign. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-WARCRIMES-0510 _ KUKES, Albania _ For a week refugee
Filip Kolgjeraj sat every day outside the tent that was his
hospital ward, smoking cigarettes and waiting to get back the use
of hands and feet swollen like a grotesque Popeye caricature. The
43-year-old Kosovar Albanian, who doctors said could not walk when
he arrived, is a candidate to become a witness for war crimes
trials already being planned. Kolgjeraj, however, has disappeared.
Much improved, he walked out of the field hospital of a refugee
camp on Thursday and melted into the tens of thousands of Kosovars
swamping this city and dispersing throughout Albania. The mobility
of the refugee population _ the people who are victims as well as
eyewitnesses to what has transpired in Kosovo _ is one reason
prosecutions will be so tough. The refugees tell their stories and
then they scatter, and no one is keeping track of where they go.

   Previewing Star Wars: Along time ago, at a junket far, far
away....
</P>
<P>
   By Chris Garcia
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``We're going to whoop, right?'' said Natalie Portman
to the gangly young man sitting next to her before the lights
dimmed at Saturday night's New York press screening for ``Star
Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman, the 17-year-old actress who plays a young queen in the
feverishly anticipated space epic, was sitting three rows in front
of me, speaking excitedly to her friend, Ahmed Best, the guy who
supplies the squeaky voice for the film's amphibious,
computer-animated sidekick Jar Jar Binks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Best replied emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   And whoop they did. Well, sort of. When the lights went out and
the familiar words ``A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away''
appeared on screen, Portman issued a curt ``Yow!,'' and Best, with
many others at the crowded screening, applauded the way people do
when a band plays their biggest hit in concert. The room's
crescendo of giddy energy was palpable and catching.
</P>
<P>
   It was by far the strangest press preview I have ever attended.
I mean, I've never watched a movie in the company of Howard Stern,
``Phantom'' co-star Samuel L. Jackson, the future Darth Vader
(8-year-old Jake Lloyd) and his Earthling father, let alone Portman
and Best. There were
</P>
<P>
   scads of other important-looking people in attendance, too, but
I couldn't ascertain what their connections were.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, these seeming V.I.P.s weren't part of the press
corps _ they actually had some fashion sense, and weren't wearing
white tennies with slacks.
</P>
<P>
   So Saturday and Sunday was the big ``Star Wars'' press junket
for the national media, where most critics will have seen the movie
when they review it the day of its opening May 19.
</P>
<P>
   They call it a ``junket'' because the studio traditionally
heaves a bunch of cool junk on the attending journalists _
T-shirts, handbags, caps and all manner of non sequitur items
emblazoned with the movie title. (At one junket, no joke, I was
given a switchblade comb.)
</P>
<P>
   I think we were all looking forward to the goodies-blitzkrieg
Twentieth Century Fox would unleash on us, this being ``Star Wars''
and all, which has knocked out the Second Coming for most
anticipated event this millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we got: Two ``Phantom Menace'' posters. That's it.
Believe me, I'm not complaining, but I bet Roger Ebert, who was
sitting next to the goodies suite at the Regency Hotel wearing a
suspicious grin, got at least a Yoda shaving kit.
</P>
<P>
   Invited journalists registered Saturday at the Regency in Uptown
Manhattan. This is where we slept, as well, and where Sunday
interviews were conducted with a portion of the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Director-mastermind-bazillionaire George Lucas didn't do
interviews, opting instead for one big press conference, the way
President Clinton does it at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas spoke with candor Sunday morning about the film's critical
prospects and the need for fans to lower their expectations _
private screenings were held last week for theater owners and
specially recruited audiences and the early reaction has been
tinged with disappointment. ``I certainly expect the film not to do
well critically,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in a situation like this, with so much hype, you
can't possibly live up to that,'' he said. ``Some of the fans have
put themselves in an unfortunate situation ... they have these
amazing expectations about the film, which the film can't possibly
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   After a ``cocktail reception'' for the press Saturday evening in
the hotel lobby (the highlight: chilled prawns the size of a
Labrador's tail), we were herded to a pair of tour-style shuttle
buses, the dorky kind with tinted windows. It was raining.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-minute ride through much of chi-chi Uptown ended at the
new United Artists Theater 8 at Union Square on Broadway. That's
right _ a cookie-cutter multiplex, except that in New York stadium
seating is shockingly novel. This is the only theater in Manhattan,
according to a resident source, with stadium seating. Compared to
Austin's stadium seating, the place was itty-bitty, like baby
stadium seating.
</P>
<P>
   After the journalistic throng was nudged through four
checkpoints _ our passes were scanned with ultraviolet light beams,
our hands were stamped, etc. _ we entered the theater and took
seats. That's when I spotted Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny and casual in low-watt mode, she held a small bag of
popcorn and let out a loud ``Ahmed!'' when the lanky,
floppy-hat-wearing actor strolled in. She picked a tooth (pesky
popcorn) with her left index finger. It had a shiny ring on it.
</P>
<P>
   There was Stern, with a small but scary entourage. In came
Jackson, looking slick in a long black leather coat and black
Kangol cap, the kind he wore with such rakish panache in ``Jackie
Brown.'' Little attention was paid the celebrity entrances.
Everyone was playing it cool.
</P>
<P>
   Portman to Best: ``The weirdest thing anybody asked me was when
I was signing an autograph and they wanted me to write 'The Force
equals God.' I was like, 'I will not write that!''' She giggled.
</P>
<P>
   Someone from the studio finally spoke into a microphone to
introduce the movie. But not without a bit of advice telling us to
narc on anyone we saw video taping the movie. ``It would be
horrible for the movie to end up on the Internet,'' he said with no
trace of irony.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell how ``Phantom Menace'' played to this
unusual, invited crowd. People clapped and whooped when Liam Neeson
and Ewan McGregor's Jedi warriors doffed hoods to reveal their
faces and when loyal droids R2-D2 and a stripped-down C-3PO
appeared. Portman's first showing was met with modest response
(during the scene, she whispered to a young woman next to her), as
did the ridiculous Jar Jar's. He got fewer laughs than was
obviously intended, probably because most of the audience was over
7.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is frenetic and loud, and bloated with as much
computer-animated critters as ``A Bug's Life.'' Overheard from a
middle-aged woman on my way out: ``I loved it, much to my
amazement.''

   During a bathroom run half-way through ``Phantom Menace,'' I
stumbled upon a man and his small child having difficulty
re-entering the theater. Their hands weren't stamped.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you get in?'' asked the doorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stamped hands? This is Jake!'' yelled the man. He pointed to
Jake Lloyd, the boy who plays Anakin Skywalker, also known as Darth
Vader.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Jake how he liked his film so far. ``Good,'' he chirped.
``How 'bout you?''
</P>
<P>
   In all the noise coming from the screen, I don't think he heard
my response.

   &UR; KOSOVO &LR;  (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ NATO spared Belgrade from bombing
overnight Sunday, but said military targets there had not been
taken off the list despite Friday's mistaken attack against the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-INTELLIGENCE (Washington) _ The administration seeks
answers to intelligence targeting failure in the face of domestic
political reaction to the Chinese embassy attack. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHINA (Beijing) _ American diplomats said they were
``hostages'' in their offices, as tens of thousands of furious
demonstrators for the second day pelted embassy buildings with
eggs, stones, paint balloons and chunks of concrete, part of an
angry protest against NATO bombings of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHINA-ASSESS (Beijing) _ Through their extended campaign
to portray the United States and NATO as evil aggressors in
Yugoslavia, and now their endorsement of mass demonstrations,
China's leaders may have unleashed forces that will come back to
haunt them. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBIA (Podujevo, Serbia) _ Three months ago, Milos Savic
was frantic. He had been stopped at a checkpoint by the Kosovo
Liberation Army close to this northern Kosovo city and dragged out
of his car at gunpoint. The fear took him over, he said, and he
lost nearly 40 pounds. Today, Savic says he's feeling much better,
even as NATO airplanes bomb in the hills to the west. The KLA
checkpoints that began less then a mile from the city center are
gone, pushed back by the Serb offensive. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA-LEADER (Tirana, Albania) _ Hundreds of thousands of
uprooted ethnic Albanians are huddled in woods and fields inside
Kosovo under the protection of Kosovo Liberation Army fighters,
Hashim Thaci, prime minister of the rebel provisional government
said in a telephone interview Sunday from inside the embattled
province. `'The food supply is running very low, the medical care
is minimal and hygenic conditions are very bad,'' Thaci said. ``We
have the first signs of epidemics of various diseases among the
children.'' By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BULGARIA (Sofia, Bulgaria) _ On the political effects of
the Kosovo conflict. By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BRITAIN (London) _ On Tony Blair and the war. By Warren
Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA-VETS (MOSCOW) _ Russia lost as many as 27 million
people in World War II, and even a half-century later, the nation
honors its war veterans to a degree unimaginable in the United
States. Sunday's Victory Day celebration drew tens of thousands,
but the conflict in Yugoslavia seemed almost a subtext, popping up
in sermons, speeches and demonstrations. ``The Americans who fought
in the war must be ashamed today,'' said Victor Chumakov, 73, a
fighter pilot-turned-sniper in what Russians call the Great
Patriotic War. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER INTERNATIONAL NEWS: &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-U.S.-CHINA-SPYING (Washington) _ A 1997 case involving
a Taiwanese-American scientist working on a classified Pentagon
project demonstrates that the U.S. government knew that China
successfully engaged in espionage during President Clinton's second
term. By Jeff Gerth and James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-ELECTION (Soweto) _ In a country with a jobless rate
that may be as high as 40 percent and a crime rate that includes
140 murders or attempted murders a day, unemployment and safety are
the issues that top the agenda for most South Africans. But with
only four weeks to go before this country's second post apartheid
elections, corruption is emerging as a key issue too. By Suzanne
Daley.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-ISRAELI-EMBASSY (Bueno Aires) _ In a new twist in the
investigation of the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy that left
29 people dead, a tape recording of a police radio call has
suddenly emerged suggesting that officials purposely removed guards
from the facility three minutes before the blast. By Clifford
Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN-JOURNALIST (New Delhi) _ A prominent Pakistani
journalist who has been harshly critical of the government has been
detained and is being held in an unknown location. His wife said
Sunday that police dragged him from his bedroom, shoeless and
without his eyeglasses, early Saturday morning. By Celia Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS (Jerusalem) _ Israeli and Palestinian
officials hold talks to avoid a showdown over orders to close
Palestinian offices in east Jerusalem by early evening. By Joel
Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-ROMANIA (Bucharest) _ John Paul II's three-day visit to
Bucharest, which ended Sunday, is the first papal trip to a
predominantly Orthodox country in more than a 1,000 years, a bold
mission to mend the breach between the Eastern and Western branches
of Christianity. But for many Romanians, the visit was more than an
ecumenical milestone. It was also an opportunity to bask in rare
international attention and make its case to the West that Romania
belongs in Europe. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PENSIONERS (Ludony, Russia) _ Aleksandra Varfolomeyeva, a
vivacious 75-year-old who spent her working life on the local
collective farm, long ago stopped trying to figure out when she
will get her government pension of 400 rubles a month. As she sees
it, retrieving a pension from the backlog that has piled up is sort
of like a lottery. Either your number comes up, or it doesn't. By
Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Coded w)
</P>
<P>
   YOUTH-VIOLENCE-CONFERENCE (Washington) _ In a search for a
meaningful public response to yet another outbreak of schoolhouse
violence, President Clinton will convene a White House meeting on
Monday to address the causes of violence by teenagers. But behind
the White House summit is the president's fabled political realism
and a desire not to alienate two powerful groups with broad
political influence and very deep pockets: the NRA and Hollywood.
By John M. Broder and Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   HITECH-POLITICS (Seattle) _ While presidential candidates once
seemed to look mostly to Wall Street in their corporate
fund-raising pleas, the technology industry has emerged as an early
battleground for cash. And while the industry long prided itself on
its libertarian streak and almost dismissive attitude toward
whatever was happening in Washington, D.C., it is now contending
with so many major issues requiring federal attention that its
executives are responding to the candidates' appeals. By Sam Howe
Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE-PRESCRIPTIONS (Washington) _ Prescription drugs were
not much of an issue when Medicare was created in 1965, and thus
not included as a benefit. But 30 years later medicine has been
transformed by expensive new drugs to treat the ills of old age,
leaving millions of the elderly struggling to pay the bill, and
creating a struggle on Capitol Hill over coverage for outpatient
drugs. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-CIVIL-RIGHTS (Washington) _ In a sign of the ways that
both Congress and the leading civil rights groups have changed, the
big civil rights battles now are not about affirmative action or
school choice, but about access to bankruptcy courts and bank
loans. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   OFFICE-SURGERY (Undated) _ More and more surgery is being done
in doctor's offices, setting off a debate on how to insure
patients' safety outside of the more regulated setting of
hospitals. Although only a handful of states have enacted
legislation on office surgery, virtually all are examining the
issue because of a few widely publicized deaths and injuries. By
Abigail Zuger.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER-GOATS (Denver) _ Denver puts a herd of goats to work to
keep the weeds down in city parks. By Mindy Sink.
</P>
<P>

May 10.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-ARATON-COLUMN (Undated) _ The choice of Don Zimmer _ in his
crimped and cranky condition _ to be the temporary replacement for
Joe Torre as manager of the Yankees should raise a question that is
disturbingly decades-old: To what lengths will a professional
sports team go before it turns to a minority aspirant, if only to
fill in? By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-BERKOW-COLUMN (New York) _ Ricky Ledee, who was something of
a World Series hero and seemed ready to blossom, instead is off to
a terrible start. By Ira Berkow.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-LEFTY-RELIEVERS (Undated) _ Tony Fossas is a left-handed
relief pitcher and, though he is 41 years old, rarely throws above
86 miles per hour and has been with seven major and minor league
teams in the last two years, he is a precious commodity in a
baseball world where lefty relievers are so scarce that even
recycled veterans are valuable. Why are lefties so precious? Mostly
because they are so difficult to find. By Jack Curry. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-YANKS-MARINERS (New York) _ Seattle at Yankees, 1:35 p.m. By

<P>
   FBN-BROWN-NBA (East Rutherford, N.J.) _ The National Basketball
Association this season has suffered through a long, antagonistic
labor fight and glumly weathered the retirement of the matchless

running back Gary Brown has almost run out of things to buy at the
NBA Store in midtown Manhattan. By Bill Pennington.
</P>
<P>
   RAC-PREAKNESS (Baltimore) _ Advance to the Preakness, possibly
focusing on Silverbulletday. By Joseph Durso.
</P>
<P>
   OLY-SYDNEY-2000 (Sydney, Australia) _ In the countdown to the
Sydney Olympics _ now fewer than 500 days _ the recent focus has
been more on political problems than progress in preparations.
Sydney is ahead of schedule on construction and organization for
the 2000 Summer Games, which are scheduled to open on Sept. 15. Yet
controversies involving an Australian delegate to the International
Olympic Committee and the planned site on a Pacific bay for the
beach volleyball competition have entangled the local organizers.
By John Shaw.

   L.A.-IMAGE-TV (Hollywood) _ The small-screen perspective on Los
Angeles, focusing on the banal, the superficial and the glitzy, has

WHY SO MANY PEOPLE KNOW TO WEAR SUNSCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (js) 
 By SREENATH SREENIVASAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never before has such mileage been milked from 675 words. The
Chicago Tribune columnist Mary Schmich's column on June 1, 1997,
dispensing life advice in a mock graduation speech, has gone on to
become a mass e-mail message, a novelty book, and, now, a hit pop
song.
</P>
<P>
   Those words were a blend of common sense (``Wear sunscreen'' and
``Respect your elders'') and some not-so-common sense (``Do one
thing every day that scares you'' and ``Keep your old love letters.
Throw away your old bank statements.'').
</P>
<P>
   Two summers ago, they were picked up by an Internet prankster,
misattributed to the author Kurt Vonnegut as a graduation speech he
supposedly gave at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
ended up in millions of e-mail in-boxes around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Ms. Schmich expanded them into a 64-page book for
Andrews McMeel Publishing,  &UR;  &LR; ``Wear Sunscreen: A Primer for Real
Life.'' But no one could have predicted the musical twist to an
already twisted tale.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, the Australian film director Baz Luhrmann _ who
has made such movies as ``William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet''
and ``Strictly Ballroom'' _ acquired the audio rights for the
words, hired an actor to bring them to life and now has a bona fide
hit recording on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The song, ``Everybody's Free (to wear sunscreen),'' consists of
spoken words and a background track. The album it is on, ``Baz
Luhrmann Presents Something for Everybody'' (EMI Group's Capitol
Records has not issued a commercial single), has been out for about
a year, but only recently did it come to widespread attention,
breaking into the top 50 in the Billboard charts, with the track
becoming one of the most requested songs at radio stations around
the country. Last week, it was No. 18 on Amazon.com's &UR;  &LR; list of top
100 albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never heard anything like this before,'' said Billy
Hammond, a disk jockey at WHTZ-FM in New York. ``I've got parents
calling up asking me to play the song so that their kids can learn
from the lyrics.''
</P>
<P>
   At KROX, an alternative radio station in Austin, Texas, the
music director, Brad Hastings, ``latched on to it immediately,''
and put it into heavy rotation. ``Our core audience, the 12- to
18-year-olds, were jumping up and down for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as e-mail helped spread the original hoax message, the
Internet has kept the song going. Dozens of Web sites have copies
of the lyrics and there's even a ``Morph's Sunscreen Song Shrine.''
There has been much discussion and analysis of the song on Internet
news groups and there are sites that sell the album or link to
sites such as Amazon.com and CDnow.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success really is thanks to the combination of Internet
and radio,'' Ms. Schmich said. ``Reminds me of how puny newspapers
have become,'' she continued, acknowledging that nothing she had
ever written before had received such a response.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The recitation is by Lee Perry, an Australian voice-over
specialist, who put on an American accent and recorded the words
using a digital field recorder and a cheap pair of headphones.
</P>
<P>
   The song is not unstoppable. On Austin's KROX, one of the
earliest stations to play it, ``Sunscreen'' has been taken off
heavy rotation, down to seven times a week from a peak of 30 times
a week. ``The things that make it appealing at first also make it
irritating after you hear it too often,'' Hastings, the music
director, said.
</P>
<P>
   And there is already a backlash against the song. Even the
Sunscreen Song Shrine carries lyrics to ``Not the Sunscreen Song,''
a parody that offers advice such as ``Don't flush public toilets''
and ``Wear sunscreen, but only if it's that coconut oil that gives
you cancer.''

MITSUBISHI TO UNDERWRITE CBS' COSTS ON HDTV

 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to jump-start the nation's sluggish
transition to digital television, the Mitsubishi Electric Corp., a
major maker of television sets, has agreed to underwrite CBS' costs
to broadcast most of the network's prime-time schedule in high
definition beginning in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   With this deal, most of the network's regular series, other than
movies or news programs, would be broadcast in the digital,
high-definition format during the 1999-2000 season _ 10 to 15 hours
of programming each week, at a cost to Mitsubishi of about $20,000
to $25,000 an hour. The money is meant to cover the cost of
converting filmed entertainment series, like ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' and ``Chicago Hope,'' to the HDTV format.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV can bring cinema-quality clarity to pictures viewable on
sets now retailing for $4,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would more than double the amount of HDTV
programming now transmitted by the nation's major
broadcast-television networks. And Mitsubishi hopes that it will
``eliminate the chicken and egg problem bothering the industry,''
said Robert Perry, director of marketing for Mitsubishi, a Japanese
company with a significant manufacturing presence in the United
States. Not incidentally, the company also hopes the arrangement
will help it sell more HDTV sets.
</P>
<P>
   For CBS the deal seems to have few negatives. At virtually no
additional cost to itself, the network can meet its public pledge
to be a leader in high-definition programming. And with the
Mitsubishi pact in hand, said Martin Franks, a senior vice
president at CBS, ``we will turn to movies and sports and specials
and see if we can find manufacturers who want to underwrite that.''
The company also hopes that by being a leader in high-definition
programming, it will get much of the advertising for HDTV sets.
</P>
<P>
   Other networks have quietly received limited subsidies from set
makers like Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial's Panasonic to
broadcast shows in HDTV. But executives have been reluctant to talk
publicly about those agreements, and no manufacturer has previously
made a deal on this scale.
</P>
<P>
   The transition to digital broadcasting began more than six
months ago, and the National Association of Broadcasters reports
that 66 of the nation's television stations are now broadcasting
programs on their separate, digital channels. Federal rules
required that every ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox station in the 10 largest
cities begin digital broadcasting on May 1. Most began months
earlier, but with a few exceptions the remaining network stations
turned on their digital transmitters last week.
</P>
<P>
   But a digital broadcast does not have to be high definition. So
far, most of the programming on the new channels is digital
versions of the shows being broadcast on the regular, analog
channels _ perhaps manipulated a bit so that the picture looks
somewhat sharper. Such digital programming is far less expensive to
broadcast than true HDTV.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, six digital stations are on the air; in Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Boston the number is five. But New York
has only two _ WCBS and WNYW _ and Chicago just one because in both
cities, the broadcasters are having trouble finding places to build
new towers that will hold the digital antennas. Beyond the 10
largest cities, one or more stations in 18 other cities have also
chosen to begin digital broadcasting before they are legally
required to.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, more than half of the nation's TV viewers are in
range of at least one digital station. Still, consumers have been
exceedingly slow to embrace the new technology. The first digital
televisions required for watching the new broadcasts went on sale
almost 10 months ago. But the consumer electronics industry
estimates that fewer than 25,000 people nationwide have bought a
digital television receiver.
</P>
<P>
   One important reason is cost. Manufacturers, generally, are
selling only high-definition sets, the highest quality and most
expensive form of digital television. And the cheapest of these
sets costs more than $4,000, including the price of a digital
receiver, which is often sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, more than 100,000 Americans spend several thousand
dollars each on a conventional television set with an extra-large
screen and other special features. But retailers report that even
these consumers remain unwilling to buy an HDTV set because there
is so little high-definition programming. Networks, conversely, say
they are reluctant to spend the extra money to produce
high-definition shows that will be watched by an insignificant
number of viewers _ the chicken or egg quandary that Perry of
Mitsubishi noted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Network executives have long said they believe television
manufacturers have the most to gain from widespread acceptance of
high-definition TV; for it is they who will make money from the
sale of all those new HDTV sets. As a result, Franks said, the
network approached several manufacturers with the idea of
underwriting the high-definition broadcasts, ``and Mitsubishi
really stepped up to the plate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, NBC, which is owned by General Electric, is
broadcasting ``The Tonight Show'' in high definition, and Walt
Disney's ABC broadcasts one high-definition movie each week. The
Public Broadcasting System airs a high definition show about once a
month. Fox has shown none.
</P>
<P>
   But even when networks air a high-definition show, there is no
easy way for a viewer to know it is happening. TV guides do not
delineate the programming on the digital channels. And most of the
time, the networks give no notice that a particular show on a
conventional channel is also available in high-definition format on
the digital channel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the CBS-Mitsubishi deal, not only would the amount of
high-definition programming increase, but an on-screen message
would appear at the start of each of these programs, on both the
regular channel and the new digital channel, saying in effect:
``Brought to you in high definition by CBS and Mitsubishi.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi will spend ``millions of dollars'' on this deal,
Perry said, though he refused to be more specific. But for that,
the company would get a year's worth of publicity on CBS that could
serve to make viewers associate HDTV with Mitsubishi. Last weekend,
the company showed its new line of eight HDTV sets.
</P>
<P>
   All of the CBS programming that Mitsubishi would convert to high
definition will be entertainment series produced in Hollywood on
35-millimeter film, which is the quintessential high-definition
format. But to be shown on television, a program shot on film must
be transferred to videotape. Even as CBS conducts these
conventional film-to-tape transfers, Mitsubishi will pay the
additional production costs of using high-definition transfer
machines, which are now in short supply, and high-definition tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi contract runs from September 1999 to September
2000. But Franks said, ``I hope Mitsubishi is so thrilled with the
results, and they sell so many of their HDTV sets, that they come
back for years to come.''

DIGITAL COMMERCE: AN UPFRONT APPROACH TO INTERNET PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every consumer study on the subject of online privacy has been
unequivocal: People fear being bled by data vampires on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But consider this gnawing contradiction: If consumers are so
fearful of their privacy, why did more than a million people reveal
virtually everything personal, short of their DNA sequences, in
hopes of getting free computers and Internet access?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is more subtle than the polar arguments of either
free-market or privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Free PC, a hatchling from the Idealab technology incubator in
Pasadena, Calif., announced earlier this year that it would give
away PCs and network access to 10,000 households between April and
June. To be considered, applicants agreed to accept continuous
on-screen advertising. They also had to complete an exquisitely
detailed personal survey so that if they were chosen, Free PC could
create their household's custom advertising profile.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, collecting personal information solely to
deliver custom advertising sounds like the epitome of what most
would call data abuse. But what Free PC has started, albeit
clumsily, appears to be precisely the model for handling personal
data that privacy advocates have been championing for years.
</P>
<P>
   And if it succeeds, it may also signal a death rattle for
today's multibillion-dollar industry for personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, no one really cares about privacy; they care
about being surprised,'' said Seth Godin, an online marketer whose
book ``Permission Marketing,'' was just published by Simon &AMP;
Schuster (www.permission.com).
</P>
<P>
   People claim to cherish their privacy, he said, but ``your
credit card company already knows everything about you _ when
you're having an affair or trouble at work, when you're seeing a
bankruptcy counselor _ and this doesn't bother anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   What does bother people, Godin contends, is when the possessors
of such personal information do something unexpected with it. Say,
when e-mail in-boxes suddenly start filling with pitches for cable
descramblers or Viagra-by-mail ads. Or when, the day after closing
the deal on a new home, unsolicited letters from mortgage insurance
and interior design companies start arriving.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite their deep distrust of most companies that
collect data on the Web, a majority of consumers say they are
interested in providing personal data to marketers _ under the
right circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Vanderbilt University analysis of consumer responses,
``Building Consumer Trust in Online Environments: The Case for
Information Privacy'' (www2000.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu/papers.html),
reported that more than 72 percent of Web users would relinquish
their data if they were assured of ``a cooperative relationship
built on trust'' _ specifically, if the sites would provide
statements about how the data were going to be used.
</P>
<P>
   In Godin's lexicon, that cooperation is the essence of
permission marketing, which has three basic components: It is
anticipated, it is personal and it is relevant.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one successful permission-style online promotion,
for H&AMP;R Block, started with banner ads that said, ``Click here if
you want H&AMP;R Block to pay your taxes next year.'' Those who
responded, Godin said, were obviously interested in both the
subject _ taxes _ and the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Then the respondents were asked whether they would participate
in an eight-week e-mail contest. The incentive was that H&AMP;R Block
would pay the winner's taxes for a year. The campaign's response
rate was a remarkable 35 percent, Godin said.
</P>
<P>
   Before being acquired by Yahoo several months ago, Godin's
company, Yoyodyne, created and ran 150 of these permission-style
promotions. He says that the typical response rate for them has
been 10 to 20 percent, compared with about 2 percent for
traditional direct-marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   So why haven't more companies embraced the permission model?
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct marketers are scared,'' Godin said. ``The key to their
multibillion-dollar industry is the buying, renting and selling of
mailing lists. Permission marketers know that selling your list
guarantees it becomes worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   And though permission is Free PC's marketing model, Bill Gross,
the company's founder, says he has been shocked by the vehemence
with which privacy advocates have attacked him. ``The issue is not
privacy,'' Gross said. ``It's disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Free PC never made any bones about what it would do with the
data, Gross said. It has also agreed to protect information about
its customers rigorously. The privacy policy on Free PC's Web says:
``Rest assured that we will never give out your personal
information to anyone. No one, including our advertisers, will be
able to identify you individually. And we will never sell, trade or
give away your information.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Gross described even more fastidious
protections: customer data will be used only within Free PC and not
by any other company affiliated with Idealab. ``We've even said
that our agreement with you is transferable to any potential
acquirer of the company,'' he said, ``so we can't sell the company
to anyone who would potentially change our privacy policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these important provisos, however, is stated on the
company's site (www.free-pc.com), nor does it state whether
advertising partners must match its stringent privacy rules. And
Gross might also want to state the company's intentions for the
data submitted by the million-plus applicants who will not receive
free PCs. (He has not decided, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Another good idea might be to tell people whether accepting a
free PC means that they subject themselves to a lifetime of e-mail,
or whether Free PC will expunge them from the company's database if
they decide they no longer want the service.
</P>
<P>
   These questions are too serious to leave unanswered. But despite
_ or maybe even because of _ the controversy that Free PC has
generated, the company finally may have forced open the door to a
marketing model that puts control of personal information in the
hands of consumers, and even gives them something in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go to a consumer and say, `I'll pay for your attention,'
that is so much more interesting than an advertiser who can
interrupt your life without you getting any benefit out of it,''
Godin said of Free PC's strategy. ``People calling you at home
during dinner, you can't stop. Billboards on the highway, you can't
stop. But if you don't like their deal, you can stop.''

US WEST TO OFFER WEB-LINKED SCREEN PHONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   US West Corp. intends to announce Monday that it will introduce
a phone developed by Alcatel of France that includes a color
screen, pop-out keyboard and one-touch access to the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   US West, the smallest of the Baby Bell regional telephone
companies, appears to be the first local phone giant planning for
wide use of such a device in the United States. It intends to make
the new phone, which could cost as much as $400, available in the
third quarter throughout its service region in the western part of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Internet for the rest of us,'' Solomon Trujillo,
US West's chief executive, said in a prepared statement. ``Today,
half of all Americans still aren't on the Internet because it's
either too complicated or too expensive. With these new phones,
we're going to blow open the Internet revolution to everybody by
moving e-mail and Web access to something people are already
comfortable with _ the telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   According to US West, users will be able to configure the new
phone to reach any Internet service provider from any normal
telephone line. The phone will include computer chips and software
to allow users to navigate the Web by touching Web links on the
screen, rather than by using a mouse, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   US West said it would not cost any more to use the new phone
than it would to make a conventional call.
</P>
<P>
   Cidco Inc. of Morgan Hill, Calif., a leading maker of caller ID
equipment, is among a handful of other companies that have
developed a ``smart phone.'' But while Cidco's unit includes
e-mail, it does not include full-fledged Web access.
</P>
<P>
   US West said the new phone could support simultaneous Web
sessions and normal phone calls only if the customer uses an
advanced telephone technology called a digital subscriber line. On
normal lines, the new phone will be able to support normal calls or
Web browsing, but not both at the same time.

MICROSOFT AGREES TO EXPERIMENT WITH NORTEL'S OPTICAL NETWORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., known as a company that runs on e-mail, may be
right when it says that it demands more from its internal data
network than perhaps any other company in the nation. To expand the
capacity of that network, Microsoft has turned, at least
tentatively, to Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the two companies plan to announce that Microsoft has
agreed to try a new Nortel optical networking technology _ one
designed to expand the capacity of fiber-optic networks by a factor
as great as 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of looking for a supplier for our
next-generation backbone,'' said Gregg Atkins, a senior network
engineer for Microsoft's internal information technology group,
referring to Microsoft's core corporate network. ``And we are
looking at this emerging technology and we see this as a solution
for our corporate network.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not quite the solution yet. Microsoft, which does not plan
to revamp its network until early next year, wants to take the next
six months or so to determine which communications equipment makers
will get the lion's share of its business.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft trial is a big vote of confidence in the
optical networking group at Nortel, the former Northern Telecom
Ltd. Nortel is locked in battle against companies including Lucent
Technologies and Ciena to become the leader in a new sort of
communications technology called wave division multiplexing.
</P>
<P>
   Wave division multiplexing, or WDM, transmits multiple
wavelengths, or colors, of light through a single strand of optical
fiber. The system that Microsoft has agreed to use could employ as
many as 32 different wavelengths.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Nortel said it had developed a long-distance WDM
system that uses 160 different wavelengths. But a network for a
local area like Microsoft's offices in the Seattle vicinity must be
capable of adding or removing traffic at many different points. For
that reason, the WDM technology for a smaller area cannot yet
achieve the raw performance of a system that transmits information
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's internal data load quadruples about every 18 months,
Atkins said. The system is used not only for internal
communications including electronic mail, he said, but also as a
testing and proving ground for Microsoft developers who want to
make sure that their software will work in congested networks.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, Microsoft installed fiber-optic technology
from Fujitsu of Japan and Alcatel of France. But Atkins said those
systems were nearing obsolescence, at least for Microsoft's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel said the technology that Microsoft will use came to
Nortel through its acquisition of Cambrian Systems Corp. of Canada
last year for about $300 million.

ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT PURSUES ITS WHALE, THE DIGITAL SET-TOP BOX
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Bill Gates become the Captain Ahab of the information age?
</P>
<P>
   Gates' white whale remains an elusive digital set-top cable box
that his company, Microsoft Corp., is hoping will re-create the
personal computer industry by blending the PC, the Internet and the
television set into a leviathan living-room entertainment and
information machine.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an obsession for more than six years for Gates,
whose ``Windows everywhere'' software strategy has led the company
to look to extend its Windows operating system monopoly into every
cranny of the computing industry _ from mighty mainframes to the
computers embedded in cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is the tantalizing possibility of the computerized
television set that has fixated Gates most, leading to the
construction some years ago of a faux living-room laboratory in a
building on Microsoft's office campus in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, that is because the prospect of digital television _
part PC, part boob tube _ promises the greatest return on the
company's research and development investment. Digital television
holds out the Holy Grail: the intersection of the nation's most
vibrant industries, including media, computing, entertainment and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that Microsoft agreed last week to invest $5
billion in AT&AMP;T, as part of that company's deal to add MediaOne
Group, the cable television company, to its recently acquired
Tele-Communications Inc. cable empire.
</P>
<P>
   Television sets are in some 98 percent of American households,
while personal computers are having trouble breaking the 50 percent
threshold. Thus, a Windows operating system monopoly on the set-top
box would dwarf the scale of the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television is the 3,000-pound gorilla,'' said Nicholas
Donatiello, president of Odyssey, a market research firm in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, just as Captain Ahab's quest for Moby Dick led to a
miserable outcome, there is no certainty that Microsoft's quest for
the television set top will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1993, Microsoft proposed a joint venture with Time
Warner Inc., AT&AMP;T and TCI called Cablesoft, in an effort to harness
the cable and phone industries to the Microsoft Windows software
operating system standard. Since then Gates has repeatedly tried to
forge pacts with partners in those industries.
</P>
<P>
   Though some have welcomed such overtures, like Comcast, the
cable company in which Microsoft acquired a 11 percent stake a few
years ago, others have held back. The laggards feared they would
inevitably fall victim to the same forces that enabled Microsoft to
reduce many PC hardware makers to mere purveyors of commodity
goods.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's considerable financial heft has eroded most
resistance. Besides the Comcast stake, Gates' investments in his
pursuit of interactive digital TV have included WebTV, Time
Warner's Road Runner, four European interactive cable television
investments and, finally, last week's investment in AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   In return for a $5 billion stake, AT&AMP;T has warily agreed to
license a minimum of 5 million copies of Microsoft's Windows CE
operating system and engage in several showcase tryouts of the
software, the consumer-electronics version of Microsoft's
industry-dominating Windows software for PC's.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will ensure that Microsoft gets an inside track in the
new interactive television industry, which after years of delay
appears to be showing some signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Microsoft's chairman believes with great certainty that
interactive digital television is the Next Big Thing. And yet just
as Gates, the visionary, entirely missed the dawning of the
Internet, there is growing evidence that rapid technology
transitions are not predictable _ let alone manipulable.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing for multimillion-dollar test runs, Gates may be
ignoring years of consumer indifference and outright interactive
television failures like Time Warner's debacle in Orlando, Fla., a
few years back _ not to mention the rapid emergence of a range of
alternative technologies for delivering Internet content that may
quickly bypass the living room.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to Gates is that the interactive television set, upon
which he is betting most heavily, may prove a mirage that wastes
billions of dollars of investment capital and Microsoft development
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The offspring of a dream that stretches as far back as the
1970s, digital television has long been a Chimera pursued by
high-technology executives _ whether in the form of videotext,
video on demand or, more recently, Internet via television.
</P>
<P>
   The new hope is that while no one has been able to figure out
the challenge of how to supply more than several channels of
compelling programming for a television audience simultaneously,
the World Wide Web would offer an easy solution.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and Microsoft envision that the DTC-5000, a set-top
box due this fall from General Instrument, will serve as a choke
point for all the digital information flowing into and out of the
home.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The original vision of interactive cable has now stretched far
beyond 500 channels to include telephone service, video on demand,
stereo audio, video games and Internet access. As a result of this
``all things to all people'' impulse, the DTC-5000 has sometimes
been derided as an information-age Cuisinart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the joke inside AT&AMP;T labs, where engineers are testing
the box, is that DTC-5000 has so many connectors that the physical
integrity of its back panel has been compromised. The prototypes
include connections for cable, power, Ethernet and Firewire
networks, Universal Serial Bus, telephony, audio, video, infrared,
PCMCIA card, smart card and computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   While simpler and more compelling alternatives _ ranging from
the home PC to a growing array of wireless and hand-held computers
and phones _ offer a seemingly more convenient way to obtain
Internet data, Gates has continued to pursue the parallels between
the world of interactive digital television and the personal
computer industry, and to re-create a dominant role for Microsoft.
Indeed, forcing Windows CE on the cable industry has become a
virtual religious crusade inside Microsoft's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big frontier, and Bill is scared to death that it's
going to pass him by,'' said a member of the AT&AMP;T team that
negotiated the deal with Microsoft. As described by Microsoft's
deal-maker and chief financial officer, Greg Maffei, the investment
makes sense as a bet on the future of high-capacity _ or broadband
_ telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is finally a plan to go out and deploy something, and
that's a great opportunity for us,'' Maffei said in a telephone
interview Thursday, after the deal closed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives argue that a business rationale now exists
for interactive television _ as opposed to the Orlando interactive
television pilot that Time Warner started with great fanfare in
1994 only to unceremoniously shut it down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deregulation is allowing a single supplier and pipe into the
home to provide digital television, telephony and high-speed
Internet access,'' said Hank Vigil, vice president for consumer
strategy at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the crusade to bring E-commerce to the family-room sofa is
probably no closer this week than before the arrival of last week's
alliance between the software and the telecommunications industry
giants.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, AT&AMP;T will be competing with other technologies
challenging cable as a means to deliver Internet data: fixed and
cellular wireless telecommunications; the phone industry's digital
subscriber line and interactive satellite systems from the Hughes
Electronics subsidiary of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, other technologies _ including the PC, digital
videocassette recorders from companies like Replay Networks Inc.
and Tivo Inc., as well as a new generation of video game players
from Sony, Sega and Nintendo _ will all contribute to the
accelerating fragmentation of the mass cable-television market.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T may even become its own largest competitor, especially for
providing consumers access to Internet electronic commerce. The
company has quietly accelerated plans for a nationwide introduction
of Internet-ready cellular phones, skipping 64 kilobits a second
and going directly to 384 kilobits.
</P>
<P>
   Such a network will be ideal for a new generation of
Internet-compatible telephone-Web browsers now being shown by Nokia
and Ericsson. Though a shift to mobile Web browsing would be warmly
greeted by AT&AMP;T, it is likely to sharply limit the market for
consumers willing to buy an expensive additional Internet account
just to permit them to browse the Web on their TV.
</P>
<P>
   And in the mobile and wireless world, Microsoft is already at a
clear disadvantage competing with the cellular phone industry,
which has shown little interest in a Microsoft Windows CE operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Gates appears to have nearly infinite capital to invest in his
dream, but there seems to be little to ensure that he will be able
to enact his vision. That, of course, is the risk of being a
visionary.

A TALKING HEAD BECOMES A HYBRID, WITH A CNN DEAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, James Carney, a prolific reporter who covers
Washington politics for Time magazine, signed a contract with CNN
and became a multimedia machine.
</P>
<P>
   Carney _ who has worked as a Time reporter for 10 years _ will
be a joint employee of both Time and CNN. He is the first of what
his editors hope will be a new breed of journalist: men and women
who can write and report for print, and write and appear on camera
for television.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our folks make appearances on CNN,'' James Kelly, the
deputy managing editor of Time, said. ``Jay is a terrific reporter
and terrific writer and he just happens to be very telegenic. We
thought, why not try something like a hybrid print-television
journalist?''
</P>
<P>
   In his new position, Carney, 33, will continue to cover politics
and the Congress for Time, but the energy he has spent in the past
as a talking head on programs like ``Inside Politics,'' ``Hardball
with Chris Matthews'' and ``The McLaughlin Group'' will now be
devoted to reporting long television pieces about politics
exclusively for ``CNN Newsstand.'' Kelly said that Carney got a
raise _ although his pay did not reach the stellar level of the
network news programs, where an annual starting salary of $300,000
is standard for reporters. ( Carney would not say how much he was
being paid.)
</P>
<P>
   Since Time's corporate parent, Time-Warner Inc., acquired CNN in
1995, the network has made vigorous use of Time's reporters, Kelly
said. Time reporters already appear on ``CNN Newsstand'' as unpaid
guests. This is the first time that a Time reporter will be
regularly paid for producing and appearing in CNN pieces, Kelly
said, but others are likely to follow in Carney's footsteps. ``He's
not going to be the only one,'' Kelly said. ``We have very high
hopes for this.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive producer at ``CNN Newsstand,'' Civia Tamarkin,
said she ``would love to do this with more reporters from Time.
Inc.'' She added that around the CNN offices in Atlanta, Carney is
referred to as ``the journalistic genome project.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no plans yet for CNN staff members to offer bylined
pieces in Time, as a CNN correspondent, Peter Arnett, and a
producer, April Oliver, did last summer, setting off the Tailwind
scandal. ``But if the opportunity arises, if the person gets into a
place that is difficult for one of our folks to get to, I can
definitely see that,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Carney is lucky enough to have his own personal television
trainer at home; his wife, Claire Shipman, is a White House
correspondent for NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her influence is sobering,'' he said. ``I realize watching her
that there's a big difference between being able to do reasonably
well on a talk show and putting together the different elements of
a television piece.'' He added: ``And in the end who knows? I might
be awful.''

   As Awards Cascade, New Yorker Weighs In
</P>
<P>
   It is the oldest trick in the Publicity 101 handbook: Need
press? Give an award. The magazine industry is handing out
statuettes faster than editors can say, ``You like me! You really
like me!''
</P>
<P>
   The congratulatory trend gathered steam in 1996, when GQ
introduced its GQ Men of the Year Awards, a celebrity-laden concert
and awards ceremony that is broadcast live on VH-1, but this year,
the industry is amplifying the honorifics. In April, there was the
Teen People Twenty Teens Who Will Change the World awards luncheon,
at which 20 teen-agers received $1,000 college scholarships. Then
last week, there was the Ladies' Home Journal One Smart Lady
Awards. (This year's one smart lady: Elizabeth Dole.) Later this
month, George magazine will host the Newman's Own George Award, at
which Paul Newman and John F. Kennedy Jr. will present $250,000 to,
as the invitation reads, ``the American company that best
exemplifies good citizenship through philanthropy.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Vogue magazine will introduce its own awards show,
the Vogue VH-1 Awards. In February 2000, The New Yorker will throw
its hat into the ring: as part of its 75th anniversary celebration,
the magazine will inaugurate The New Yorker Book Awards, begging
the question: Does the world need more than the National Book
Critics Circle Awards, Pulitzer Prizes and National Book Awards?
How many gold-foil stickers can one book jacket carry?
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of magazines and newspapers and publications do
things to promote the magazine and at the same time exemplify the
magazine,'' David Remnick, The New Yorker's editor, said. ``We
thought it was perfectly legitimate and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards, to be judged by panels headed by New Yorker editors,
will be given in five categories _ fiction, nonfiction, poetry,
lifetime achievement and best debut _ and the ceremony will cap a
weekend-long arts celebration The New Yorker is hosting for its
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Remnick said only time will demonstrate the awards' legitimacy.
``The prizes only begin to matter when the prize itself has a
certain integrity and consistency.'' he said. &QL;

   Papers Find a Common Advertising Theme
</P>
<P>
   The Newspaper Association of America may have hired Sergio
Zyman, the former head marketer at Coca-Cola, to lend spark to the
business, but three New York-area dailies are not waiting for
pointers. The Daily News, The Wall Street Journal and The Journal
News, which is published in the city's northern suburbs, have found
a common theme.
</P>
<P>
   Television spots for The Daily News feature a surgical patient,
in need of anesthetic, being offered The New York Times to read. It
works.
</P>
<P>
   Spots for the Gannett Co.'s Journal News show commuters _ one
with The Times, the other The Journal News. ``Do you know the
Rockefellers are granting 88 acres of parkland in Mount Pleasant?''
The Journal News reader asks. ``How would I know?'' comes the
response.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a billboard appeared along the side of the Ford
Center, across 43rd Street from The Times Building. A part of The
Wall Street Journal's new ad campaign, which fits slogans in the
middle of the newspaper's name, the billboard reads: ``The Wall  &UR; we
save the color for the writing &LR;  Street Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   A coincidence? No, said Richard J. Tofel, a vice president of
Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which owns The Journal. ``Times Square is one of
the crossroads of the world and would be an important part of any
outdoor advertising campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be outlandish to think the ad might be aimed at The
Times, which has used color daily for 19 months? ``That would be a
little bit self-absorbed,'' Tofel said.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the billboard, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of
The Times, said: ``I say this with a smile. We're delighted The
Wall Street Journal needs to advertise in a square named after The
New York Times.''

UNDERSTANDING THE SQUIRREL IN YOUR COFFEE

   Readers who have scoffed at character analysis methods reported
recently herein _ indicators being one's choice of salad dressing,
for example, or one's choice of ice cream flavor _ may have been
dieting. Readers seeking lower-calorie truths may find answers in
``Fortune in a Coffee Cup'' (Llewellyn; $9.95), in which the
author,  &UR; Sophia &LR; , describes how to foretell tomorrow by reading
leftover grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The author recommends using ``organic coffee picked by people
who are treated decently,'' to be made in a French press. While the
water is coming to a boil, ``circle the collected cup'' (white is
best), ``boiling water and coffee three times with your left hand,
clockwise. Make the coffee in the press, as usual. And after it is
poured into the cup, add a pinch of grounds. After drinking the
coffee, the consumer/fortune-seeker should turn the cup three times
counterclockwise, leaving the dregs to be read.
</P>
<P>
   Some sample interpretations: If you see a bicycle at the bottom
of the cup, ``you are on the path to obtain your goals''; if you
see a squirrel, ``hard work is not a stranger to you''; any
vegetable in the bottom of the cup ``is a symbol of prosperity''
(unless you were clumsy enough to drop a carrot into it
accidentally).

   Shares in National Semiconductor Corp. evidently got a lot more
attractive last week, after the company announced it was quitting
the personal computer microprocessor business. National shares
gained 21 percent on Wednesday, another 12 percent on Thursday, and
gave up just 6 percent on Friday to close at $18.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen analysts upgraded their recommendations on the
stock Thursday, and nearly all the analysts who follow the company
raised their earnings estimates for the company's fiscal year,
which ends in May, according to First Call Corp., which tracks
corporate earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   While most analysts had projected a loss, estimates for the year
now range from a profit of 35 cents to $1.17 a diluted share. ``We
run the gamut from modest upgrades to the full Monty,'' said Chuck
Hill, First Call's director of research. ``Everyone is raising
their numbers for next year, but there's still a fair degree of
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   National said on Wednesday that it would leave the PC processor
business, and seek a buyer for the assets of Cyrix Corp., which it
purchased less than two years ago for $550 million, as well as a
related chip manufacturing plant in South Portland, Maine. National
executives said that fierce price wars between Intel Corp. and
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. had made the PC business unprofitable,
and that National's losses from PC chips had kept the whole company
in the red for the last year.
</P>
<P>
   National said it would still pursue so-called systems on a chip,
using the Cyrix technology, for information appliances like
cellular telephones and television set-top boxes for the Internet.
But the retreat from the PC business is at least a partial
repudiation of the strategy laid out by Brian Halla, the company's
chairman and chief executive, to move National out of commodity
chips and into higher-priced, more profitable products, like
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cheered the move as a recognition of the realities of
the marketplace. ``Buying Cyrix was a big mistake,'' said John
Lazlo, an analyst with Paine Webber. ``I know Brian Halla had a
vision, and he articulated that vision well and there was some
merit to it. But they clearly bought damaged goods.'' He reiterated
a buy recommendation and raised his estimate for the year ending in
May to 40 cents from 31 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Lazlo said Cyrix had always lagged behind Intel and Advanced
Micro, and put huge capital demands on National that siphoned off
money better spent on other products. ``Cyrix was a black hole'' he
said. ``Now the wicked witch is dead. If they refocus on analog,
they can turn this into a very successful business.'' Analog chips
are used to process audio, video and other signals outside the
digital domain.
</P>
<P>
   Although National is ranked third in the analog market in some
surveys and fifth in others, it is an established player that can
take steps to gain share now that its resources are not drained by
the PC business.
</P>
<P>
   One counterintuitive effect of the digital revolution has been a
surge in demand for analog chips, which are used in everything from
PC monitors to cellular telephones. Analog companies like Analog
Devices Inc., Linear Technology Corp. and Maxim Integrated Products
have enjoyed strong growth and healthy profit margins, as have the
analog businesses of companies like Texas Instruments Inc. and
Motorola Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Without the PC processor business, ``of the residual portion of
their business, 65 percent of that is analog, which is a good
business,'' Arun Veerapan, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, said. ``It's healthy and growing at 15 to 20 percent.''
He added that National sells more than $200 million worth of analog
chips a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not new for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veerapan estimated that the PC processor business generated
sales of $50 million a quarter and losses of $40 million, coupled
with $35 million a quarter in manufacturing overhead costs. Without
those losses, National's other businesses will be profitable, he
said, raising his estimate for the fiscal year to 36 cents a
diluted share from 8 cents and his recommendation to ``buy'' from
``long-term attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Peck, an analyst with S.G. Cowen, retained his ``hold''
rating on National, cautioning that it would not be easy to achieve
the goal of leadership in analog chips. ``A lot of companies want
to be No. 1 in analog,'' he said. ``National has been a distant
third. Can they make up some of that ground? It's certainly more
likely now than in the past, but it's still a tall order. The good
news is you don't have to be No. 1 in analog to make a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Although National's exit from the PC business might appear to
take some of the pressure off Advanced Micro, Peck said he doubted
that would be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Cyrix was much of a factor in microprocessor
pricing,'' he said. ``What will happen is AMD will gain market
share in an intrinsically unprofitable market.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest sporting goods retailers are
banding together to back a single company that will run Internet
stores for all of them. It is a novel plan fraught with potential
conflicts. But the retailers hope that by joining forces with some
of their traditional rivals, they will be able to block any of the
Internet-only sporting goods companies, now small, from growing to
dominate all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Like retailers in many industries, the sporting goods chains
have watched with trepidation as Amazon.com &UR;  &LR; captured most of the
online book business and Etoys &UR;  &LR; quickly became the biggest Internet
toy store. And it is hardly consolation, for any but the biggest
retailer, that Barnes &AMP; Noble &UR;  &LR; and Toys ``R'' Us &UR;  &LR; are spending tens
of millions of dollars each to try to replicate their
physical-world leadership in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   These fears led the Athlete's Foot, &UR;  &LR; a national chain of
footwear stores, and three regional sporting goods chains _ Jumbo
Sports, MC Sports and Sports Chalet &UR;  &LR; _ to join the venture. It is
being organized by Global Sports, &UR;  &LR; until now a dealer in surplus
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Global will design and run separate Internet sites for each of
the retailers taking part. But they will use common software,
inventory and shipping operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows us to enter e-commerce without having to build the
back room and all the infrastructure we need,'' said Robert J.
Corliss, the chief executive of the Athlete's Foot. ``We're
confident that Global will be able to pull this thing off better
and in a more timely fashion than if we tried to do it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Few industries have undertaken such joint efforts. One related
approach, however, is being tried by the Wine and Spirits
Wholesalers of America. That trade group recently endorsed a plan
in which orders that are placed on a site called Wineshipper.com
will be routed to a network of local liquor stores.
</P>
<P>
   So far sporting goods have sold modestly on line, and the
biggest players have been chains that already have mail order
operations _ including REI &UR;  &LR; and Venator, the nation's largest
sporting goods retailer, which owns the Eastbay mail order concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global's idea levels the playing field a little bit for those
who aren't set up to run a business like this,'' said John Horan,
the publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many competitors looming, from manufacturers like
Nike, &UR;  &LR; which will open a big Internet store in June, to
Internet-only stores like Fogdog.
</P>
<P>
   The Global deal is the brainchild of Michael Rubin, the
25-year-old entrepreneurial prodigy who founded Global Sports.
Rubin started selling skis in his parents' suburban Philadelphia
basement at the age of 13, with $2,500 from bar mitzvah gifts. By
16 he had a chain of ski-gear stores. At 18, he switched to buying
up surplus goods and selling them to retailers. And in recent
years, he started selling shoes, buying up the ailing Ryka and Apex
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was bitten by the Internet bug last fall after seeing
stocks of other companies shoot up when they announced Internet
moves. He considered opening his own online store to sell the
close-out shoes. But he was put off by the business model,
pioneered by Amazon.com, in which companies plan to lose a lot of
money for years as they build their brands. So he concocted this
hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at what was really good about the Web-centric
retailers _ they can act quickly, they can raise unlimited capital,
they can use their stock as compensation and they are not measured
on traditional measures like earnings,'' Rubin said. ``And we
wanted to combine that with what the traditional retailers had:
brands, customers and relationships with vendors so they can get
the best prices and the best products.''
</P>
<P>
   Global will put up all the capital, pay all the expenses and
take all the risk of owning inventory. It will also have the
potential to earn nearly all the profits from the business, if
there are any. It will pay what is in effect a royalty to each
store _ something less than 10 percent of sales under its brand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of expensive Internet advertising deals, Global will
rely mainly on its partners for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every retailer who works with us is obligated to put the Web
site address in every ad, on every billboard, shopping bag even
every register receipt,'' said Michael Golden, the head of Global's
Internet effort.
</P>
<P>
   Global hopes to start the sites for these four retailers and
possibly others this October. To prepare for a surge of investor
interest, Global moved its stock to the Nasdaq market last week.
Its share price has quadrupled since the beginning of the year,
most likely because word of its Internet plans has leaked out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An unusual aspect of this arrangement is that Global will
operate several sites that will appear to consumers to be direct
competitors of each other. Golden said that Global would have
separate teams of people to design and operate each store's site.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the same pair of running shoes could well have a
slightly different price on each of the sites, because Global
intends that the site it runs for each retailer will match the
prices that the chain has in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   There is very little price competition in the sporting goods
business, however, because the big manufacturers discourage deep
discounting. Still, the prospect of joining a group with some of
its biggest rivals has so far kept Modell's Sporting Goods, &UR;  &LR; the
New York area chain, from joining Global's group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder when they are working on six or eight accounts, who
will get top priority,'' said Mitchell Modell, the president.
Still, Modell said he was intrigued by the arrangement and might
yet join. ``There are very few ways to get involved in the Internet
where you are guaranteed a return on your investment,'' he said.

A HOT TV DEAL MAKER TRIES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brad Grey, who grew up in Buffalo, N.Y., studying show business
so closely he all but memorized every line from the classic comedy
``The Honeymooners,'' certainly knows the name Max Bialystock.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Zero Mostel character in the antic Mel Brooks film,
``The Producers,'' who sold off endless percentages of his latest
Broadway production to unsuspecting widows.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Grey, the chairman of Brillstein-Grey
Entertainment, has made deals for 50 percent interests in his
television production company to no fewer than three separate
partners, none of whom would ever qualify as widows or as
unsuspecting: ABC, Universal and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Max Bialystock wound up in jail. Grey has wound up
collecting millions in producer fees _ and he still has 50 percent
of the latest iteration of his television production company, BGTV,
a joint venture announced last week with the Columbia Tristar
Television Group of Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Grey appreciates the humor in the comparison to ``The
Producers,'' but understandably does not want it taken literally.
For one thing, he never intended to change partners and dance so
many different times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have loved to have stayed in business with ABC or
Universal for a long time,'' Grey said. It was, he added,
circumstances beyond his control _ namely that both those companies
changed corporate hands shortly after his deals were consummated _
that altered his relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he emphasized the quality of the product coming out
of his company, which certainly is not of the same nature as Max
Bialystock's unforgettable musical flop, ``Springtime for Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in at least his most recent series, ``The Sopranos''
Grey has come up with something unforgettable of his own, the
most-talked-about television show of the season.
</P>
<P>
   His track record also includes the burgeoning hit comedy ``Just
Shoot Me,'' as well as the highly regarded (if never highly rated)
comedy ``NewsRadio,'' both on NBC, and another ongoing comedy,
``The Steve Harvey Show,'' on Time Warner Inc.'s WB. Grey's company
also produces ``Politically Incorrect'' for ABC, and it was the
production company that created ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' another
groundbreaking series, for HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking deals, Brad is the best,'' Ted Harbert, who
once led ABC's entertainment unit, said. ``ABC ended the deal with
him before it paid off, but if they had stayed in, and realized the
full potential of shows like `Just Shoot Me,' ABC would have done
quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the changes that have undone Grey's deal-making are
mainly rooted in the volatile nature of the television business in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Grey made his deal with ABC in 1994. The network became his
banker, financing development of his shows in exchange for
co-ownership and first crack at them.
</P>
<P>
   This was attractive to ABC because Brillstein-Grey's management
side controlled so much talent, including stars like Adam Sandler,
Brad Pitt, Nicolas Cage, Dennis Miller, David Spade, Bill Maher and
Courtney Cox.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, ABC was acquired by Walt Disney Co. Referring
to the Disney chairman, Grey said, ``Michael Eisner told me Disney
was not in the business of owning half of another company.''
</P>
<P>
   After some negotiations about joining Disney as an executive,
Grey went in another direction. In 1996, he sold 50 percent of
Brillstein-Grey Entertainment to MCA Inc.'s Universal for an
estimated $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, that meant Disney was supplying financing for shows
to be jointly owned by Universal. This was not a situation Disney
found appealing. The company settled with Grey, retaining a small
interest in some of the shows.
</P>
<P>
   But Grey's deal with Universal had hardly taken root before
Universal sold most of its television operations to USA Networks.
The deal was not transferable, meaning he was now in partnership
with a studio that had essentially closed down its television
business and thus had lost the leverage that would help get Grey's
shows on the air.
</P>
<P>
   After again contemplating a possible jump into the executive
ranks, as head of a new Universal television division, Grey decided
to stay with his own company. ``The philosophy was very simple,''
he said. ``We started in the talent business. We have to stick to
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the economics of the television business, in which producers
accumulate big deficits hoping for hits to pay them back, usually
demands a big company's bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   By now Grey knew this game well. This time he approached
Columbia Tristar.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Feltheimer, the president of the Columbia Tristar Television
Group, cited Grey's track record. ``A lot of money was being
made,'' Feltheimer said. ``Why wouldn't we want to be in business
with Brad?''
</P>
<P>
   Grey negotiated a settlement with Universal and set up BGTV.
Columbia will cover production overhead and will supply $15 million
to $20 million a year to develop new shows.
</P>
<P>
   The deal-making has at least one other dizzying layer. Grey has
made further partnerships with networks to help ensure his shows
get on the air. In ``The Sopranos,'' HBO is his partner and will
share in ``Sopranos'' merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Grey also brought NBC in on ``News Radio'' to keep the show on
the air last year and ceded ownership interests to the network in
two new comedy pilots for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Arrangements like this have been criticized by producers who say
they were forced to pony up financial interests in shows to get
them on the air, but Grey dismissed such complaints as ``whining.''
</P>
<P>
   One partner Grey no longer does business with is Garry
Shandling, the star of ``The Larry Sanders Show,'' and once a close
friend. In a highly publicized lawsuit, the actor accused Grey of
taking money both as a manager and a producer. Grey denied the
accusation and filed a counter suit. He said of the coming trial,
``I'd like it to get over with.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was also eager to begin his new deal with his latest
50-50 partner, Columbia. ``And I'd be delighted if this partner
decides to stay in business with me,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Peter Mayer felt the slim weight of an electronic book in
the palm of his hand, he suffered instant pangs of dread.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reassuring crackle of paper or the faint scent of
ink that had been a constant in his career in publishing, for two
decades as chief executive of Viking Penguin and now of his own
independent company, Overlook Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect it,'' Mayer said of the electronic book that could
change the dynamics of his business, ``but I have an emotional and
professional investment in what I know. And when I was young, I
knew that I could conquer any change, and now I don't know what's
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Such wariness is prompting Mayer, and some authors and agents,
to shy away from books made of bytes until a clear view develops of
the rapidly emerging market for electronic readers. The culture of
technology has collided with the slower-moving book industry, which
is engaged in a tense, early clash over how to divide up the spoils
of an infant business that is still difficult to picture in scope
and potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a scramble over who controls what,'' said Laurence
Kirshbaum, chief executive of Time Warner Trade publishing, a Time
Warner unit that includes Warner Books and Little Brown &AMP; Co. He
noted that ``we're not being motivated by what's to come, but a
fear of being left out as the train is pulling away from the
station, with some exotic station in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in five years, the New York-based Authors
Guild mailed out contract warnings last month to some 7,500
members. The letter criticized current e-book contracts as bad
deals. The guild said it considered distribution fees for
electronic book manufacturers a payment scheme that would deny
publishers and authors the rewards of the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent literary agencies are also advising authors to
refuse electronic book agreements unless the contracts promise to
revise the deals if electronic editions rapidly gain popularity.
But in turn, some publishers are refusing to make that concession,
which means that many popular books are staying firmly on the
bookshelves instead of a digital page.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, start-up technology companies have
pushed forward with plans to make electronic books as ubiquitous as
mass market paperbacks. This month, Nuvomedia will expand its sales
of $500 versions to stores, while Librius is preparing to begin
selling its slender 12-ounce pocketbook-sized model for $200 in
July. Softbook Press has been lining up deals with corporations and
school districts that are eager to eliminate lockers and reduce
backpack strain on students laden with textbooks. Softbook's
version, with note-taking and scribble functions, sells for $299.
</P>
<P>
   The first e-books became available late last fall.
Barnesandnoble.com, for example, has about 500 titles available for
sale and downloading and has sold about 15,000 copies in this
format. In general, the privately held manufacturers will not say
how many of the electronic readers have been sold, but a
Barnesandnoble.com spokesman, Ben Boyd, said the company had been
``pleasantly surprised with the pace that customers have purchased
these devices and titles.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers may seem small now, says Chuck Verrill, a literary
agent with Darhansoff &AMP; Verrill, but ``the issues are profound in
their long-term impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we want to see the market grow, but we want to make sure
the terms are fair,'' he said. The agency's authors, including
Arthur Golden and E. Annie Proulx, are avoiding the electronic
format until they reach better deals with publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The devices that are inspiring all this anxiety weigh from 12
ounces to more than two pounds and carry brand names like Rocket
eBook, Millennium E-Reader and the Softbook. They seem rather
expensive now for leisure reading, but eventually the manufacturers
expect the cost to fall below $100 or plunge to nothing as e-books
are given away like cellular phones to entice customers to buy and
download books, newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   With almost missionary zeal, the entrepreneurs developing the
e-books from the West Coast and a culture of technology are
predicting changes in a publishing industry centered in New York
and steeped in tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be everywhere,'' said Devin McKinney,
director of content services for Softbook Press. ``I think that 50
percent of the books are going to be published in electronic form
and not in paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers say they do not feel threatened by the development of
the electronic book because they do not think the form will replace
conventional books for adult readers who will always want to savor
the familiar touch of paper.
</P>
<P>
   But a new generation of young readers may have different notions
about what constitutes a good book. Some school districts are
already negotiating to buy the Softbook for students to essentially
create ``textbook-free'' schools where students can download books
and packets of course information over phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Davis Joint Unified School District in Davis,
Calif., is expecting to learn this month whether it has received a
$6 million federal grant to subsidize the purchase of some 3,000
electronic books that will be shared among 7,700 students.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But if educators see immediate benefits, publishers are showing
more caution as the first deals are struck for electronic rights
that could set a pattern to last the life of a copyright. When
authors try to make the case that paperless books will result in
cost savings, Random House, the top-ranking publisher, expresses
private misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memo, the company said that ``a generally held
misconception is that publishers will make greater profits on
e-books since the costs of paper, printing, warehousing and
delivery are saved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This ignores the different kinds of costs that are incurred in
handling e-books,'' the memo said. It then listed the added
expenses of formatting manuscripts for electronic books, protecting
digital material from piracy and granting higher discounts to
e-book distributors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Authors Guild does indeed expect savings from lowered
paper and printing costs and so, as the guild's director, Paul
Aiken, put it, ``the result seems clear: Authors should receive a
significantly higher royalty for e-books than they do for physical
books.''
</P>
<P>
   The Authors Guild says that now, a writer might get a share as
great as 15 percent of the list price of a book as a royalty. The
structure for an electronic book is about the same, but can run as
low as 4 percent. In a conventional contract for a hard-cover book,
the publisher gets about 35 percent of the list price while the
distributor gets 15 percent and the bookseller keeps 35 percent.
With the new electronic rights agreements that e-book manufacturers
are getting from publishers, this structure shifts, with publishers
getting 25 to 40 percent, booksellers 35 to 40 percent and
distributors 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the guild has assailed the new cut for Nuvomedia,
which it describes as a combined ``whopping 60 percent distribution
fee'' to Nuvomedia and Barnesandnoble.com, which sells the
electronic titles.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such sentiments anger e-book manufacturers
like Martin Eberhard, the chief executive of Nuvomedia of Mountain
View, Calif., even though the parent company of Random House,
Bertelsmann AG, has invested in his company and in Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual Book Expo America in Los Angeles, which draws
thousands of booksellers and publishers, Eberhard sat in his
exhibit booth, fuming about Random House's arguments and the
Authors Guild letter, which also contended that ``profit margins
for publishers and royalty rates for authors should soar with these
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the publishing industry doesn't let up on these squabbles,
it will hurt them,'' he said, adding that the combined 60 percent
share for the distributor and bookseller had since dropped to 55
percent of the list price of a book.
</P>
<P>
   Eberhard contends that the costs of publishing an electronic
version are lower than conventional formats and so authors can
improve their shares. But he complained that Random House was
taking credit for bearing the costs of encrypting digital material
``because they're trying to get the best royalty rate that they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Random House's general counsel, Harriette Dorsen, said:
``Publishers do the formatting and each device needs to be
individually done. Upgrades are required for new upgrades of the
devices.'' In addition, she said, the costs of encryption are
passed back to the publishers through higher discounts granted to
e-book manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Some literary agents contend that Random House has taken tough
negotiating positions by refusing to allow contract revisions as
the market grows. But Ms. Dorsen said: ``This is emphatically not
correct that we have refused to revisit the issue of royalties. In
fact, we understand that in a changing environment, with a business
in its infancy, there will be changes in the way this business is
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The current tension is such that Nuvomedia is prevented from
selling an electronic version of Arthur Golden's ``Memoirs of a
Geisha,'' one of the titles published by Random House's Knopf unit
that was used to test Rocket eBooks with customers. ``We had it all
ready to go, and it was pulled at the last minute because the
author wasn't happy with the deal,'' Eberhard said.
Barnesandnoble.com, which was offering it on its site, deleted it
when a dispute emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Golden's literary agent, Verrill, said that they chose not to
permit an electronic version more out of concern about the
uncertainties of the future. In general, he said, he thinks that
publishers should allow contracts to be revised after a limited
number of years to gauge the impact of electronic books on
publishing economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready to commit a book that was likely to sell for
the next 20 years over terms that seemed so unthought-out,''
Verrill said..
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he is aware of the impact if authors continue
to shy away from electronic versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet it has an impact,'' Verrill said. ``It affects the
content that Nuvomedia can offer, and if they have nothing but
books nobody wants, then they're likely to fail.''

MICROSOFT LOOKS TO NORTEL IN EARLY TEST FOR NETWORK 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To expand the capacity of its internal data network, Microsoft
has turned, at least tentatively, to Nortel Networks of Canada. The
two companies plan to announce Monday that Microsoft has agreed to
try a new Nortel optical networking technology.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which does not plan to revamp its network until early
next year, wants to take the next six months or so to determine
which communications equipment makers will get the bulk of its
business. But the Microsoft trial is a big vote of confidence in
the optical networking group at Nortel.

<P>
   Shares in National Semiconductor got a lot more attractive last
week after the company announced that it was quitting the personal
computer microprocessor business, saying that fierce price wars
between Intel and Advanced Micro Devices had made the business
unprofitable. Analysts cheered the move as a recognition of the
realities of the marketplace. Market Place.  &QL;

   APPLE VS. WINDOWS COMES TO TV

<P>
   When it comes to the history of the personal computer, the truth
is as good as fiction, at least as far as a TV movie is concerned.
``Pirates of Silicon Valley,'' which will be shown on TNT on June
20, seeks to retell how an orphaned Steve Jobs invented Apple
Computer in a suburban garage with his friend Steve Wozniak and how
William H. Gates persuaded IBM to give Microsoft the contract for
the first PC operating system and later developed Windows to
compete with Apple's Macintosh. The role of Jobs went to Noah Wyle,

SPORTS RETAILERS IN WEB VENTURE

   Some of the nation's biggest sporting goods retailers are
banding together to back a single company that will run Internet

with some of their traditional rivals, they will be able to keep
Internet-only sporting goods companies from dominating them.  &QL; 
A NEW MODEL FOR INTERNET PRIVACY
</P>
<P>
   When Free PC announced earlier this year that it would give away
computers and Internet access to 10,000 households, applicants had
to accept continuous on-screen advertising and complete a detailed
survey. Collecting personal information to deliver custom
advertising sounds like data abuse. But Free PC seems to have come
up with a model for handling personal data that privacy advocates
have long championed.  &QL; 
TV DEAL MAKER TRIES AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Brad Grey, the chairman of
Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, has made deals for 50 percent
interests in his television production company with no fewer than
three separate partners: ABC, Universal and Sony. The changes that
have undone Grey's deal-making are mainly rooted in the volatility
of the television business. What has remained constant is the high
quality of his shows, from ``The Sopranos,'' the most-talked-about
TV show of the season, to the comedy ``Just Shoot Me,'' starring
Laura San Giacomo and Wendie Malick.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Valley of unexpected millionaires, Meg Whitman is the
unlikeliest of billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman recalls the day in November 1997 that a headhunter
urged her to leave her comfortable job promoting Teletubbies at
Hasbro Inc. The proposition: to head up a no-name Silicon Valley
startup that needed a chief executive. Her answer was ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Like legions of graduates coming out of elite business schools
in the late 1970s, Ms. Whitman had taken her Harvard MBA and
slipped quietly into a successful career at a blue-chip consulting
firm. She later moved to corporate America, happy to work for the
likes of Disney and Stride Rite.
</P>
<P>
   So it would take more than Internet stock options in a company
she had never heard of for Ms. Whitman to give up the peaceful life
she enjoyed with her husband and two sons in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That was until Ms. Whitman visited the cramped San Jose, Calif.,
offices of Ebay Inc., the person-to-person Web auction community
that was already attracting a following so devout it bordered on
the cultish. After a few days being wooed by venture capitalists
and hearing the testimonials of users so addicted they slipped out
of business meetings to monitor their auctions, Ms. Whitman was
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought something was very right here,'' she said. ``They
had touched a consumer nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman's ``No'' became ``Yes.'' And 14 months ago, she
packed up her family and moved to California to begin preparing
Ebay for the initial public stock offering that the company's
founder, Pierre M. Omidyar, was already mulling.
</P>
<P>
   Since its $735 million offering last September, the company's
market capitalization has blossomed to $22.1 billion _ the stock
price skyrocketing 1,019 percent. And the 42-year-old Ms. Whitman,
along with a cadre of early investors, has become very rich _ at
least on paper.
</P>
<P>
   But more to the point, she is also one of the new generation of
Internet executives who is bringing conventional corporate bona
fides and consumer product-style marketing to the Web. In the
process, executives like Ms. Whitman are changing the way Web
companies are run _ even as they are developing a new management
style suited to this emergent medium.
</P>
<P>
   With no technology background to speak of, Ms. Whitman leaves
the heavy lifting to the tech experts. But what she does seem to
have are many of the skills that may be necessary if Ebay is to
prove itself more than a hot stock or consumer fad and become an
established brand. In some ways, executives like Ms. Whitman are
becoming to technology what Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's,
was to fast food and consumer culture in the early 1960s. In those
days, an executive didn't need to understand the chemistry of
ground beef to deliver a hamburger people wanted. Likewise, today's
Internet executives don't have to be computer geniuses, but
seasoned brand managers who immerse themselves in the culture they
are trying to foster online.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kagle, a partner at the venture firm Benchmark Capital,
an early Ebay investor who hired Ms. Whitman, may put it best: ``I
was looking for a brand builder to help make Ebay a household name.
Understanding technology was not the central ingredient. You have
to get the emotional component of the customer experience in your
gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Ebay brand is becoming synonymous with Ms.
Whitman, something she is not entirely comfortable with. A man
moving furniture at Ebay's headquarters last week pointed at her, a
spark of recognition lighting up his face. ``There she is,'' he
shouted. ``My wife said she's seen you on TV. Maybe 10 times.
You're real popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman smiled and waved at the man. But the grin faded as
she turned away. ``That's what I hate,'' she said. ``I even have
the furniture man noticing me.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention isn't all that surprising, though. Ms. Whitman
campaigns for Ebay as fervently as any candidate on the trail. In
recent weeks she attended a press conference with the governor of
Utah; spoke to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington,
where she also met with congressional leaders to discuss online
privacy, and been interviewed for a handful of upcoming profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't care,'' she said, commenting on the media
swirl. ``But it is the right thing to do for Ebay.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Whitman never planned on a Web career. After a summer
selling advertising for her college magazine at Princeton
University, she switched from pre-med studies and graduated with an
economics degree in 1977. She got her MBA from Harvard Business
School two years later, and briefly worked at Procter &AMP; Gamble
before moving to San Francisco in 1981 with her husband, Griffith
R. Harsh IV, who landed a neurosurgery residency at the University
of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   There, she was hired by the consulting firm Bain &AMP; Co., where
she worked for eight years. But the demands of her husband's career
(they moved to Boston in 1992 when he became director of the brain
tumor program at Massachusetts General Hospital) and the fact that
headhunters called every time a new job surfaced, led to a number
of jobs at several companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was her two years as chief executive of Florists' Transworld
Delivery in Michigan, though, that proved her biggest
disappointment. Ms. Whitman had been hired by the florist-owned
member association in 1995 _ better known as FTD _ to help smooth
its transition to a privately held company. But several key members
opposed the idea, quick decisions were politically impossible and
competition was eroding market share. Conceding defeat, Ms. Whitman
quit in 1997, moved briefly to Hasbro and the next year found
herself at Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   As if to test the new chief's technical mettle, Ebay's Web site
crashed during her first day on the job, crippling trading for
eight hours. ``The No. 1 job at Ebay is keeping the site up,'' she
said, so she assembled a team of senior managers to assess the
site's reliability. As a result, Ebay added enough backup software
and computer servers to increase trading capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But intermittent problems have persisted, and Ms. Whitman has
not hesitated to tap powerful Silicon Valley connections to help
her. ``Last January, we were having short outages _ 10 to 15
minutes,'' she recalled. ``It made everyone here crazy.'' So she
called Scott G. McNealy, chairman of Sun Microsystems Inc., who she
has known for a decade. ``I said, `Scott, I need a nanny for this
system until the baby gets better.' '' Now Sun technicians are on
call 24 hours. But the baby can still be fussy; just last Monday
trading was interrupted for four hours because of a computer
glitch.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Ms. Whitman's job is understanding who uses the auction
service. About a year ago, Ms. Whitman set up a consumer insight
and analysis group to find out. Unlike traditional retail
companies, she said, ``there is no one between us and the
consumer.'' So twice monthly Ebay posts customer surveys on the
site. Among the suggestions that were adopted is ``Ebay Life,'' a
newsletter chock full of feel-good stories _ like the woman who
collects wedding cake decorations, 50 of which she found on Ebay,
or the stay-at-home mom who is an avid Ebay trader at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay, at times, can come off as a bit homespun, but that doesn't
concern Ms. Whitman. ``I didn't create this culture, but I want to
maintain it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kagle can attest to that. It was he who prodded her to set up a
feature that customers had been requesting: notification by e-mail
whenever favorite items are up for bid. And everyone is a source of
feedback. Even the architects who redesigned their headquarters
were asked to buy something and report back to Ms. Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, Ms. Whitman meets with staff members to
review what competing auction sites have that Ebay does not. Ebay's
recent $260 million acquisition of auction house Butterfield &AMP;
Butterfield was spurred, in part, by the threat of competition, she
said. And Ebay is rushing to expand into untapped regional as well
as foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the sense of urgency that drives her, Ms. Whitman
displays a calming, down-to-earth veneer _ perhaps a result of her
upbringing as the youngest of three children in the comfortably
affluent village of Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island's North
Shore.
</P>
<P>
   Her father was a businessman, her mother a full-time homemaker
with a sense of adventure. Ms. Whitman recalls the summer she was 6
years old when her mother, the three Whitman children and a family
friend with five children of her own, embarked on a three-month
camping trip across Canada to Alaska. Driving for long stretches in
a camper with canvas bunks in the back, the children would
sometimes get antsy and start to squabble. So Ms. Whitman's mother
came up with an unusual solution to tire them out.
</P>
<P>
   She would stop the camper, order the children out on the
deserted Alaskan highway and let them run ahead, creeping behind in
the camper until they were weary. More than once, a passing trucker
would stop to ask if something was wrong. ``You could always hear
the hiss of the air brakes,'' Ms. Whitman recalled. ``We finally
put up a sign on the back of the camper that said, `We're OK'''
</P>
<P>
   And one year, during the family's annual Christmas camping trip
on the island of St. John in the Virgin Islands, her parents were
too late to make a reservation at the usual campground. Undaunted,
the family bivouacked in a toolshed.
</P>
<P>
   That willingness to make do may help explain why Ms. Whitman was
willing recently to move with her husband and children into a
subdivision in Menlo Park that the locals refer to as ``Woodside
training houses,'' because executives there typically aspire
eventually to the exclusive homes in that nearby town. ``We didn't
want to buy a statement house,'' she said (although not buying a
statement house is a statement in itself). They do plan to move
once they have finished remodeling a 3,800-square-foot home they
bought in well-heeled Atherton.
</P>
<P>
   Working for Ebay will be her last job, Ms. Whitman said. Her
stock options _ worth about $1.3 billion as of Friday's closing
price _ vest over four years, and she plans to stay at the company
at least five years. But by then, if she has not delivered, her
options could be worth significantly less or, depending on the
capriciousness of the market, nothing at all.
</P>
<P>
   For it is not yet certain whether the new brand-conscious
executive is indeed the blueprint for the future, or simply an
expensive experiment in Internet management. Yahoo and Amazon.com
are already fast on the heels of Ebay hoping to grab the company's
loyal customers for their own. And more are sure to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this constant roar,'' Ms. Whitman said. ``The
challenge is to reorganize your business every three months.'' And
being on the run makes missteps inevitable. ``You will be wrong
sometimes,'' she said. ``That is just going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But uncertainty is a condition with which Ms. Whitman, and any
investors in Internet stocks, for that matter, must learn to live
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has done a great job so far with the stock,'' said Alberto
Vilar, president of Amerindo Investment Advisors, and one of Ebay's
largest shareholders. ``Anyone who wants to pick her off as a
second-rate manager is barking up the wrong tree.''
</P>
<P>
   But though a fan of Ms. Whitman, Vilar sounded the kind of
warning that is an implicit part of being one of today's new Web
chiefs: ``Her board and shareholders are going to lynch her if she
doesn't execute.''

PATENT PROTECTION SOUGHT FOR CLARITIN, 6 OTHER DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Wash., S.D., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With this season's bumper crop of pollen, many allergy sufferers
are turning to Claritin, a powerful antihistamine that subdues the
sneezing and coughing and general misery of allergies without
inducing drowsiness. Indeed, Claritin is one of the most popular
prescription allergy treatments on the market, with $1.9 billion in
national sales for its maker, Schering-Plough, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of patent protection, Schering-Plough enjoys a monopoly
on crucial chemical compounds in Claritin. Thus, no cheaper generic
equivalents are available.
</P>
<P>
   Given the drug's best-seller status, though, a number of drug
makers are poised to bring generic knock-offs to market when the
original Claritin patent _ granted in 1981 _ expires in 2002. That
is, unless Schering-Plough succeeds with its mighty lobbying effort
to persuade Congress to give it three more years of patent
protection, until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   At stake for Schering-Plough _ and for consumers, collectively _
are many millions of dollars. Generic drugs are usually priced 30
percent to 60 percent less than brand-name counterparts, and the
generic market is likely to divert a large chunk of business from
Schering-Plough.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Reps. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., and Jim McDermott,
D-Wash., introduced a bill in the House that would, in effect,
extend patent protection for seven drugs, including Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers contend that the drug companies deserve
extensions because of lengthy delays they encountered after
receiving their patents, as they awaited Food and Drug
Administration approval to sell the drugs to the public.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure, which has been proposed in the past, has its
critics, too. ``This is the same smelly piece of garbage that it
has always been,'' said Maura Kealey, a representative of Public
Citizen, a health consumer interest group founded by Ralph Nader.
``It's a greedy special-interest grab at the expense of consumers
and the health industry.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that a formal bill on the matter has been
introduced. Previously the drugs' backers preferred the stealth
approach. Last year, for example, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
slipped the measure into a huge federal spending bill. But it was
dropped after the generic-drug industry and some consumer groups
cried foul.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's introduction, however, does not preclude its being
tacked on to a faster-moving piece of legislation. H.W. Menn III, a
spokesman for the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association, said
his group feared the measure would be attached surreptitiously to
the Kosovo relief bill now pending on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The last successful attempt to extend a patent was in 1996, when
such a measure covering Daypro, an anti-inflammatory drug made by
the Monsanto Co.'s G.D. Searle unit, was attached to emergency
legislation to avert a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Claritin is perhaps the most recognizable drug in the current
patent-extension bill, but the bill would also cover Eulexin, a
Schering-Plough treatment for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining drugs seeking extra patent life also have powerful
parents. They are Dermatop (Hoechst Marion Roussel); Penetrex
(Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer); Cardiogen-82 (Bristol-Myers Squibb); Nimotap
(Bayer AG), and Relafen (SmithKline Beecham).
</P>
<P>
   So far no equivalent bill is pending in the Senate. But
Schering-Plough and its compatriots should not be wanting for
friends. By one estimate, nine law and lobbying operations have
been making their case on Capitol Hill. According to numbers
compiled by Congress Watch and the Center for Responsive Politics,
Schering-Plough spent nearly $4.3 million on lobbying in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of 1998, $200,000 of that went to
Baker, Donelson, Bearman &AMP; Caldwell, a law firm that includes
Howard Baker Jr., the former Senate majority leader, and Linda Hall
Daschle, the wife of the Senate's minority leader, Thomas Daschle,
D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough alone made about $170,000 in direct
contributions to House and Senate campaigns in 1997-98. And the
company contributed another $50,000 to the Democratic Senate
Campaign Committee, which is headed by Sen. Robert Torricelli, a
Democrat who, like Lautenberg, is from Schering-Plough's home state
of New Jersey. A spokesman for Torricelli said the senator had no
plans to introduce the patent-extension legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough says it and the other companies represented in
the bill simply want to be treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Claritin and the other drugs have already received a patent
extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which was passed in 1984 to
give pharmaceutical companies extra years of patent protection to
compensate for the often lengthy Food and Drug Administration
approval process. Since they were in the regulatory ``pipeline'' at
the time the legislation was passed, though, they were given only
two years of extra protection, rather than the typical five.
</P>
<P>
   ``These drugs spent an inordinate amount of time in regulatory
review'' at the FDA, said William O'Donnell, a spokesman for
Schering-Plough. He also noted that the legislation does not call
outright for an extension but for an impartial review process to
determine whether the patents should be extended.
</P>
<P>
   Critics disagree. ``They've structured it with very tight
timelines,'' Ms. Kealey said. ``There's really no way to object to
the extensions.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the World Wide Web at www.uspto.gov or
may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the
Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Warm and increasingly humid air will be drawn north through the
eastern Plains and Mississippi Valley as southerly winds increase
ahead of developing low pressure in the western Plains. Scattered
thundershowers will be common in the sultry air from the western
Gulf of Mexico coast to the central Missouri River Valley. Some
potent thunderstorms will erupt Monday afternoon as a jet stream
disturbance crosses over eastern Nebraska, Iowa and northern
Missouri. During the late afternoon and evening, a new area of
thunderstorms will gain strength over central parts of Kansas and
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   A pool of chilly air will spread gradually east from the
northern Rockies. As the cool air encounters the warmer air mass
over the Plains, areas of locally heavy rain will occur from
southern Manitoba to the western Dakotas. A mixture of valley rain
showers, intermittent mountain snow and gusty winds from the north
will cover a large part of Montana, Wyoming and the western slopes
of northern Colorado. Elsewhere in the Western states dry weather
will prevail; however, clouds will begin to increase near the
Northwest coast as a warm front approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure will promote plentiful sunshine in most
of the Northeast. Breezes from the northwest will be gusty at times
over New England where some mountain clouds and sprinkles will
develop.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast will be warm with ample sunshine in most areas. A
weak disturbance will increase the risk of a few thundershowers
near the coasts of Georgia and southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Shifting Gears
</P>
<P>
   During spring, the atmosphere shifts gears. For most of the
winter, storms move steadily at 30 to 40 mph. The pace is set by
jet stream winds which draw energy from the temperature differences
across the globe. During summer, when thermal contrast is minimal,
weather systems move half as fast. In spring, the jet stream
undergoes an unsteady northward retreat. Often, the jet stream is
as strong as it is in the winter. However, during the week ahead,
the jet stream over much of the East will weaken considerably,
resulting in slow weather changes typical of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Extended Forecast
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Thursday: Moist winds from the south will combine
with a jet stream disturbance to produce some strong thunderstorms
in the western Mississippi Valley. Breezy and cool conditions will
develop over New England while most of the Eastern states are dry
and mild. Cool and showery conditions will follow a cold front as
it move through the Northwest states. The Southwest will be hot
with plenty of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Saturday: Warm air will spread over most of the Eastern
states, although sea breezes will keep parts of the Atlantic
seaboard cool. The Southeast will be very warm and humid with
scattered afternoon thunder. A few thunderstorms will also form in
the warm air over the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes. Most of the
Northwest will be quite cool with scattered showers. The Southwest
will stay dry and very warm.

SKIP THE `HOWDY' AND SAY YES TO HEARTY EUROPEAN FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As long as we were in the neighborhood, we decided to drop in on
Dick.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, historians identify him as Richard the Lion-Hearted
and he no longer lives in Durnstein Castle overlooking the Danube.
But he was imprisoned there in 1192.
</P>
<P>
   The climb to the ruins of Dunstein was straight up and when we
rested for breath, another hiker asked my wife Alice whether we
were Americans. He was German but had once ridden a motorcycle
around America including, he said, Montana. Told that we were both
raised in Montana, he waved and uttered a greeting: ``Howdy!''
</P>
<P>
   We could not spot a McDonald's franchise from the castle ruins.
But that seemed to be one of the few viewpoints in Europe where you
would not glimpse a golden arch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like McDonald's?'' a young lady in Nancy, France, asked
us.
</P>
<P>
   Before we could answer, she said, ``I love McDonald's.''
</P>
<P>
   Her province was surrounded by vineyards yet she showed no
interest in wine. ``I drink only Coca-Cola,'' she informed us.
</P>
<P>
   At one intersection in Budapest, it was possible to spot signs
identifying Burger King, Wendy's, KFC and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we headed for Gerbeaud, established in 1858, where fine
pastries are served in a ballroom setting.
</P>
<P>
   We ordered Black Forest Cake and coffee. A Hungarian couple at
the next table daintily picked at a symmetrical pile of tiny cream
puffs that they consumed between slurps of Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we reached the historic community of Bratislava in
Slovakia, we suspected we might finally have outdistanced the
spreading Americanization of Europe. Then we spotted a sign posted
in front of an ancient stone gateway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening soon,'' it promised. ``Montana Grizzly Bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if I stumble across a package of ground beef, I'd much
rather create some European-style meatballs than a row of
quarter-pounders.
</P>
<P>
   Lion-Hearted Meatballs
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lean ground beef or ground turkey
</P>
<P>
   half-cup cup fresh rye bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 and three-fourths cups dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 lightly beaten egg
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter teaspoon rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-quarter teaspoons black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 pound small fresh mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 14-ounce can small onions
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons canola oil or butter
</P>
<P>
   one-quarter cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup beef stock
</P>
<P>
   3 carrots, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sage
</P>
<P>
   After you have sprinted up to the castle and back, moosh
together in an authentic 14th-century Tupperware bowl the beef or
turkey, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, egg,
rosemary, one-quarter teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon salt and
one-quarter cup red wine. Knead with your hands for 2 minutes, then
form into meatballs, about an inch and a half in diameter. Place on
a plate, cover with plastic wrap and chill at least an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 tablespoons of oil or butter in a large skillet. Stir in
the brown sugar. Toss in the mushrooms and stir-cook over high
heat, until they have released their juices and are turning brown.
Remove to bowl and add the onions, drained.
</P>
<P>
   Brown the meatballs on all sides in the same skillet. Add them
to the mushrooms and onions in the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter or oil to the pan.
Stir in one-quarter cup flour and stir-cook 3 minutes. Add the beef
broth and one and one-half cups red wine. Stir until the sauce is
smooth and has begun to thicken. Dump into the pan the carrots,
thyme, sage and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Plunk into the skillet the
meatballs, mushrooms and onions and stir.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the skillet and simmer for an hour. If the sauce isn't as
thick as you would like, remove the lid after 45 minutes of
cooking. Richard the Lion-Hearted preferred his meatballs in a
fairly thin sauce. Duke Leopold V liked his fairly thick. Oops,
there they go again.
</P>
<P>
   This should serve four, with buttered noodles.
</P>

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On the 54th anniversary of the Allied victory over the
Nazis, Viktor Chumakov, 73, a fighter-pilot-turned-sniper in what
Russians call the Great Patriotic War, recalled the morning his
division of infantrymen reached the Elbe River in Germany and saw
their American allies on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the Americans, waving and crossing the river on rafts,''
he said. ``We met. We had lots of fun _ singing, dancing, drinking
together. I even remember someone had a Russian accordion. That was
a great time. Everyone was so glad that the war was finally over.''
</P>
<P>
   Chumakov, who transferred to the infantry when the country's
supply of planes ran short, stood grizzled but erect Sunday, one
row of medals across his breast, a second running down the lapel of
his blue uniform. ``The Americans who fought in the war must be
ashamed today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was speaking of the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia, of
course. So were most of the other veterans interviewed on a
crystalline day at the vast, overwhelming plaza and memorial built
for them a few miles southwest of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia seemed almost a subtext of Sunday's celebration,
popping up in sermons, speeches and demonstrations in Moscow and
elsewhere in the old Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost as many as 27 million people in World War II, and
even a half-century later the nation honors its war veterans to a
degree unimaginable in the United States. The veterans are rapidly
dying off _ there are an estimated two million in Russia today,
half as many as five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's celebration, like that of every Victory Day, drew
tens of thousands to Moscow's Victory Park memorial and thousands
more to rallies, marches and ceremonies downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The streets were festooned with billboards and banners, most
bearing slogans like ``Glory to the City of Heroes of the War!''
Every veteran clutched a handful of tulips and daffodils given him
_ or her _ by children walking through the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds of veterans were dancing in front of the Bolshoi Theater,
and old units had reunions in Culture Park, along the Moscow River.
A parade of 5,000 servicemen in Red Square was dampened somewhat by
the absence _ for lack of money, it appeared _ of the usual
artillery and other military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslavia and emnity toward the West were almost
unavoidable. At a Communist Party rally near downtown, a large
crowd _ 450,000 by the party's reckoning, 11,000 by that of a local
news radio station _ waved placards bearing the face of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and cheered the slogan
``Solidarity With Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Orthodox Patriarch, Aleksy II, told worshipers that
the flames of war had risen again in southern Europe and must be
smothered before a third world war erupts.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin, swathed in a black overcoat against the
cold, gave a short speech in which he made no mention of
Yugoslavia. ``We must support each other and reliably defend
Russia's security and integrity,'' he said. ``We must do everything
possible to strengthen our army. This is our common duty.''
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, according to Russian press reports, Yeltsin said
the searing experience of World War II should give modern leaders
pause. ``All countries should not forget the main lesson of war,''
he said. ``The rule of power may spark a big fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's remarks were muted compared with those of many
veterans. None saw any parallel between Hitler's massacre of six
million Jews and the killings or expulsions of Kosovo Albanians.
Nor did any draw a distinction between the NATO alliance and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they denounced America in general, and especially
President Clinton, as outlaws and bullies bent on imposing their
will on other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chumakov, the onetime fighter pilot, angrily asserted that he
now believed old stories that the CIA had orchestrated the breakup
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A portly 74-year-old who would identify himself only as Anatoly
refused to talk about his service as an artillery gunner. ``I'm
more interested in Yugoslavia,'' he said. ``Milosevic and the other
things _ that's an internal problem. It doesn't give anyone the
right to bomb a country. A lot of people have died there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blame Clinton most of all. The man's an idiot. First he has
a war in Iraq, now one in Europe, all without U.N. permission.
They're outlaws. They don't obey international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly later said he had spent six months in Washington, D.C.,
recently visiting his daughter and her American husband and had
come away unimpressed. He left believing that Americans by nature
``want to command everything _ they're rough and crude.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksei Vasilenko, 72, a former infantryman, said he had entered
the war as a 16-year-old Cossack cavalryman, fighting Romanians.
The situation was so desperate during the first winter, he said,
that the soldiers were reduced to amputating the frozen legs of
dead Romanians, then warming them over a fire to remove their
boots.
</P>
<P>
   The unit was starving and freezing until shipments of clothing
and food arrived from the United States, under President Franklin
D. &UR;  &LR; Roosevelt's Lend-Lease program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans were good friends,'' he said. ``Roosevelt was a
good man. Now America wants to be the leader of the world. Well,
Russia is a big country as well, and it is developing new missiles.
The military industry is working again. Russia is stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians don't trust Americans.''

AS MOM WOULD SAY, `BE NICE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Mother's Day, we say nice things about people. Because that's
what Mom taught.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind ...
</P>
<P>
   - It hasn't taken the Kansas City Council long to figure out
that it's lucky to have Bonnie Sue Cooper on board.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, a mother of three who came to the council after 17 years
as a Republican member of the Missouri House, brings a wealth of
legislative know-how.
</P>
<P>
   That will come in valuable as Kansas City, Mo., continues its
annual battle to get as much out of the General Assembly as St.
Louis does.
</P>
<P>
   She has federal connections, too, through her leadership of the
5,000-member American Legislative Exchange Council in 1987 and
National Order of Women Legislators in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   New Mayor Kay Barnes quickly saw that she had a bird in hand.
She appointed Cooper to head the Legislative Rules and Ethics
Committee, which works to build ties with state and federal
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she was a member of the minority party, Cooper had a
reputation for working well with Democrats to bring home the bacon
for Kansas City. She knows how to cut deals and make compromises.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper already is working with city department heads to get more
grant money flowing to the city. During her time in Jefferson City,
Mo., she noticed that Kansas City often wasn't getting its fair
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is because we weren't asking for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians don't often aspire to move from bigger to smaller
offices, as Cooper did with her move from a state post to a local
one. But with term limits, Cooper had to move out by 2002, and she
liked the idea of overseeing some of the laws she had helped
implement at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   That, and she wanted to spend more time with her four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   - Doris Haddock is 89 and is walking across America to protest,
of all things, Congress' failure to pass campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite arthritis in her hands and aches in her legs, Haddock, a
great-grandmother of 11, journeys on. Known as Granny D, she began
her journey in Pasadena, Calif., more than three months ago and
hopes to reach Washington by January. She tries to cover 10 miles a
day.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her about the influence of money in the nation's politics
and Haddock uncoils a righteous anger and pounds the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just infuriates me!'' she told The New York Times. ``I feel
we are losing our democracy. The corporations are taking over and
deciding who gets elected.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-April, Haddock logged her 1,000th mile. She has fewer
than 2,000 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Godspeed, Granny D.
</P>
<P>
   - Jim Garner is not a mother. Nor does he have grandchildren.
But in his first year on the job, the minority leader of the Kansas
House made his presence felt in a powerful way.
</P>
<P>
   By wielding his party's 48 votes as a club, Garner was able to
wring significant concessions from Republicans eager to pass a
highway program and other bills.
</P>
<P>
   Among his achievements: creation of a children's trust fund that
will hold money from the settlement of the tobacco lawsuit. Without
the fund, the Legislature might have been tempted to fritter the
money away on other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, concluded Martin Hawver, publisher of Hawver's Capitol
Report, became the most powerful lawmaker in the statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   - U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt, a Republican from southwest Missouri, has
become a power player in just his second term in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Voted the chief deputy whip in January, Blunt is at the table
when the House leadership makes key decisions. He also is one of 10
members of George W. Bush's presidential exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say ``rising star''?

MEN CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH MOUNTAINS, AND THE ROCKS PREVAIL

<P>
   For one month short of 75 years, the mountaineer's body had lain
unmarked, unmolested and remarkably preserved through the eternal
winter on a ledge near the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
   George Mallory and his young climbing companion, Andrew Irvine,
perished in early June 1924 somewhere below the summit of Mount
Everest. A team member, witnessing their final assault on the peak,
saw them vanish into a mist above their last camp at nearly 27,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would be seen again until, in recent days, an expedition
of American climbers found and identified Mallory's remains.
Irvine's body was not found.
</P>
<P>
   Reports indicated that a fall had cost Mallory a broken leg and
injured shoulder -- fatal injuries in an environment so unforgiving
that even a small setback can spell doom.
</P>
<P>
   The lore of Everest is rich with accounts of ascents that
reached their goal and others that ended in tragedy. So it is
possible to picture Mallory's last hours.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced in that altitude mountaineers call the ``death
zone'' -- an otherworldly region of thin air, brutal cold and
spectral beauty -- he would have understood immediately the meaning
of his hurts. No doubt he would have been concerned for his
climbing colleague, 28 years old and still a student. He would have
been sorry for the grief his own wife and family would soon have to
bear.
</P>
<P>
   Then, being powerless over these matters, he surely must have
composed himself.
</P>
<P>
   As evening deepened and shadow claimed the mountain's face, the
terrible cold would have come on with a force to defeat whatever
protection the outerwear of that day afforded. And sometime in the
frozen darkness of that June night, Mallory would have drifted into
the sleep from which there was no waking.
</P>
<P>
   This is how, from reading and imagining, this flatlander
supposes the last hours would have gone. Knowing is, of course,
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Unknowable, also, is the answer to an enduring historical
question. Might Mallory and Irvine in fact have been the first two
men to surmount Everest, rather than Edmund Hillary and Tenzing
Norgay, who climbed the mountain 29 Junes later, in 1953?
</P>
<P>
   Did calamity overtake them before they reached the summit, only
some 2,200 feet above that last camp? Or is it possible they
completed their ascent, then perished on the way back down?
</P>
<P>
   And if the latter is true, wouldn't it mean that Hillary and his
Sherpa partner received the credit for an achievement that two
other brave men had earlier paid for with their lives?
</P>
<P>
   Fertile area for speculation, no doubt, but leading only to a
further question.
</P>
<P>
   What conceivable difference could it make?
</P>
<P>
   If one can believe what mountaineers say about their life's
passion, it isn't competition that draws them to the dangerous
heights, in calculated acceptance of mortal risk. At least not
competition with other climbers.
</P>
<P>
   No, they say, it's the chance for measuring the strength of
their sinews, their mastery of fear, the largeness of their hearts
against an adversary so much grander than themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mallory wouldn't have thought it very important who got the
credit for being first, his grandson said. ``He climbed for the joy
of climbing.''
</P>
<P>
   And so must all the best of them. They have their time, then
pass in their turn. And after everything, there remain the
mountains -- beautiful and wicked and unchanged -- caring nothing
for records, and never really conquered.
</P>

AS ELECTION NEARS, RIVALS SCOFF AT ANC'S ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa _ When President Nelson Mandela's governing
African National Congress issued a 14-page booklet on ``moral
renewal'' last week, South Africa's opposition parties barely
paused for breath before labeling it ``insulting insincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough with the ``pious speech,'' the ``fruitless workshops''
and the ``glossy booklets'' said the opposition United Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   The African Christian Democratic Party said much the same. ``To
demonstrate that the ANC is serious about moral renewal, it needs
to punish immorality and criminal actions by members of its own
ranks,'' said the Christian Democrats' president, Kenneth Meshoe.
</P>
<P>
   In a country with a jobless rate that may be as high as 40
percent and a crime rate so high that there are an average of 140
murders or attempted murders every day, unemployment and safety are
the issues that top the agenda for most South Africans. But with
only four weeks to go before this country's second post-apartheid
elections, corruption is emerging as a key issue too.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that South Africans give the Mandela's government
a poor rating on rooting out and controlling corruption in its
ranks. In a poll conducted last November by the Institute for
Democracy in South Africa, only 37 percent said the government had
done a good job in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the ANC has begun to take on this issue. It held a
conference on corruption last month. The booklet, which
encapsulates the topics discussed at the conference, pledges, among
other measures, to engage its members in a meaningful debate on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who is expected to
become the country's next president, is holding daylong public
hearings in the country's three most-populous provinces to ``obtain
first-hand impressions'' about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   At the first session in Soweto last week, many of those who took
to the microphones could hardly control their anger and
frustration. Hospital employees said that some doctors and nurses
sold medical files to lawyers involved in insurance scams; crime
victims told of watching perpetrators go free because ``suddenly''
the evidence had disappeared, and township residents told of paying
money to housing officials for houses that never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Most wore ANC buttons and T-shirts or waved party flags and
talked of low-level corruption. But one elderly man withstood the
boos of the crowd to aim higher. ``Don't come to us only when it is
election time because you will not know all our concerns,'' he
said, adding that the ANC needs to root out corruption in its own
ranks before coming to the people. Mbeki simply stared at him.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say that the way South Africa's first black
government has handled allegations of corruption has left it
vulnerable to criticism. Certainly corruption is nothing new to
South Africa. Experts say that there may well have been more of it
under the former apartheid government, although information about
it was far more tightly controlled then.
</P>
<P>
   The government's leading corruption investigator, Justice Willem
Heath, says he has recovered millions of dollars in recent years,
much of it from corrupt officials who were operating long before
Mandela _ the country's first black president _ was elected in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts point out that the ANC tends to circle the
wagons when allegations of corruption are made against its own
members, particularly those who were active during the
anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ANC has not always acted swiftly and cleanly in dealing
with corruption,'' said Tom Lodge, a political analyst at the
University of Witwatersrand. ``They are always saying: `We'll have
to wait and see. There has been no conviction yet.' Whereas in many
countries, just an allegation of corruption and you are out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in recent months, with the elections coming up, the ANC
appears to have made several missteps in this area. For instance,
when it unveiled its preliminary list of candidates in March,
opposition parties had a field day. Democratic Party officials
quickly found 17 who they said had questionable records. The New
National Party, another opposition group, found 12.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations ranged from the petty to the serious and
included one candidate who had been convicted of attempted murder.
Several others were under investigation for fraud. Eventually,
seven of the candidates were dropped from the list.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who has been
convicted of kidnapping and could face further charges relating to
the activities of her bodyguards in the late 1980s, remains on the
final list of candidates. She is still extremely popular among the
poorest South Africans and has been a potent campaigner for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, the ANC was embroiled in another
controversy that critics saw as more evidence of a wishy-washy
standard when it came to those with ``struggle credentials.'' It
nominated a lawyer, Ramesh Vassen, to be South Africa's consul
general to India.
</P>
<P>
   While Vassen was once a member of the present justice minister's
law firm and an anti-apartheid activist, he also turns out to have
been convicted of stealing money from client trust funds. At first,
ANC officials defended their choice, though eventually Vassen's
nomination was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the ANC see a far broader pattern of ethical laxness.
They point to incidents ranging from the hero's welcome that was
afforded to another anti-apartheid activist, Allan Boesak, when he
returned to face charges of stealing hundreds of thousands of
dollars from his own foundation (he was convicted), to the refusal
to take any action at all against the health minister, Nkosazana
Zuma. Her department had been accused of wasting millions of
dollars on an extravagant and ineffective AIDS prevention play,
called Sarafina 2. Investigators have concluded that the awarding
of the contract for the play was highly irregular.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Anyhow, there is little doubt that the ANC will win the June 2
national and provincial elections. It is still riding a wave of
loyalty for its role in bringing apartheid to an end. But the party
wants a two-thirds majority, which would give it the power to
change the constitution if it wants to. So every vote counts. And
party officials believe the corruption issue is hurting them.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Mbeki often deplores corruption and calls
on everyone to take action against it. When Mbeki finally rose to
speak at the Chiawelo Community Center in Soweto recently he urged
the audience to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   In the measured tones that have become his trademark as a
speaker, he suggested that while there was no bed linen left at the
local hospital, many of them could see hospital linen hanging from
their neighbors' washing lines. They must take steps to report
their neighbors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government cannot succeed if you just sit here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has been outspoken about the need for moral rejuvenation.
He argues that the years under apartheid have left the country in
``a threatening state of moral degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say that the ANC's recent efforts to confront
corruption _ the conference, the booklet, and Mbeki's tours _ are
simply a way of focusing attention away from the government's
handling of the problem.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing right now is a political strategy to cope
with the fallout,'' Lodge said. ``These are not an anti-corruption
measure.''

AD COLUMN: AN AD MAN IN SEARCH OF AN AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., N.J.)  (jw) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A co-founder of one of America's best-known agencies now wants
to hire an agency. And it's not likely to be the agency he once
headed.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Chiat, who had been chairman and chief executive at
Chiat/Day, the agency known for campaigns for advertisers like
Apple Computer, Energizer and Nissan, is seeking a shop to handle
the account of Screaming Media (www.screamingmedia.net), a New York
company in which he holds a minority stake and is temporarily
acting as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming Media, formerly named Interactive Connection, is in a
business known as content streaming, collecting and distributing to
Web sites news articles on topics such as technology, health and
business. The content is meant as an incentive for computer users
to visit the sites more frequently and spend more time once they
are there.
</P>
<P>
   Chiat is not automatically awarding the assignment, with
billings estimated at $3 million to $5 million, to his former
agency, now named TBWA/Chiat/Day, without a review. Rather, he
plans to hold what could be called an online audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do our agency search on the Internet,'' Chiat,
67, said last week in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agencies can go to our Web site and send us e-mail on why they
think they should be our agency,'' he added. ``And they can put the
pitch up on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they present a compelling story,'' he added, ``we'll hire
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if TBWA/Chiat/Day would participate in the ``Chiathon'' _
the nickname for the review coined by Jim Pavoldi, a salesman at
Screaming Media _ Chiat replied, ``They're certainly invited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have total respect for the agency,'' he said. ``They're a
great agency. But I want to see if agencies out there understand
what we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiat said that he would ``probably be a minor part of the
decision-making'' because of his former ties to TBWA/Chiat/Day.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Chiat is involved or not, TBWA/Chiat/Day is bowing out
of the review gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay and I had dinner the other night,'' said Bob Kuperman,
president and chief executive for the Americas at TBWA Worldwide in
New York. ``And I told him he'd be the worst client in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived with the guy for 10 years,'' Kuperman said, laughing.
``I have to have him as a client now?''
</P>
<P>
   Chiat founded Chiat/Day in 1968 with Guy Day, as they merged
Faust/Day with Jay Chiat &AMP; Associates in Los Angeles. Chiat/Day's
bold risk-taking for accounts like Apple (the ``1984'' commercial)
and Energizer (E.B. the battery bunny) earned the agency a
reputation for creative prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Chiat left Chiat/Day after it was sold to Omnicom Group in 1995
and merged with domestic operations of TBWA International to form
the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of TBWA Worldwide. Chiat has been serving
as a consultant to Omnicom as he is paid out his share of the
purchase price for Chiat/Day over several years.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign for Screaming Media would have two purposes, said
Alan Ellman, 36, president, who joined Chiat for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   One would be to attract additional Web sites as clients as well
as additional sources of news articles for the content the company
provides.
</P>
<P>
   The other would be to promote a feature now being tested that
Ellman termed ``contextual commerce,'' which ``utilizes interest in
editorial to sell product.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiat explained: ``We have software programs that allow us to
embed applets in editorial. So you can click on a word and a window
comes up with an on-site link.'' For instance, a computer user
reading a book review could click on the title or the author's
name, bringing up a Web site like Barnesandnoble.com where the book
could be ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web sites split the revenue with us,'' Chiat said, ``and
the content provider.''
</P>
<P>
   These programs are now being tested.
</P>
<P>
   Chiat and Ellman acknowledged that contextual commerce could
elicit objections from those perceiving it as another way the
Internet blurs the lines between editorial and commercial content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to do it with some kind of sensitivity,'' Chiat
said. ``We don't want to turn the editorial into a throwaway
shopping paper.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to searching for an agency, Screaming Media is also
seeking a chief executive to replace Chiat, who has been handling
those duties temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the Steve Jobs interim CEO school of management,''
Chiat said, smiling, referring to the interim chief executive at
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Chiat and Ellman listed other investors in Screaming Media as
Regis McKenna, president of McKenna Group, a management consulting
firm in Palo Alto, Calif.; Kevin O'Connor, chairman and chief
executive at Double Click in New York, and James Robinson III,
former chairman and chief executive of the American Express Co.
</P>
<P>
   Chiat also has other Internet interests. He is a member of the
board of Cybergold Inc. in Berkeley, Calif., and an investor in
Passlogix Inc. in New York and Softcom Video in Iselin, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing his experiences on Madison Avenue and in cyberspace,
Chiat declared that the online realm ``moves at a factor at least
10 times faster than an agency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a short attention span like I do,'' he added,
``it's perfect.''

WASHINGTON MEMO: SEARCHING FOR CAUSES OF YOUTHFUL ANGST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va., Colo., Okla.)   (jw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When violence strikes yet again in the schoolyard,
Washington's search for villains is never far behind. Democrats
tend to finger guns and their powerful lobby, the National Rifle
Association. Republicans are more inclined to blame Hollywood and
the glorification of natural born killers in movies, music and
video games.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, ever seeking a triangular third way, said in
the aftermath of the shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado
that neither uncontrolled guns nor vulgar culture was singularly at
fault.
</P>
<P>
   In a search for a meaningful public response to Columbine and
other recent deadly incidents, Clinton convenes a White House
meeting on Monday to address the causes of violence by teen-agers.
The session will include entertainment executives, representatives
of hunting groups and gun manufacturers, clergy, education
officials, nonprofit organization leaders, law-enforcement
officials and students.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton does not intend to make scapegoats either of
Hollywood or the gun lobby, mindful of both groups' political
influence and very deep pockets. The president, in effect, will try
to find a solution in the space between the First Amendment's
protection of free speech and the Second Amendment's guarantee of
the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, conference planners said, may be found in a
therapeutic definition of violence as a public health problem to be
addressed by a range of solutions that go well beyond the control
of violent images in the media or restrictions on gun sales. White
House officials said the conference would explore the roots of
youthful angst and alienation, a safe target that is unlikely to
fire back or withhold contributions. There is, as yet, no
alienation industry with a lobbying arm in Washington or a
well-funded political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, organizers say, is to devise a national strategy to
stem violent outbursts by adolescents, but the only concrete action
likely to emerge on Monday is the announcement of a new study on
violence by Surgeon General David Satcher. The study will take a
broad look at the roles of popular culture, peer pressure, mental
illness and the availability of guns in triggering homicidal rage
by young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence is a serious public health issue that claims the
lives of more than 13 young people in the United States every
day,'' Satcher said Sunday in a statement to The New York Times.
``While we should not wait to implement preventive measures that
have already been found to be effective in surgeon generals'
reports on violence issued in 1972 and 1985, our new report will
build upon those previous studies and look at factors not present
when they were issued, such as the Internet and video games.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Colorado tragedy, Clinton proposed a modest set of
gun control measures, but at the same time announced he wanted to
``bury the hatchet'' in his years-long feud with the gun lobby. The
NRA issued a ritual denunciation of the president's plan, but said
it would propose gun-control measures of its own this week.
Representatives of a hunting group, the American Shooting Sports
Council, endorsed the president's proposals and will attend
Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The president also took a mild swipe at Hollywood, even as he
praised the entertainment industry's willingness to take voluntary
steps to limit youngsters' access to violent material. But Clinton
has said nothing to jeopardize attendance by entertainment industry
leaders at a $1.5 million Democratic fund-raiser next weekend in
Beverly Hills that will be held by David Geffen, the music magnate
and co-founder of Dreamworks studio. Clinton is the featured
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, White House officials and Democratic fund-raisers have
labored over the past week to reassure donors in the entertainment
complex that the president had no intention of launching a new
moral assault on Hollywood. Top executives from CBS, ABC and the
cable, movie and music lobbies have accepted invitations to
Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to help kids get connected up,'' said Secretary of
Education Richard Riley, one of the participants in Monday's
session. ``This alienation of young people where they become
`loners' is troubling in this complex society we live in. There's
no reason for any child to feel alone or to feel alienated.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the entertainment business said they saw no harm in
another earnest White House talk session on youth and violence, so
long as it did not infringe upon artistic freedom or mistake
conversation for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a good thing and I have no doubt they're
sincere,'' Geffen said in a telephone interview. ``But I wonder if
they'll have pharmacologists there to explore teen-age minds.
Clearly these are very disturbed kids. Before you talk to people in
music or entertainment or video games, or even gun control, you
need to talk to psychiatrists.''
</P>
<P>
   Geffen expressed the frustration of many in the entertainment
world with Washington's instinctive reaction to look to popular
culture as the wellspring of youthful fantasy and action. ``Where
were the parents?'' they ask over and over. ``Where were the
teachers and counselors?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not blame the libraries? They're full of violent books,''
Geffen said. ``If you're looking for violence, what about the
evening news? America is bombing Yugoslavia; it's on every day.
It's not a movie, it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top movie industry executive, who insisted he not be
identified because he often worked closely with the White House,
said that the Monday meeting was likely to produce little of
substance, beyond showing the president's concern about an issue
that troubles virtually all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trying to do a 30-second commercial, produce a
sound bite and move on,'' this executive said. ``Clinton believes
if you say something it's done. He's always mistaken talk for
action.''
</P>
<P>
   If the president was serious, he added, he would take on the gun
lobby and propose tough new gun laws. ``But nobody wants to take on
the NRA, both sides have vulnerable seats and they know the NRA
could pour a lot of money into those districts. So they seize on TV
and the movies and cable as the source of discontent in our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not invite the rifle association's most
prominent officials, like Charlton Heston, the president, to its
conference. Instead, it invited a lower-profile member of the board
of directors _ former Rep. Bill Brewster, R-Okla., now a lobbyist
in Washington. It also invited gun manufacturers and other gun
lobbyists who have practiced more moderate tactics than the rifle
association.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's political action committee donated $1.35 million to
Republican congressional candidates in the 1998 election cycle and
$283,000 to Democratic candidates, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. PACs and
individuals in the entertainment industry gave $4.4 million to
Democrats and $2.8 million to Republicans in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, as is his custom, is trying to steer a path between the
clout of the NRA and the cultural reach of the entertainment
business. The White House conference was originally intended to
explore the link between youthful violence and media influence. But
after sharp protests from the president's Hollywood patrons and the
increasingly powerful Internet lobby, the focus changed to a
broader look at society's responsibilities, including the role of
school, family and faith-based institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A media lobbyist who attended a White House planning session
last week said that officials made it clear that the president did
not intend to blame violent images in the media for real violence
in the schoolyard.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Friday that he was engaged in a search not
for scapegoats, but for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are turning the tide on all kinds of social problems. Now
we must turn our intense efforts to this issue of violence,''
Clinton said in a brief Rose Garden statement, `` We will not ask
who takes the blame, but how we can all take responsibility. And I
will challenge everyone there and everyone in America to do their
part.''

BEYOND BLOND AND GORGEOUS:   TAKING ON L.A.'S TV IMAGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Everyone in Los Angeles is blond, beautiful and,
duh, has an IQ capable of absorbing only one Leonardo. DiCaprio,
not da Vinci. The town stops dead in its tracks every week for a
late afternoon freeway chase that is more entertaining than
anything else on television. Everyone over 30 gets facial surgery,
and that includes the women. You can't find a good bagel either.
</P>
<P>
   This small-screen perspective on Los Angeles, focusing on the
banal, the superficial and the glitzy, has been beamed out in
dozens of television shows over the decades, reflecting an image of
Los Angeles that has acquired the undeniable patina of truth for
many viewers. But the city's image, like television, is changing.
Its odd trajectory can be traced in the departure of that
archetypal L.A. show, ``Melrose Place,'' on May 24 after seven
years and 226 episodes on Fox, and the critical success of the new
ABC comedy ``It's Like, You Know,'' which makes fun of the kind of
gorgeous, self-absorbed airheads who populate ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's often been a kind of shallow view of L.A.,'' said
Peter Mehlman, a former co-executive producer of ``Seinfeld'' who
created ``It's Like, You Know.'' The new show is about a group of
wacky underachievers in a Los Angeles apartment house who do things
like spend an entire episode watching a high-speed car chase on the
101 South.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception of L.A. has always been that of surface
glamour, and there's never been much of an attempt to get beneath
the veneer,'' he said. ``Actually, it's one of the saddest cities
on earth because so many people come out here struggling for some
kind of dream, and so few get there. And it's hard to see because
it's so physically pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to New York, which appeals to television executives
precisely for its grittiness (though even shows like ``NYPD Blue''
have their moments of unreality, too), Los Angeles is often
presented as a sun-drenched pastel city with barely a trace of
economic or social diversity. Even ``Dragnet,'' which made its
debut in 1952 and became one of the most successful police dramas
ever by drawing on actual cases from the files of the Los Angeles
Police Department, rarely focused on the violence, poverty and
racial and immigration problems that were roiling the city in the
postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   Several new Los Angeles-based dramatic series (including one by
the filmmaker David Lynch) that promise to deal with the
complexities of life in the city may turn up on home screens in the
fall. This more complex vision of Los Angeles is probably the next
wave in television. (While movie studios have churned out film noir
set in Los Angeles since the 1930s, television has shied away from
these bleak mysteries in favor of the city's sun and light.)
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' complexity goes only so far on television. Even
David E. Kelley, the highly skilled and innovative creator of shows
like ``Ally McBeal,'' ``The Practice'' and ``Picket Fences,'' has a
new show, ``Snoops,'' that by all accounts depicts the more
glamorous side of the detective business. The show, tentatively set
for ABC, features handsome private eyes who use high-tech means to
catch the bad guys. One network executive described it as `` `Miami
Vice' in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Some television shows perpetuate the banality of life in Los
Angeles. Look at ``Baywatch,'' with its cast of hunk lifeguards
with perfectly chiseled features. Or the USA Network's successful
``Pacific Blue,'' about seven young male and female police officers
in tight clothes riding on motorbikes in Santa Monica. ``It's cops
on bikes,'' said Joan Swift, the publicity chief at the network.
``They're in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, some of the successful shows involving New York,
like ``Seinfeld,'' ``Mad About You,'' ``Law and Order'' and ``NYPD
Blue,'' have been viewed by critics as more realistic and
hard-edged. (The hit show ``Friends,'' also set in New York, is
another matter.)
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, with the exception of ``Law and Order,'' most of
these New York-based series are actually shot in studios in Los
Angeles. And it shows. Even on a series like ``NYPD Blue'' there is
a notable absence of people seen _ and accents heard _ on the
streets of New York now: Koreans, Indians, Pakistanis, Africans,
Latinos, Russians, Israelis and others.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a handful of shows like ``Cosby,'' with its star,
Bill Cosby, who is black, the New York region is often represented
in shows like ``The King of Queens'' and ``Everyone Loves Raymond''
as a place populated by Italian, Irish and Jewish types _ and
stereotypes _ , where everyone speaks with an extreme Noo Yawk
accent like that of Fran Drescher in ``The Nanny.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the shows set in Los Angeles often depict the
outlandish wealth of areas like Beverly Hills and Bel Air. This
goes back to ``fish out of water'' comedies like a corny 1960s
series, ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' about the backwoods Clampett
clan who strike oil and move to Beverly Hills. More recently, there
was the somewhat more realistic ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' about
a black rapper from a tough Philadelphia neighborhood (Will Smith)
who moves in with wealthy Bel Air relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet blondes at the beach still seem to predominate.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spelling, whose company, Spelling Television, produced
``Melrose Place,'' and whose Los Angeles-themed shows over the
years like ``Mod Squad,'' ``Charlie's Angels,'' ``Hart to Hart''
and ``Beverly Hills 90210'' have, in some ways, shaped the kind of
glitzy version of Los Angeles, said, essentially, that fantasy
sells, not only around the nation but, more importantly, abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do some of our L.A. shows for two crazy reasons,'' Spelling
said. ``When it's snowing in the East and Midwest, when it's
freezing outside, people love to see the beaches and the sunshine.
And in foreign countries they love L.A. Sunset Strip. Malibu. Rodeo
Drive. The homes. It's the glamour. They love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Locklear, who played the malevolent Amanda Woodward on
``Melrose Place,'' said that the highly successful series, about a
group of young people who live in a garden-apartment complex,
initially floundered when it was tamely patterned as a sober
``twentysomething'' version of the hit show ``Thirtysomething.''
Then the creators added some spice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fantasy,'' she said. ``The women became a little
stronger than the men. It was sexy girls wearing tight clothes and
no bras.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Locklear said with a laugh that she hoped she would now get
more varied parts. ``I'm a little typecast,'' she said. ``People
think of me as a nasty-type person who always wore short skirts.
Hopefully, I'll be able to break that.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   As a reaction to the fantasy version of Los Angeles, ``It's
Like, You Know'' is the first show to take on the city with a
vengeance. Ted Harbert, an executive producer of the show and
former chairman of ABC Entertainment, said he could not recall a
series that had turned a city like Los Angeles into a dominant
character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Kramer in `Seinfeld,' or Ted Baxter in `Mary Tyler
Moore,' and Norm and Cliff in `Cheers,' L.A. is one of our crazy
and loopy characters,'' said Harbert, who grew up in Pound Ridge,
N.Y., and Stamford, Conn. ``L.A. is a confusing place because it
lures you with wonderful weather and great opportunity and then
often frustrates with its inability to deal with complex emotions.
It celebrates superficiality in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   (ABC executives remain uneasy that the show, which has performed
moderately well, may be too much of an inside joke for most of the
country.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea _ or at least the title _ for the show came when
Mehlman, a onetime sportswriter for The Washington Post, visited
Fred Segal, a trendy clothing store. ``The woman who worked there
used the term `it's like, you know,' about five times in one
minute, and I thought that was a great idea for a title. And if I
was going to use that title it would have to be set in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast includes Chris Eigeman as a New York journalist
visiting Los Angeles to write a book, ``Living in Los Angeles: How
Can You Stomach It?'' Actually, Eigeman's personal view of Los
Angeles is quite similar to the character he plays. ``I do think
L.A. is a little moral petri dish of degradation,'' said Eigeman,
who lives in Brooklyn when he is not making the show in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But the star is the actress Jennifer Grey (``Dirty Dancing''),
who plays Jennifer Grey. Reality blurs. In the show, the
self-deprecating Ms. Grey talks about some real-life boyfriends and
her facial surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not actually playing myself,'' Ms. Grey said. ``I'm
playing a character loosely based on certain facts of my life. It's
also based on what the public might think I'm like, based on movies
or rumors or tabloids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grey lived in Los Angeles for eight years, before moving
back to New York two years ago. She has an apartment in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is about the most demented city in the country, and
how it dements the people who live here,'' said Ms. Grey, who
admitted nonetheless that the yoga, the Pilates exercise, the
weather and the health food were better in Los Angeles than New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's real in L.A.; it's all about illusion,'' Ms. Grey
said. ``It's about illusion of power, illusion of youth, illusion
of wealth. Nothing is what it seems.''
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of L.A. bashing is anathema to other actors as
well as filmmakers, who said it was far too easy dismiss the city
as superficial when it is, in fact, extraordinarily complex.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, whose films include ``Blue Velvet'' and ``Lost Highway,''
as well as the cult serial drama ``Twin Peaks,'' has just completed
an ABC pilot for a dramatic series set in Los Angeles called
``Mulholland Drive.'' He said he hoped to deal with numerous levels
of life in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first glance there's a big sprawling sameness to L.A.,''
Lynch said. ``But every little section has its own mood. And I love
the different moods in L.A. The Valley is so different from Santa
Monica, which is so different from Pomona or Riverside. It sort of
excites me to deal with the specific moods here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mark Johnson, producer of the CBS drama ``L.A. Doctors,''
said he and the show's creator, John Lee Hancock, were seeking to
present a series as much about Los Angeles as it was about doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we did this was that, like it or not, L.A. was at
the cutting edge of what's going on in the country,'' Johnson said.
``It's easy to make fun of superficiality and shallowness. But
there are conflicts and temptations and dynamics that abound in
L.A. that are much more harsh and extreme than anywhere else in the
country. And that, we hope, makes good television.''  &QL;

(EDITORS: Daily News Film Critic Bob Strauss attended the first
press screening   of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace''
on Friday night in New York.   The movie opens nationwide May 19.
He gives the film 3 1/2 stars out of four maximum.) 
BY BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prequel has landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
madly anticipated follow-up to his epic ``Star Wars'' movie
trilogy, was finally shown over the weekend to film critics,
exhibitors and other anointed souls who congregated in Gotham. It
hits theaters nationwide May 19.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Phantom Menace'' is pretty good. Outstanding in
many parts _ once it gets rolling.
</P>
<P>
   When you get past the setup, the rest is intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   It's Lucas' first directing effort since the original ``Star
Wars'' film, which changed the movie dreamscape forever 22 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's got nearly 2,000 digital special effects shots. That's by
far the most ever seen in one film _ four times the number that
``Titanic'' had.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes us to dazzling new worlds teeming with outlandish
alien creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There are even some fine actors along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' strengths as a filmmaker and mythmaker have been nothing
but enhanced by the advances in computer graphics technology that
his own company, Industrial Light and Magic, has been at the
forefront of developing for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   His genius for visual grandeur and kinetic excitement has never
been realized with the photo-realistic detail seen here.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that ``Phantom Menace'' presents the most
elaborate, thoroughly integrated fantasy universe ever put on film.
</P>
<P>
   You could watch it without sound and still be enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   More enthralled in some stretches, since Lucas' main deficiency
as a writer and director _ which can be summed up as a tin ear for
dialogue and its delivery _ apparently can't be improved upon by
high-tech wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   And because the early parts of ``Phantom Menace'' are the
talkier ones, they're by nature the least satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's action from the get-go _ one short, early
monster bit is wittier and scarier than all of last year's
``Godzilla'' remake _ the film's first 45 minutes are mainly
devoted to extensive exposition and introductions. Probably not too
many ways around that, though it would have helped if the human
characters displayed more personality than the sets.
</P>
<P>
   But wait.
</P>
<P>
   Set three or so decades before the first ``Star Wars,''
``Phantom Menace'' is mainly concerned with the decay of a
democratic but ineffectual galactic republic and the origins of the
boy who will become Darth Vader, both key factors in the
forthcoming rise of the evil empire. A plot summary follows, so
stop reading now if you don't want to know that happens.
</P>
<P>
   A masterful if somewhat unorthodox Jedi knight, Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson), and his eager young apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan
McGregor, not even trying to sound like Alec Guinness), are
dispatched to settle a dispute between the greedy, militaristic
Trade Federation and the teen-age Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman)
of the Edenlike planet Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   The monkish warriors, practitioners of the good part of that
cosmic spiritual essence called the Force, are almost immediately
attacked by the federation's skeletal, birdlike robot soldiers.
They barely escape with the deposed queen to the outlaw desert
planet of Tatooine.
</P>
<P>
   You'll recall that that's where we first encountered the hero of
the original trilogy, Luke Skywalker. This time, while hunting for
spare parts to repair their damaged spaceship, Qui-Gon encounters
9-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd, whom you may have seen
playing Arnold Schwarzenegger's kid in ``Jingle All the Way'').
Though a slave to a kind of flying cross between a blue mosquito
and a vulture named Watto, young Anakin possesses a mechanical
genius (he's already built a humorously see-through prototype
version of the fussy droid C-3PO) and an attunement to the Force
that, by Qui-Gon's reckoning, is off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Young Anakin proves his mettle _ and kicks the movie into high
gear _ when he enters an all-or-nothing pod race that could earn
him his freedom or a ghastly early death.
</P>
<P>
   This long, grippingly intense sequence is worth the price of a
ticket alone.
</P>
<P>
   The pod racers are rickety constructs of twin jet engines
connected to small, exceedingly vulnerable driving modules. The
race itself, several laps around the rocky, barren Tatooine
landscape, is like the ``Ben Hur'' chariot sequence in anti-gravity
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   It's a senses-shattering suite of speed and sound (forget what
was said about watching in silence earlier; Ben Burtt, Lucas'
quadruple Oscar-winning sound designer, does the best work of his
career here) that elevates the movie, and the movies, to a new
level.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, ``Phantom Menace'' crisply careens from one
awesome spectacle to another.
</P>
<P>
   There's a visit to Coruscant, a planet entirely covered by a
city. There's plenty of fancy spacecraft jockeying. A younger,
greener Yoda, still puppeted and voiced by the incomparable Frank
Oz, makes a welcome appearance. And there's the inevitable fight to
regain the Italianate ice cream castles of Naboo, which
incorporates battle elements from all the previous films and finds
ways to top most of them.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Of the key new characters, the computer-generated, comically
klutzy amphibian creature Jar Jar Binks is, as many feared,
initially annoying.
</P>
<P>
   But the floppy-eared goon grows more tolerable as the film goes
along, something which could not be said about Ewoks. And the way
he interacts so intimately with Qui-Gon, Anakin and the gang is
never short of astounding.
</P>
<P>
   As for main villain Darth Maul, the demonic practitioner of the
dark side of the Force is portrayed with great gymnastic vigor, if
not exactly deep resonance, by martial arts stunt master Ray Park.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is likely to threaten Han Solo's position at the top of
the ``Star Wars'' character canon. But it would be wrong to leave
anyone with the impression that Lucas hasn't written anything as
interesting as what he shows us here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace,'' by turns more serious and more childlike
than the earlier trilogy, truly seems to express the whole mythos
from young Anakin's point of view. This is not wrong; not only is
``Star Wars'' the ultimate boy's adventure of our era, the whole
saga is clearly now about Anakin's troubling evolution, and it is
only fitting that we start out on that path in his hopeful,
wonder-driven shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Lucas refines the scope of his mythic theme here,
moving from archetypal heroic elements to more specifically
Judeo-Christian ideas about the struggle between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   He even lays the ground for a pretty sophisticated political
allegory _ and a sadly relevant one. Debate in the Galactic Senate
over the Naboo situation sounds presciently similar to current
discussions of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There is, then, great storytelling in ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas just expresses it better with pictures than words.
</P>
<P>
   And this movie has some of the greatest pictures ever whipped up
in cyberspace or on celluloid, which is certainly fitting for the
millennial chapter of the movie century's most popular fantasy.

 `OUR GUYS:' OUTRAGE OVER A RAPE IN GLEN RIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) (DW) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They do look like young gods at first. ``Such beautiful boys,''
as one local woman says, strong and brave on the high school
football field, glowing with confidence afterward, handsome,
popular, golden. But half an hour into the ABC film ``Our Guys:
Outrage in Glen Ridge,'' when these teen-agers walk into a room as
a group, their red and yellow football jackets might as well be
gang colors or the uniform of an enemy army. Privilege has bred a
dangerous arrogance, even if the neighbors refuse to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Guys'' is the story of the 1989 gang rape in Glen Ridge,
N.J., of a mentally retarded 17-year-old girl. It is also the story
of a value system that reveres and protects good looks and success,
at any age, while disregarding the rights of the weak or different.
The portrait is of a community that sees gang rape, if committed by
white boys with nice suits and college plans, as a youthful prank.
``Our Guys'' is a quiet, intelligent, complicated,
thought-provoking film that deserves to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Matarazzo, the teen-age actress who made her film debut
as an unhappy seventh grader in ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' gives
an outstanding performance as Leslie Faber. (The character name is
a pseudonym given to the victim by Bernard Lefkowitz, a journalism
professor at Columbia, in his book about the case.) Ally Sheedy, a
little hardened since her Brat Pack days, is good (if somewhat
self-satisfied) as Kelly Brooks, the police detective who presses
the case when others just want it to go away. Eric Stoltz plays
Robert Laurino, the prosecutor, with his usual excellence. In a
uniformly good cast, Kett Turton stands out in a small role as John
Tierney, a decent student who takes action. Paul Brown's script and
Guy Ferland's direction make virtually every character and action
believable and understandable.
</P>
<P>
   When Glen Ridge's adults first react to the suggestion that a
group of high school football players have committed rape, they
reveal something about their priorities, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the good kids; they can get any girl they want,''
says L. Frank Bennett (Eric Keenleyside), Kelly's boss, whose son
may have been involved. ``We're having a tough enough season as it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably enough, the boys offer the ``she wanted it''
defense, to which the prosecutor replies, ``Since when does
consensual sex involve a bat and a broom?''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie has such a desperate, childlike need to please and to fit
in that she changes her story constantly, even in court. Her
understanding of the situation may not be complete. When she first
sees a television news report about the case, she turns to her
parents, crying ``How could you lie and say I was retarded?'' and
runs to her room. Soon her classmates are wearing yellow ribbons to
show support for the boys. The community has turned against Leslie
(``She's the one ruining this town with a vicious rumor.'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Guys'' could have gone further. Some of the boys' ruder
habits, like masturbating in the classroom, described in
Lefkowitz's book, aren't referred to here. The worst practice
described is their habit of watching, hidden in a closet, while one
of their group has sex with an unwitting girl (``It's completely
`Porky's,''' says John. ``They live for it.'')
</P>
<P>
   The rape scene itself, depicted at the end of the film, has been
so toned down for network acceptability that what's left of the
horror is anticlimactic.
</P>
<P>
   After four years free on bail, two of the young men went to
prison. A third was sentenced to probation and community service.
Charges against the police lieutenant's son were dropped.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; EVERYBODY WAS SO YOUNG: GERALD AND SARA MURPHY. A LOST
GENERATION LOVE STORY. &LR;  By Amanda Vaill. Broadway, $15. The Murphys
were a dazzling, rich American couple who knew and entertained just
about everybody who was anybody in Paris and on the French Riviera
in the 1920's, from Fitzgerald to Picasso. In 1998 our reviewer,
Brooke Allen, called this ``a marvelously readable biography'' by
``a skillful and compassionate writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ABOUT A BOY. &LR;  By Nick Hornby. Riverhead, $12.95. Will Freeman
is a smug but aimless London bachelor in his 30s who devises a
dating scheme to tap the market in sexy divorced women by
pretending to be a single dad and joining a support group full of
single mothers. Before long, though, he runs into a troubled
12-year-old boy who sees right through him, and the two become
unlikely soul mates. ``Hornby ... combines a skilled, intuitive
appreciation for the rigors of comic structure with highly original
insights about the way the enchantments of popular culture
insinuate themselves into middle-class notions of romance,'' Hal
Espen wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A WALK IN THE WOODS: REDISCOVERING AMERICA ON THE APPALACHIAN
TRAIL. &LR;  By Bill Bryson. Broadway, $13. The author chronicles in
breezy, good-humored fashion his five-month struggle to hike the
2,100-mile Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine. Bryson is ``a
satirist of the first rank, one who writes (and walks) with
Chaucerian brio,'' Dwight Garner wrote here last year.  &UR; SEARCHING
FOR YELLOWSTONE: ECOLOGY AND WONDER IN THE LAST WILDERNESS &LR; , by
Paul Schullery (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14), is an environmental
and human history of Yellowstone National Park by a longtime park
ranger and administrator. ``Schullery ... has given us a
refreshingly unhyperbolic look at the place he loves,'' Michael
Parfit wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREEDOMLAND. &LR;  By Richard Price. Island/Dell, $7.99. This novel
tracks the racial turmoil that erupts after a white woman turns up
in a New Jersey city and claims her 4-year-old son was abducted by
a black carjacker. ```Freedomland' is infinitely more than a
detective story,'' Francine Prose said here last year. ``It aspires
to the heft and weight of a 19th-century Russian classic.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORMHOLES: ESSAYS AND OCCASIONAL WRITINGS. &LR;  By John Fowles.
Owl/Holt, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This grab bag of musings by the 73-year-old English novelist
covers a lot of territory _ from autobiographical pieces to
cantankerous forays into politics and culture. ``The book is as
various, quirkily learned, beguiling, opinionated and, in parts, as
sumptuously written as Fowles' fiction,'' Roger Kimball wrote here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE IRON TRACKS. &LR;  By Aharon Appelfeld. Schocken, $12. This
Israeli novel is about a concentration camp survivor who wanders
through Austria buying sacred books and other remnants of the
Jewish culture that once flourished there while searching for the
Nazi officer who murdered his parents. ``Appelfeld's controlled
fiction compresses large themes into small spaces,'' Jonathan Rosen
said here in 1998.  &UR; BRONSTEIN'S CHILDREN &LR; , by Jurek Becker
(University of Chicago, $15), is another novel about the psychic
aftershocks of the Holocaust, in which an 18-year-old German Jew in
1973 stumbles onto his father and two other camp survivors as they
torture a former Nazi guard. ``Becker, writing simply and clearly
in an unstrained narrative, speaks with the voice of knowledge,''
Eva Figes said here in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COLLECTED POEMS OF AMY CLAMPITT. &LR;  Knopf, $19.95. Clampitt's
poetry is full of restless motion and energy as she evokes places
like the Quaker village in Iowa where she was born and Greenwich
Village, where she cultivated a resolute bohemianism. In 1997 in
the New York Times Book Review, Christopher Benfey called this
posthumously published collection a testament to an ``extraordinary
life's work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BEAUTIFUL MIND. &LR;  By Sylvia Nasar. Touchstone/Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $16. This biography of John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning
developer of game theory, follows him from his early career through
his crippling bouts of schizophrenia to his recovery years later.
The author, who writes about economics for The New York Times,
``offers a remarkable look into the arcane world of mathematics and
the tragedy of madness,'' Simon Singh wrote here in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GREEN FIRES: ASSAULT ON EDEN. A NOVEL OF THE ECUADORIAN
RAINFOREST. &LR;  By Marnie Mueller. Curbstone, $13.95. A former Peace
Corps volunteer revisits the jungles of coastal Ecuador on her
honeymoon in 1969 and becomes involved in a battle between the
native people and American oil companies. ``The characters are well
drawn, and the novel has adventure, intrigue and romance as well as
politics,'' one critic said in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HAVANA DREAMS: A STORY OF A CUBAN FAMILY. &LR;  By Wendy Gimbel.
Vintage, $13. The lives of three unhappy women _ a wealthy
bourgeoise, her daughter and the daughter's child by Fidel Castro _
provide a striking perspective on Cuba and its odd destiny. ``The
result is a shimmering book,'' Alma Guillermoprieto said here last
year.

`PHANTOM' BLASTS ON SCREEN, AND WHAT A RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Daily News Film Critic Bob Strauss attended the first
press screening   of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace''
on Friday night in New York.   The movie opens nationwide May 19.
Strauss gives the film 3 1/2 stars on a 4-star-maximum scale.) 
BY BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prequel has landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' George Lucas'
madly anticipated follow-up to his epic ``Star Wars'' movie
trilogy, was finally shown over the weekend to film critics,
exhibitors and other anointed souls who congregated in Gotham. It
hits theaters nationwide May 19.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Phantom Menace'' is pretty good. Outstanding in
many parts _ once it gets rolling.
</P>
<P>
   When you get past the setup, the rest is intoxicating.
</P>
<P>
   It's Lucas' first directing effort since the original ``Star
Wars'' film, which changed the movie dreamscape forever 22 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's got nearly 2,000 digital special effects shots. That's by
far the most ever seen in one film _ four times the number that
``Titanic'' had.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes us to dazzling new worlds teeming with outlandish
alien creatures.
</P>
<P>
   There are even some fine actors along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' strengths as a filmmaker and mythmaker have been nothing
but enhanced by the advances in computer graphics technology that
his own company, Industrial Light and Magic, has been at the
forefront of developing for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   His genius for visual grandeur and kinetic excitement has never
been realized with the photo-realistic detail seen here.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that ``Phantom Menace'' presents the most
elaborate, thoroughly integrated fantasy universe ever put on film.
</P>
<P>
   You could watch it without sound and still be enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   More enthralled in some stretches, since Lucas' main deficiency
as a writer and director _ which can be summed up as a tin ear for
dialogue and its delivery _ apparently can't be improved upon by
high-tech wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   And because the early parts of ``Phantom Menace'' are the
talkier ones, they're by nature the least satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's action from the get-go _ one short, early
monster bit is wittier and scarier than all of last year's
``Godzilla'' remake _ the film's first 45 minutes are mainly
devoted to extensive exposition and introductions. Probably not too
many ways around that, though it would have helped if the human
characters displayed more personality than the sets.
</P>
<P>
   But wait.
</P>
<P>
   Set three or so decades before the first ``Star Wars,''
``Phantom Menace'' is mainly concerned with the decay of a
democratic but ineffectual galactic republic and the origins of the
boy who will become Darth Vader, both key factors in the
forthcoming rise of the evil empire. A plot summary follows, so
stop reading now if you don't want to know that happens.
</P>
<P>
   A masterful if somewhat unorthodox Jedi knight, Qui-Gon Jinn
(Liam Neeson), and his eager young apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan
McGregor, not even trying to sound like Alec Guinness), are
dispatched to settle a dispute between the greedy, militaristic
Trade Federation and the teen-age Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman)
of the Edenlike planet Naboo.
</P>
<P>
   The monkish warriors, practitioners of the good part of that
cosmic spiritual essence called the Force, are almost immediately
attacked by the federation's skeletal, birdlike robot soldiers.
They barely escape with the deposed queen to the outlaw desert
planet of Tatooine.
</P>
<P>
   You'll recall that that's where we first encountered the hero of
the original trilogy, Luke Skywalker. This time, while hunting for
spare parts to repair their damaged spaceship, Qui-Gon encounters
9-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd, whom you may have seen
playing Arnold Schwarzenegger's kid in ``Jingle All the Way'').
Though a slave to a kind of flying cross between a blue mosquito
and a vulture named Watto, young Anakin possesses a mechanical
genius (he's already built a humorously see-through prototype
version of the fussy droid C-3PO) and an attunement to the Force
that, by Qui-Gon's reckoning, is off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   Young Anakin proves his mettle _ and kicks the movie into high
gear _ when he enters an all-or-nothing pod race that could earn
him his freedom or a ghastly early death.
</P>
<P>
   This long, grippingly intense sequence is worth the price of a
ticket alone.
</P>
<P>
   The pod racers are rickety constructs of twin jet engines
connected to small, exceedingly vulnerable driving modules. The
race itself, several laps around the rocky, barren Tatooine
landscape, is like the ``Ben Hur'' chariot sequence in anti-gravity
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   It's a senses-shattering suite of speed and sound (forget what
was said about watching in silence earlier; Ben Burtt, Lucas'
quadruple Oscar-winning sound designer, does the best work of his
career here) that elevates the movie, and the movies, to a new
level.
</P>
<P>
   From this point on, ``Phantom Menace'' crisply careens from one
awesome spectacle to another.
</P>
<P>
   There's a visit to Coruscant, a planet entirely covered by a
city. There's plenty of fancy spacecraft jockeying. A younger,
greener Yoda, still puppeted and voiced by the incomparable Frank
Oz, makes a welcome appearance. And there's the inevitable fight to
regain the Italianate ice cream castles of Naboo, which
incorporates battle elements from all the previous films and finds
ways to top most of them.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Of the key new characters, the computer-generated, comically
klutzy amphibian creature Jar Jar Binks is, as many feared,
initially annoying.
</P>
<P>
   But the floppy-eared goon grows more tolerable as the film goes
along, something which could not be said about Ewoks. And the way
he interacts so intimately with Qui-Gon, Anakin and the gang is
never short of astounding.
</P>
<P>
   As for main villain Darth Maul, the demonic practitioner of the
dark side of the Force is portrayed with great gymnastic vigor, if
not exactly deep resonance, by martial arts stunt master Ray Park.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is likely to threaten Han Solo's position at the top of
the ``Star Wars'' character canon. But it would be wrong to leave
anyone with the impression that Lucas hasn't written anything as
interesting as what he shows us here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace,'' by turns more serious and more childlike
than the earlier trilogy, truly seems to express the whole mythos
from young Anakin's point of view. This is not wrong; not only is
``Star Wars'' the ultimate boy's adventure of our era, the whole
saga is clearly now about Anakin's troubling evolution, and it is
only fitting that we start out on that path in his hopeful,
wonder-driven shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Lucas refines the scope of his mythic theme here,
moving from archetypal heroic elements to more specifically
Judeo-Christian ideas about the struggle between good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   He even lays the ground for a pretty sophisticated political
allegory _ and a sadly relevant one. Debate in the Galactic Senate
over the Naboo situation sounds presciently similar to current
discussions of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There is, then, great storytelling in ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas just expresses it better with pictures than words.
</P>
<P>
   And this movie has some of the greatest pictures ever whipped up
in cyberspace or on celluloid, which is certainly fitting for the
millennial chapter of the movie century's most popular fantasy.

ART DEALERS COMBAT RUMORS OF NAZI LINKS

(DW) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Embarrassed by persistent rumors that it collaborated
with the Nazi occupiers of wartime France, the Wildenstein family,
the powerful French-Jewish dynasty of international art dealers,
has brought a lawsuit seeking $1 million in damages against an
American writer who repeated some of these allegations in a recent
book.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which goes to trial in Paris this week, reflects the
family's eagerness to clear its name and silence its critics. But
it involves a measure of risk: since the court will judge the
veracity of postwar Allied reports that the head of the family at
the time did business with Nazi art dealers, in a sense it is the
Wildensteins, as much as the American writer, Hector Feliciano, who
will be in the dock.
</P>
<P>
   The case illustrates how new interest in the fate of looted
wartime art collections is suddenly spotlighting murky events that
took place in occupied Europe more than half a century ago. But
while most disputes revolve around efforts to recover paintings
confiscated from wealthy Jews by the Nazis, the Wildenstein case
touches on far more sensitive questions.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge lower court will hear brief statements from
lawyers for the parties on Wednesday before adjourning to study
arguments and supporting documents filed with the court. (Copies of
the main arguments were obtained from both the Wildensteins and
Feliciano.) A ruling is expected around mid-June. The verdict can
then be appealed to the Court of Appeal and to France's Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, published in France in 1995 as ``Le Musee Disparu''
and in the United States in 1997 as ``The Hidden Museum,''
Feliciano dedicates little space to Georges Wildenstein, who ran
the family company from 1910 until his death in 1963. Rather, he
focuses on the Nazi seizure, and postwar recovery, of important
French-Jewish art collections.
</P>
<P>
   But Feliciano cites documentary evidence that Georges
Wildenstein ``seems to have'' organized some deals with Germans
during the Occupation; that after the gallery owner escaped to New
York in January 1941 his longtime non-Jewish employee Roger Dequoy
was his ``secret representative'' during the Occupation, and that
Dequoy did a lot of business with Nazi dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildensteins' lawsuit _ brought by Georges' son, Daniel, 81,
his grandsons, Alec and Guy, and the New York-based Wildenstein &AMP;
Co. _ denies all the allegations in the book and accuses Feliciano
of displaying negligence and ``serious and flagrant scorn for
searching for the truth'' by associating Georges Wildenstein with
the ``war crime'' of collaborating with the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildensteins also maintain they have suffered ``considerable
commercial damage'' as a result of Feliciano's references of
Georges Wildenstein, which, they said, cast ``intolerable suspicion
over his honorability that translates directly into distrust by
clients and particularly by important Jewish American clients.''
They add that some Jewish clients have stopped visiting the
Wildenstein gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In response Feliciano's lawyer, Antoine Comte, said the writer
worked with ``moderation and professionalism'' in analyzing Allied
intelligence and Nazi and French documents of the era that fully
supported what he wrote. At the same time, Feliciano has filed a
countersuit claiming $180,000 in damages against the Wildensteins
for initiating ``an abusive action'' with intent to discredit the
author.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the judges analyze the substance of the dispute,
however, they must decide whether the lawsuit is valid. The
Wildensteins are suing under articles 1382 and 1383 of the Civil
Code, which require reparation to be paid for any kind of damage
caused by one person to another. Comte says the relevant
legislation is the 1881 Press Law, which contemplates defamation of
the dead only when the intent is to harm living heirs or relatives.
The Wildensteins have conceded that Feliciano had no such intent.
</P>
<P>
   Comte said that it was odd that the lawsuit was brought in
France since the Wildenstein company and Guy Wildenstein are
located in the United States and Daniel and Alec Wildenstein live
in Switzerland. He added that the Wildensteins probably did so in
the belief that a French court would be more sympathetic to the
family's wartime situation and less credulous of American
intelligence reports implicating Georges Wildenstein. Denying this
motive, the Wildensteins noted that Feliciano's book was published
first in France.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the outcome of the case appears to depend on the
credence given by the judges to these intelligence reports and
other documents that detail Georges Wildenstein's prewar business
dealings with Karl Habertsock, a Berlin-based Nazi art dealer, and
his wartime relationship with Dequoy, who managed the Wildensteins'
Paris gallery under his own name during the Occupation and who
worked again for Wildensteins after the war.
</P>
<P>
   These documents include a special report on the Wildenstein
company prepared for the Office of Strategic Services in 1945 that
refers to a visit by Haberstock and Dequoy to Georges Wildenstein
in Aix-en-Provence in October 1940. The report quotes Haberstock as
saying under interrogation after the war that ``Wildenstein was
very eager to do business.'' It adds, ``In Haberstock's presence,
Wildenstein gave Dequoy full authority to deal with his
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Another document, a U.S. Treasury Department report dated Jan.
29, 1942, is based on questioning of Georges Wildenstein. He said
that at first he had hoped to purchase some paintings in France
through Dequoy, ship them to America and thereby salvage some of
his French franc balances in French banks. ``However, with the
exception of 17 pictures, he was unsuccessful,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the Wildensteins' case is that these and other
documents are unreliable. They argue that, while Dequoy may have
done business with Nazis, he was acting on his own behalf and not
on instructions from Georges Wildenstein. They further charge that
Feliciano ignored ample evidence of Georges Wildenstein's
patriotism, including his work for the Resistance cause for which
he was honored after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano, who has flown to Paris to attend Wednesday's hearing,
said he was surprised to have been sued because the Wildensteins
are challenging the validity of documents that have been used by
historians and journalists for decades. ``It is strange that they
should be drawing attention to Georges Wildenstein in this way,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Daniel Wildenstein said he would not comment
on the case until the verdict was announced. But in an interview in
April 1998 Guy Wildenstein said that the family had decided to
answer its critics. ``We decided not to remain indifferent now,''
he said. ``For me, the honor of the family is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the interview the Wildensteins sued a French
weekly, VSD, for defamation. (A judgment in that case is expected
on May 25.) A few weeks later they took Feliciano to court.

 Hilma Wolitzer's novels include ``Tunnel of Love'' and
``Silver.''  
 By HILMA WOLITZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How do you decide when to stop looking at something?'' This is
the riddle that haunts the protagonist of ``Crocodile Tears,'' the
fine opening story of A.S. Byatt's kaleidoscopic new collection.
Patricia Nimmo is suddenly widowed after a petty argument with her
husband, Tony, at one of the small London art galleries they
frequent. She flees this tragic event like a criminal, traveling
aimlessly through France until she finally settles, almost
randomly, in Nimes.
</P>
<P>
   There she continues her zealous habit of observation, noting
everything from the ``small silver square of fish crisscrossed with
golden lines'' that she eats for dinner to the abstract geometry of
the local architecture. Even her self-assigned project _ to read
Proust, in French _ is ``like a jigsaw seen through thick, uneven
glassware, the colors and shapes hopelessly distorted.''
</P>
<P>
   But tender thoughts of Tony, whom she first met in student
theater (``He had called her Patra, and she had called him
Antony''), pierce Patricia's willed concentration on the visual
world, and she begins to grieve in public places. Another fugitive,
a remote Norwegian named Nils Isaksen, witnesses her misery and
cautiously offers his assistance, which she refuses at first with
corresponding British reserve. But Nils persists, driven by his own
secret sorrow and guilt to help her assuage hers.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia's solace begins with a dream of Tony, warmly alive
beside her. She feels ``dreadfully happy,'' an oxymoronic phrase
that perfectly captures the opposing yet twinned experiences of
memory and loss. Gradually, through conversations about history and
mythology, she and Nils allow each other access to their private
histories and their emotions, and he accompanies her back to London
to face the reality of what she sought so desperately to escape. In
a lovely, understated denouement, they begin their slow, mutual
progression toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Byatt, whose elegant literary mystery, ``Possession,'' won
the Booker Prize in 1990, always has been concerned with the ways
in which art and literature inform and transform our lives. In ``A
Lamia in the Cevennes,'' a painter named Bernard Lycett-Kean leaves
Thatcher's Britain for a house in Southern France. He installs a
swimming pool, has it filled with river water and spends his days
contentedly swimming and battling problems of color and line.
</P>
<P>
   One day what appears at first to be a black water snake swims
past him. Soon he realizes that the creature is brilliantly
patterned and has lustrous human eyes. It announces itself as a
lamia, an enchanted spirit that requires a mere kiss from him to
turn into a beautiful woman. If he doesn't comply, the lamia hints,
there will be Faustian consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But Bernard, who likes snakes more than women, demurs. All he
wants is for this hybrid being to remain in his pool in its current
state, so he can solve the problems of its colors. It's a standoff,
as the lamia pleads for the chance to gain an immortal soul, and
Bernard opts for a few more days of painting. But their conflict is
finally, wittily resolved, and Bernard is able to return to his
studies, ``one of the ways in which human beings are happy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Byatt demonstrated in her previous collection, ``A Djinn
in the Nightingale's Eye,'' the fairy tale is the ideal form for
her gifts. ``Cold,'' the story of a beautiful princess, descended
from an icewoman and seemingly doomed by her metabolism, is steeped
in imagery and sensation. Fiammarosa, like all fairy tale
princesses, is offered in marriage to whoever best meets the
challenge set by her father, although she will make the final
choice herself.
</P>
<P>
   The passionate but cold-blooded Fiammarosa's needs demand
exceptional invention and perseverance on the part of her legion of
suitors. They all send emissaries to woo her with lavish gifts,
while at home her brilliant, lovesick tutor plots his own
courtship.
</P>
<P>
   When her hand is finally won by Sasan, a master glass blower and
the ruler of a desert nation, she returns his ardor, but languishes
in the sultry climate of his kingdom. After visiting her new
husband at his work, she almost succumbs to the fiery heat. ``She
was melting, she thought in confusion, as she fell, slowly, slowly,
bending and crumpling in the blast, becoming hot and liquid, a
white scrap, moaning in a sea of red blood, lit by flames.'' How
Sasan saves her is a testament to both the heroism of love and the
power of art.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter stories in ``Elementals'' offer their own, smaller
pleasures. ``Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'' is a charming
parable about the glory inherent in every kind of work. As an
artist explains to a young cook dissatisfied with her lot in life,
``the divide is not between the servants and the served, between
the leisured and the workers, but between those who are interested
in the world and its multiplicity of forms and forces, and those
who merely subsist.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Jael,'' a woman who has ``the opposite of Alzheimer's'' _
the ability to remember things she's not sure ever happened _
reflects back on her girlhood and makes amusingly irreverent
connections between her early studies of the Scriptures and the
television commercials she now creates. When blood turns into fruit
juice, the miracle is merely technological, not divine.
</P>
<P>
   The only disappointment in the collection is the brief
``Baglady,'' about the metamorphosis of a gentlewoman in a
supermall, which seems merely clever and doesn't develop beyond its
original concept. But the longer stories, fired by a fierce
intelligence and related in shimmering prose, evolve from idea to
execution in unexpected and thrillingly persuasive leaps. This
eclectic little volume should delight A.S. Byatt's devoted readers
and attract many new ones.

STRIKE ON CHINESE EMBASSY MUST NOT DETER NATO, BLAIR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair, the most outspoken of the
allied leaders in championing NATO since the start of the war over
Kosovo, said Sunday that the attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade should not and would not deter the alliance from
intensifying its bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Conscious of the effect such episodes are having on British
public opinion, he wrote a front page article in the mass tabloid
Sunday Mirror saying: ``NATO will prevail. The butchers of Belgrade
will be defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Britons who believe that NATO should suspend the bombing ``could
not be more wrong,'' Blair said, adding that ``it would send
exactly the wrong message'' to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In the personal and evocative language that has characterized
his repeated calls to arms, Blair gave a graphic account of his
visit last week to refugee camps in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth remembering these people when you hear stories
about incidents like the mistaken attack on the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade,'' he wrote. ``No matter how many times you see these
scenes on TV, nothing prepares you for the stench, the
all-pervading air of fear or the awful stories that pour out. They
come from women who have been raped. From old men who have seen
their daughters violated. From children who have seen their fathers
dragged away and shot. From sisters who've lost brothers, and
brothers who have lost sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   British newspapers and television had shown Blair moving in
shirtsleeves through the Stenkovec camp and the Blace border post,
and his wife, Cherie, was photographed weeping at the sight of the
hordes of displaced people. Blair told readers that every person to
whom he spoke urged NATO to stick to its bombing. Blair, who
addressed the Romanian Parliament in Bucharest on his trip to the
Balkans last week, will take his message this week to Albania and
Bulgaria, where meetings are planned with refugees as well as heads
of state. In his stepped-up campaign to bolster support, he
exhorted people to rally around NATO in an op-ed article in
Friday's Times of London, and he will do so in other British papers
this week.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Blair has cast the war in terms meant to
resonate with Europeans, noting that the scenes of people being
forced from their homes and packed onto cattle trains bear awful
similarities to those of 50 years ago. ``It is time for my
generation to reflect on the fight of our parents' generation
against Hitler's evil regime,'' he said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Blair's voice has been the most insistent in Europe,
there is also some resentment of Britain in the rest of Europe
because of Britain's reluctance to take in the refugees whose
plight Blair cites so passionately. Only 330 Kosovo refugees have
arrived in the United Kingdom while nearly 10,000 have been
airlifted to Germany, more than 6,000 to Turkey and 2,600 to
Norway.
</P>
<P>
   At the commemoration of NATO's 50th anniversary in Washington
last month, Blair broadened his audience to embrace Americans. He
was the most visible of the assembled national leaders, arriving a
day ahead of time to see President Clinton, lobbying congressmen,
traveling to Chicago and appearing on television news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators in Britain saw the prime minister providing
spine-stiffening leadership to a president weakened by scandal,
shoring him up the way Margaret Thatcher counseled President Bush
over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that Blair is anxious about White House
perseverance in the face of public and congressional opposition,
and worried that the United States will accept a diplomatic
settlement too generous to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Blair chose an American network, CNN, to state his
position that the Yugoslav leader was a war criminal and not
someone with whom NATO ought to be thinking about negotiating. ``I
will not be sitting down and dealing with Milosevic,'' he said. ``I
don't think anyone is in a position to be dealing with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment contrasted with remarks by Clinton in Germany a day
earlier, outlining the possibility of a settlement that would leave
Milosevic in power and stressing that removal of the dictator was
not a stated policy goal. Blair said bluntly, ``The corrupt
dictatorship of Milosevic must be cast out.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has formally ruled out the introduction of ground
troops, Blair is known to feel that they will be needed in whatever
mopping up actions in Kosovo follow the end of the bombing. This
scenario, in which the troops would enter without formal permission
and little chance of major resistance, is being called a
``semi-permissive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   There is far less opposition to the use of ground troops in
Britain and elsewhere in Europe than there is in the United States,
and Blair is understood to have no clear idea of whether the
Europeans can count on the Americans to commit significant numbers
of soldiers if they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports of British unease at possible American
vacillation, a spokesman for 10 Downing Street said, ``The prime
minister has no question about the president's resolve. At the
summit and since then, we have watched everything the president has
said, and we have not seen his resolve waver, and we didn't expect
it to.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman also disputed reports of British unhappiness over
the sudden switch to the diplomatic track in Bonn, Germany, last
week, when foreign ministers of eight nations, including Russia,
settled on a proposal aimed at ending the war and guaranteeing the
safe return of the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the proposal included all the threshold points that
NATO requires as a condition for ending the bombing, he said, ``We
welcomed the effort the president and the Russians and the others
have made.''

IN BELGRADE, EMBASSY ATTACK IS FOLLOWED BY DEFIANCE TOWARD NATO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Chinese demonstrators protesting the
bombing of their embassy here held up a banner in the main square
of the capital Sunday, where a crowd was gathered for the daily
rock concert: ``America the loser, Yugoslavia the winner,'' it
read.
</P>
<P>
   That summed up the defiant mood here in Belgrade. Although the
bombing of the embassy on Friday night has shocked Serbs and
Chinese alike, dashed burgeoning hopes of peace, and fed the fear
of living under the threat of airstrikes, it has also convinced
many residents that they are being deliberately targeted by NATO,
and hardened their determination to resist.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of conversations over the weekend, virtually every
Belgrader interviewed seemed convinced that the United States had
intended to hit the Chinese Embassy. They gave various reasons:
NATO's alleged intention to spark a greater crisis by dragging in
China, an attempt by the United States to show its superiority as
the world's only superpower, or as part of a cynical campaign to
hit more and more civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you believe that with all their sophisticated weapons,
they can miss?'' said a pensioner, Vlade Smiljanic, who was
examining bomb damage to government buildings on a main Belgrade
street across the Sava River from the New Belgrade district where
the Chinese Embassy is located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they not bomb the American, German, French and
Canadian Embassies along here?'' shouted his companion, Djordje.
``Just you see, they will hit the Russian embassy next and spark a
third world war.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, in a bookshop cafe where intellectuals gather, the
views were the same. ``It was a provocation by the United States,''
said Zoran Arsic, a computer systems manager who was drinking a
morning coffee with a friend. ``They did it on purpose to show the
whole world that they are the only remaining superpower. To say to
us: `How can such a small power do anything, when the U.S. can do
this to China,'''
</P>
<P>
   Arsic said he was sure that the latest bombing, the heaviest
Belgrade has experienced, signaled NATO's new determination to hit
at the civilian population. ``Now they are going to bomb by day to
scare the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombing has rattled many people, who are showing the
stress of nearly six weeks of on-and-off bombing. They say it was a
sign that anything is a target. Saturday night was quiet in the
capital, but NATO planes continued their bombing around the
country. People in the city are bracing for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has completely changed our views,'' said Smiljanic.
``Things are worse now. I am more calm but my wife has
psychological problems with all the sirens going off again and
again. I never go to the bunker, because I am so old it does not
matter, but these young girls should go,'' he said gesturing to a
9-year-old girl on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have water in their ears,'' he said of NATO. ``They are
disoriented. They don't know what to hit next.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Serbian reasoning defies logic. The people can be
simultaneously nervous and supremely indifferent, even fatalistic.
They are often scared, but few bother to go down to the bunkers at
night and almost no one reacts when air raid sirens sound during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Vladan Markovic, a 24-year-old mechanical engineering student,
was in his apartment just behind the Chinese Embassy compound when
the missiles hit on Friday. ``I never felt it that way before,'' he
said. ``My knees began to shake. I went to the cellar first, but
what should I do there? It is only the old people there.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbian interpretations of NATO's aims and intentions in
this war are wayward, or warped by propaganda and old Communist
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing people into submission is always senseless, they say,
but particularly senseless when it comes to Serbs, because they
will resist even harder. ``It is the wrong politics of the West,''
Arsic said. ``They do not know our thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But his friend, Misa Popovic, who was drinking coffee with him,
countered: ``They are very clever. They know how Serbs will resist,
because they know we will not be conquered.'' His reasoning was
that the Serbs would fight to the end, and so be destroyed by the
West or reduced to slaves, which, he argued, is what the West has
wanted all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they have shown what their real goal is,'' Arsic added.
``They do not want to allow Yugoslavia to live under its own
authority, and they do not want to see Yugoslavia as a partner in
business or politics.''

 &HT;    As mixed signals continue, JonBenet Ramsey murder investigation
may be winding down
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For eight months, a public hungry for justice in the
JonBenet Ramsey case has held its collective ear to the closed door
of a grand jury room.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, the slightest sign of an impending decision set
off a flurry of rumor and media attention.
</P>
<P>
   Still, eight months is an uncommonly long time for a grand jury
to work, say legal experts, and these days the buzz is growing that
the proceedings are winding down. The pool of reporters that hover
in the court hallways has doubled to a dozen. And for the past two
weeks the grand jury of eight women and four men has gone from
meeting twice a week to once, according to the media closely
watching the scene in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But, with no official word coming down, mixed signals persist.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, the judge overseeing the Ramsey grand jury
struck down a request for television cameras in the courtroom.
Boulder District Court Judge Roxanne Bailin said in her ruling that
``there is no current indication that an indictment of anyone is
imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   The request pertained to only a first court appearance, bond
hearing and filing of charges following any indictment. It did not
address cameras at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the grand jury, which would have concluded its term in
late April, has received an extension of up to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Conjecture that the grand jury was nearly done heated up in
March when Denver 's Rocky Mountain News, quoting the jury
commissioner, reported that five people serving as alternates had
been discharged.
</P>
<P>
   In April, rumors were fueled by an unconfirmed Fox News report
that the Ramseys were making arrangements for ``a plan of
cooperation'' with prosecutors, should one or both parents be
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Bob Grant, a district attorney from a neighboring
county who had lent a prosecutor to the grand jury, has said he has
reason to believe he'll be getting his employee back soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to getting my prosecutor back by the
middle or end of May,'' said the Adams County district attorney.
But he tossed in some words of caution, saying, ``That estimation
doesn't have a whole lot of reality-base to it.''
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet's body was found Dec. 26, 1996, in the basement of the
family's home in Boulder. About seven hours earlier, her mother
Patsy Ramsey had reported to police in a 5:52 a.m. phone call that
she had found a ransom note demanding $118,000 for the girl's safe
return.
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy Ramsey have been a focus of the investigation,
but they have maintained their innocence. They currently live in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the scuttlebutt, the evidence and testimony
presented to the grand jury has pretty much remained a secret over
the past eight months. The secrecy marks a change in a murder
mystery that for many months had been riddled with media leaks that
detailed trouble with the investigation and dissent between cops
and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Hunter, the district attorney handling the case, has
repeatedly declined comment on the closed-door grand jury probe
into the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   When the grand jury does announce its decision, it has three
likely scenarios to chose from, said Grant:
</P>
<P>
   _ They could recommend an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   _ They could decide they do not have sufficient evidence to
recommend an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   _ They could decide not to even deliberate for lack of evidence.
That could include calling for more investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it indicts anyone, the grand jury could also
issue a report on the investigation, though anyone named in the
report has the right to see it and add their own comments before
its released. The judge and the prosecutor must agree that the
report will not compromise any ongoing investigation. A grand
jury's recommendation for an indictment must also be signed by the
judge and prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The elevation of what commonly would be considered a local
murder story into an international news event has fascinated people
for over two years. Whether the grand jury indicts someone or not,
it will hardly mark the end of the story, said media expert Alan
Caruba.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, the dimensions of the story are far in excess of
its real news value,'' said Caruba, a former editor of a directory
of media contacts and writer whose work has appeared in the New
York Times. ``It's become symbolic of all child murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the grand jury chose to indict someone, especially one or
both of the parents, the story would create a media frenzy equal to
the O.J. Simpson trial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if no indictment comes down, interest will continue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it passes into the annals of the classic unsolved
mysteries,'' he said. ``And it goes on forever.''

RESEARCH: IDEAS ARE EVERYWHERE, IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO DIG

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Irish singer Christy Moore clips out ``Don't Forget Your
Shovel,'' a song I like not only for its tripping rhythm and sly
social commentary but for its advice to the diggers of the world, a
group to which I belong.
</P>
<P>
   A whole set of metaphoric shovels is part of my tool collection,
and for me the research that underlies the writing is the best part
of the scribbling game. Years ago, alder scratched, tired, hungry,
and on a late return from a fishing trip, I was driving through
Maine when a hubbub on the sidewalk caught my eye: milling
customers at a yard sale. I stop for yard sales.
</P>
<P>
   Pay dirt. I found the wonderful second edition unabridged
Webster's New International Dictionary with its rich definitions
and hundreds of fine small illustrations. On a collapsing card
table nearby sat Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and
Antiquities, The Oxford Companion to English Literature and other
weighty reference works, discards from a local library and the best
catch of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   I am an inveterate buyer of useful books on all possible
subjects. Collectors pass up ex-libris books, but I need reading
copies. Because I often fold down page corners and scribble in
margins, it is best to keep me away from first editions.
</P>
<P>
   On the jumbly shelves in my house I can find directions for
replacing a broken pipe stem, a history of corncribs, a booklet of
Spam recipes, a 1925 copy of ``Animal Heroes of the Great War''
(mostly dogs but some camels); dictionaries of slang, dialect and
regional English; a pile of Little Blue Books (none are blue) from
the 1920s featuring titles like ``How to Be a Gate-Crasher'' and
``Character Reading From the Face.'' One of these, ``Curiosities of
Language,'' treats us to the tortured orthography our grandparents
thought hilarious:
</P>
<P>
   There was a young man, a Colonel,
</P>
<P>
   Who walked in the breezes volonel;
</P>
<P>
   He strolled in the aisles,
</P>
<P>
   Of the wooded maisles,
</P>
<P>
   And, returning, read in his -jolonel.
</P>
<P>
   This digging involves more than books. I need to know which
mushrooms smell like maraschino cherries and which like dead rats,
to note that a magpie in flight briefly resembles a wooden spoon,
to recognize vertically trapped suppressed lee-wave clouds; so much
of this research is concerned with four-dimensional observation and
notation. These jottings go into cheap paper-covered notebooks that
I keep in a desultory fashion, more often onto the backs of
envelopes and the margins of newspapers, from there onto the floor
of the truck or onto the stair landing atop a stack of faxes and
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The need to know has taken me from coal mines to fire towers, to
hillsides studded with agate, to a beached whale skeleton, to the
sunny side of an iceberg, to museums of canoes and of windmills, to
death masks with eyelashes stuck in the plaster, to shipyards and
log yards, old military forts, wildfires and graffiti'd rocks, to
rough water and rusty shipwrecks, to petroglyphs and prospectors'
diggings, to collapsed cotton gins, down into the caldera of an
extinct volcano and, once or thrice in the middle distance, in view
of a snouty twister.
</P>
<P>
   I listen attentively in bars and cafes, while standing in line
at the checkout counter, noting particular pronunciations and the
rhythms of regional speech, vivid turns of speech and the duller
talk of everyday life. In Melbourne I paid money into the hand of a
sidewalk poetry reciter to hear ``The Spell of the Yukon,'' in
London listened to a cabby's story of his psychopath brother in
Paris, on a trans-Pacific flight heard from a New Zealand engineer
the peculiarities of building a pipeline across New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   The grand digging grounds are still the secondhand bookshops.
Every trip ends with boxes of books shipped back, dusty old manuals
on the hide business or directions for the dances of Texas with
footprints and dotted lines reeling across the pages. But
bookstores are changing. Recently I rattled the latch of a favorite
in Denver before I saw the sign announcing that it was forever
closed, but the inventory could be ``accessed'' on the Internet.
Another dealer, a specialist in local histories, operated from his
living room for years and put out an interesting catalog from time
to time. Both the catalog and a visit to his bookshelves are things
of the past, rendered obsolete by chilly cyber-lists.
</P>
<P>
   I rarely use the Internet for research, as I find the process
cumbersome and detestable. The information gained is often
untrustworthy and couched in execrable prose. It is unpleasant to
sit in front of a twitching screen suffering assault by virus,
power outage, sluggish searches, system crashes, the lack of direct
human discourse, all in an atmosphere of scam and hustle.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do I do much library research these days, though once I
haunted the stacks. Libraries have changed. They are no longer
quiet but rather noisy places where people gather to exchange
murder mysteries. In bad weather homeless folk exuding pungent
odors doze at the reading tables. One stands in line to use
computers, not a few down for the count, most with smeared and
filthy screens, running on creaky software.
</P>
<P>
   I mourn the loss of the old card catalogs, not because I'm a
Luddite, but because the oaken trays of yesteryear offered the
researcher an element of random utility and felicitous surprise
through encounters with adjacent cards: information by chance that
is different in kind from the computer's ramified but rigid order.
</P>
<P>
   This country swims in fascinating pamphlets. In a New Mexico
greasy spoon I pick up a flyer that takes St. Paul sharply to task
on the subjects of hair style, clothing and women. (``Shorts,
miniskirts, halters, bikinis, etc., are all OK. You don't have to
listen to Paul. . . . God wants women to look nice and be in style
with the times. As far as men, Jesus had long hair. Paul must have
been a religious fanatic.'') A hundred miles later I read a narrow
sheet with advice on how to behave in the presence of a mountain
lion. (``Do not make direct eye contact. . . . Try to appear as big
as possible.'')
</P>
<P>
   Food and regional dishes are important research subjects. Some
you can order in restaurants, but others exist only in out-of-print
cookbooks and must be prepared at home, like a duck roasted inside
a watermelon, a dish called Angel in a Cradle, or another called
the Atlanta Special, which sounds like a train, although the
ingredient list begins, ``1 beaver (8 to 10 pounds.)''
nn
</P>
<P>
   I like to drive the West, making a slow drift over caliche and
gravel roads, volume cranked up and listening to music (this, too,
is research), usually regional subtexts of alternative genres. But
two that I never tire of hearing are Glenn Ohrlin singing
``Barnacle Bill, the Sailor,'' in his two-tone voice, and the good
ol' boy Texas country-and-western yodeler Don Walser with the
Kronos String Quartet, sliding a heartaching ``Rose Marie''
straight at me.
</P>
<P>
   The truck wanders around intersecting roads as tangled as
fishing line. At times topographic maps, compass bearings or
keeping the sun at my shoulder are better direction guides than
signs, usually nonexistent or bullet-blasted into unreadability.
The rules of road drift are simple: Always take a branching side
route, stop often, get out and listen, walk around, see what you
see. What you see are signs, not direction signs but the others,
the personal messages. We live in a world of signs.
</P>
<P>
   I am amazed when people mourn the loss of the Burma Shave
jingles. Better stuff is all around us, in public restrooms, in
phone booths, on rocks, stapled to telephone poles, struck on
lawns. I remember a large billboard that stood for many years on a
back-country road in Colorado. The community used it as a kind of
enormous greeting card, welcoming home a son on leave from the
Navy, congratulating a child on her fifth birthday, inviting
neighbors to a party.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of urban panhandlers seem to indicate that many of
them took creative-writing courses. These messages are always
printed in neat capital letters: ``WILL KILL FOR FOOD,'' ``BIG DUMB
UGLY BUM NEEDS YOUR HELP,'' ``MY MOTHER LOVED ME BUT NOW SHE'S
GONE.''
</P>
<P>
   The digging is never done because the shovel scrapes at life
itself. It is not possible to get it all, or even very much of it,
but I gather what I can of the rough, tumbling crowd, the lone
walkers and the voluble talkers, the high lonesome signers, the
messages people write and leave for me to read.

CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS SHIFT FOCUS TO FINANCIAL ARENA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Ill., Md.)   (jw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign of the ways that both Congress and the
leading civil rights groups have changed over the years, some of
the biggest civil rights battles now are not about affirmative
action plans or school choice, but about access to bankruptcy
protection and bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in the advocacy groups' agenda from social inequities
to economic opportunities has become apparent recently as two
landmark bills, overhauling both the nation's banking system and
its bankruptcy courts, move swiftly through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed a bill by a
veto-proof margin that would make it much harder for American
families, particularly women and the elderly, to have their debts
erased through bankruptcy proceedings. A day later, the Senate
adopted a sweeping overhaul of the nation's financial system
sponsored by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, that would also eliminate
many of the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act, a 1977
law that requires banks to make loans to residents of inner cities,
farmers and others who have traditionally been denied credit.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in the agenda of the civil rights groups reflects the
political realities of a highly partisan Congress that wants to
roll back many of the legislative gains won by liberals a
generation ago, and of civil rights groups that now see they have
nothing to gain by pushing old and unpopular issues like
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country today has largely moved beyond the most blatant
aspects of racial discrimination, which was the driving force for
so many years of the movement,'' said Wade Henderson, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, an umbrella
group of the nation's most prominent civil rights organizations.
``Every economic disadvantage suffered by the under-served in our
society is reflected in the bankruptcy debate and the Community
Reinvestment Act debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups, which have suffered from dwindling public
support and significant court setbacks in the affirmative-action
fight, stormed Capitol Hill last week hoping to remove provisions
from both bills that would repeal the advances the groups had made
more than 20 years ago. The groups that actively lobbied against
the measures included a variety of organizations representing the
interests of minorities, women, American Indians, the elderly,
urban areas and farmers. And liberal Democrats in both chambers
said that the votes on the two measures could be the only major
civil rights votes in the 106th congressional term. But so far both
the House and Senate have rebuffed the recommendations of the civil
rights groups and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and other
aides, Clinton has threatened to veto both measures if they are not
changed later in the session when members from both Houses meet in
conference committees.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said in an interview last Friday that he had not heard a
single complaint from bankers about the costs of the Community
Reinvestment Act, and that the civil rights groups were right to
make the legislation a central focus of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Martin Luther King, I think, who said that the
unfinished business of this country was extending economic
opportunity,'' Rubin said. ``If what the civil rights community is
doing is fashioning itself around this issue, I think it's a
sensible view.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats say that they fear that the Republicans have found
an ideal ``wedge issue'' for the modern age _ embarking on what
could be a successful political strategy of forcing the president
to choose between the powerful and politically generous banking
industry, which has spent years pushing for the adoption of both
bills, and civil rights leaders who oppose them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gramm could well provoke the administration to have to choose
between the civil rights community and the financial
institutions,'' said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who fought
unsuccessfully to eliminate the provisions of the banking
legislation that would repeal major portions of the Community
Reinvestment Act. ``It has the potential to be a wedge issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Before last fall, the Community Reinvestment Act had never been
an important issue in the perennial debate over whether to
deregulate the banking system by eliminating the restrictions
imposed in the Great Depression that limited the ability of banks,
insurance companies and securities firms. The law has actually
proved highly profitable for many banks and savings associations,
encouraging them to lend in areas that had often been ``red-lined''
and neglected. Some experts have estimated that the law has helped
to direct more than $6 billion annually to distressed communities.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's proposal would exempt some 4,000 smaller banks and
savings associations from the act. He would also make it more
difficult for community groups to challenge the lending records of
financial institutions. Gramm has said that the legislation has
proved to be too onerous for financial institutions and has been
used by some community groups ``to extort'' settlements from banks
who need strong lending records to the disadvantaged in order to
get regulatory permission to expand.
</P>
<P>
   The rigid harshness of the new bankruptcy legislation became
apparent when it was denounced by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who
sought unsuccessfully to soften it by giving more discretion to
bankruptcy judges to set the legitimate expenses of debtors.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation takes away most of the discretion of judges by
forcing them to rely on a schedule of allowable expenses written by
the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   During debate on the measure, Hyde pleaded with his colleagues
to ``give some wiggle room so that humanity can play out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not throw a little small bone to the debtor?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has lost
his once considerable influence among House Republicans as a result
of his handling of the impeachment proceedings. In a scene that was
unimaginable before the impeachment proceedings, Hyde was
challenged by Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who urged the
chamber to reject the Hyde provision and impose ``legislative
discipline'' by leaving bankruptcy judges with no discretion to
consider the individual circumstances of each case that came before
them.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who received the support of only 25 of his fellow
Republicans, was ultimately defeated by a vote of 238 to 184.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Lucas told reporters in New York on Sunday
that he's not one of the many who expect ``Star Wars: Episode I _
The Phantom Menace,'' his universally anticipated prequel to the
most popular movie series of all time, to be the biggest box office
hit in history.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he doesn't care whether it is or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The billion dollars or so that people are saying the film will
make, I'm dubious about,'' said Lucas, who hasn't directed a
feature film since the first ``Star Wars'' 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That 1977 classic currently stands as the second-highest
grossing feature ever at a figure of $461 &UR;  &LR; million, including
reissues.
</P>
<P>
   James Cameron's ``Titanic'' is the leader in North American box
office take at more than $600 &UR;  &LR; million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where that `Let's beat Titanic' stuff came
from,'' Lucas added. ``Anybody who knows the film business knows
that the chances of this film beating the original (Star Wars) are
slim to none. I don't even think it'll really beat `E.T.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   (``E.T.'' led the all-time box office rankings from 1982 until
1997, when the ``Star Wars Special Edition'' was reissued.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I expect it to be one of the top 10 grossers of all
time,'' Lucas said of ``Phantom Menace,'' ``and if it wasn't, I
would probably be very disappointed. But it's not the end of the
world, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Though certainly the most personally successful of filmmakers _
Lucas owns all rights to ``Star Wars'' sequels and merchandising _
he disdains both the industry's and the media's focus on films'
financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a contest,'' he said. ``We're living in this sort
of adversarial society where somebody has to be a winner and
everyone else has to be losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movie,'' he said. ``I made it because I enjoy making
the movies. I hope it does well. I really don't have any interest
or desire to be No. &UR;  &LR; 1 or win an Academy Award or count how many
good reviews I get as opposed to how many bad reviews I get. That's
not what it's really about. It's about the process of making the
movie.'' &QL;

EAGER FOR APPROVAL, ROMANIA BASKS IN POPE'S VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania _ As Pope John Paul II prayed at an open-air
Orthodox Sunday Mass at the side of Patriarch Teoctist, Cristian
Andrei, 40, examined the historic moment from Mammon's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe this could attract new investors,'' Andrei, a
Romanian executive at an American venture capital fund, said as he
sipped coffee at an outdoor McDonald's with his wife and twin
13-year-old boys. ``Romania needs good publicity and profits, and
the visit can do that. It shows that the West can trust Romania.
It's a safe place in the Balkans for the pope to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II's three-day visit in Bucharest, which ended Sunday,
is the first papal trip to a predominantly Orthodox country in more
than 1,000 years, a bold mission to mend the breach between the
Eastern and Western branches of Christianity. But for many
Romanians, the visit was more than an ecumenical milestone. It was
also an opportunity to bask in rare international attention and
make a case to the West that Romania belongs in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war in Kosovo began, the Romanian government has made
the point repeatedly, opening its airspace to NATO forces and
complying with an oil embargo against Yugoslavia. But it is an
uneasy position for a former communist country that shares a border
and the Orthodox faith with Serbia, and has simmering ethnic
tensions of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The beaming presence of John Paul II, who drew more than 100,000
people to the Orthodox service in Union Square and twice as many to
a reciprocal Roman Catholic Mass attended by the patriarch Sunday
afternoon, charmed even wary Orthodox nationalists. Romanians of
all faiths seemed to view the visit as a reward for less pleasant
services rendered to the Western alliance that Romania hopes one
day to join, having been bitterly disappointed that it did not make
the first cut for post-communist countries, when the Czechs, Poles
and Hungarians were admitted to NATO in March.
</P>
<P>
   President Emil Constantinescu, a geologist who was elected in
1996 with a mandate to jump-start Romania's shaky transition to
democratic capitalism, suggested as much in his greeting to the
pope on Friday. He described the visit as among other things ``a
sign of your gratitude for the wisdom and balance that Romania has
demonstrated during the difficult and troubled years of this close
of a century.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanians were deeply disappointed that recent bids to begin
negotiations to join NATO and the European Union were rejected.
Since the war began, though, Western leaders have suggested that
Romania merits a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Bucharest on May 4,
and described Romania as an ``exemplary partner and future ally''
of NATO. He said he wanted Romania to be put on a fast track for
NATO membership, and also pledged to support Romania's negotiations
to join the European Union. The Romanian government has asked the
International Monetary Fund to increase its loans, a request that
seems likely to get approved.
</P>
<P>
   Bucharest is keeping a sharp eye on how much the war, which has
devastated trade and halted transportation through the Danube
River, is costing its troubled economy. Zoe Petre, a
foreign-affairs adviser to Constantinescu, said government
economists had calculated that Romania is losing $500,000 a week
because of the bombing. She had her eye on postwar opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not so much whether the West will pay us back,'' she
said. ``There are other ways that are more interesting, such as
insuring that Romania is really involved in rebuilding the
economies of the Balkans.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Economic considerations are paramount to Romania right now,
where high taxes, crippling bureaucracy and low wages (less than
$100 a month on average) have made Romania's conversion to
capitalism slower than the conversions of neighbors like Bulgaria
or Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   The government has recently sought to speed up the privatization
process, but there is considerable skepticism about how deep such
reforms really go in a country long stifled by the communist
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, which was overthrown in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to invite the pope than to restructure the
economy,'' Stelian Tanase, a political science professor at
Bucharest University, said. But he too focused on the advantages to
be found in wartime. ``NATO needs our support and we need their
money,'' he said. ``Ordinary people are against the bombing, but
that is actually not very smart. I may sound cynical, but if we
want to be admitted to NATO and the EU, what we really need is a
very long war.''
</P>
<P>
   But public opinion polls show that a strong majority of
Romanians vehemently opposes the NATO bombing. ``I think it is
terrible,'' Daniel Voinea, a 21-year-old art student who works in a
bookstore, said. ``Innocent people are being killed by those bombs.
We watch it on television, and we know how close this war is to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed a fear that is widely shared in Romania, where
there are tensions with ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania.
``Transylvania is not Kosovo,'' he said, ``it's not exactly the
same, but what is happening there could someday spark something
similar here.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, while in Romania, criticized the NATO bombings, but
Romanians nevertheless see him as a voice of the West. In Clejani,
a small village about 25 miles outside Bucharest, a group of 300
Serbs and Romanian leftists protested the pope's visit during a
commemorative Orthodox Church service for Serb victims of the NATO
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the three-day visit, such demonstrations were
rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope has now seen that we are all Christians together,''
said a 70-year-old retired civil servant. ``And we Romanians see
that our country has the approval of the Western world, including
an important international organization like the Vatican.''

PAKISTAN ACTS AGAINST CRITIC IN CRACKDOWN ON JOURNALISTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A prominent Pakistani journalist who has been
harshly critical of the government has been detained by Pakistani
authorities and is being held at an unknown location. His wife said
Sunday that the police dragged him from his bedroom, shoeless and
without his eyeglasses, early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Najam Sethi, is one of several who have been
arrested, interrogated and harassed in Pakistan over the past week.
Pakistani journalists and the Committee to Protect Journalists,
based in New York, say the government is apparently retaliating
against editors and writers who have given interviews to BBC
reporters investigating high-level corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials did not return calls Sunday, but the
official Pakistani news agency quoted an unnamed government
spokesman on Saturday as saying that Sethi was being interrogated
by agents of Pakistan's intelligence service for alleged links to
India's intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the government's suspicions were aroused when
Sethi, editor of The Friday Times, an English-language weekly based
in Lahore, gave a speech in India that was darkly pessimistic about
Pakistan's future. He spoke at the India International Center in
New Delhi on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   The top Pakistani envoy in New Delhi, Ashraf Qazi, was a guest
at the event, which was sponsored by the India-Pakistan Friendship
Society. Qazi filed a report to Islamabad describing Sethi's
remarks as an act of ``the most contemptible treachery,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Qazi did not return calls to his residence here Sunday. I.K.
Gujral, a former prime minister of India who heads the Friendship
Society, said Qazi rebutted Sethi's remarks at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that they should make such silly accusations
against Sethi,'' Gujral said. ``He is a respected intellectual.''
</P>
<P>
   Sethi's wife, Jugnu Mohsin, publisher of The Friday Times, said
she and her husband had been threatened even before he gave the
speech. Saifur Rehman, appointed by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as
the nation's chief investigator of corruption, phoned her to accuse
her husband of conspiring with the BBC to destabilize the
government, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehman could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The speech her husband gave in New Delhi had been printed months
earlier in The Friday Times, without incident, and was delivered to
a standing ovation at the National Defense College in Pakistan, she
said. ``They are accusing him of somehow being a traitor by voicing
the truth in enemy territory _ India,'' she said. ``This is a
spurious charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mohsin said the arrest of her husband occurred at 2:30 a.m.
Saturday, when about 10 police officers _ two of them uniformed
Punjab state police officials _ barged into their bedroom, clubbed
Sethi on the head with wooden rods, smashed their bedside phone
with a rifle butt and held a gun to her head.
</P>
<P>
   When she demanded a warrant, she said an officer retorted: ``You
want a warrant? Let us give you his dead body.'' Ms. Mohsin said
her hands were tied with rope and she was locked in her dressing
room while the police took her husband away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid,'' she said. ``I think his life is in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Sethi is not the only journalist who had given interviews to the
BBC who has been detained. M.A.K. Lodhi, who is in charge of the
investigations bureau in Lahore for The News, an English-language
daily, was interrogated from May 2 to May 4 about his involvement
with the BBC crew, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported.
</P>
<P>
   And Hussain Haqqani, a columnist for The Friday Times and the
Urdu daily, Jang, was detained on Tuesday and has not been
released, the committee and Pakistani journalists said.
</P>
<P>
   Other journalists who are critical of the government have also
been harassed. A man in dark glasses came to the home of Ejaz
Haider, news editor at The Friday Times, Ms. Mohsin said. Haider
was not home, but the man gave his 7-year-old son an anonymous note
printed on computer paper. It said, ``Put up bullet-proof windows
on your car.''
</P>
<P>
   And Imtiaz Alam, a columnist for The News and Jang, said men
broke the lock on the gate to his home on Wednesday at 3:30 a.m.,
pushed his 1998 sedan, a gray Khyber Suzuki, into the street and
set it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a pattern of witch hunts and intimidation of critical
voices in Pakistan,'' Alam said. ``About 95 percent of the press is
already neutralized and controlled. If they are able to silence
those 10 or 12 more voices, the free press will come to an end in
Pakistan.''

POLICE AND ARMED FORCES IMPLICATED IN ARGENTINE SCANDALS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Recent evidence implicating elements
of the police and armed forces in a string of scandals is raising
unsettling questions among Argentines about violence, corruption
and lawlessness by men in uniform 16 years after the end of
military rule.
</P>
<P>
   While conspiracy theorizing is a national sport here even in the
quietest of times, Argentina's media of late have been full of
accounts of strange plots.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise came last week, with the emergence of a
tape recording of a police radio call suggesting that officials
purposely removed guards from the Israeli Embassy here in 1992
three minutes before a blast that killed 29 people.
</P>
<P>
   In the audiotape, discovered during prosecutors' investigations,
an unidentified federal police commander orders the guards to leave
their posts to take up positions at the nearby Foreign Ministry,
where a demonstration was supposedly gathering. The demonstration
turned out to be a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the tape comes as government investigators are
looking into possible ties between Argentine police officers and
Islamic terrorists suspected of carrying out the 1994 bombing of a
Jewish cultural center here that left 86 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening here is like the story of the `One Thousand
and One Nights,' '' said the Israeli Ambassador here, Yitzak
Aviran, who has long pressed Argentine officials to investigate the
possible involvement of their own police in the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something new, without explanation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent reports have included retired police officers'
planning death squad hits to fight rising crime and allegations
that an organized-crime gang has enjoyed the protection of several
local police forces. The gang has been responsible for assaults on
banks and other businesses across five western provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Like elsewhere in Latin America, money appears to be the
mother's milk of police and military wrongdoing in Argentina.
Salaries are low, and the security forces have lost much of their
budgets, prestige and influence under civilian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there have been enormous improvements since the
dictatorship, you can still see some sectors of the security forces
that are definitely still outside the law,'' said Martin Abregu,
director of the Center for Legal and Social Studies, a human rights
research center.
</P>
<P>
   But Abregu added that in some cases errant members or cliques
within the security forces were working in coordination with
``civilian politicians who act improperly and with total
impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with the newsmagazine Veintiuno, the
governor of Buenos Aires, Eduardo Duhalde, acknowledged that ``I
feared for my life'' last year while he was cashiering much of his
province's police force following revelations of police involvement
in various criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde, who is a leading candidate for president, became
alarmed a year ago when his bodyguards came under a series of
attacks, and prosecutors began investigating whether the shootings
were linked to former police officers seeking revenge. No arrests
have ben made.
</P>
<P>
   Among the acts that forced Duhalde to take action were
allegations of police collusion in the murder of a magazine
photographer in 1997 as well as the arrest of the head of the
provincial police department's stolen vehicle division for selling
stolen property himself.
</P>
<P>
   The chief, Juan Jose Ribelli, is still being held on suspicions
he provided Islamic terrorists with a stolen van used in the 1994
bombing of the Jewish cultural center in exchange for cash
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Six former Buenos Aires provincial policemen who had previously
been held and released were taken into custody again Saturday for
questioning on their possible connection to the van.
</P>
<P>
   Collusion between military and civilian officials is also
suspected by Argentine prosecutors in the illegal sale of arms to
Ecuador and Croatia in the early 1990s. The sales, which broke a
U.N. embargo in the Balkans, included the diversion of 40,000
artillery shells from the Rio Tercero army ammunition plant.
</P>
<P>
   The facility was destroyed in 1995 in a huge explosion that
killed seven people and destroyed 4,000 homes. President Carlos
Saul Menem and military officials have long claimed it was an
accident, but tests conducted two weeks ago under the supervision
of government prosecutors indicated that the plant might have been
destroyed in an attempted coverup.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since 1995, the case has already led to the resignations of one
defense minister and a former air force chief of staff. And a
federal judge has asked Congress to impeach Foreign Minister Guido
Di Tella on allegations he tried to cover up the sales. Di Tella
has denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the two bombings of Jewish targets here that have
produced the greatest concerns about whether corrupt sectors of the
security forces are working against the interests of the country
for money.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious police cassette recording turned up May 4 as the
three officers who were on duty at the Israeli embassy the day of
the bombing testified before a congressional committee. One of the
officers said that his nephew, also an officer, obtained a copy of
the tape at the police academy in 1994 during a training session on
how to respond to catastrophic situations.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Carlos Corach promised that investigators
would first establish whether the tape was authentic, and then
identify the officer who ordered the police to leave the embassy.
So far, no one has been prosecuted for either of the two bombings
of Jewish targets.

TRAINERS LINING UP TO TAKE A SHOT AT CHARISMATIC IN PREAKNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trainers and their horses seemed slower than usual in making
the move, but the Triple Crown scene was relentlessly shifting last
week from Louisville to Baltimore while racing skeptics wondered
how in the world the 31-1 long-shot winner of the Kentucky Derby
could repeat in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   At Pimlico Race Course, where the Preakness will be run
Saturday, the track is narrower, the turns tighter and the distance
shorter than it was for the Derby at Churchill Downs. But
Charismatic will try to make it two straight over 10 or 11 of the
horses he outran with an untroubled trip in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   As Preakness week began, it appeared that a full field of 14
horses would be entered for the second classic for 3-year-olds,
most of them graduates of the Derby. They include Charismatic, the
winner; Menifee, who missed catching him by a neck and was ranked
as the probable favorite to defeat him this time, and Cat Thief,
who missed by less than a length and finished third.
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed likely that Worldly Manner, the horse from Dubai,
who ran seventh in the Derby, would give it another try in the
Preakness. And Bob Baffert, who lost the Derby when all three of
his horses ran out of the money, indicated over the weekend that he
might try to enter his two star fillies: Excellent Meeting, who
finished fifth in the Derby, and Silverbulletday, who won the
Kentucky Oaks the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert apparently intended to excuse General Challenge from
further punishment following the colt's arduous trip to an
11th-place finish in the Derby. And he still was considering
whether to enter Prime Timber, who ran a solid fourth in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert is holding a pair of aces: Silverbulletday, winner
of 10 of her 11 starts, including the Kentucky Oaks, and Excellent
Meeting, winner of six races in a row before the Derby. They are
expected to be shipped to Baltimore on Wednesday. But the trainer,
who played the same guessing game before the Derby, suggested that
he might change the agenda for both fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert returned to Pimlico over the weekend with Real Quiet,
winner of the Derby and Preakness last year. Baffert revived his
exuberance when Real Quiet outran Free House in the homestretch and
won the Pimlico Special by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer also won the Derby and Preakness in 1997 with Silver
Charm. Now, although his Derby streak was broken, he could win the
Black-Eyed Susan one day with one filly and the Preakness the next
day with another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I still plan to enter Silverbulletday in both the
Black-Eyed Susan and the Preakness,'' he said. ``It pretty much
depends on where she draws whether she goes in the Preakness. If I
don't like the post, she'll go in the other race.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, Charismatic's trainer, won his third Kentucky
Derby in five years and his fourth overall, restoring luster to a
career that was being overshadowed by Baffert. But for Lukas, his
chief mission was to build some credibility into Charismatic, who
has won only four of his 15 starts and who ran in a $62,500
claiming race as recently as Feb 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get the credit that he deserves,'' Lukas said.
``But it would be dangerous to overlook him in the Preakness. Very
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Charismatic clearly was not a dominant horse who might sweep
the Triple Crown, which probably explains why a full field of 14 is
likely to start the Preakness for the first time since 1992. That
was the year A.P. Indy came up with a foot injury on the morning of
the Derby, which was won by the undistinguished Lil E. Tee. Two
weeks later, Pine Bluff won the Preakness. Three weeks after that,
a repaired A.P. Indy came back to win the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Charismatic was trying to find respect, Menifee has won
five of his seven starts and ran second in the two others. And Cat
Thief, who is the more highly regarded of the Lukas horses, should
be close to him in the odds.
</P>
<P>
   If Menifee wins the race, it will be the sixth victory for his
jockey, Pat Day, tying him with Eddie Arcaro for the Preakness
record. Day also is the only rider to win the Preakness three years
in a row: aboard Tabasco Cat in 1994, Timber Country in 1995 and
Louis Quatorze in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One other question mark was removed late last week when Carl
Nafzger decided to run Vicar, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes
and the Florida Derby before finishing 18th in the Kentucky Derby.
He said that he would ship Vicar from Churchill Downs to Pimlico on
Wednesday, but added that an outside post position would change his
mind about starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get our rhythm out of the gate,'' Nafzger said.
``We didn't get that in the last race, and a horse with that much
speed, that's his game. Get him out, get in the pace and then have
a little kick at the end. If I get out there in the 14 hole, then I
doubt I will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Nafzger said Vicar would have a new jockey because he released
Shane Sellers last week when he was not sure that they would make
the Preakness. ``Shane was getting calls from other trainers,''
Nafzger said, ``so I told him if he found something definite, he
probably should go.''
</P>
<P>
   The horses will run 1 3/16 miles in the Preakness, which is
one-sixteenth shorter than the Derby. For the strong of heart and
wind, the Triple Crown series closes with the Belmont on June 5 at
a 1 1/2 miles .  &QL;

ANALYSIS: DANGEROUS DIRECTIONS FOR CHINESE REFORM?
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Through their extended campaign to portray the United
States and NATO as evil aggressors in Yugoslavia, and now their
endorsement of mass demonstrations involving the unimpeded stoning
of the American Embassy here, China's leaders may have unleashed
forces that will come back to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the government has shaped, or been forced to
concede to, public passions on the Yugoslavia bombing and NATO's
attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But one result of Beijing's policies was obvious in the chants
and slogans of this weekend's protests: a revival of nationalistic
and anti-American sentiment, which could lead in directions that
are dangerous and unpredictable for the reformist regime led by
President Jiang Zemin. If these unpent emotions solidify, the
effects on Chinese politics and foreign policy will be profound,
possibly lending new power to conservative forces in the Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators have sung the national anthem and shouted for
China's pride and against ``American imperialism.'' Such attitudes
seem to lurk permanently in the Chinese psyche, right alongside the
affection for American culture that seemed so prominent last year
when many students _ a prominent faction of the current
anti-American protests _ hailed President Clinton as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Left to fester, that emotional nationalism could spin in
unpredictable and dangerous directions, quite possibly turning
against Jiang and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and their policies of
closer ties with the West and more market economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese nationalism is a very emotional and explosive
sentiment that, once aroused, can lead to all sorts of unexpected
consequences,'' said Xiao Gongqin, a historian at Shanghai
University.
</P>
<P>
   The current outburst of nationalistic excess, Xiao said, may be
simply a shallow and largely passing response to an extraordinary
event. But if it grows, he said, ``it could encourage China to
attempt to return to the past, and it will put Jiang Zemin and Zhu
Rongji under great pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand of hard-liners, who are less inclined to develop close
ties to the United States or make concessions on, say, foreign
access to Chinese markets, could be strengthened. The relative
power of a figure like Li Peng, who now heads the national
parliament, might grow, and military chiefs who want a stronger
response to NATO bombing in Yugoslavia might have a greater voice.
</P>
<P>
   The patriotism expressed this weekend was seldom linked to
direct support for the current leaders, who many protesters
complained have been ineffectual in doing anything about the NATO
crimes they so vociferously condemn.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cheers in front of the American Embassy on Sunday
morning came when a man paraded a large photograph of Mao Tse-tung,
the leader who brought on the mass turmoil and suffering of the
Cultural Revolution and whose legacy has been largely dismantled
since his death in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Live Mao,'' scores of people chanted, students and older
white-collar workers alike, seeming to revel in a slogan seldom
heard in the last 20 years of economic reforms. In truth, few of
them would really want to return to the rigid ideology and personal
oppressions of Mao's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Tang Zhenlei, a 30-year-old teacher, explained why he had
shouted with the others: ``When Chairman Mao was the leader, he
would have stood up to America and taken stronger measures,'' he
said. ``But now our leaders have been too soft, they're happy to
accept an apology from NATO and leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Chairman Mao was willing to stand alone to defend China's
dignity,'' Tang said.
</P>
<P>
   For the current leaders, this was supposed to be the year of no
demonstrations, a year of sensitive dates like next month's 10th
anniversary of the crushing of the democracy movement in Tiananmen
Square. And a stable China was supposed to broaden its ties with
the West and deepen its progress toward a modern market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, last month more than 10,000 members of a spiritual
movement held a surprise demonstration on the edge of Zhongnanhai,
the inviolable leadership compound in Beijing, and the police saw
little choice but to let it proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Then this weekend, after the shock of the embassy attack in
Belgrade, the leaders endorsed mass demonstrations around the
American and British embassies. Given the anger over NATO's motives
that inflammatory propaganda has helped create here, officials may
have felt they had little choice but to let people vent their
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, they cannot be pleased to have watched the
student marches spiral almost out of control on Saturday night, as
roaming mobs heaved bricks at American Embassy buildings and cars
and mockingly defied the riot police. At several points that night,
groups of young men formed human wedges and tried to batter their
way to the American Embassy through police lines.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare, direct speech to the people televised this evening,
Vice President Hu Jintao gave official approval to the
demonstrations, saying, in words that were sure to be quoted by
democracy advocates: ``The Chinese government firmly supports and
protects, in accordance with the law, all legal protest
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   In a characteristically wooden manner, he also seemed to warn
against excesses such as Saturday night's burning of the American
Consulate in Chengdu. ``We believe that the broad masses will,
proceeding from the fundamental interests of the nation and taking
the overall situation into account, carry out the activities in
good order and in accordance with law.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese people think that the government intentionally
stirred up public opinion over NATO's campaign in Yugoslavia to
shift attention from domestic ills and the approaching June 4
anniversary of the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square
demonstrations for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday, one person involved in the democracy
movement said that by permitting the current large and raucous
demonstrations, officials were courting trouble. He quoted a
Chinese saying: ``He who climbs on a tiger may have trouble getting
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as riot police began to assert more control over the
streaming throngs of protesters, the government continued to stoke
the flames of public passion, its media and ``experts'' insisting
absolutely that the Belgrade attack had been intentional.
</P>
<P>
   A bitter editorial in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's
prime mouthpiece, referred to the ``criminal intent of the
aggressors'' in the embassy bombing and said that NATO now owed the
Chinese people a ``blood debt.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a far jump from those words to the more lurid slogans
voiced by protesters, like ``Bomb the White House'' and ``Blood for
blood.'' But the newspaper's harsh words came from the same
political leadership that had staked great status on building a
``strategic partnership'' with the United States.

TO MOTIVATE THE HEAT, RILEY GOES TO THE VIDEOTAPE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Normal, for Pat Riley, would have been to hold a
marathon practice Sunday. He would have run his players until they
either dropped or realized how awful it was to lose their first
home playoff game by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   But renowned as he is for motivating underachieving teams with
work and more work, the Miami Heat coach let the camera speak for
him.
</P>
<P>
   A day after they were run out of Miami Arena in Game 1 of the
three-of-five-game series, Heat players were forced to sit through
a videotape at their Coconut Grove practice facility of their 95-75
debacle against the New York Knicks. No wind sprints. No endless
scrimmage. Just Knick highlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all the truth,'' said P.J. Brown, who was ejected from
the game after arguing a technical foul. ``They say the eye doesn't
lie. With that camera, there's nothing you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   With Game 2 looming Monday night, Riley is one loss from
returning to Madison Square Garden in a disastrous 0-2 hole. Rather
than resort to the usual bunker mentality, he tried a more
practical approach. Basically telling his players, ``That's not
you,'' he urged them to watch the videotape before speaking of
their seasonlong resilience.
</P>
<P>
   The Heat began the season 1-3 and weathered a midseason streak
in which they lost six of seven games before righting themselves to
take control of the Atlantic Division and eventually the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what the perception and what people think based
on the first game,'' Riley said. ``I know what our team is and how
we've showed in the past. We are a team that has great heart and
great character _ and it will surface.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``What really counts is who we are, what we've done
and how we've played in the past. We simply have to get back to
that. The reality, like any team that loses the first game of the
playoffs, is that we simply have to go back to work mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to Game 2, Riley cautioned his players about reading
too many South Florida newspapers _ most of which painted a
dreadful picture for the first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, beneath the steely veneers of Alonzo Mourning and Tim
Hardaway, there is genuine concern.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning had an effective offensive game, but Miami was once
again unmasked as a team with few offensive options beyond its
franchise center and trigger-happy point guard. Dan Majerle and
Jamal Mashburn missed layups. Voshon Lenard could not make a
3-pointer until the game was out of reach. The reserve forward
Clarence Weatherspoon looked intimidated each time he caught the
ball in the post.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway is clearly ailing. Bothered by a sore right knee, he
made only 4 of 19 shots. Stubbornly proud, he did not stick around
to be interviewed by reporters. But his defenders were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the odds are poor that that will happen,'' Riley said
of Hardaway having another meltdown from the perimeter. ``But
they're doing a good job on him. Tim's got to find a way to do
other things, and I've got to find a way to help him get better
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning said: ``I know Timmy. He's going to go out and play a
lot better game. We don't play that way on a regular basis. If we
played that way on a regular basis, we wouldn't be the No. 1 seed
in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   The general perception among Heat players is that Saturday was
an aberration. They even played down the 44 points put up by
Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play as hard as they did,'' Majerle said. ``We
didn't do the things we needed to do to win. Sprewell and Houston
are both great players, but we have to go out and play our type of
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley criticized his team's transition defense and went on and
on about discipline and detail. But the challenge he was issuing to
his players seemed simple: lock those Game 1 impostors in the
closet and assume their rightful identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed as anybody,'' Majerle said. ``He was mad,
but we've seen him a lot worse. He knows what we have to do. He let
the film pretty much speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said: ``Everybody who stepped on the court yesterday for
the Knicks contributed nicely to the team. We only had one guy that
stepped up for us. If they're going to play like that, we have to
have more guys on our team play better to match them. Because if
they continue to play like they played and we continue to play like
we played, we're going to be swept.'' &QL;

SIGN LANGUAGE

 SIGNS _ SF CHRON   By Benny Evangelista 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Damien Pickering stands on the edge of the curb, listening intently
for the red light to change.
</P>
<P>
   Blind since childhood, Pickering relies on a small plastic box
he holds in his hand like a TV remote control. The box repeats a
scratchy, computerized voice that says, ``Wait, Polk Street. Wait,
Polk Street.''
</P>
<P>
   After the light changes to green, the voice says, ``Walk sign,
Polk. Walk sign, Polk.'' Without hesitation, Pickering steps off
the curb and quickly crosses the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a technology that holds a lot of promise,'' Pickering
said of the receiver-transmitter system that is called Talking
Signs. ``Everyone points to new technology these days, and there
are products that come and go. But this one gets my vote for
something that can really make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, San Francisco has become a real-life laboratory for
Talking Signs, which uses microprocessors and infrared beams to
give vision-impaired people a voice description of signs and
landmarks in their vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 900 Talking Signs transmitters placed at &LR; 
various points  &LR; throughout the city, at key crosswalks, inside the
newly rebuilt City Hall, throughout the main library and in the
Powell Street BART station.
</P>
<P>
   There even are transmitters atop 20 of the city's fancy J.C.
Decaux automatic public toilets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, only a handful of visually impaired people like
Pickering use the Talking Sign receivers to get around.
</P>
<P>
   But there increasingly are signals that the technology has made
a breakthrough from being an experiment to being a promising
commercial product. And it also has the potential to help sighted
people find their way around an unknown place.
</P>
<P>
   Talking Signs, marketed by a small Baton Rouge, La., company of
the same name, now are also installed at intersections, museums and
train stations in New York; Washington, D.C.; Boston; Austin,
Texas; and Mashantucket, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing accelerated interest all over the country,'' said
C. Ward Bond, president of Talking Signs Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Luminator Inc., a Texas company that makes the
electronic destination signs found on buses throughout the country,
launched a new product that incorporates Talking Signs to broadcast
destination and route information for riders who are visually
impaired.
</P>
<P>
   Next week in San Francisco, Mayor Willie Brown's disability
advisory committee is expected to approve a resolution making it
the city's official policy to install Talking Signs transmitters in
every new or remodeled public facility. The proposed resolution
also suggests that private buildings have at least one installed,
when possible, at entrances.
</P>
<P>
   And a unit of giant Mitsubishi Corp. now is producing new
Talking Signs devices as part of a year-old deal with Talking Signs
Inc. to market the transmitters and receivers throughout Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market of this orientation device will expand rapidly in
the near future,'' Hajime Sone, general manager for corporate
planning for Mitsubishi Precision Co., said in an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to market for public place(s) first, such as
government offices, hospitals, libraries, museums, train stations
and others,'' Sone said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitsubishi said it also is eyeing more universal uses of the
devices by private businesses like hotels, department stores and
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitsubishi deal ``makes us optimistic that these units will
be everywhere,'' said William Crandall, a scientist with San
Francisco's Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, which
originally invented Talking Signs.
</P>
<P>
   The basic technology has existed for years. A voice description
of a sign or landmark is digitally recorded on a microchip.
Light-emitting diodes transmit the message on an invisible infrared
beam in the same way a TV remote control works.
</P>
<P>
   The person using the receiver presses a button to hear the
message, either through a speaker on the device or with an
earphone. The strength and direction of the signal itself is useful
as a homing beacon to find the sign or landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Talking Signs users like Jerry Kuns of San Francisco say the
devices replace constantly having to ask strangers to become
guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I travel all the time, and for me to go from here to Los
Angeles, I probably have to ask and be handled by a dozen people,''
said Kuns, who lost his sight during childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a demand on me socially, and it's a demand on me
psychologically,'' he said. A sighted person ``can just look up,
see a sign and just head for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Braille signs on elevators and ATM machines are fine, said Kuns,
a sales manager for a company that sells products for the visually
impaired. But for a visually impaired person, Braille signs are
useless if they cannot even find the elevator or ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Kuns said he can find his way without any help around places
like the Powell Street BART station, which has Talking Signs
transmitters at fare gate entrances, ticket machines, rest rooms
and telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independence and the dignity provide me with a great deal
more comfort and happiness,'' Kuns said. ``The freedom of choice is
very important.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the University of California at Santa Barbara
showed that Talking Signs made a profound difference for visually
impaired transit riders.
</P>
<P>
   During the study, members of one group of visually impaired
people took five minutes or more to locate an express bus stop, if
they found it at all, said Reginald G. Golledge, a University of
California at Santa Barbara geography professor who conducted the
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Talking Signs, they were all doing it in a minute or a
minute 20 seconds,'' Golledge said. ``The difference was really
night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking Signs may get a boost from recent federal legislation.
The sweeping Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 mandates that
people with disabilities have equal access to buildings and
services.
</P>
<P>
   And a $230 billion Transportation Equity Act passed in 1998
includes a provision to install audible signals and signs at
certain crosswalks, Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, cities such as Oakland have installed audible
street signals that chirp like birds to indicate a green light.
People who are visually impaired say the chirping helps but can be
confusing. That's why Ward said the bill has increased interest in
more-sophisticated technologies like Talking Signs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cost remains a barrier. Currently, Talking Signs cost about
$1,000 per transmitter and $250 for each receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, whose privately owned company has yet to turn a profit,
hopes to sell transmitters to government agencies and private
businesses, while providing receivers to the visually impaired at
little or no cost to them.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, only a few municipalities such as San Francisco &LR; 
 &LR; have installed the devices, and the cost scares off private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And receivers won't be in great demand until there are more
transmitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to bring the chicken and egg along at the same
time,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement with Mitsubishi, which received a small stake
in Talking Signs, gives Talking Signs fans hope that the cost of
the devices will decline.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Talking Signs proponents hope other creative uses that
benefit sighted people will surface. For example, the devices could
be programmed to receive in different languages, so tourists who
don't speak or read English can find their way around a town.
</P>
<P>
   And the $135 million Mashantucket Pequot Museum in Connecticut
uses Talking Signs to guide blind visitors through its Native
American exhibits, but the same technology also could be used by
sighted visitors for self-guided tours.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richard Skaff, Mayor Brown's special assistant for
disability-access issues and former access coordinator for San
Francisco's Department of Public Works, said the city continues to
install Talking Signs transmitters at city facilities like the
Yerba Buena Gardens and a new public pool at Hunters Point.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the transmitters already installed were funded through
corporate donations or, in the case of City Hall and the main
Library, included in overall publicly funded construction costs,
Skaff said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Kuns is concerned, the cost is more than justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says sighted people should get all the benefits of the
world?'' Kuns said. ``I pay taxes so that everybody who drives can
use the streets. We all need to share in making the world a kinder
and more accessible place.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
For more information: Visitors to San Francisco's City Hall or the
main library can borrow a Talking Signs receiver for use in the
building. Also, the Rose Resnick Lighthouse for the Blind and
Visually Impaired has receivers available for an extended loan with
a $25 refundable deposit. For information, call (415) 431-1481.

 Pretty Web Pages Can Be Ugly to Disabled
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
The blazing 3-D graphics, video and sound that enliven multimedia
Web sites also can create barriers for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web design is primarily driven by retinal chauvinists,'' said
Jerry Kuns, a visually impaired sales representative who uses
computer speech and Braille synthesizers to read information on the
Internet. ``Pictures are great, but they are stumbling blocks to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, audio clips can present a barrier for hearing
impaired people if no text translation is available.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a worldwide Internet standards body has just created
guidelines to help Web designers avoid problems that make their
sites cumbersome or unusable for people with physical or learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The World Web Web Consortium, called the W3C for short, released
its ``Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0'' last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web has become a very visual medium,'' said Judy Brewer,
director of the W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative. ``It's a
wonderful way to exchange information. But if you have someone who
can't see that information, they wouldn't necessarily know what's
in that content.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a button graphic on a company's Web site that links
a sighted person to products they can buy online may not be visible
to a person using software that converts text into speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone with sight might see `products, services, a business
plan, news,' but someone who can't see that would hear, `image,
image, image, image,''' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   And sites that rely solely on mouse clicks for navigation may be
difficult for people with physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines ``take that into account, so a developer doesn't
have to think through all of that,'' Brewer said. For instance, she
said the guidelines say ``when you are putting in an image, add
alternative text.''
</P>
<P>
   The 300-member W3C also created a list of 10 tips for making
pages more accessible, such as always using the ``alt'' key to
display text that describes what visual elements like buttons do.
</P>
<P>
   Web accessibility is not just an issue of aesthetics, Brewer
said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 opinion written by the U.S. Department of Justice said
the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act _ a sweeping bill that
mandates that buildings and services be made accessible to people
with disabilities _ also applies to companies and government
agencies offering products and services through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, the W3C also tried to create guidelines that could
bring about better Web designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are afraid an accessible page is dull or
boring, but multimedia can be effective support for
accessibility,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are available at &LR;  www.w3.org/wai &LR; . For a list of

VETERAN OF GUN VIOLENCE OFFERS COLD CANDOR ON SCHOOL SHOOTINGS

(DW) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of course there will be another schoolhouse rampage
of gunfire, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy observed, cool as the trauma
nurse she once was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. Sure,'' she said in an interview, her voice firm,
her gaze anguished. ``That's one thing we did get out of all the
committee hearings,'' she said of the serial congressional
inquiries _ five so far _ that, she has found, follow so gravely
yet inconsequentially upon the schoolhouse shootings that
periodically seize the nation's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychologists, the crisis team researchers, they all come
out to these hearings and say it's not a matter of if there's going
to be another school shooting,'' said Mrs. McCarthy, looking darkly
beyond the latest school gun carnage in Colorado. ``It comes down
to a question of when there'll be another shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy, D-N.Y., may speak with too much cold candor for
the current capital mood. Reacting to the 15 gun deaths in
Colorado, President Clinton has optimistically scheduled a
``summit'' of school experts on Monday. Republican congressional
leaders talk of delving again into the problem, their words more
resolute than their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy feels entitled to her candor. As much as
war-veteran lawmakers are consulted about the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's attacks on Yugoslavia, the 55-year-old congresswoman
represents a certain grisly expertise as the widow of a gunshot
victim.
</P>
<P>
   She became vaguely famous six years ago for her fury and her
decision to go into politics because of a gunman's rampage that
killed her husband, Dennis, and five others on a Long Island Rail
Road train. She has since become a different person, in a way, a
politician humbled by the way things work here, but one who
personalizes the continuing gun deaths to keep her edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here two and a half years and that means I've lost _ what?
_ close to 13,000 kids,'' the congresswoman said of the 5,000
American minors who are shot to death annually, most of them
without stirring national attention. ``You have to personalize it.
That's what gives you the energy to keep fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy now knows the arcane turnings by which the gun
control issue can get studied to a standstill here even as public
concern is stoked with the killing of more innocents. She becomes
jaded, but in the strange ways of Congress that she is coming to
savor, she finds jadedness yields to fresh resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, the maneuvers,'' Mrs. McCarthy said, ticking off a
list of legislative sidetrackings second nature to her. ``The
cop-out,'' she said of the renewed blame-saying over the state of
mental health, national morality and entertainment violence.
Important factors, she agrees, but hardly the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you a perfect example,'' she said, pointing to the
Education Committee and its quick post-Colorado decision to propose
``a comprehensive report'' on school violence. ``We got a lot of
information in five earlier hearings, and in this one they've left
one thing out: There's nothing in there to look at the easy access
to guns. It's, like, `We're going to do something. But we're not
going to touch that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In becoming a politician, Mrs. McCarthy has focused on other
issues like education and breast cancer, working against any
single-issue ``gun nut'' stereotyping, she says. Her bill for
mandatory trigger locks and for penalizing parents who store their
guns irresponsibly is not rooted in the usual ``war of words''
about the right to bear arms, she emphasizes. It has a narrower,
more practical premise that adult gun owners should be held
responsible for their possessions. She concedes that the bill is
not very likely to move. She promises to rework it as amendments
for other bills, and then to fight beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a doubting glance at all her maneuvering, Mrs.
McCarthy insists that the Colorado shootings seem of a different,
more alarming, scale. ``Women, mothers, kids are scared this time
and still talk about it more than two weeks later,'' she said.
``Usually these shootings have only a five- to seven-day spread,''
she added, speaking like a Capitol veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin called almost immediately to see if I was all right,''
she said of the Colorado shootings and her son, who was critically
wounded alongside his father in the commuter train. ``Each new time
hits us quite hard.'' Family endurance feeds her Capitol resolve.
After each week's final vote, she hurries back to Mineola, where
she lives with her brother, Tommy Cook, a veteran of the family's
proud tradition as boilermakers, three generations deep.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Kevin and his wife, Leslie, introduced new life,
a grandson for Mrs. McCarthy. He was named Denis after his late
grandfather, with a single-``n'' twist of Irish for good measure.
As incumbent matriarch, Mrs. McCarthy scrapped her son's plans for
this Mother's Day. ``I said, `Listen to me very carefully. You and
Leslie are going out to eat. And I am staying home with the baby.
That's what I want for Mother's Day.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The politician smiled. ``I've been teaching Denis to roll
over.''
</P>
<P>
   She seems stoic at how Mother's Day can be followed by a White
House summit on the shooting of children. The congresswoman's
message is as plain as the lesson of her new life as a politician.
``Unless each and every American who cares about this issue becomes
involved, it will die here,'' she declared coolly. ``And the
silence here in Congress is going to be deafening.''

 FILES _ SF CHRON   Anti-Spam Service or McCarthyism?  
Art Coombes and customers of his small Internet service company
recently learned some hard lessons about sharing an online account
with a spammer. They stopped receiving e-mail.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coombes, owner of Internet Frontier in Walnut Creek, became the
latest unwitting ISP to make the Realtime Blackhole List, which is
generated by the self-proclaimed e-mail police of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Coombes and a long list of RBL offenders, call the
Redwood City organization behind the list a gang of vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   RBL publishes an electronic enemies list of ISPs and Web-hosting
companies that it accuses of trafficking in spam or unsolicited
bulk e-mail. Billions of junk e-mail messages are delivered
annually, according to e-mail experts. RBL's list is circulated to
hundreds of ISPs, universities and online organizations, who,
following RBL's advice, automatically can refuse to deliver
messages from an ISP that has been ``blackholed.''
</P>
<P>
   At various times, America Online, Microsoft Network, Real
Networks and Earthlink Network have been listed by RBL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a solution to spam,'' said John Mozena, co-founder of
Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email, of which RBL is a
member. ``But it is a valuable tool _ both in technical and public
relations terms _ for domains that want to protect themselves
against spam. No one wants to be stigmatized by being on the RBL
list.''
</P>
<P>
   But the electronic blockade often extends too far. When an ISP
is ``blackholed,'' other ISPs and corporations block all e-mail
from that ISP _ cutting off the ISP's nonspamming customers in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than be surgically precise, they are like the Sherman
Army marching to the sea,'' said Coombes, whose company has 2,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being penalized for simply being a customer of Internet
Frontier,'' said one East Bay resident, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a month, e-mail service for dozens of Internet
Frontier customers was spotty _ until Coombes booted the offending
spammer from his online service, RBL dropped his company from its
list and other ISPs lifted their ban. Full e-mail service was
restored to Internet Frontier several days ago. Nick Nicholas,
executive director of the Mail Abuse Prevention System LLC, which
operates the Realtime Blackhole List, admitted that consumers
``unfortunately are caught in the middle.'' But he said RBL's
pressure tactics forced Internet Frontier to clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   Counters the still-fuming Coombes: ``We are off their list not
because we dropped a customer, but because we threatened a lawsuit.
They can dress this up anyway they want, but what they are doing is
arrogant and philosophically repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Others agree that RBL is taking a radical approach _ albeit
with less vitriol than Coombes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes spam, and there is no easy way to stop it,'' said
Paul Hoffman, director of Internet Mail Consortium in Santa Cruz.
``So we have a situation where people are taking extreme measures
that upset a lot of individuals yet cut spam by only 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EUROSPAM: The European Parliament, meanwhile, improbably voted last
week to legalize spam over the objections of ISPs and anti-spamming
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ part of larger legislation on legal aspects of
electronic commerce _ requires that unsolicited commercial e-mail
be labeled as such in e-mail headers. &UR;  &LR; European ISPs, who rightly
accused Parliament members of being misinformed, fear that weak
laws will encourage spammers to bombard consumers with junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   Could you imagine a similar scenario in the United States? Not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There are several bills floating in Congress to curb spam
nationwide, and state laws in California, Nevada, Washington and
Virginia. Another 14 states are considering anti-spam bills.

Fortune magazine.

PRODUCTION WORKERS SUFFER AS HOLLYWOOD TAKES MORE SHOWS ON THE ROAD
 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seamstresses, steel workers and electronics
assemblers have all lost jobs as manufacturing moved from the
United States to countries where costs were lower. Now complaints
about similar job losses are coming from workers in a
quintessentially American industry: Hollywood's film and television
studios.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by declining profits and ballooning expenses at home,
Hollywood has shifted production abroad, particularly the
production of low-budget movies made for television. About 55
percent of the 1997-98 season's made-for-television movies and
miniseries were filmed in other countries, according to the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., which promotes filmmaking
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Most were made in Canada, where a weak currency, generous
financial incentives and proximity to the United States make
production relatively inexpensive and convenient. Of the 14
original movies shown by the Showtime cable network, 10 were made
there. And despite its name, 14 of 23 films made for the USA
Network were not made in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Current television shows like ``The Outer Limits'' and ``The New
Addams Family'' are made in Vancouver, which has become known in
the industry as ``Hollywood North.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent feature films made at least partly in Canada include
``Jumanji,'' ``Legends of the Fall'' and ``Good Will Hunting.''
``Down in the Delta'' was really up in Toronto. So was ``Murder at
1600.''
</P>
<P>
   Runaway production, as it is called by critics, is a hot issue
for scores of Hollywood art directors, grips, boom operators, sound
mixers, costume designers, makeup artists, prop builders and stunt
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost three movies in four months with producers I have
worked with for years,'' said David Lewis, a director of
photography. Lewis, 53, said he has made only $1,800 so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts caution that the amount of offshore production is
tiny, compared with Hollywood's overall output. If workers are
losing jobs, they say, it is probably because movie studios, which
have been hurt by big-budget flops, are cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, about 1,500 people showed up for a ``Bring Hollywood
Home'' demonstration on April 18 in Burbank, organized by the Film
and Television Action Committee, a group of Hollywood workers
fighting what their chairman, Jack De Govia, called Canada's
raiding of American industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild are
jointly financing a study of the phenomenon. Two bills introduced
in the California Legislature would provide tax incentives to keep
filmmaking in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, representatives of many of the 196 state and
local film commissions met last week to form a new trade group,
Film US. The group will press for federal tax incentives and easier
access to national parks and military bases for film crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry was created here,'' said Dawn M. Keezer, director
of the Pittsburgh Film Office and chairwoman of the new group.
``It's now walking out the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cities and states the group represents once drew
business away from Los Angeles, where costs are high and obtaining
a permit to film on city streets is not always easy. Now they find
themselves in the same boat as Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh, where five to eight television movies were once made
annually, had none in 1997 and only four in 1998, Ms. Keezer said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City, the nation's second-largest production center,
continued to report record levels of filming in 1998. Pat Swinney
Kaufman, director of the New York Governor's Office for Motion
Picture and Television Development, suggested that the city did not
see the decline experienced by some other cities because very few
television movies are made there.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, as production moved to other states, Los
Angeles-based workers could travel from one project to another,
like highly paid migrant workers. But under Canadian immigration
and union rules, only the top people on a production _ including
the director, the producer and the stars _ are allowed in. The rest
of the film crew must be Canadian, with rare exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Weekly television series and feature films have not moved
offshore to the extent that television movies have. Only 8 American
feature films out of 77 now in production are being made in Canada,
according to The Hollywood Reporter, a trade newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been considerable migration, and not only to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, which also has a weak currency, is attracting
production. The News Corp., the Australian parent of 20th Century
Fox, has just opened a studio in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers executives have said they saved more than $20
million by making ``The Matrix'' in Australia. ``Mission:
Impossible 2'' is also being made there, as will the next two
``Star Wars'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Baywatch,'' the iconic California beach series, planned
to move to Australia, but ended up going to Hawaii instead after
the state government and local labor unions made cost-cutting
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The movie business has driven the Los Angeles area's recovery
since the collapse of the aerospace industry, and any threat to the
business is of great concern. Employment in movies and television
in Los Angeles County soared from less than 76,000 in 1990 to a
high of 142,500 in February 1998, according to the county.
</P>
<P>
   But employment has dropped by about 10,000 since then. Filming
of movies, television shows, commercials and music videos on Los
Angeles streets fell 8 percent in 1998 and 2.9 percent further in
the first quarter of 1999.

 _ SF CHRON   Company's Trade Secrets Clash With a Judge's Need to Know 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A company's desire to protect a secret formula collided with a
judge's interest in proving guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt last
week.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Superior Court Judge Robert Dondero decided that
he would not accept a certain type of DNA test as evidence in five
criminal trials before him because the company that sells the test
_ Perkin-Elmer Biosystems in Foster City _ refused to show him the
secret formula that supposedly makes the test foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   At Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters in Washington,
D.C., where the feds use that same test to identify criminals by
using their DNA ``fingerprints,'' spokesman Paul Bresson insisted
that the test ``has been validated in numerous studies. We'll
continue to use it, and I suspect so will most other crime labs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dondero refused to accept previous studies, and when he
demanded that the company fully disclose its test data,
Perkin-Elmer refused. Nicky Fildes, who sells the DNA test to
police labs worldwide, explained why.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the DNA test kit is something of a shake 'n'
bake operation. The DNA sample, from a drop of blood or a speck of
skin, is mixed with chemicals provided by Perkin-Elmer.
</P>
<P>
   These chemicals do two things, she explained. The first set of
chemicals mark &UR;  &LR; 13 spots on DNA thought to be unique to each human
being _ the so-called genetic fingerprint. A second set of
chemicals reproduces these 13 DNA markers billions of times over,
producing enough material to run through an analysis machine.
</P>
<P>
   But that machine is standard lab equipment, Fildes said. The
real magic is in the chemicals in the kit. And as far as
Perkin-Elmer is concerned, that chemical recipe constitutes a trade
secret, just like the formula for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one case where we turned over similar proprietary
information to a court in Boston, a defense expert published the
data,'' Fildes said.
</P>
<P>
   That let competitors mix up the same chemicals and undercut
Perkin-Elmer's business, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Riley, a research professor at the University of
Washington in Seattle, was the defense expert who published the
formula for an earlier Perkin-Elmer test in the Boston case Fildes
described.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a skeptic when it comes to the accuracy of DNA
fingerprinting techniques, often testifies as an expert witness for
defense lawyers trying to undermine the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Because the chemical makeup of the test kit is so essential to
assessing its validity, Riley thinks that the formulas must be
published _ even if that allows competitors to sell generic
versions at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to risk an opinion on reliability if I don't know
what are the ingredients,'' said Riley, who testified to that
effect before Dondero.
</P>
<P>
   But George Sensabaugh, a professor of forensics at the
University of California at Berkeley, said the Perkin-Elmer test _
and its secret chemical formula _ are widely accepted by academic
and crime lab scientists in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sensabaugh also testified before Dondero, on behalf of
prosecutors trying to assuage the judge's concerns. He said
Perkin-Elmer had an understandable interest in protecting its
chemical formula.
</P>
<P>
   And given the wide testing that other labs have done on
Perkin-Elmer's chemical kit, he feels the company doesn't need to
reveal every aspect of its recipe to be confident it yields
reliable results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are components in your car you don't know anything
about,'' he said. ``Your concern as a consumer is, `Does this get
me from one place to another?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BUYER'S MARKET: It's a tough time to be looking for a CEO job at a
young biotech firm, said Victor Kleinman, with the Stevenson Group
in San Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   As a headhunter with years of experience matching executives
with life sciences firms, Kleinman said companies are more
demanding when assessing qualifications and tougher when
negotiating pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking to run a company, you have to be a total
package,'' he said. That means a proven track record in science,
successful drug development, growing companies, and above all,
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   While CEO jobs at many high-tech companies can write their own
ticket, a shortage of startup capital in biotech has made companies
_ and their venture backers _ more choosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash is so tight that boards won't look at candidates who
haven't done private financings or IPO road shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinman said the standard package for CEOs used to be $200,000
in base pay and 3 percent of the company's stock in options. ``In
today's market, it's more like $175,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the 3 percent in stock likely will be tied to meeting
milestones _ so many shares when you complete a financing round, so
many shares when you go public, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have your sights set on a job below the executive
office, this may not be the time to pound the fist for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything at the top filters down,'' Kleinman said.

 LOS ANGELES: of 1999 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The downturn has hit people like Betty Pecha Madden, a costume
designer for 24 years, who said that in the past she had made
between $80,000 and $120,000 in a good year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madden said she had lost two jobs to Canada in the last
year. ``I did a commercial for three days in January. That's the
only work I've had since March 14 of last year,'' she said, adding
that her husband, who supervises children on film sets, has also
had trouble finding work. ``We're scared of losing our home,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mitchell, the director of the British Columbia Film
Commission, said the anger of workers like Ms. Madden is misplaced.
Production of American movies and television shows in Canada
generated about $1.5 billion last year, he said, compared to $27
billion in Los Angeles alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to evaporate as a production center overnight, or
double, it would not have any effect on California at all,''
Mitchell said. As with other industries, he said, manufacturing
jobs have come to Canada while more lucrative financial and
creative jobs stayed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hollywood executives say that even now, film employment in
Los Angeles is way ahead of where it was a few years ago and the
overall economy is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   These executives attribute the dip not to runaway production but
to runaway budgets, which have crimped profits and caused studios
to make fewer films. The Walt Disney Co. says it plans to make 20
movies a year, down from more than 30, cutting its budget by $500
million. Television networks are also tightening their belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know that so-called runaway production is
really any more an issue than it's always been,'' said Tom Rothman,
president of production for 20th Century Fox. ``I think there is an
increasing cost consciousness with the business overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, film production in British Columbia, most of it in
Vancouver, grew by roughly 20 percent in 1998 to about $550
million, measured in U.S. dollars. Right now, 30 productions are
under way or about to start there, including 12 television movies
and several feature films. These include ``Detox,'' starring
Sylvester Stallone; ``Reindeer Games,'' starring Ben Affleck, and
``Mission to Mars,'' a big-budget Disney picture starring Gary
Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia is recruiting film work heavily. The province's
premier, Glen Clark, visited Los Angeles last year to meet with
studio executives. Last year, British Columbia introduced financial
incentives similar to those instituted by the Canadian government
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the programs provide a rebate equal to 22 percent of a
film's spending on Canadian labor. Similar incentives are available
in Toronto, Canada's other major film center.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the Canadian dollar has depreciated to 69
American cents from nearly 90 cents early in the decade. Locating
in Canada results in a roughly 30 percent saving on labor, which
typically accounts for about 40 percent of a movie's costs. Some of
the savings are offset by travel and hotel expenses for American
crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the Canadian dollar and the tax advantage they give
you, it's very hard to beat it,'' said Leonard Goldberg, the
producer of ``Double Jeopardy,'' a thriller made in Vancouver that
is scheduled to be released this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lammi, executive vice president for production at Columbia
Tristar Television, said moving to Canada could save up to
$200,000, or 10 percent of the budget of a one-hour television
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, on a lot of shows you just can't overlook
that,'' he said. Columbia Tristar, a unit of the Sony Corp., made 5
of its 20 pilots for next season in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in town is there,'' Lammi said. ``It obviously
works.''
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, this trend represents an odd turn of events.
Canada has long been concerned that its culture is being overrun by
movies and television shows made in the United States. Now some
people in Hollywood worry that Canadians are usurping the creation
of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to have to tell John Wayne, `You're going to
have to take ``The Alamo'' and do it in Canada?''' asked Luster
Bayless, the owner of American Costume of North Hollywood, who was
once Wayne's personal costumer.
</P>
<P>
   While some angry film workers have called for a movie boycott on
Memorial Day weekend, many say the studios are merely reacting to
economic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't blame the studios; they're a business,'' said Richard
A. Ludt, who gave up union construction work five years ago for a
job as a grip, moving and positioning cameras. Unable to find work,
Ludt, 35, temporarily went back to construction early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups are exploring whether Canada's incentive system
could be attacked under world trade rules or the North American
Free Trade Agreement, but they say such moves do not look
promising. Many local unions have agreed over the last few years to
accept lower wages for low-budget productions to keep them in the
United States, but Canada is still cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Migration to Canada could level off. In January, a Canadian
government commission recommended eliminating incentives, saying
they were attracting too many foreign companies and interfering
with the greater goal of fostering Canada's own film and television
production. Canadian actors are threatening to strike for higher
pay, and film crews there are stretched thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' moved to Los Angeles this season after five
years in Vancouver, because one of its stars, David Duchovny,
wanted to spend more time with his wife, actress Tea Leoni. But few
people have enough clout to get a movie or television series to
relocate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all rather be working at home,'' John V. Stuckmeyer, a
producer of television movies, said in a telephone interview from
Vancouver. But, he added, ``For every `X-Files' that leaves here,
three more show up.''

 FILES _ SF CHRON   Anti-Spam Service or McCarthyism?  
 c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
Art Coombes and customers of his small Internet service company
recently learned some hard lessons about sharing an online account
with a spammer. They stopped receiving e-mail.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coombes, owner of Internet Frontier in Walnut Creek, became the
latest unwitting ISP to make the Realtime Blackhole List, which is
generated by the self-proclaimed e-mail police of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Coombes and a long list of RBL offenders, call the
Redwood City organization behind the list a gang of vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   RBL publishes an electronic enemies list of ISPs and Web-hosting
companies that it accuses of trafficking in spam or unsolicited
bulk e-mail. Billions of junk e-mail messages are delivered
annually, according to e-mail experts. RBL's list is circulated to
hundreds of ISPs, universities and online organizations, who,
following RBL's advice, automatically can refuse to deliver
messages from an ISP that has been ``blackholed.''
</P>
<P>
   At various times, America Online, Microsoft Network, Real
Networks and Earthlink Network have been listed by RBL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a solution to spam,'' said John Mozena, co-founder of
Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email, of which RBL is a
member. ``But it is a valuable tool _ both in technical and public
relations terms _ for domains that want to protect themselves
against spam. No one wants to be stigmatized by being on the RBL
list.''
</P>
<P>
   But the electronic blockade often extends too far. When an ISP
is ``blackholed,'' other ISPs and corporations block all e-mail
from that ISP _ cutting off the ISP's nonspamming customers in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than be surgically precise, they are like the Sherman
Army marching to the sea,'' said Coombes, whose company has 2,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm being penalized for simply being a customer of Internet
Frontier,'' said one East Bay resident, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a month, e-mail service for dozens of Internet
Frontier customers was spotty _ until Coombes booted the offending
spammer from his online service, RBL dropped his company from its
list and other ISPs lifted their ban. Full e-mail service was
restored to Internet Frontier several days ago. Nick Nicholas,
executive director of the Mail Abuse Prevention System LLC, which
operates the Realtime Blackhole List, admitted that consumers
``unfortunately are caught in the middle.'' But he said RBL's
pressure tactics forced Internet Frontier to clean up its act.
</P>
<P>
   Counters the still-fuming Coombes: ``We are off their list not
because we dropped a customer, but because we threatened a lawsuit.
They can dress this up anyway they want, but what they are doing is
arrogant and philosophically repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Others agree that RBL is taking a radical approach _ albeit
with less vitriol than Coombes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody likes spam, and there is no easy way to stop it,'' said
Paul Hoffman, director of Internet Mail Consortium in Santa Cruz.
``So we have a situation where people are taking extreme measures
that upset a lot of individuals yet cut spam by only 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EUROSPAM: The European Parliament, meanwhile, improbably voted last
week to legalize spam over the objections of ISPs and anti-spamming
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ part of larger legislation on legal aspects of
electronic commerce _ requires that unsolicited commercial e-mail
be labeled as such in e-mail headers. &UR;  &LR; European ISPs, who rightly
accused Parliament members of being misinformed, fear that weak
laws will encourage spammers to bombard consumers with junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   Could you imagine a similar scenario in the United States? Not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There are several bills floating in Congress to curb spam
nationwide, and state laws in California, Nevada, Washington and
Virginia. Another 14 states are considering anti-spam bills.
</P>

e-mail, consider this: Online correspondence is slowly supplanting
the phone and face-to-face conversations. More than 200 million
e-mail messages travel through cyberspace every day, according to
Fortune magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Author Joy Van Skiver advises e-mailers to craft short, concise
messages that include punchy headings &UR;  &LR; and make good use of white
space. She also recommends that consumers carefully check spelling
and grammar of their e-mails to make a better impression. Van
Skiver stresses that electronic letter writers avoid long-winded
messages.
</P>
<P>

get about 50 messages a day, so make your message brief and
visually pleasing.''

 WATCH _ SF CHRON  
 Watchdog Site Keeps Its Eye on Web Auctions
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Jamie Beckett &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Mark Dodd and Rodrigo Sales are the self-styled consumer advocates
of the online auction world. When bidders and sellers have gripes,
Dodd and Sales listen.
</P>
<P>
   The pair run AuctionWatch.com, a forum where auction
participants can chat, complain and get more information about
who's buying, who's selling and who's cheating. That's made
AuctionWatch a frequent thorn in the side of eBay and other major
online auction sites, both in a watchdog role and as a gathering
spot where disgruntled customers freely air gripes.
</P>
<P>
   Its founders have plans to make the site a great deal more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to become the trusted, unbiased portal to the online
auction community,'' said Sales, the Mountain View company's
25-year-old co-founder and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The site provides free ``image hosting'' for auctions on both
eBay and Amazon, allowing sellers to post pictures to help push
their products. AuctionWatch provides the server space to store
these images.
</P>
<P>
   AuctionWatch recently added a postcard service that auction
participants can use as ``feedback.'' This rating of other users
and how they handle transactions is a key element of online auction
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers information on hundreds of online auction
sites, and it is moving to provide advice for auction participants
on such subjects as bidding strategies.
</P>
<P>
   AuctionWatch keeps the online auction houses on their toes. A
few months ago, Dodd spotted (and made his observation public) a
bazooka for sale on eBay, after the Web site had banned sales of
guns and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Auction newcomer Amazon.com has had its share of complaints on
AuctionWatch, as well, ranging from gripes about a lack of bidders
to complaints that the site is too hard to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd is the driving force behind AuctionWatch. He'd been doing
some buying and selling himself _ mostly toys and ``Star Wars''
paraphernalia _ and he noticed that there was no unbiased source of
information on the auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the business-to-individual sites didn't even allow
bidders to interact and that they used the auction format only to
increase excitement about a product and drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was bad for consumers,'' said Dodd. ``I wasn't going to
stand for that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was last spring. Dodd, a 29-year-old, self-taught
programmer and inveterate tinkerer _ as a child, he tore apart his
parents microwave and TV and put them back together _ spent a month
setting up the site. It went live in June 1998, spreading the word
via users' forums on eBay and other auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   In August, needing resources for expansion, Dodd called in his
friend Sales. The two met in 1991 through a classified ad _ Sales
was selling automobile tires. Sales then was a year away from
finishing his MBA at Stanford. The lessons about raising capital
were fresh in his mind. They raised money from angel investors,
waiting to build the company before they approached venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Sales and Dodd say the site is getting ``millions''
of page views a month and is growing by 190 percent monthly. They
won't discuss revenue, except to say it's now based primarily on
advertising, which isn't plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   The company, formerly headquartered in the apartments of its
founders, just moved to its first offices, in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   But investors say there's plenty of potential because of the
booming growth of the online auction business and because of the
need for the services AuctionWatch offers by monitoring auctions
and providing services for users.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a gigantic market, and you're going to
need somebody to do what AuctionWatch does,'' said Palo Alto money
manager Kurt Feshbach. ``These guys (AuctionWatch) are the first on
the block.''

 _ SF CHRON   Company's Trade Secrets Clash With a Judge's Need to Know 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
A company's desire to protect a secret formula collided with a
judge's interest in proving guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt last
week.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Superior Court Judge Robert Dondero decided that
he would not accept a certain type of DNA test as evidence in five
criminal trials before him because the company that sells the test
_ Perkin-Elmer Biosystems in Foster City _ refused to show him the
secret formula that supposedly makes the test foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   At Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters in Washington,
D.C., where the feds use that same test to identify criminals by
using their DNA ``fingerprints,'' spokesman Paul Bresson insisted
that the test ``has been validated in numerous studies. We'll
continue to use it, and I suspect so will most other crime labs.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dondero refused to accept previous studies, and when he
demanded that the company fully disclose its test data,
Perkin-Elmer refused. Nicky Fildes, who sells the DNA test to
police labs worldwide, explained why.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the DNA test kit is something of a shake 'n'
bake operation. The DNA sample, from a drop of blood or a speck of
skin, is mixed with chemicals provided by Perkin-Elmer.
</P>
<P>
   These chemicals do two things, she explained. The first set of
chemicals mark &UR;  &LR; 13 spots on DNA thought to be unique to each human
being _ the so-called genetic fingerprint. A second set of
chemicals reproduces these 13 DNA markers billions of times over,
producing enough material to run through an analysis machine.
</P>
<P>
   But that machine is standard lab equipment, Fildes said. The
real magic is in the chemicals in the kit. And as far as
Perkin-Elmer is concerned, that chemical recipe constitutes a trade
secret, just like the formula for Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one case where we turned over similar proprietary
information to a court in Boston, a defense expert published the
data,'' Fildes said.
</P>
<P>
   That let competitors mix up the same chemicals and undercut
Perkin-Elmer's business, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Riley, a research professor at the University of
Washington in Seattle, was the defense expert who published the
formula for an earlier Perkin-Elmer test in the Boston case Fildes
described.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a skeptic when it comes to the accuracy of DNA
fingerprinting techniques, often testifies as an expert witness for
defense lawyers trying to undermine the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Because the chemical makeup of the test kit is so essential to
assessing its validity, Riley thinks that the formulas must be
published _ even if that allows competitors to sell generic
versions at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to risk an opinion on reliability if I don't know
what are the ingredients,'' said Riley, who testified to that
effect before Dondero.
</P>
<P>
   But George Sensabaugh, a professor of forensics at the
University of California at Berkeley, said the Perkin-Elmer test _
and its secret chemical formula _ are widely accepted by academic
and crime lab scientists in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sensabaugh also testified before Dondero, on behalf of
prosecutors trying to assuage the judge's concerns. He said
Perkin-Elmer had an understandable interest in protecting its
chemical formula.
</P>
<P>
   And given the wide testing that other labs have done on
Perkin-Elmer's chemical kit, he feels the company doesn't need to
reveal every aspect of its recipe to be confident it yields
reliable results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are components in your car you don't know anything
about,'' he said. ``Your concern as a consumer is, `Does this get
me from one place to another?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BUYER'S MARKET: It's a tough time to be looking for a CEO job at a
young biotech firm, said Victor Kleinman, with the Stevenson Group
in San Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   As a headhunter with years of experience matching executives
with life sciences firms, Kleinman said companies are more
demanding when assessing qualifications and tougher when
negotiating pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking to run a company, you have to be a total
package,'' he said. That means a proven track record in science,
successful drug development, growing companies, and above all,
raising money.
</P>
<P>
   While CEO jobs at many high-tech companies can write their own
ticket, a shortage of startup capital in biotech has made companies
_ and their venture backers _ more choosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cash is so tight that boards won't look at candidates who
haven't done private financings or IPO road shows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinman said the standard package for CEOs used to be $200,000
in base pay and 3 percent of the company's stock in options. ``In
today's market, it's more like $175,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the 3 percent in stock likely will be tied to meeting
milestones _ so many shares when you complete a financing round, so
many shares when you go public, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have your sights set on a job below the executive
office, this may not be the time to pound the fist for a raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything at the top filters down,'' Kleinman said.

SITUATION GRAVE FOR UPROOTED CIVILIANS, KOSOVO REBEL LEADER CLAIMS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Hundreds of thousands of uprooted Kosovo
Albanians are huddled in woods and fields inside Kosovo under the
protection of Kosovo Liberation Army fighters, a rebel leader said
in a telephone interview Sunday from inside the embattled Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their situation is very difficult,'' said Hashim Thaci, the
rebel leader. ``The food supply is running very low, the medical
care is minimal and hygienic conditions are very bad. We have the
first signs of epidemics of various diseases among the children.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that most of the civilians were under improvised tents.
``These are pieces of plastic over the trailers of tractors or just
on the ground,'' he said. ``Many have been there since the
beginning of the Serbian campaign, basically almost two months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the telephone interview, arranged by rebel officials here in
the Albanian capital, Thaci said the area from which he was
speaking, described as being in central Kosovo, was ``relatively
under the control'' of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Neither his description of the condition of the refugees nor his
comments about the military situation could be independently
confirmed. His description of the location of the refugees seemed
generally to match one issued this afternoon at the daily NATO
military briefing in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The briefer, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz of Germany, produced maps
showing several areas in northeastern, central and southwestern
Kosovo as places where rebels were active and refugees still inside
the province were concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears some sanctuary is being provided for these poor
people,'' Jertz said.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci said that clashes were continuing between the Serbian
forces and the rebels. He said the Yugoslav forces had been able to
control or maintain road blocks on the major tarmac roads, but
contended that the Serbs had become much weaker and were not able
to carry out new offensives.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that, ``Of course, if we compare, the Yugoslav
troops are much better armed,'' Thaci maintained that the rebels
were benefiting from new recruits and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci also echoed the position of another top rebel official,
Jakup Krasniqi, that the guerrilla army would not allow itself to
be disarmed, a central tenet of the proposed peace agreement
unveiled by Western and Russian diplomats in Germany last week.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the 700,000 refugees who had left Kosovo and crossed
into Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, a high official of the U.N.
agency responsible for coordinating the relief efforts in the area
said Sunday that his agency was going broke because donor nations
had failed to make contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no cash,'' said Dennis McNamara, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees' special representative for the region.
The refugee agency and other relief agencies were caught unprepared
when ethnic Albanians began pouring over the borders at the rate of
20,000 to 40,000 a day in late March and early April.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McNamara said, his agency has drawn up a Kosovo
refugee emergency budget of $143 million through the end of June,
predicated on the arrival of some 950,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have received cash contribution of only $78 million,''
he said. ``I am extremely disappointed in donor countries.''

   JERUSALEM _ Vowing to block entry by the Israeli police, scores
of Palestinians gathered Sunday at the Palestine Liberation
Organization's headquarters in East Jerusalem as Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to close three offices in the
building forcibly.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to boost a flagging campaign little more than a week
before the Israeli elections, Netanyahu revived a longstanding
demand of the political right to move against the PLO building,
Orient House, plunging Israeli and Palestinian officials into
crisis talks to avert violence.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials have warned that closing the offices would
set off serious unrest, and the move has caused a rift between
Netanyahu and the public security minister, Avigdor Kahalani, whose
police officers would have to enforce the closure.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Netanyahu made his threat Sunday, Kahalani met with
Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem, to try
to negotiate a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Cabinet officials who approved the closing last
month debated their next steps at a late-night meeting as American
diplomats tried to mediate the crisis. Israeli security officials
reportedly told the ministers that forcibly closing the offices
could set off riots in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has made Jerusalem a rallying cry of his election
campaign, and he is pressing to close the offices on the grounds
that they are linked to the Palestinian Authority, thus violating
the Israeli-Palestinian accords and Israeli sovereignty over
Jerusalem. The Palestinians deny such links, saying the offices
belong to the Palestine Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Orient House is considered a national symbol by many
Palestinians. Netanyahu has repeatedly pressed to close it, calling
political activities there, especially meetings with foreign
diplomats, a challenge to Israeli rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians view East Jerusalem, captured by Israel from
Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, as the capital of their
hoped-for state. Israel asserts that the area will forever remain
part of its indivisible capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will shut these offices,'' Netanyahu said Sunday. ``We will
shut them down with agreement, or we will have to do it without
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahalani said he was seeking a peaceful solution. ``We are
trying to find a solution without having to go in by force, which
would create violence there,'' he said. Scores of Palestinians have
gathered at Orient House in recent days to block a forced entry by
the Israeli police, and many slept in the compound overnight.
</P>
<P>
   After signing orders that set a 7 p.m. deadline for the closing,
Kahalani played for more time. ``Why should we put a gun to the
head when it is still possible to find a way to continue living
together and continue the peace process?'' he said after meeting
with Husseini.
</P>
<P>
   As the deadline came and went, officials on both sides continued
their consultations. Husseini met with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, and with the U.S. consul general in Jerusalem,
John Herbst, urging his intervention. Dennis Ross, the State
Department's special envoy to the Middle East, spoke by phone with
Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that if there is a closure order there will be riots
everywhere,'' Husseini said. ``We want to arrive at something that
will prevent a deterioration.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio reported Sunday night that the Palestinians had
rejected an Israeli proposal that two of the offices be moved to
Abu Dis, a village just outside the Jerusalem city limits, and that
Husseini stop meeting foreign ambassadors in Orient House.
</P>
<P>
   The three offices ordered closed are a department that monitors
Israeli settlement activity; the office of international relations,
which handles contacts with foreign diplomats; and the personal
office of Husseini, who is the official responsible for Jerusalem
affairs in the PLO.

OKLAHOMANS' SPIRIT UNSHAKEN AFTER LATEST TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Their building was destroyed by last week's
killer tornado, but the spirit and faith of members of Beth Haven
Independent Baptist Church is unshaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been completely positive, nothing negative,''
said Ivan Casteel, the pastor of the small church that had stood on
Western Avenue near 119th Street, an area that sustained some of
the heaviest damage in south Oklahoma City on May 3. ``This is a
slight setback. It may be awhile, but we will rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, about 130 members of his congregation gathered at
Southwest Baptist Church, which had opened its doors so that Beth
Haven members could pray together for those who lost lives and
property.
</P>
<P>
   Two members' homes were destroyed and two were heavily damaged,
Casteel said.
</P>
<P>
   In Moore on Sunday, hundreds of people _ including Oklahoma Gov.
Frank Keating, U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts and the mayors of Oklahoma City
and Moore _ gathered at First Baptist Church to celebrate Mother's
Day and the resilience of Oklahomans.
</P>
<P>
   The large brick church is about the only building left standing
in that part of town.
</P>
<P>
   The storms that struck a week ago today spawned 76 verified
tornadoes, killed 41 people and injured more than 700. Damage was
put at about $1 billion, and 11 counties were declared federal
disaster areas. Weather officials calculated winds in excess of 300
mph, including one tornado with winds of 318 mph, the fastest ever
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Only two people remained unaccounted for Sunday, a man and a
woman. Earlier two British tourists who had been counted as
missing, John and Barbara Potten, called their son in England, who
notified the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office that they were all
right. The couple are traveling through the United States in a
recreational vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   At First Baptist Church, Keating told those in attendance that
once again the people of Oklahoma have been tested and are showing
that despite the loss of life and property, their spirit remains
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge here today is to be here together as a feeling
family,'' Keating said. ``To rebuild we have to stay together. We
will be here together as an Oklahoma family.''
</P>
<P>
   The message was the same for the displaced Beth Haven
congregation. The church will go on, Casteel said, urging
worshipers to remember others who have been affected by the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the only fish in the pond,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ester Fellin, 36, a church member whose mobile home in Bridge
Creek was destroyed by the tornado, said she and her husband and
their two children were not at home when the twister moved through
their area.
</P>
<P>
   Since it hit, the family has drawn strength from their
congregation. ``I don't know what we would have done without our
church family,'' she said before Sunday's service.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, several dozen Beth Haven members worked to clear
debris from a field next to the 5-year-old metal church building.
They raked insulation from the grass and dumped small pieces of
rubble into garbage cans. A line of large trees was to have become
a picnic area for parishioners. The trees now lay mangled, the bark
and leaves sucked from their trunks.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Kitelinger walked toward the church, seeing the damage
for the first time. She and her husband, Frank, came to join the
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news didn't do it justice,'' she said, wiping tears from
her cheeks. ``On TV, you can't see how bad it is. I'm a little
shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   The day the storm hit, about 40 church members were signed up
for a money management class that was scheduled for 7 p.m. at the
church, which is across the street from Westmoore High School and
near the Emerald Springs Apartment complex where four people died.
</P>
<P>
   About 6:30 p.m., when newscasts announced that the powerful
storm was snaking toward the church, the class was canceled and
those who hadn't yet arrived were called and told to seek shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Some were en route and were told to leave as soon as they
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes after the last person left the church, the twister
hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the tornado, Casteel has heard from nearly 100
preachers from around the country who have offered support,
including one church in Richmond, Va., that is sending two
truckloads of donated items to Beth Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Casteel said what members don't need will be passed on to others
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   And he got a call from Choctaw, a town about 30 miles northeast
of Oklahoma City, where paperwork from the church was recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Kitelinger said she and her husband visited many churches before
deciding on Beth Haven. The tornado, its victims and the rebuilding
of the church will fortify the congregation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a family,'' Kitelinger said. ``I think it will pull us
together moreso. The spirit of the Lord is here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lowe's Co.s in North Wilkesboro, N.C., the national
home-improvement retailer, has awarded its broadcast advertising
account, effective July 1, to McCann-Erickson New York.
</P>
<P>
   The account, with billings estimated at $100 million, had been
handled since 1990 by the Southfield, Mich., office of Doner.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came Friday after a 10-week review that began with
16 agencies. A list of six finalists announced in March was later
pared to McCann-Erickson and the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of
TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group.
Print campaigns continue to be handled in-house.
</P>
<P>
   McCann-Erickson, which will also handle strategic planning and
media buying for Lowe's, will work on the assignments from offices
in New York, Houston and Los Angeles and offices to be opened in
North Wilkesboro and Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising
unit of McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by the Interpublic Group

VENUS WILLIAMS WINS ITALIAN OPEN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Last week, Venus Williams became that rare American
visitor who will leave Rome wealthier than when she arrived. Now,
the next challenge for Williams, clay-court neophyte turned
clay-court master, will be to win her first Grand Slam singles
title on the same slippery surface in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of dreams, and most of them come true these
days,'' Williams told the crowd after winning the Italian Open
Sunday with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Mary Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Williams lost in the Italian final to Martina
Hingis. This year, Hingis had to settle for winning the doubles
after Williams got the best of her in Saturday's semifinals and
then did a short but satisfied victory dance on center court.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's celebration was more subdued: two long arms thrust into
the air. But the satisfaction was there for all in the Foro Italico
to see, when Williams _ braces recently removed from her teeth _
stood grinning with her trophy at the victory ceremony, saving her
first and most enthusiastic pose for her sister Serena, who was on
the court with a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Serena has had a remarkable spring, but Venus is, for now, the
young woman to beat, even on clay, a surface she had never played a
tournament on until last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think I understand it a little more,'' she said. ``I
think I've learned how to attack when I need to: to step up
sometimes and to keep the ball in play sometimes. In the past, I
didn't always know how to find the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Pierce was nursing a strained groin muscle before
Sunday's match and strained a hamstring during the match, there is
no reason to qualify what Williams has accomplished so far this
year. Since losing a quarterfinal and her composure against Lindsay
Davenport at the Australian Open, her play and results have
improved considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something is going wrong, you go out and fix it, and I went
and fixed everything that was going wrong,'' she said. ``Basically
I was making a lot of errors off the forehand, and I decided that I
would have to no longer be able to participate in that activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams has won four tournaments in 1999, more than anyone
including Hingis, who is still ranked No. 1 to Williams' No. 5, but
who did not perform like it down the stretch on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That three-set victory was Williams' first over Hingis on clay,
but what happened against Pierce was no novelty. Only last week,
Williams defeated Pierce, 6-0, 6-3, in the final of the WTA event
in Hamburg to win her first clay-court event. Pierce was treated
for a back injury during that lopsided match, and Sunday, the
hard-slugging French woman whose imposing physique is paradoxically
fragile was treated again on court.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce had strained her groin during the semifinals, and she had
a small bandage on her upper-left thigh Sunday. That did not keep
her from matching Williams' power from the baseline in the early
going, but in the third game, Pierce said that she felt a sharp
pain in her left hamstring. After repeated visits from the trainer
on changeovers, she finished the match with the entire thigh
wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was bothering me for most of my shots and
running,'' said Pierce, who won the Italian Open in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Williams served 12 aces SUnday, rushed the net intelligently and
kept her power consistently under control from the baseline,
hitting 19 winners and making only 11 unforced errors. Though
Pierce broke her serve twice, the only time Williams truly lost her
concentration came at 3-2, 0-30 in the first set when a swarm of
bees sent fans in the upper bleachers shouting and scurrying for
cover as she prepared to hit a second serve. The result was a
double-fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``When her game is on, she's tough to beat,'' Pierce said.
``She's just powerful. The way to beat her is to take it to her and
keep her running. If you give her short balls, you tend to put
yourself in a difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   While Serena travels to Germany this week with mother Oracene to
play in Berlin, Venus will fly home to Florida and resume
practicing on green clay before returning to the red at the French
Open, which begins in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of confidence in my tennis, even before I won
these two tournaments,'' Venus said. ``It's just going to be up to
me the next two weeks to train hard and maintain the same level and
come back playing even better.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prescription drugs were not a major issue when
Medicare was created in 1965, and thus never included as a benefit.
But 34 years later, medicine has been transformed by new drugs to
treat the ills of old age, from osteoporosis to heart disease, and
many of the elderly are struggling to pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has great and growing power at the grass roots,
politicians and health care advocates say, and with the goad of an
election just over the horizon, lawmakers in both parties on
Capitol Hill are suddenly working on a variety of proposals to do
something about it. The debate will be fully joined in a matter of
weeks when the Clinton administration produces its plan to overhaul
Medicare, which is expected to propose a major new drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is also widespread agreement that it will be very hard
to actually pass legislation on the issue, and not simply because
of partisan politics. Medicare, the federal health insurance
program for the elderly and the disabled, already has problems
paying for benefits over the long term; because of that, many
politicians say, any expansion of benefits must be tied to a
broader restructuring of the program, an extremely divisive
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who headed a
federal advisory commission that deadlocked over how to restructure
Medicare, put it: ``People want the goodies. They want dessert. But
you've also got to reform the system to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the 39 million people on Medicare have no
coverage for prescription drugs they use outside hospitals, and
many others with some form of private coverage have substantial
out-of-pocket costs.
</P>
<P>
   It was not hard to start a conversation about the issue at the
Berkeley Senior Center in Martinsburg, W.Va., last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My medicine bill was almost $200 last month,'' said Edith
Dennison, 82, a retired millworker who says she pays that bill out
of her Social Security check. Dorothy Baker, a friend who is also
82, said her bill was more than $100. Judy Knick pulled out a list
of her medications, pointed to one and declared, ``This is the one
that kills me _ $145 for 30 at the Wal-Mart.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers at Berkeley Senior Services, a private, nonprofit
agency that operates the center, say they have become expert at
getting the low-income elderly onto drug-company programs that
provide free medication, and patching together other forms of
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Triplett, a Berkeley outreach worker, said: ``A lot are
embarrassed or ashamed to admit that they can't afford their
prescriptions. So they go from month to month and never let anyone
know what a dire situation they're in. Sometimes their kids call
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost can be to a patient's health as well as pocketbook.
Addressing that concern, Roni Mather, a registered nurse, recently
gave a talk at the senior center about the importance of patients'
taking medication as directed, and not trying to economize by
stopping short when they feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost really comes into play with our patients,'' Ms. Mather
said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries who do have some drug coverage get it in
several ways. About a fourth of all beneficiaries had coverage
through employer-sponsored plans in 1995, according to the National
Academy of Social Insurance, a research group, while less than a
tenth bought supplemental Medigap insurance with a drug benefit,
which is substantially more expensive than a standard Medigap
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of those with coverage are either members of health
maintenance organizations that provide drug benefits, or qualify
for Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor. Thirteen states
have programs to help the lower-income elderly who are not poor
enough for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare does cover prescriptions for its beneficiaries in
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the third of all Medicare beneficiaries with no drug
coverage at all, what worries some analysts are the signs of
erosion in private coverage. The number of large companies offering
their retired employees such benefits is declining, according to
the administration. Meanwhile, some health maintenance
organizations are putting new limits on how much they will cover
for prescription drugs. Some of the elderly have lost their drug
benefits because their health maintenance organizations have pulled
out of the Medicare market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a period toward the end of last year when four
of the eight HMOs that treat seniors pulled out of my area,'' said
Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md. ``So I had a town hall meeting and a
huge crowd showed up.'' They were ``panicked,'' he said, over the
loss of prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   With coverage limited, advocates say, the out-of-pocket costs
for the elderly are substantial, because of both the rising prices
of drugs and the greater use of them. Spending on outpatient
pharmaceuticals this year is expected to average $942 per Medicare
beneficiary, roughly half paid by insurers and half paid by the
beneficiaries, according to the National Academy of Social
Insurance. About 29 percent have out-of-pocket expenses of more
than $500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jerry Avorn, a geriatrician and expert on drugs at Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston, said a Medicare patient today might
be a woman in her 70s, on medication for osteoporosis, cholesterol,
high blood pressure and depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could easily end up with bills of three or four thousand
dollars a year, primarily to prevent the occurrence of disability
in future years,'' Avorn said. ``In that light, we're really in a
new era of pharmacological therapy for the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Avorn said, ``When Medicare was first created back
in the mid-'60s, our understanding of drugs was quite different.
They were primarily used to treat acute illness and made up a small
part of the health care budget. In the three-plus decades since,
medicine has become not just about the treatment of acute disease
but about ongoing management of chronic illness, and even more
about the lowering of risk status for things like hypertension.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many advocates argue, the lack of prescription drug
coverage raises important questions of equity.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has caught fire on Capitol Hill, with both parties
promising action. But the enthusiasm masks the serious difficulties
in its path. Among the biggest questions: Should a new prescription
drug benefit cover everyone on Medicare, or just the lower-income?
How should it be paid for?
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of five possible drug benefits by the National
Academy of Social Insurance showed them adding $17 billion to $24
billion in the first year to Medicare, whose total spending is
about $200 billion a year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are keenly aware that one of the last major efforts to
expand Medicare benefits was disastrous: a 1988 law intended to
provide additional coverage for catastrophic illnesses and for
prescription drugs that was financed, in part, by a surtax on the
elderly. The backlash was so intense that it was repealed the
following year, before the drug benefit even began.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all the current maneuvering is taking place in the
shadow of the 2000 elections, in which the House, where Republicans
have only a thin majority, is considered up for grabs. Some
Republicans suggest that the Democrats are less interested in
passing legislation than in creating a campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders say they will offer a more responsible
approach to the problem. ``Republicans are working on a
prescription drug plan for seniors that will not bankrupt
Medicare,'' Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif. and chairman of the Ways and
Means Subcommittee on Health, said last week. ``The Democrats' bill
is a poison pill,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that some powerful lobbies, notably the Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America, which is fiercely opposed to
any Medicare prescripti plan that would involve government
price controls, asserting it would hinder research.
</P>
<P>
   For all of that, many analysts say that sooner or later, the
Medicare benefit package must be retrofitted for the changing
medical needs of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christine K. Cassell, chairman of the geriatrics department
at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said, ``If you were to look at the
current Medicare population, living as long as they do, and say,
`Let's design a cost-efficient but effective health care plan,'
you'd do it very differently.''

PREMIER GLEN CLARK ANOTHER POLITICIAN DEFYING THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ British Columbia Premier Glen Clark emerges
from a meeting at the provincial Legislature and spots waiting
microphones of his critics in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   He reacts with an almost cheerful defiance that is his political
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated,'' Clark
jokes. He delivers a quick sound bite, warning of ``horror and
anger'' if Alaska catches too many B.C.-bound salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has come through a firestorm reminiscent of the early days
of la liaison de Monica Lewinsky in the United States. The
premier's resignation was widely predicted after the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police raided Clark's Vancouver home two months ago,
supposedly seeking evidence in a gambling case against one of the
premier's neighbors. A BCTV television crew was tipped off, and
filmed the premier during the raid.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it was being revealed that a Clark-championed
project to build two prototype hydrofoil ferries had ballooned to
twice its original budget. The premier's conservative critics were
threatening to mount a recall campaign against all 40 provincial
legislators of the ruling New Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Clinton in January of last year: The only question
seemed to be how many days the guy had left,'' said former Premier
Dave Barrett, a political ally but no personal friend of Clark's.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Clark is still on his feet. The RCMP has downgraded
charges against Clark's neighbor. The recall campaign has
collapsed. Bad economic news was recently broken when
Louisiana-Pacific Corp. announced it would invest $283 million
(Canadian) in four new mills. As Clark's opponents tried to stage a
rally in Nanaimo Thursday, 250 supporters of his government paraded
under the banner: ``Give Us News, Not Right-Wing Propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasts still say that Clark and the New Democrats will
go down for the count in the next provincial election. He may not
even enter the ring, resigning to allow a new, untarnished premier
to lead his party into battle. Changing heads is a time-honored
formula for survival in Canadian politics.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada's maritime provinces, an old joke goes, politics is a
family tradition. Battles over separation make politics a religion
in Quebec. Politics is a business in self-satisfied, prosperous
Ontario. But in British Columbia, politics is a blood sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is played out over a land mass larger than California, Oregon
and Washington combined. Two-thirds of the province's 4 million
residents are squeezed into 3 percent of its land base, around
Vancouver and on lower Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   The political center in British Columbia is as sparsely
populated as much of the province. Parties of the left and right
face off at the polls. They confront each other daily on the floor
of the B.C. Legislature. Punches were traded at the Nanaimo rally
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its name, the opposition Liberal Party represents
conservatism, tax cutting and free enterprise, and gets heavy
backing from big business. Its contributors include the parent
companies of British Columbia's major news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats are closely tied to the 446,000-member B.C.
Federation of Labor. The ``third way'' moderation of Britain's
Labour Party and Germany's Social Democrats hasn't reached
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   The government's new budget anticipates an $890 million
(Canadian) deficit. It is heavy with health, education and
infrastructure spending designed to help jolt the province out of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, however, wants tax cuts, and is aghast
at the budget. The Clark government ``is beyond salvaging,'' says
Vancouver Mayor Philip Owen, a critic of the premier.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Polls have shown the New Democrats with as little as 18
percent of the vote. Less than 5 percent of those surveyed are
strongly positive toward Clark's performance. Controlled by
billionaire conservative media magnate Conrad Black, Vancouver's
two daily newspapers display their hostility on both news and
editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   But chances for survival are often measured by the skills of
those seeking your demise. In this respect, Clark may blessed
almost as much as Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party's leader, former Vancouver Mayor Gordon
Campbell, is stiff and ill at ease in the cut-and-thrust of British
Columbia politics. He has fumbled explanations of why Liberal Party
aides were meeting with the RCMP before its raid of the premier's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The RCMP has never clearly explained the purpose of the raid, or
how BCTV was tipped off. A highly placed former police official
told the Toronto Globe &AMP; Mail: ``What I've seen here tells me
someone is after the premier. What they've done is convict him
without a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska may even come to Clark's rescue. U.S.-Canada salmon talks
reportedly have snagged on a call by Alaska to increase its catch
of British Columbia- and Northwest-bound chinook salmon. Such a
demand, if pressed, would vindicate Clark's militant stand toward
the province's neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   In a parliamentary government, there are no set election dates.
The ruling party decides when it will face the voters. New
Democrats have until the spring of 2001 to call the election. The
date of Clark's widely predicted demise is, therefore, controlled
by Clark.

REPORTS SHOW SCIENTIST GAVE U.S. RADAR SECRETS TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(js) 
 By JEFF GERTH and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A scientist working on a classified Pentagon
project in 1997 provided China with secrets about advanced radar
technology being developed to track submarines, according to court
records and government documents.
</P>
<P>
   Submarine detection technology is jealously guarded by the
Pentagon because the Navy's ability to conceal its submarines is a
crucial military advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The information about the radar technology, which is considered
promising and has been in development for two decades, was divulged
to Chinese nuclear-weapons experts during a two-hour lecture in
Beijing in May 1997 by Peter Lee, an American scientist, court
records show. Lee was then working for TRW Inc., which had been
hired by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles wanted to charge Lee with
espionage but were unable to, in part because Navy officials in
Washington would not permit testimony about the technology in open
court, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department in Washington, having some questions of
its own, would not approve the prosecution either, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lee ended up pleading guilty to filing a false
statement about his 1997 trip to China and to divulging classified
laser data to Chinese scientists during an earlier trip to China in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the failure to prosecute Lee over the radar technology,
the case shows that the scope of Chinese espionage is broader than
the assertions of nuclear thefts at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, which officials say involved another American
scientist, Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are not known to be related. The submarine
technology in the Peter Lee case was developed at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, a weapons lab in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Peter Lee case is also significant because it clearly
demonstrates that the American government believed that China was
successfully engaged in espionage _ obtaining American defense
secrets _ during President Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   While the Los Alamos disclosures earlier this year prompted an
array of investigations, Clinton, two months ago, said no one had
brought suspicions of Chinese espionage to him and administration
officials initially portrayed the problem as one confined to
earlier administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Today on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press,'' Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged that there had been
espionage by China during the Clinton administration, but he did
not go into detail.
</P>
<P>
   The breach involved in the Peter Lee case _ code-named Royal
Tourist by the FBI _ occurred in 1997, a point made in a classified
November 1998 counterintelligence report ordered by and then sent
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my desire and the desire of my office and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to pursue espionage counts,'' the
prosecutor in the Peter Lee case, Jonathan S. Shapiro, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at Lee's sentencing on March 26, 1998, Shapiro told the
judge that Lee's activities struck at the heart of national
security, according to witnesses at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee and his lawyer argued that the Taiwanese-American
scientist had simply made egregious mistakes and never intended to
help a foreign country or harm the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The judge declined to put Lee in prison and sentenced him to 12
months in a halfway house with three years' probation and a fine of
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Tom Jurkowsky, a Navy spokesman, said, ``The Navy
cooperated fully with the FBI from the start to the finish in their
investigation.'' Jurkowsky declined to comment on whether the Navy
prevented prosecutors in the Peter Lee case to use information
about the anti-submarine warfare technology in open court.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department spokesman, Myron Marlin, said: ``The
matter was handled in a way in which many parties had a chance to
make their views known. In a case of this nature, we obviously
cannot go into details, but there are often a number of reasons as
to why a certain course of action is taken.''
</P>
<P>
   The November 1998 counterintelligence report citing the Peter
Lee case was part of a comprehensive review ordered by President
Clinton as part of his effort to improve security at U.S. weapons
laboratories, which are run by the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   That report states that as late as 1997, Lee had ``provided
China with classified information.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, was briefed
about the Peter Lee case by Energy Department intelligence
officials in July 1997. Berger's spokesman, David Leavy, declined
to say when Clinton first learned about Lee's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Counterintelligence agents from the FBI watched Peter Lee from
the early 1980s, officials said. But the bureau did not prevent Lee
from traveling to Beijing in 1997 to discuss his work on
anti-submarine warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Lee failed to report his trip to superiors at his company, TRW,
who did not know about it until informed by the FBI, court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's 1997 decision not to approve the
espionage prosecution of Lee contrasts with some spy cases
involving the former Soviet Union or Israel in which ways were
found to protect secrets and bring charges.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 decision not to prosecute came a few months after the
Justice Department turned down a request from the FBI to put a
covert wiretap on Wen Ho Lee, then a scientist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congress and the Justice Department are examining how the
Wen Ho Lee case was handled as a result of recent assertions that
he transferred more than 1,000 classified files containing a
virtual history of American nuclear-weapons development to an
unsecure computer system at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Wen Ho Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher of Los Angeles,
denied any wrongdoing by his client.
</P>
<P>
   The Peter Lee case and the investigation of Wen Ho Lee figure in
a secret congressional report soon to be released in part by a
committee led by Rep. Christopher Cox of California.
</P>
<P>
   The technology at issue in the Peter Lee case involves a radar
ocean imaging program developed in cooperation with Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The former manager of the program, Richard Twogood, said in an
interview that because the project was still in the developmental
stage, there was a debate in the government over its significance.
</P>
<P>
   Some see it as vital to American national security, since
submarines and anti-submarine warfare are crucial to the defense of
the United States. But others are uncertain about how useful the
technology will prove to be, according to Twogood.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear how immediately valuable the
submarine-detection technology would have been to the Chinese.
China does not have a strong navy and has only a modest submarine
fleet, but it has been looking for ways to improve its military
power at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Twogood told the FBI that the information Peter Lee provided the
Chinese in 1997 was ``classified and sensitive,'' court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   The radar program seeks to detect the physical traces, briefly
left as signatures on water surfaces, of the undersea motions of
submarines. Remote sensing devices located, for example, on an
airplane pick up the traces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy has invested a lot in this area for 20 years and so
by definition that implies it's important,'' said Twogood,
currently the deputy associate director for electronic engineering
at Lawrence Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union worked hard to develop this technology during
the Cold War. Recent American advances suggested that Soviet
assertions of success in anti-submarine measures should be taken
more seriously, Twogood told Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has made considerable efforts over the years
to make sure its submarines are difficult to detect.
Ballistic-missile submarines form a critical part of the American
nuclear arsenal, and are especially valuable because they are
extremely difficult to track when submerged.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines also are used to attack an enemy's surface ships and
submarines and increasingly to launch other long range weapons,
like cruise missiles with conventional warheads.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Peter Lee was born in China in 1939. His father was an ardent
anti-Communist and moved his family to Taiwan in 1951. They later
immigrated to the United States. Lee became a naturalized citizen
in 1975 after graduating from California Institute of Technology
with a Ph.D in aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1984, he worked as a physicist in a program at
Lawrence Livermore that specialized in the use of laser power to
initiate nuclear reactions. In 1985, he moved to Los Alamos, where
he worked on the laser program as a contract employee.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1985, Lee met with top Chinese nuclear scientists,
where he twice divulged secrets about his laser work and
``discussed problems the United States was having in its nuclear
weapons testing simulation program,'' according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had traveled to China with a group of scientists at the
invitation of a Chinese visitor to his laboratory. Lee was supposed
to act as a translator for the American delegation, according to
the 1998 report on threats to the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Lee later told the bureau that on or about Jan. 9, 1985, in a
Beijing hotel room, a Chinese nuclear-weapons scientist asked for
Lee's help, saying that China was a ``poor country.'' Lee told the
FBI, according to court records, that he decided to help because he
wanted to bring China's scientific capabilities ``closer to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese scientist drew a diagram and asked Lee questions
about his laser research, according to court records filed in
connection with his sentencing. Lee said he responded with detailed
answers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Lee was picked up at his hotel and driven to
another hotel to meet a group of Chinese scientists. He answered
their questions for two hours, drawing diagrams and providing
specific mathematical and experimental results related to laser
fusion research.
</P>
<P>
   The laser fusion research that he gave to the Chinese was
declassified by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary in 1993, prompting
several of Lee's former colleagues to recommend a lenient sentence
to the sentencing judge.
</P>
<P>
   Lee stayed at Los Alamos until 1991, when he went to the space
and electronics group of TRW Inc., in Redondo Beach, Calif. At TRW
he worked on the classified radar imaging research program, which
was financed by the Pentagon, but managed by Lawrence Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 or 1995, Lee applied for another job at Los Alamos, but
the FBI, having intensified its investigation of Lee, warned the
Energy Department of its counterintelligence concerns, and,
according to one official, Lee's application was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, Lee made a three-week trip to China as a
paid guest of China's Institute of Applied Physics and
Computational Mathematics, which handles the design of China's
nuclear weapons, according to an FBI affidavit filed in Lee's case.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit was based in part on what it called Lee's
``confession'' in interviews with FBI officials from October 1997
to early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lee filed a report with his company, TRW, saying that he planned
to travel to China only for sightseeing and pleasure. But before he
left, he contacted a Chinese scientist to tell him that he would be
giving lectures on laser and nuclear energy at several Chinese
institutes, the affidavit states.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also sent a message that there was another subject that he
planned to lecture on and discuss with Chinese scientists, but
would only discuss it after he arrived in China. Lee's lawyer,
James Henderson, said in an interview that Lee never intended to
spy and has been hurt by insinuations he did.
</P>
<P>
   While in Beijing on May 11, 1997, he gave a lecture about his
work on the radar ocean imaging project at the Institute of Applied
Physics and Computational Mathematics to a group that included
Chinese nuclear-weapons scientists.
</P>
<P>
   He was questioned about its applications for anti-submarine
warfare, and showed the audience a surface ship wake image that he
had brought with him from his lab. After a two-hour, detailed
discussion of the physics of his work and its submarine
applications, he tore the ship wake image ``to shreds'' after
leaving the meeting, Lee told the FBI, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee initially admitted his encounters in China and his
false statement about his travel, the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles believed it could move forward with an espionage case,
law-enforcement officials said. But any indictment required
approval from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A series of meetings and phone calls ensued in the fall of 1997
involving lawyers in Los Angeles and top Justice and Pentagon
officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Navy took varying positions, but officials
said that in the end the Navy refused to let prosecutors disclose
information about the submarine detection technology in open court.
``The Navy was adamant in protecting the information,'' said an
official.
</P>
<P>
   So Shapiro, the prosecutor, lacked a crucial component of an
espionage case, a witness to testify about the classified nature of
the information. He then negotiated a plea bargain. And on Dec. 5,
1997, the U.S. attorney's office filed a two-paragraph criminal
information against Lee in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California, ending a 15-year FBI investigation.

   Yeah, it could be revisionist memory taking hold. But I'm
reasonably sure the general population felt a sense of obligation
toward the mentally challenged in those days. They weren't
``mainstreamed'' as much, but we had lots of opportunities to
encounter them: at church, the grocery store, the playground. If we
spoke to them, it was politely and protectively. Even the bully
caste, which taunted any easy prey, held back.
</P>
<P>
   My memory got some validation Friday when I read a review of
Monday night's ABC movie, ``Our Guys''. In it, Bernard Lefkowitz,
author of the book on which the film is based, says that, in the
small town where he grew up, there was a mentally impaired guy who
clearly was different. But he wasn't scorned, he wasn't ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this sense in the town,'' Lefkowitz says, ``that he
was the responsibility of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   That got me thinking about more recent times, not the '50s but
the '80s, when I was living in a small town that could have modeled
for ``Leave It to Beaver.'' This town also had a ``different''
fellow, a guy named Preach. He spoke gibberish, but he was very
aware, and he was everywhere. Little League games. City council
meetings. The courthouse on election night. Helping out at the
funeral home. Walking Main Street at all hours.
</P>
<P>
   Preach dragged one leg as he ambled, but he probably covered
five miles a day. Maybe 10. The cops gave him a badge, made him one
of the gang. Preach couldn't read, but each day he'd pick up a copy
of the newspaper and deliver it to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a slice of small-town America I think about often. If
Preach wasn't at the council meeting, we'd worry. If he didn't show
up at the newspaper office, we'd ask around. We loved him. He was
our guy.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes ``Our Guys'' so disturbing. It's the story of a
17-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by a group of high
school football players in 1989 in the comfortable, suburban
enclave of Glen Ridge, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you remember. After the story leaked, the town circled
the wagons and rallied. Not around the victim, who had the mental
capacity of an 8-year-old, but around the boys who had been
accused. They were the town's BMOCs, its high-achieving
celebrities. Surely, it was all a mistake. Or, if they actually had
done the things alleged _ unspeakable, acts involving a baseball
bat and a broomstick _ then the girl was probably to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Several years after the attack, justice was served, to a degree.
Yet ``Our Guys'' is a powerful reminder, especially in light of
events like those in Littleton, Colo., that the communal
``responsibility'' Lefkowitz and I seem to remember isn't a
universal given anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it never was, but I'll hold onto my memories just the
same, thanks. ``Our Guys'' isn't a great film, but Heather
Matarazzo's portrayal of the young victim is worth watching, if
only to get an idea of who's really of diminished capacity in cases
like Glen Ridge's.

INTELLIGENCE FAILURE CAUSED `MISTAKEN IDENTITY' IN EMBASSY
BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, was
struck by long-range, satellite-guided bombs and identified not by
a pilot but by intelligence analysts who routinely use grainy
reconnaissance photographs to chose their targets, with apparently
little or no vetting from anyone on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   With an investigation under way and NATO still blaming the CIA
for picking the wrong target, American officials said Sunday that
something obviously went horribly awry in translating the street
address of the intended target from the military's airborne
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The intended target was the headquarters of a Yugoslav arms
agency, picked because intelligence agencies have long suspected
that it helped rivals of America to develop advanced weapons,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   From these reconnaissance photographs, which are used routinely
in choosing targets, the analysts apparently picked the Chinese
Embassy for attack, even though the two buildings are about 200
yards apart and look nothing alike on the ground. In an aerial
photograph the two buildings could look similar.
</P>
<P>
   Deriving geographic coordinates from the images, the analysts
apparently plugged the wrong target into the bombs' navigational
system, officials said. The bombs, which were dropped by a stealth
B-2 bomber, flew precisely to their assigned point, guided along
the way by constantly updated radio signals from a constellation of
Navstar global positioning satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence failure led to a deadly case of mistaken
identity that killed at least three people and wounded 20. While
NATO spared Belgrade from bombing overnight Sunday, officials said
that military targets there had not been taken off the bombing
list.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Defense Secretary William Cohen and the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, faxed an unusual
joint statement to news organizations insisting that neither pilot
error or mechanical failure was to blame. Instead, they said, the
bombing was ``an anomaly that is unlikely to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, faulty information led to a mistake in the initial
targeting of this facility,'' the statement said. ``In addition,
the extensive process in place used to select and validate targets
did not correct this original error.''
</P>
<P>
   But with no further explanation than that for the accident, the
opaque statement gave no evidence for why American and NATO
officials are sure this will not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got confidence in the process and we're going to
continue to target,'' Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander,
said on the ABC News program ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pentagon and intelligence officials refusing to say
anything more about the mishap other than that it was under
investigation, these questions are still unanswered: Who was
involved in the initial targeting? What safeguards are in place to
validate targets? How were the two buildings confused?
</P>
<P>
   Several intelligence experts expressed dismay at such an
intelligence blunder. ``I'm absolutely dumbfounded,'' said one
senior retired American officer with extensive experience in
picking targets. ``They should have known long before this conflict
where that agency was located.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence experts said Sunday that the accident also raised
questions about the wisdom of the government's decision in 1996 to
fold the CIA's photographic intelligence center into a new Pentagon
agency, a move that prompted many of the agency's most experienced
analysts to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, NATO's track record in the seven-week air war has been
pretty good. After more than 5,000 bombing missions that have used
more than 15,000 missiles and bombs, there have been relatively few
mistakes, largely because of political constraints imposed on both
targets and pilots' tactics to avoid downed aviators and civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began its strikes on March 24 with a list of about 100
targets, allied officials said. Most of those targets were selected
by military aides to Clark, working with military planners in
Belgium, Germany and Italy and with a special set of aides to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the CIA also plays an important role, military officials
said. In fact, the targeting information for Serbian targets bombed
in Bosnia in 1995 was produced by the CIA's Balkans task force,
intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The target list is constantly being revised, with sites added or
dropped based on new intelligence and battlefield assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Once a target is identified for its military value, it is
checked and cross-checked for possible risks to civilians. ``Each
target has an assessment of high, medium or low collateral
damage,'' said one senior Air Force general, using the military
term for civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive targets, including the arms agency's
headquarters, require President Clinton's review and approval,
administration officials said. The intended target on Friday night,
the federal directorate of supply and procurement, has long been
suspected by the CIA of helping American rivals to develop advanced
weapons. American intelligence officials say Yugoslavia has a
rudimentary chemical weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say the CIA picked the headquarters building, but
American officials acknowledged that NATO, the U.S. European
Command and the Pentagon's Joint Staff all reviewed and approved
it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   From the grainy airborne reconnaissance photographs of downtown
Belgrade that NATO military planners use to identify bombing
targets, the Chinese Embassy and a headquarters for a Yugoslav arms
agency situated nearby look very similar: same size, shape and
height.
</P>
<P>
   But at street level, there is no mistaking the embassy's marble
structure with blue mirrored glass, flying the distinctive Chinese
flag, from the Yugoslav military's white office building on the
other side of a major thoroughfare, Lenjinov Bulevar (Lenin
Boulevard).
</P>
<P>
   The address of the Chinese Embassy is No. 3, Ulica Tresnjevog
Cveta (or Cherry Blossom Street), and lies north of Lenjinov
Bulevar, the main highway running through New Belgrade. The address
of the arms agency headquarters is No. 2, Bulevar Umetnosti (or
Boulevard of the Arts), which lies south of Lenjinov Bulevar.
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings were constructed two to three years ago. The arms
agency building is five stories high, a square, white stone or
concrete building, with a new wing under construction. The Chinese
Embassy is roughly five floors high, has a curved north end, and a
separate residence building at the back. The compound, with garden
at the back and parking for cars north and south, is encircled by a
heavy metal fence.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy underscores the
obvious limitations on the Pentagon's high-technology weaponry: The
thousands of precision-guided bombs and missiles are only as good
as the intelligence on which their targets are based.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Brig. Gen. Leroy Barnidge, commander of the Air
Force's B-2 wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, told
reporters that after more than 40 B-2 missions, ``everything had
gone where it's supposed to go and hit what it was supposed to
hit.``
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, that was also true Friday night. The B-2, carrying
up to 16 satellite-guided bombs called joint direct attack
munitions, carried out its assigned mission and hit its assigned
building with at least three of the bombs, American officials said
Sunday. Six Air Force B-2s had dropped more than 500 of the bombs
during the air campaign, Barnidge said last week.

ANTI-U.S. PROTESTS MOUNT IN CHINA AS OFFICIALS STUDY BOMBING
ERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ American diplomats said they felt like hostages in
their offices Sunday as tens of thousands of furious demonstrators
marched for the second day to protest NATO's bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade and pelted embassy buildings with eggs, stones,
paint balloons and chunks of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's demonstrations dwarfed similar protests held Saturday
because a large number of Beijingers flocked to the embassy
district to join student delegations from dozens of universities.
Some came merely to see the scene, many more to march, to sing and,
above all, to vent their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month after Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to the
United States, many of the protesters carried home-made signs
carrying thoughts like ``Blood for Blood'' or American flags marked
with tiny swastikas instead of stars. Some of the protesters
screamed insults at people they identified as American and one
American television journalist was hit on the head as she delivered
a live report.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration scrambled to limit the damage the
embassy bombing may do to a long-term relationship already battered
by differences over trade and human rights and charges of
espionage. President Clinton sent President Jiang Zemin a letter to
express condolences and lay out NATO's case against Yugoslavia, a
White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither that letter nor a statement of deep regret from the
embassy here were publicized in Beijing, where long double rows of
unarmed policemen locking arms stood in front of both the British
and U.S. embassies, and for the most part prevented protesters from
entering. But the policeman did nothing to discourage or stop the
rain of objects hurled from the street; a few even snapped
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the imposing facade of the embassy's old stone
office building had been thoroughly defaced, its windows broken,
signs stolen, and its facade covered with splotches of red and blue
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Protests also occurred in a number of other cities over the
weekend, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and the
southwestern city of Chengdu, where the U.S. consul general's home
was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``'The embassy compounds are still under siege and today was
worse, at times much worse, than yesterday,'' said Bill Palmer, an
embassy spokesman in Beijing who said he was ``stuck'' in one of
the mission's buildings Sunday evening. ``We feel like we're
hostages. We can not come and go safely because of inadequate
Chinese security.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Vice President Hu Jintao gave an unusual live
television address in which he both endorsed the demonstrations and
cautioned against extremes, reflecting the government's desire to
maintain control while not alienating what is clearly a popular
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government firmly supports and protects, in
accordance with the law, all legal protest activities,'' he said.
But he added: ``We must prevent overreaction and insure social
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador in Beijing, James Sasser, and the embassy
staff on Sunday issued a statement expressing sorrow at the
bombing. The statement was not yet carried in Chinese news reports.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The protest Sunday was an odd amalgam of extreme order and total
chaos, as tens of thousands of protesters marched the circuitous
half-mile protest route designated by the People's Armed Police,
passing the British and U.S. embassy compounds.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon on a glorious spring day, thousands of
protesters waited in line to enter the densely packed, slow moving
river of people that moved along the protest route, as if awaiting
admission to some outdoor rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations of several hundred students from schools like the
Beijing Chemical University and the Beijing College of Fashion
entered the route chanting angry slogans: ``American Killers'' and
``Revenge.'' A number had brought along rocks to throw at the
embassies. And the crowd applauded as protesters burned American
flags.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the protesters carried pictures of the two
journalists killed in the Chinese embassy bombing. The third victim
was the wife of one of the journalists. The bodies are likely to be
returned to China on Tuesday, possibly provoking a further public
outpouring of rage.
</P>
<P>
   Students took turns taking photos of each other. ``After the
bombing of the embassy, I feel more than ever that America is an
international bully,'' said Zhang Xingxing, a 20-year-old student
wearing a headband that read ``inexcusable murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Saturday's protesters, who were nearly all students,
Sunday's crowds included businessmen, lawyers, teachers and mothers
with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the news on the radio while riding in a taxi, and my
shock quickly turned to disbelief, then outrage,'' said Ding Ming,
26, an outgoing young man in a polo shirt who works for an
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Ding came to the embassy Saturday night with friends and then
again Sunday with his girlfriend. ``We just walked about _ we do
not throw rocks and bottles,'' he said. ``Yes, there were some in
the crowd who went to extremes, but most people here are sensible.
They know their issue is with the American government and still
have friendly feelings towards the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The police generally kept the crowd moving but allowed stops in
front of both the British and U.S. embassies, where the protesters
often turned aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon at the British Embassy, one student got through
police lines to scale the wall of the elegant red building and
lowered the Union Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But the featured stop was clearly the No. 3 Compound of the U.S.
Embassy, which houses the offices of top embassy officials,
including the ambassador. The paint-stained building looked like an
amusement park target. In the dense crowd, groups of young men set
off firecrackers, broke up pieces of sidewalk to use as missiles,
begged police officers to let them in to steal the American flag
and gawked at the battered cars that remained in a nearby embassy
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The People's Armed Police have told U.S. officials here that
they will insure that the protesters do not get into the embassy
grounds, but make no other guarantees, said Palmer, the embassy
spokesman. He said that his office has more than a dozen holes in
its windows and an equal number of chunks of concrete on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   An American student living in China, Shuan Rein, said he was
beaten by a group of protesting Chinese workers in front of the
U.S. Embassy gate when he tried to explain that the Americans were
sorry about the bombing. Students rescued him and the police took
him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stone throwing is understandable because what was
done is intolerable, so I understand why people are driven to
extreme reprisals,'' said Ding Rong, a 29-year-old industrial
designer, who said she came because she attended the same
elementary school as one of the slain reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At various moments during the afternoon, Cuban diplomats,
apparently buoyed by such a fervent resurgence of anti-American
sentiment in China, held up huge photographs of Castro shaking
hands with Jiang. They shouted ``Long live socialism. Down with
America. Long live China,'' and crowds returned the refrain.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the protests said they would most likely return to their
studies or jobs on Monday. They were uncertain of exactly what they
wanted from NATO or the United States, but yearned for some kind of
revenge. Placards carried messages like ``Hang Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Ding Rong said that she hoped the protest would both humble the
Americans and encourage China's leaders to protest more forcefully
against the bombing. Others said they merely sought an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to offer a fair and sincere apology and to
thoroughly investigate the matter,'' said Ding Ming. ``It seems
unbelievable that three bombs could fall on a foreign embassy by
mistake.''

BELGRADE IS SPARED BOMBING FOR A NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO spared Belgrade from bombing overnight
Sunday, but said military targets there had not been taken off the
bombing list despite Friday's mistaken attack against the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military and civilian spokesmen blamed a failure by U.S.
and allied intelligence to determine the correct location of a
Yugoslav military supply headquarters that an American plane was
assigned to bomb for the error. The location the pilot was given
was in fact the spot where the embassy was built several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The error started in the intelligence gathering process,''
Jamie P. Shea, NATO's spokesman, said. ``It obviously went through
the system and was not identified.'' But he continued: ``We are not
going to be intimidated into stopping the bombing. The air campaign
is going to go on until Serb forces leave Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that a joint statement issued late Saturday in
Washington by Defense Secretary Bill Cohen and the director of
central intelligence, George J. Tenet, represented all that the
allies were likely to say in public about the reason for the
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   NATO apologized Saturday to the Chinese authorities for the
error and for the three deaths and 20 injuries it caused.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany plans to express regrets in
person when he visits Beijing later this week, according to
diplomats here.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO planes struck no targets in Belgrade in the 24 hours
up to 9 a.m. Sunday, the 47th day in the allied bombing campaign to
stop attacks by the forces of President Slobodan Milosevic of
Yugoslavia on the ethnic Albanian civilian population of Kosovo, a
senior diplomat said the allies had not ordered military commanders
to halt strikes on the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general sentiment was that we have to stay the course,''
the diplomat said, though allied ambassadors told military
commanders to exercise extra care in the target-selection process
to guard against any repetition of the error in hitting the Chinese
Embassy. The allied representatives here also asked Gen. Wesley K.
Clark, the military commander, to report to them personally this
week on the incident and on the progress of the bombing operations.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said its planes had flown more than 500 missions and bombed
targets throughout Serbia on Sunday despite poor weather, hitting
airfields at Nis, Pristina and Sjnenica, three bridges, and radio
and television transmitter sites at nine locations as well as
military barracks at Kragujevac and Valjevo and oil storage sites
at Lopatnica and Nis.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the command said, pilots had bombed Yugoslav
artillery positions near the Albanian border west of Djakovica, and
11 artillery and mortar positions near the Macedonian border.
Allied bombers also hit Yugoslav troop positions and, elsewhere in
the province, they bombed reinforced military shelters, armored
vehicles, trucks and a command post.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the bombing in Kosovo this month, an allied
military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz of Germany, said Sunday
that Yugoslav forces in the province had been pinned down and were
now increasingly unable to conduct the sweeps that have driven
hundreds of thousands of civilians from the province over the last
month and a half.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the bombing drove Yugoslav military units into hiding, Jertz
said, there had been a resurgence of activity by the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that our operations may be allowing them to provide
some protection for their kinfolk,'' Jertz said, although he added,
using the Albanian initials for the KLA: ``We are not the air force
of the UCK We are not supporting the UCK, either directly or
indirectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the allies' assertion that the bombing had slowed down
Yugoslav attacks, Shea said that 5,000 more refugees, most of them
from the city of Pec in western Kosovo, had poured across the
border into Albania Saturday and that 4,000 were expected there
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy Friday, the
allies had reached general agreement with Russia on the outlines of
a possible diplomatic solution that would end the fighting and
allow all the refugees to return to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A senior diplomat said that the allies hoped to keep up momentum
this week when Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott flies to
Moscow on Tuesday for two days of talks with Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   The allies hope that Russia will eventually agree to a U.N.
Security Council resolution authorizing an international military
force to move into Kosovo.

PREMIER GLEN CLARK ANOTHER POLITICIAN DEFYING THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ British Columbia Premier Glen Clark emerges
from a meeting at the provincial Legislature and spots waiting
microphones of his critics in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   He reacts with an almost cheerful defiance that is his political
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated,'' Clark
jokes. He delivers a quick sound bite, warning of ``horror and
anger'' if Alaska catches too many B.C.-bound salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has come through a firestorm reminiscent of the early days
of la liaison de Monica Lewinsky in the United States. The
premier's resignation was widely predicted after the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police raided Clark's Vancouver home two months ago,
supposedly seeking evidence in a gambling case against one of the
premier's neighbors. A BCTV television crew was tipped off, and
filmed the premier during the raid.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it was being revealed that a Clark-championed
project to build two prototype hydrofoil ferries had ballooned to
twice its original budget. The premier's conservative critics were
threatening to mount a recall campaign against all 40 provincial
legislators of the ruling New Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Clinton in January of last year: The only question
seemed to be how many days the guy had left,'' said former Premier
Dave Barrett, a political ally but no personal friend of Clark's.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Clark is still on his feet. The RCMP has downgraded
charges against Clark's neighbor. The recall campaign has
collapsed. Bad economic news was recently broken when
Louisiana-Pacific Corp. announced it would invest $283 million
(Canadian) in four new mills. As Clark's opponents tried to stage a
rally in Nanaimo Thursday, 250 supporters of his government paraded
under the banner: ``Give Us News, Not Right-Wing Propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasts still say that Clark and the New Democrats will
go down for the count in the next provincial election. He may not
even enter the ring, resigning to allow a new, untarnished premier
to lead his party into battle. Changing heads is a time-honored
formula for survival in Canadian politics.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada's maritime provinces, an old joke goes, politics is a
family tradition. Battles over separation make politics a religion
in Quebec. Politics is a business in self-satisfied, prosperous
Ontario. But in British Columbia, politics is a blood sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is played out over a land mass larger than California, Oregon
and Washington combined. Two-thirds of the province's 4 million
residents are squeezed into 3 percent of its land base, around
Vancouver and on lower Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   The political center in British Columbia is as sparsely
populated as much of the province. Parties of the left and right
face off at the polls. They confront each other daily on the floor
of the B.C. Legislature. Punches were traded at the Nanaimo rally
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its name, the opposition Liberal Party represents
conservatism, tax cutting and free enterprise, and gets heavy
backing from big business. Its contributors include the parent
companies of British Columbia's major news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats are closely tied to the 446,000-member B.C.
Federation of Labor. The ``third way'' moderation of Britain's
Labour Party and Germany's Social Democrats hasn't reached
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   The government's new budget anticipates an $890 million
(Canadian) deficit. It is heavy with health, education and
infrastructure spending designed to help jolt the province out of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, however, wants tax cuts, and is aghast
at the budget. The Clark government ``is beyond salvaging,'' says
Vancouver Mayor Philip Owen, a critic of the premier.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Polls have shown the New Democrats with as little as 18
percent of the vote. Less than 5 percent of those surveyed are
strongly positive toward Clark's performance. Controlled by
billionaire conservative media magnate Conrad Black, Vancouver's
two daily newspapers display their hostility on both news and
editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   But chances for survival are often measured by the skills of
those seeking your demise. In this respect, Clark may blessed
almost as much as Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party's leader, former Vancouver Mayor Gordon
Campbell, is stiff and ill at ease in the cut-and-thrust of British
Columbia politics. He has fumbled explanations of why Liberal Party
aides were meeting with the RCMP before its raid of the premier's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The RCMP has never clearly explained the purpose of the raid, or
how BCTV was tipped off. A highly placed former police official
told the Toronto Globe &AMP; Mail: ``What I've seen here tells me
someone is after the premier. What they've done is convict him
without a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska may even come to Clark's rescue. U.S.-Canada salmon talks
reportedly have snagged on a call by Alaska to increase its catch
of British Columbia- and Northwest-bound chinook salmon. Such a
demand, if pressed, would vindicate Clark's militant stand toward
the province's neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   In a parliamentary government, there are no set election dates.
The ruling party decides when it will face the voters. New
Democrats have until the spring of 2001 to call the election. The
date of Clark's widely predicted demise is, therefore, controlled
by Clark.

   Ohio churches high on Rocky Mountain prayer, worldwide
spirituality
</P>
<P>
   By Charlise Lyles
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo. _ This parched mountain valley at the
foot of Pikes Peak is the new epicenter of American power
evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   At its core is an unprecedented urgency about prayer.
</P>
<P>
   It radiates from dozens of Christian ministries such as the
conservative Focus on the Family, major promoters of the National
Day of Prayer, as well as the newly opened World Prayer Center,
Intercessors International and the Promise Keepers, farther north
in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   As the millennium comes to a close, their message has penetrated
sanctuaries throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   These so-called ``parachurch ministries'' have taken prayer high
tech so that local churches can log on to the Prayer Room Network
and receive prayer request from people they may never talk to or
see.
</P>
<P>
   They've compelled Terri Sebree, a member of Dayton, Ohio's New
Covenant Church, to promote $10 Adopt-a-Leader kits to faithful who
wish to pray for city commissioners, state legislators or
congressional representatives.
</P>
<P>
   They've convinced Centerville, Ohio teen-agers Jennifer Knoll
and Lindsay Swift that they have ``a talent for prayer'' and should
fill out applications to become intercessors, praying for people
they do not know.
</P>
<P>
   And they have declared Dayton one of several ``strategic
cities'' ripe for millennial revival.
</P>
<P>
   The ministries have migrated to these mountains from across the
country, many from California, lured by the Lord, most of their
spokespeople will tell you. But beauty, quality of life, lower cost
of living and state tax incentives for nonprofit agencies are also
part of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, scores of Dayton churches have tuned in to
the Rocky Mountain prayer high and global evangelical movement.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Forrest Schwalm of Fairhaven Church in Centerville stays
tuned in to Colorado Springs ministries that sponsor programs such
as Prayer Track AD 2000, which aims to evangelize ``unreached
people'' by the century's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Prayer Center is going to have a growing influence
on prayer all over the United States,'' said Schwalm. ``It's going
to provide up-to-the-minute prayer requests and needs all over the
world. As a result of their hookups, you'll be able to pray for
people all over the world in seconds. ``There's an awareness that
the whole communications technology explosion has affected
Christians and Christian prayer life. People are aware of more info
and all of that contributes toward a prayer movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, says Schwalm and other evangelicals, is a sense of
millennial urgency and mission about prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Prayer Central
</P>
<P>
   The steep curves of Highway 83 here could easily be dubbed the
highway to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   In between sleek Ford Aerospace buildings and a U.S. Olympic
Committee facility rise brand-new structures that will house
offices for expanding ministries. Just as you reach a summit, a
stucco semicircular fortress seems to rise out of the mountainside
like a mirage. Flags of 54 countries snap in the breeze above it.
This is the World Prayer Center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Pastor Ted Haggard was a 27-year-old up-and-coming
minister from York, Ind., praying and fasting on a Colorado
mountainside when he had a few visions. One revealed to him a place
where people could pray for global evangelism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just to pray.'' he said. ``This is where we connect
a global network of intercessors; we would link prayer
organizations all around the globe. And I saw a person standing
inside a globe praying. That's why the building is inside a circle
of flags. I saw a person go up to a kiosk and punch in how long he
had prayed and what he wanted to pray about.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard's New Life Church donated $3 million and 2.2 acres for
the center. Evangelist C. Peter Wagner of Global Harvest
Ministries, which is located in the center, raised another $2.5
million to cover the total price tag, $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   It opened in September 1998. Fourteen-foot floor-to-ceiling
windows reveal a panorama of Pikes Peak. Suspended from the
auditorium ceiling is a 2,200-pound transparent globe, 15 feet in
diameter, that rotates every hour. Underneath the building are six
miles of wiring and conduits. There's also a conference center; its
65-plus rooms include 10 ``extended prayer suites'' for overnight
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   A global network
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry about that, but we have very sensitive security
information in here,'' Faith, the receptionist, apologizes as a
door clicks locked behind a visitor entering the World Prayer
Center's inner sanctum.
</P>
<P>
   Inside is the computerized nerve center of world evangelism,
where prayer requests are categorized, coded, and in some cases,
secretly disseminated to intercessors.
</P>
<P>
   Using e-mail, faxes and a burgeoning Christian church computer
network, the center plans to link prayer requests from around the
world with millions of volunteers willing to pray for them. Derrick
Trimble staffs ``The Observatory,'' headquarters of the Prayer Room
Network and a cyber-cafe, a low-light, mauve-colored room with bar
stools and a bank of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who feel called to pray for others can log on to a server
here that will provide them prayer concerns on any topic from
personal to public. They can talk to missionaries or intercessors
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an international connecting point. We connect prayer
points,'' explains Trimble, a soft-spoken man of 39 in horn-rimmed
glasses seated behind a laptop computer. ``There are strategic
prayer concerns. We categorize them based on urgency and
sensitivity. In many ways, it's like a news service. But it's
focusing on items for prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the World Prayer Center's communication infrastructure
is designed to mobilize prayer instantly in churches across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the customer want?'' is scribbled on the wipe board
across from Trimble's desk.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the marketing man. It's his job to sell the Prayer
Room Network (PRN) to 5,000 churches across the country for an
annual $300 subscription fee.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, churches can send prayer requests and ``receive
prayer information of state, national and global importance.'' And
they can connect with other prayer rooms for online discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Annual operating costs are estimated at $600,000 with a
round-the-clock staff seven days a week. The prayer software is
being developed in-house for three servers at a cost of up to
$40,000 each. ``When we get 5,000 PRNs, that'll cover our costs and
a little more for expansion,'' he says. ``We don't make any money
on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Prayer and commerce
</P>
<P>
   Just south of the World Prayer Center is Focus on the Family,
another prayer nerve center.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1977 in California by child psychologist James
Dobson, today Focus is a compound of new brick buildings, including
an amusement park-style visitors center. Its annual operating
budget for its 75 outreach ministries is $116 million, coming from
private donations about whom employees remain tight-lipped.
</P>
<P>
   Listeners hear Dobson's Christian values radio broadcasts on
2,500 stations in 95 countries. And his attempts to influence
Congress are infamous. In February 1988, he scolded the GOP,
calling the party a traitor to the evangelical constituency for
failure to approve ``pro-family'' and ``pro-moral'' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Dobson's wife, Shirley, the National Day
of Prayer has taken hold across the country. Dobson's appearance at
the 1998 Dayton Mayor's Prayer Breakfast drew more than 3,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   On the third floor at Focus, thick carpets soften the bustle as
Jim Weidmann and the nine-member staff of the National Day of
Prayer Task Force worked to coordinate 5,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Shelves are lined with National Day of Prayer products: $10
Adopt-a-Leader kits to equip those who wish to pray for a city
commissioner, state legislator or congressional representative. Or
a $100 painting of George Washington praying in the woods of Valley
Forge by moonlight. There are prayer calendars, prayer coloring
books, a CD titled Let Us Pray and another book, The Myth of
Separation: A Revealing Look at What the Founders and the Courts
Really Say.
</P>
<P>
   And snug on Weidmann's wrist is one of the newest products, a
canvas bracelet whose woven threads spell ``Pray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the money situation, people look at the catalog and
say, 'You're just selling stuff,''' said Weidmann. ``But we're
really just doing things to help people. A church can observe
National Day of Prayer with our resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Weidmann and his assistant, Robert Velarde, want to infuse
secular holidays such as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving with
an awareness of Christian prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Dobsons' stances against homosexuality and in favor
of school prayer, Weidmann and Velarde maintain that their mission
is apolitical. ``Our only agenda is that we want to lift our nation
up,'' said Weidmann. ``We're not a political organization. We can't
endorse candidates. We do come from a certain perspective and
people may interpret that.''
</P>
<P>
   Worship with `no strings'
</P>
<P>
   When the National Day Task Force needed someone to train its
team of nationwide coordinators to pray, it called on the Rev. Ted
Haggard, the visionary.
</P>
<P>
   A slender, blond, laid-back guy who pads about the World Prayer
Center in his socks, Haggard wraps a sweet, almost prepubescent
voice around a listener as he cozies up in a big leather chair in
the atrium.
</P>
<P>
   He is a self-described political conservative and charismatic
Christian, a believer in the gifts of prophecy and intercession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a church where people could worship with no strings
attached _ endless boards, bickering, bureaucracy, formality,
jealously. But prayer would be the focal point ''
</P>
<P>
   His vision for a hassle-free church has come true. The North
American Church Growth Association has called his 8,000-member
charismatic New Life Church one of the fastest-growing in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   New Life stands just across the parking lot from the World
Prayer Center. Outside, the mountain air is thin. Inside, people
seem breathless for God. Completed in 1992, it is a cavernous _
70,000 square feet _ two-story concrete slab structure. There are
no angels in the architecture, no stained-glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   Worship is just as simple. Rather than preaching, Sunday
services center on informal worship and prayer. Members stand,
reach their hands to heavens or sit quietly, praying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This church teaches you to have a love relationship with God
through prayer,'' said Dale Pitts, 41, a construction worker who
attends church in overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Living Word Church in Vandalia, Ohio closely resembles New Life.
The building is a simple, mall-like structure. Its roof, painted
royal blue, rises above a subdivision. And inside, members are
eager to pray as intercessors for others.
</P>
<P>
   Tommi Femrite, a member of New Life and vice president of
Intercessors International, recently brought her campaign to
recruit intercessors for global prayer to Living Word. Femrite says
Dayton is ``a key city militarily and spiritually'' and ripe for
revival because of growing prayer activity.
</P>
<P>
   Two Centerville High School students who could have been out
partying on a recent Friday night enrolled to be intercessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in a panicky situation, God answered before I could
get the words out,'' said Jennifer Knoll, 17. ``I want to be able
to pray for others like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Intercessors International will provide her ``code names'' of
three pastors and their problems. She will pray 15 minutes daily.
In turn, she will receive a progress report on the pastors.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Clark, a saleswoman who attends Living Word, gives thanks
to the intercessory prayer movement emanating from Colorado
Springs. It's in the marrow of her church now, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started smoking MarIboros when I was 12 years old and I've
never been able to quit, '' said Clark, 41. ``I haven't had a
cigarette since the second week in December. People here prayed and
fasted for me to quit smoking. And I believe their prayers set me
free to feel the spirit of God.''

ROUGHED-UP ANGELS SWEPT IN BOSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Angels manager Terry Collins sat in his office Sunday
afternoon after his club's 4-2 loss to the Boston Red Sox, and
didn't have the scowl he usually has after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any reason for a scowl, it was Sunday. The loss
before 23,710 at Fenway Park ended a three-game sweep at the hands
of the Red Sox. It was the Angels' fourth loss in a row and sixth
in seven games. They fell six games under .500 (13-19) for the
first time this season and remain alone in last place.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins was relatively calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had other options, we'd look at it,'' Collins said of a
lineup that is missing four starters because of injury. ``But we
don't. We've got to get it done with this bunch. As guys get
healthy, we'll have more options.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the Angels lineup Sunday included Dave Silvestri at
shortstop, Jeff Huson at second base, Orlando Palmeiro in right
field and Charlie O'Brien at catcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are fortunate to be part of a division (AL West) in
which no team is playing much better than .500 ball. But it doesn't
get any easier for Anaheim, which will begin a three-game series
against the defending World Series champion Yankees on Tuesday
night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking a lot of guys to do a lot of things they
shouldn't have to do,'' Collins said. ``We have young players that
hopefully will learn by it and down the road be better for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to reach inside ourselves. They're down, no question.
But I'll tell you one thing, they're trying. You see it on their
faces all game long. They're trying, they're into it. They'll break
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, they don't seem close to breaking out of their
team-wide batting slump. Although they had 10 hits Sunday _ the
most they've had in seven games _ they still couldn't come up with
the big hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' only runs against Red Sox starter Mark Portugal
(3-1) scored on an RBI single by Palmeiro in the second inning and
an RBI double by Silvestri in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The one Angel slumping more than any other is third baseman Troy
Glaus, who is 2 for 27 with 11 strikeouts in his past seven games.
Glaus, off to a sizzling start, has seen his batting average fall
to .282.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fine; he's handled it good,'' Collins said. ``He's
taking extra batting practice, trying to correct things. His swing
right now is a little long and he might be tired, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Ken Hill (1-2) had lasted at least seven innings
in his previous four starts but couldn't make it out of the fourth
inning Sunday. He gave up four runs and seven hits in 32/3 innings.
And when Collins came to the mound with two out in the fourth, Hill
initially refused to give Collins the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to give him the ball,'' Hill said. ``I wanted to
keep battling. I'm not a quitter. No matter what the situation, if
you're up or down, I want to keep fighting. I take pride in what I
do. Nobody wants to be embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a perfect first inning, but after that he lost a little
bit of rhythm, which is what he uses for command,'' Collins
explained. ``He struggled after that. I didn't want to leave him in
and have him start searching for things and changing his
mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill gave up a solo home run to Nomar Garciaparra in the second
inning, and, in the third, gave up a two-out RBI single to Troy
O'Leary despite being ahead in the count 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be a fastball inside and I didn't get it in
there,'' Hill said. ``I was too fine with it instead of burying it
in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because we're not playing well. It's
frustrating because you want to give good, quality innings and keep
the game close because we're not scoring many runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox added two runs in the fourth on an RBI triple by
Damon Buford and a sacrifice fly by Jose Offerman.

BOMBING ADDS NEW STRAINS TO ALREADY TENSE TIES BETWEEN U.S. AND
CHINA
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade has
far greater potential to harm an already battered long-term
relationship between the United States and Beijing than to
frustrate any peace settlement for Kosovo that the United Nations
might help broker, administration officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental bombing by NATO _ which is being portrayed in
China as deliberate _ played to one of China's historical
sensitivities: humiliation at the hands of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   With no let-up Sunday in street demonstrations in Beijing
against the United States, the administration scrambled to try and
persuade the Chinese that it regretted the loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that the embassy bombing may strengthen the hands of
conservatives in Beijing's secretive leadership, administration
officials also emphasized the continuing desire for a ``strategic
partnership'' with China, a relationship already badly frayed over
allegations of espionage, and issues of human rights and trade.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a 1 1/2-page letter to China's President
Jiang Zemin Sunday that expressed condolences and set out NATO's
cause against Yugoslavia, a White House spokesman said. The letter
concluded by saying the president would continue to work on
improving the relationship between the two countries, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   To date, however, China has resolutely opposed NATO's bombing,
and its controlled media have not reported on the plight of
Kosovo's Albanians, but rather on the suffering of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Around midnight on Saturday, Secretary of State, Madeleine
Albright, accompanied by the under secretary of state, Thomas
Pickering, went to the Chinese Embassy to speak with Ambassador Li
Zhaoxing to express sorrow at the accident, a State Department
spokesman said. The secretary, he said, explained to the ambassador
that the accident was an ``intelligence failure.''
</P>
<P>
   How much effect the late-night visit had was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the ABC television program ``This Week'' Sunday, Li
declared that the bombing was a ``horrifying atrocity, something
rarely seen in the entire history of the worst diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Li said the Chinese government was demanding an investigation of
the bombing by NATO and after the results of the inquiry would
determine what ``further actions'' to take.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the embassy in Beijing on the CBS News program
``Face the Nation,'' America's ambassador to China, James Sasser,
said the Chinese government was tolerating or even encouraging the
street demonstrations in Beijing, which he called a risky policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a sense of widespread indignation within officialdom
itself here about this tragic bombing of the Chinese Embassy,'' he
said, even as the demonstrations continued outside his compound.
``This is, I think, really a national thought to some extent, and
one of our more perceptive foreign service officers here today
said, perhaps the Chinese want us to feel their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major complicating factor in the United States-China
relationship,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably inevitable, he said, that the bombing would be
exploited by the conservative elements in the Beijing government
who have been against the more modernizing trends led by Jiang and
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the official said, the administration's
policy of working toward a ``strategic partnership'' with China may
have shown some dividends in the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With personal contacts established between Clinton and Jiang
during their visits to each other's countries in the last two
years, it was slightly harder for the Chinese to return immediately
to the mentality of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressures on the more Western-leaning officials,
particularly as China faces the 10th anniversary next month of the
killing of hundreds of civilians by the military at the Tiananmen
demonstrations, would only mount in the wake of the Belgrade
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a debate in China mirroring that in the United
States in which the military and the hard-liners have accused Prime
Minister Zhu of being too soft,'' said Winston Lord, a former
American ambassador to China. ``There is the danger that in the
coming weeks that those who want to be constructive will be on the
defensive. This is going to give ammunition to the hard-liners.''
</P>
<P>
   While China, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
is needed for any U.N.-brokered resolution of the Kosovo war, the
most immediate long-term issue at stake for Washington is China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based body
which governs world commerce. China's admission has been going
through a rocky phase after the visit of Zhu to Washington last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who came to the United States with far more concessions on
market openings in China than the administration expected, was
aggrieved when Clinton failed to sign onto an agreement that would
have paved the way for China's entry.
</P>
<P>
   But just before Zhu left the United States, Clinton backtracked
somewhat, telephoning the prime minister with a pledge that the
United States would back China's membership in the trade
organization as long China stood by the major concessions on
foreign investment in telecommunications, banking and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, however, those concessions had been withdrawn,
apparently the victim of Chinese government officials who believed
Zhu had given away too much to the West. With anti-Americanism now
raging in the Chinese media and on the streets of Beijing, these
conservative officials could well prevail, a Clinton administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the bombing of the embassy, the next three weeks
are critical in the World Trade Organization process. Clinton faces
a June 3 deadline for telling Congress whether he intends to renew
China's trading status. If China becomes a member of the trade
body, Congress would have to normalize China's trading status, a
move that is set to spark a major political brawl for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of human rights, the administration infuriated
Beijing by filing a resolution condemning China's practices at the
annual meeting of the United Nations this spring in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a number of arrests and imprisonments of
political dissidents late last year and earlier this year, the
recent State Department annual report on human rights around the
world was particularly critical of China.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has also soured over allegations from the U.S.
intelligence agencies that China posed an ``acute intelligence
threat'' to nuclear weapons laboratories. A computer scientist at
Los Alamos National Laboratory has been fired under suspicion of
stealing nuclear design secrets for China, although he has not been
charged.

   NEW YORK _ After six terrifying weeks fleeing war at home in
Kosovo, Sytkije Deva and her family had finally arrived at Kennedy
International Airport late Saturday night to great fanfare: They
were showered with flowers and stuffed toys, surrounded by a gaggle
of news reporters, and fussed over by politicians making speeches
in a language they did not understand.
</P>
<P>
   But when it was time to leave the airport and walk free into the
streets of New York, Mrs. Deva, 67, looking bewildered and frail in
an oversized navy blue suit, stared up at her sister Lili Erbeli
and asked whether they were going to a refugee camp next.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Erbeli, eyes brimming, bent over, took her eldest sister's
hand and broke the good news in rapid-fire Albanian. ``You're
coming home with me,'' she said, and helped her rise from her seat.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Mrs. Erbeli, 55, and her husband, Rex, 59, brought
home to their three-bedroom duplex in the Sheepshead Bay area of
Brooklyn 14 of their Kosovo kin: Mrs. Deva and her husband, Musa,
72, their three grown children and their spouses, and six
grandchildren, ages 11 to 2.
</P>
<P>
   They were undoubtedly among the world's luckiest exiles of war.
They were among a planeload of 102 who had landed at Kennedy on
Saturday night from Skopje, Macedonia, via London. They came as
refugees into the United States, eligible for government benefits
and permanent residence in a mere three years. Most of all, unlike
those who had arrived at Fort Dix, N.J., last week, these refugees
had relatives in New York to sponsor them and take them directly
home.
</P>
<P>
   So on Saturday night, in a caravan of two Jeeps and a sedan,
three generations of Albanian-American Erbelis came to fetch three
generations of their Kosovo cousins.
</P>
<P>
   At a hangar set up as a welcoming hall, they waited breathlessly
behind a line of Port Authority police officers. Lili Erbeli waited
up front, dressed in red and black, the colors of the Albanian
flag, and as soon as she spotted a familiar face, hurried past the
police officers. Her American-born daughter, Albana, 26, followed,
and threw her arms around her eldest cousin, Bujar. Rex Erbeli,
heretofore jovial, suddenly grew quiet and escorted the elderly
Musa Deva to a chair. Mrs. Erbeli covered her mouth and whispered,
``Look, how skinny!''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the American Erbelis embraced their old-country kin,
the grown-ups' faces streaked with tears, the children's cheeks
covered with lipstick. The Erbelis' granddaughter, Brianna, 8,
opened a bag of toys she had brought from her own collection. Their
12-year-old nephew Argjent began chatting with an 11-year-old
cousin, Dren, whom he had never met, and they seemed to hit it off
immediately _ Dren telling his American cousin of a friend who had
been shot and killed with his father in their hometown of Kosovska
Mitrovica, and then, comparing notes on their favorite television
programs.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Sheepshead Bay it was a most unusual family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary occasion was marked by a relatively quiet
meal. Dinner was served in shifts, for there were too many to fit
around the 10-seat dining table. In the kitchen, an efficient
assembly line of Erbeli women cleared one set of plates and filled
another with chicken cutlets, peas and spoonfuls of rice pilaf.
Tiny cups of Turkish coffee were passed around, with bowls of flan
that Mrs. Erbeli had prepared the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Lili and Rex Erbeli seemed unfazed about making do with an extra
14 people. After all, they said, closets had already been cleared
and the refrigerator stocked with giant jugs of juice and soda.
Extra pillows and blankets had been found, and foam mattresses
borrowed from friends. Rex Erbeli joked that he would sleep on the
balcony if he had to. Lili Erbeli said they would simply have to
share.
</P>
<P>
   ``You help them now or never,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Rexhap and Liriej Erbeli were themselves
refugees. Both teachers in Yugoslavia and active in Albanian
political causes, they were expelled, Erbeli said, for hoisting an
Albanian flag in Serbian territory. The International Rescue
Committee, the same relief agency that arranged to bring their
relatives on Saturday, had arranged for their own passage to the
United States.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Neither Rex nor Lili Erbeli knew a word of English when they
first arrived with a 5-month-old daughter, Arberesa _ now Betsy,
31. A friend of Erbeli's father met them at the airport, put them
up in his apartment for a week, and from there began their typical
immigrant's journey. He cleaned the presses at The Daily News,
trimmed the hedges at a Manhattan park, drove a cab (not knowing
English or his way around, he once drove a passenger who wanted to
go to Greenwich, Conn., to Kennedy Airport instead).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rex Erbeli retired as an office building manager in
midtown Manhattan. Lili Erbeli still works as a teacher's assistant
at a nearby elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   They have been active in Albanian-American organizations. They
sent their girls back to Kosovo every summer, so they would not
forget who they were. And members of their extended family are
active in the Kosovo Liberation Army, the Kosovo Albanian rebels
who have been fighting for independence. Albanian nationalism
survived across the generations. Albana, who is scheduled to
graduate later this year from the Fashion Institute of Technology,
has tattooed the eagle of the Albanian flag on the small of her
back. For a while, she entertained the thought of fighting with the
Kosovo Liberation Army. Betsy has given her daughter, Brianna, the
middle name of Kosova.
</P>
<P>
   When the NATO bombings began seven weeks ago, the Erbelis, like
scores of Kosovars in New York, were on the phone nearly every day
with family members in Kosovo. Mrs. Erbeli heard of the houses that
had been torched in their neighborhood. She heard the children in
the background asking Auntie Lili to send a helicopter to fetch
them.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bombing started, Mrs. Erbeli lost contact.
``That's it, I said, they are dead,'' she remembered. ``I was crazy
for a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   She planted herself in front of the television, devouring any
news she could get. For a few days, her daughters recalled, she
refused to leave the house, lest she miss a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   The family in Kosovo, it turned out, had hidden at home for
eight days, leaving only when a neighbor, a Serb, offered to help
them get away. If they did not leave, the neighbor told them, they
would be killed. Two hours later, with a few bags packed with food
and clothes for the children, cash and jewelry, they left.
Remembering the advice of Bosnian refugees who came to their city
some years ago, they also brought all the family photos they could.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the Erbelis' living room, Bujar Deva, 38, and his
wife, Njeldez, 35, quietly told this story early Sunday morning
with the help of a cousin, Fatmir Kodra, who translated. Their
faces looked weary, and repeatedly they spoke of how unreal it
still seemed, being in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving their house in Kosovo, they spent several nights
in an abandoned trailer near the Macedonian border, waiting for
authorities to let them cross. The women and children were
separated from the men for a few days, but eventually, all ended up
at the home of relatives in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   They said they thought they could return home in a few weeks,
but then came the news from Kosovska Mitrovica: Their house had
been burned, along with the liquor store that Bujar Deva ran
nearby. He whispered this, for he had yet to tell his parents.
</P>
<P>
   While the Devas were considering their prospects in Macedonia,
the Erbelis were rushing to the offices of the International Rescue
Committee in New York. They were among some 700 Albanian-Americans
who filed papers to sponsor their extended families. Last
Wednesday, the call came in: all 14 of their relatives would be
coming into Kennedy Airport on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That night, before heading to the airport, Rex Erbeli was
describing his plans to set them up here. ``We're going to find an
apartment for them, we're going to fix up the apartment for them,
we're going to find them a job,'' he said with great confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Albana was saying she wanted her cousins to know freedom _ the
freedom to hoist an Albanian flag (she was bringing one to the
airport), to play their own music, to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   But would the Devas of Kosovska Mitrovica really want to stay?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to go back?'' Erbeli snapped, convinced that
Slobodan Milosevic would never let the Albanians live peacefully in
Kosovo. ``They stop now, OK. Twenty years from now, they start
again.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bujar Deva could not stop thinking about what he
was leaving behind. When he boarded the plane at Skopje on
Saturday, he said he was thinking only how quickly he could return.
He could barely sleep an hour on that flight of more than nine
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to realize at this age,'' he said, ``that you
have to start everything.''

STANTON COMES THROUGH FOR YANKS IN PITCHING EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Stanton grinned like a pig farmer who had been
asked to play golf at a private club, after he was informed he
would start against the Seattle Mariners Sunday. Truth be told, the
Yankees' coaching staff wished it had never had to submit the
invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, the Yankees' interim manager, would have greatly
preferred that Ramiro Mendoza had shaken off his viral infection
and pitched, as scheduled, rather than turn to Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   But Mendoza's temperature soared and his throat swelled, and
Stanton stepped in and prepared in his own weird left-handed
reliever way and shut out the Mariners for the first four innings.
In his first start in the major leagues after 552 relief
appearances _ a record for calls as a reliever before getting a
first start _ Stanton established a beachhead for the Yankees in
their 6-1 victory against Seattle before 49,622 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley followed Stanton and threw four strong innings _
prompting complaints from Mariners manager Lou Piniella that
Grimsley was illegally scuffing the ball _ and earned the victory,
improving his record to 4-0. Derek Jeter slugged his seventh home
run, a 430-foot blast that landed at the base of the monuments in
left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Yankees optioned outfielder Ricky Ledee to Class
AAA Columbus and called up Shane Spencer, who will be given a
chance to become the everyday left fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer's angst over demoting the likable Ledee was diminished by
the performances of Stanton and Grimsley, for the circumstances
were ominous. The Yankees had no fully rested starters available,
and their bullpen had been depleted by the recent workload. Mendoza
began feeling ill on Saturday, but Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching
coach, figured Mendoza would get better overnight. When Brian
Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, offered to call up a pitcher
from Class AAA, perhaps a starter, Zimmer and Stottlemyre insisted
that no, they would get by.
</P>
<P>
   Except that Mendoza felt worse Sunday, leaving Stanton and
Grimsley as the only viable options to start in his place. Zimmer
picked Stanton _ the fact that the left-handed-hitting Ken Griffey
Jr. was to bat in the first inning might have been a deciding
factor _ and hoped Stanton would pitch two or three good innings
and Grimsley two or three innings before the Yankees somehow turned
over a lead to Mariano Rivera in the eighth. David Cone, slated to
work out in the bullpen Sunday, volunteered to throw an inning in
relief, and Zimmer and Stottlemyre did not say no immediately.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the Mariners had pounded Stanton? A pitching
disaster, with Zimmer possibly turning to position players to throw
the late innings. ``We could've been a little bit embarrassed
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton felt no pressure, in a sense. This was something
different, something fresh. ``This was fun,'' said Stanton, who was
switched from a starter to a reliever in the minor leagues in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton trades his share of one-liners with starting pitchers
over the supposed ease of the starters' professional lifestyle, and
after Stottlemyre informed Stanton of his emergency start Sunday,
at about 11 a.m., Stanton mostly stayed with the normal routine of
a reliever. He shagged fly balls during batting practice, a
practice unheard of by starting pitchers. Stottlemyre expected
Stanton to begin warming up at 1:20 p.m. at the latest, about 15
minutes before game time.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton _ who sometimes warms up in the bullpen with as few as
10 pitches _ did not start throwing until 1:27 p.m. Even then, he
threw just 20 pitches or so; most starters require 50 to 60 to warm
up.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton did not return to the dugout after his pregame warmups,
going to the mound directly from the bullpen, just before the game
was to begin. The strangest part of the day, he said, was standing
on the mound for the national anthem; he had never done that in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   As enjoyable as it was, however, Stanton understood the great
need for him to pitch at least adequately, and that pressure, he
said, forced him to concentrate. ``I hate to say there are times
that my concentration is not what it should be,'' Stanton said,
``but that definitely happens. But when the adrenaline gets going,
those are the easy times to concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a 12.86 earned run average into the game, Stanton,
working from the stretch as always, threw far better than he had at
any time this season, getting strikes with all four of his pitches.
Zimmer said he felt good about Stanton right away, seeing him get
ahead in the count early and repeatedly. The Mariners did not get
their first hit until Dan Wilson plunked an opposite-field double
in the third inning, and by then the Yankees led, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton threw 42 pitches in the first three innings _ ``It was
the most strikes I've seen him throw in two years,'' Cone cracked _
and Stanton opened the fourth by walking David Bell. Grimsley
popped up in the bullpen and Stottlemyre walked slowly to the
mound. Stanton knew he was just trying to kill time for Grimsley to
warm up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You OK?'' Stottlemyre asked. Yes, Stanton replied, and
Stottlemyre asked again and Stanton answered the same way, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know why I'm out here,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton retired the next three batters, however, and lobbied to
pitch the fifth inning. But Stottlemyre explained that if Stanton
did that, he would not be available to relieve in Tuesday's game,
and Stanton departed, returning to his life as a reliever with his
perfect 0.00 ERA as a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cakewalk,'' Stanton said, laughing, like a pig farmer
who hit a hole-in-one at the club.

SPREWELL ALTERS THE KNICK-HEAT, GRIND-IT-OUT EQUATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Latrell Sprewell was standing for the cameras after
practice, decked with yellow-tinted, black-rimmed sunglasses to
accessorize his hip braids and complete a look fit for the South
Beach scene.
</P>
<P>
   It seems he could have easily found his niche here, in the
sunshine, on a team that needed a shooting guard, playing for Pat
Riley. He knows how close he was to that reality when the Heat and
Knicks were jockeying to acquire him in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here, so yeah, I'm happy I ended up with New York, I
guess,'' Sprewell said after the Knicks practiced in preparation
for Game 2 of their first-round series against Miami set for Monday
at Miami Arena. ``But if I was in Miami, I'd probably be saying the
same thing about being with them.''
</P>
<P>
   His transition from league outcast to reinstated star might have
been easier in Miami: less pressure, less chance of playing off the
bench, less unhappiness. But Riley pulled out of the running for
Sprewell at the 11th hour. The Knicks' management took the risk
with the belief that the slashing three-time All-Star could nudge
them ahead of the Heat and Pacers in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sprewell began to raise eyebrows with his reckless
style and grumble about his sixth-man role, and when the Knicks
were on the verge of missing the playoffs, the Heat was sticking
its flag into the top of the division.
</P>
<P>
   Who needed Sprewell? The Heat earned the top seeding in the
East, while the Knicks picked up the pieces of their season in time
to grab the eighth and final spot. But after finally finding
harmony with Sprewell, the Knicks reversed their underdog status
and shocked the Heat in Game 1 with their 95-75 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome defied expectation. This was supposed to be a
grind-it-out, halfcourt kind of meeting between two teams that
mirror each other. But the addition of Sprewell distorts that
reflection to an extent. He is not like any Knick that Riley has
prepared for in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they'll play me next,'' Sprewell said. ``You
just have to adjust to what happens. I know they'll come out fired
up, though.''
</P>
<P>
   This matchup may yet revert to its buttoned-down personality of
the past if Miami makes some of the open shots it missed on
Saturday and puts the Knicks in a tighter, more pressured
situation. With that in mind, the Knicks restrained themselves from
gloating Sunday. They were cautiously optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can come back to New York with two games, we can close
the series out, hopefully,'' Kurt Thomas said. ``We just have to
keep working together. We all knew we had a great player in
Latrell. It was just a matter of jelling.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Sprewell's contorted shots continue to fall, that
cohesiveness stands a better chance of sustaining itself. He gives
the Knicks a look the Heat doesn't have. Sprewell is the Knick
alternative to the predictable halfcourt world lorded over by
Patrick Ewing. The Heat may not be able to win if Alonzo Mourning
doesn't dominate. But the Knicks have consistently shown they can
thrive even when Ewing has to gingerly step back from his go-to
role because of a sore Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing how mobile Ewing will be in Game 2.
Typically, he has needed more than a day's rest before feeling good
enough to spin for layups and slide laterally to defend. If Ewing
becomes more of a rebounder and shot blocker _ just as he was in
Game 1 _ the Knicks have other methods of scoring. Such as
Sprewell, for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big guy knows that there are other players here
who can take the load off his shoulders, somewhat,'' said Sprewell,
who complemented Allan Houston's 22 points with 22 of his own in
Game 1. ``But we want Patrick in there. He was excellent in
rebounding and blocking shots on Saturday. That was great for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to know that he doesn't have to do it all. But we
haven't always played that way. He has had to be the dominant guy.
We want him to feel less of the burden. Hopefully, we can do our
part to have a team effort. That's when we're playing our best
basketball, when everyone is doing something on the floor to help
each other, and it's not just one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the theme for the Knicks in their last eight games of
the regular season. During that 6-2 span, five different Knicks
were the team's top scorer: Ewing twice, Sprewell three times, then
Houston, Larry Johnson and Marcus Camby. The pattern extended to
Game 1 when Houston and Sprewell led the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this is the best we've played this year, as far as
playing together on both ends of the floor and the confidence of
the team,'' Sprewell said. ``Right now, we're at a level that we
really haven't been at this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Sprewell is living with his sixth-man role, albeit
begrudgingly. Maybe he would have found a more comfortable niche as
a Heat star. He'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just flattered that both teams wanted me,'' Sprewell
said. ``Two first-class organizations. You couldn't go wrong.''

NO PRETTY BOYS LEADING WAY FOR STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Mike Keane, Grant Marshall, Brian Skrudland and Dave
Reid are not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   That's an observation that has nothing to do with the scraggly
beards and long hair of Keane and Marshall, Skrudland's receding
hairline or Reid's circa-1950 crew cut.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it a commentary on the assorted scars, cuts and
missing teeth common to men who make their living playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   No, this has nothing to do with physical appearance. This is
about style of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have their share of pretty players. Mike Modano, Joe
Nieuwendyk Jere Lehtinen and Sergei Zubov are fancy skaters and
puck handlers. Brett Hull has a gorgeous slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing attractive about the play of Keane and Co.,
however.
</P>
<P>
   They bump, they grind, they push, they shove, they hit, they
hold. They annoy, they pester.
</P>
<P>
   They win.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars take a 2-0 lead into St. Louis today for Game 3 of the
best-of-seven, Western Conference semifinal series, thanks largely
to the play of the grinders.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk deservedly grabbed the headlines after his
game-winning goal in overtime of Game 2 on Saturday night, but the
Stars wouldn't have been in position to win without the
contributions of the blue-collar, lunch-pail guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game really started to turn in our favor when some of the
grinders really started getting a bigger bite in the game,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``grinders'' primarily are Marshall, Keane, Skrudland, Reid,
Guy Carbonneau _ who's out with a knee injury but is expected back
for Game 4 on Wednesday _ Blake Sloan and Benoit Hogue. They spend
most of their time on the third and fourth lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're out there, they do good things,'' said Stars
defenseman and captain Derian Hatcher. ``That's what we expect from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't score much, although Keane got the Stars' third goal
_ and his second of the postseason _ after a feed from Marshall in
the 5-4 victory on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not their job. Their job is to keep the other team
from scoring, to do the dirty work, to play hard, to provide energy
on every shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to score; that's the name of the game,'' Sloan
said. ``But the third- and fourth-line guys like Marshall and Keane
and myself, it's our job to keep it down in their zone. If we keep
the pressure on, it really wears them down. That's our job. To
create more opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan is playing that role so well he's creating playing
opportunities for himself. Even though he's listed at a charitable
5-foot-10, he leads the Stars in hits in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hits come in the opponents' end, as Sloan and his
fellow grinders battle to keep the other team from getting the puck
up the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep it down low and keep the other team from
getting scoring opportunities, that's how we gauge a good shift,''
said Sloan, whose playing time comes at the expense of Tony Hrkac,
who's a better scorer. ``It's a tough role, but a fun role.''
</P>
<P>
   The grinders are so important that they play at the expense of
Hull's best game.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Hull is most effective in a three-line rotation.
But the benefits of playing four lines outweigh having the former
86-goal scorer at his absolute best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a four-line team,'' Hitchcock said after Saturday's
game. ``We're a 12-forward team. We needed everybody to win the
hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   The grinders weren't at their best in the first two periods of
Game 2. The pretty players on both players controlled the game,
racing up and down the ice and creating scoring chance after
scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues led, 4-3, after two periods against a team that hadn't
given up more than two goals in its first five games in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the blue-collar guys took over after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues had 24 shots in the first 40 minutes. They got off
only seven in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a huge third period from Mike Keane and his line,''
Nieuwendyk said. ``They did a tremendous job controlling the puck
down low. They give the kind of effort you have to have.''
</P>
<P>
   In the overtime, the fourth line almost scored the game winner.
Skrudland kept poking at a puck that Blues goalie Grant Fuhr might
or might not have covered and finally slid it across the line, but
the play was blown dead.
</P>
<P>
   However, while that was going on, Marshall was on the ice
tussling with the Blues' Terry Yake. Both players drew roughing
penalties, creating a four-on-four game for two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough time, and gave enough space, for the
pretty-skating Nieuwendyk to score the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of will,'' Hitchcock said. ``Maybe it wasn't the
strongest positional game, but we played hard for 60 minutes.
That's our team, and that's the way we've played all playoffs.''

YOUNG BLUES WINGER IS GOAL-ORIENTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A pack of media members surrounded St. Louis
winger Pavol Demitra's locker after practice several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty popular, eh?'' Blues winger Blair Atcheynum joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants same thing,'' Demitra said, forlornly.
``Everyone wants to ask why I'm not scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Well now that you mention it Pavol, why aren't you?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Demitra said. ``I really don't know. Maybe in
Game 2, I score.''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring hadn't been a question in the regular season. Demitra,
24, led St. Louis in goals (37) and assists (52). He had 52 points
in all of 1997-98, his first full NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's maybe not producing at the rate he did over the course of
the year, but he's one of those guys who all of a sudden: `Boom' is
going to snap out of it and have a big night,'' Blues coach Joel
Quenneville said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Quenneville a psychic; Demitra went ``boom'' in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   He scored twice in Saturday's 5-4 loss, tallying St. Louis'
first and last goals. The Blues probably will need more of the same
from Demitra if they are going to get back in this best-of-seven
series with a victory in Game 3 tonight in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I have to do. I have to score goals,'' Demitra
said. ``I score a couple of goals \Rin Game 2\S, but not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Blues brass gambled in the off-season that Demitra and others
could fill a scoring role left when Brett Hull signed with the
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he would be able to remained a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already heard that question probably 1,000 times,'' Demitra
said.
</P>
<P>
   If he hadn't been asked, though, Demitra said he wouldn't have
thought about it. He said nobody in the Blues organization had
talked to him about replacing Hull.
</P>
<P>
   The two are about as different as Dallas and Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Hull loved the spotlight. He liked talking about the big goal
almost as much as he liked scoring it. Demitra, well, he would just
as soon leave that kind of stuff to guys like Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``The adulation and exposure he gets from being a top scorer,''
Quenneville said, ``he probably wishes he never had it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain pressure that comes with being the man. It
was a pressure that Quenneville said Demitra took very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started the year, we figured we should get more
balanced scoring from a number of people, Jimmy Campbell, Pavol,
Geoff Courtnall, Scotty Young,'' Quenneville said. ``Pavol emerged
as a key guy as far as producing for us. I think he surprised a
number of people including ourselves with his offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the top 10 scorers in the league, which he was
one of them, the other nine are superstars.''
</P>
<P>
   Try Demitra in a group with Jaromir Jagr, Peter Forsberg, Eric
Lindros and Theo Fleury?
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't supposed to be there, but he was.
</P>
<P>
   So when the goals stopped coming _ Demitra didn't score in the
last four games of the Blues' seven-game, first-round series
against Phoenix _ the questions started coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``My response is scoring goals. That is what I want to do,''
Demitra said. ``I'm just starting. ... I'm still learning, just
learning. I think I can do much better.''

HULL UNFAZED BY ST. LOUIS BOOS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Brett Hull said he doesn't expect to be
welcomed back to St. Louis today _ not with the Stars leading the
best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals series 2-0 and Blues
fans looking to find a villain.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he has no problem with the fans of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if they boo me. They booed me in the preseason
game I played there. They booed me in the regular-season game I
played there,'' Hull said. ``They pay their money for the tickets.
They have the right to boo.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who played 11 seasons in a Blues uniform and scored the
majority of his 586 career regular-season goals (13th all-time in
the NHL), said he still loves the city of St. Louis, still has
plenty of friends in St. Louis and still respects the fans and
their love of the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been over this a lot,'' said Hull, who was allowed to
walk as a free agent last summer when the Blues refused to give him
a no-trade clause in his contract. The Stars signed him to a
three-year deal for $17 million. ``Management there made a decision
that they wanted to go a new direction, that they wanted to go with
youth, and that's just business. But what I had there and what I
gained playing and living there, that hasn't gone away. It's a
great city and they have great fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Blues fans now see Hull as an opponent, if not a
traitor. And Hull said after training camp he would no longer sign
St. Louis Blues sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Dallas Star now,'' Hull said. ``We've gone through all
that stuff, and now I'm just another guy they like to hate.''
VERBEEK TO RETURN Stars winger Pat Verbeek is expected back in the
lineup tonight after sitting out a one-game NHL suspension for
slashing Pierre Turgeon in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek said he didn't expect retribution from the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just go in there and play,'' he said. ``As far as I'm
concerned, it's over.'' STREAKING Just as the Stars have a chance
to set a franchise record tonight by winning their seventh
consecutive playoff game, three Stars players also have the chance
to extend playoff streaks.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner had a goal and an assist Friday in Game 2
and now has scored a point in five consecutive playoff games _ a
career best for the 23-year-old winger. Langenbrunner has three
goals and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Mike Modano also is on a career-best streak as he
has points in six consecutive games. Modano assisted on Jere
Lehtinen's game-tying goal in Game 2. Modano has two goals and four
assists in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zubov assisted on a goal for the fourth consecutive game.
He has six assists in the playoffs. CONGRATULATORY CALL Stars
center Guy Carbonneau, who was in Quebec after the death of his
father Thursday, called the Stars' locker room to congratulate Joe
Nieuwendyk on his overtime goal after Game 2. Carbonneau will
attend the funeral of his father today and is expected to join the
Stars tomorrow in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau, who has missed the past four games with a knee
injury, is expected to need only one skate to be ready and is
listed as likely to play in Game 4 on Wednesday.

BLUES' CHASE SCOFFS AT REPORT OF FINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Blues winger Kelly Chase said reports that
he had been fined $1,000 for throwing a water bottle at Stars
winger Pat Verbeek in the tunnel following Game 1 are false.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even throw a water bottle,'' Chase said. ``Some knob
head reported that without talking to me or talking to Verbeek.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbeek was called for slashing Blues center Pierre Turgeon with
2:18 remaining in Game 1. The Blues were upset, saying Verbeek
intended to injure Turgeon. Chase said he wasn't upset enough to
throw a water bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Would Turgeon have helped if he had been fined $1,000?
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding?'' Chase said. GOING HOME Home hasn't exactly
been helpful for the Blues in the playoffs. They were 1-2 at Kiel
Center in the first round against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Blues center Pierre Turgeon said he thinks part of the problem
is they are always coming home trailing in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to go back home 1-1, but we've got to move on
and think about the third game,'' Turgeon said. ``It's not like
we've never been in that situation before.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis came back from down 3-1 in the series to defeat
Phoenix and advance to the second round. MORAL VICTORIES The Blues
had been saying all along that they thought they could defeat the
Stars. They sounded convinced following Game 2 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues played well enough to win and had a 4-3 lead in the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look at that game like we could beat them,'' St.
Louis defenseman Chris Pronger said. ``With a couple of bounces
here and there and scoring, I guess we could finish them off.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Blues coach Joel Quenneville: ``Certainly, we proved we've
got a chance against these guys. It's not a hopeless situation.''

THE FOUR COURSEMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ All right, so they're not exactly The Four
Horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   How about The Four Coursemen?
</P>
<P>
   When Mark Brooks, Clark Dennis, Alan Bratton and Lindy Miller
stride the fairways of the TPC course at Las Colinas in this week's
GTE Byron Nelson Classic, they surely will be making some kind of
local golf history.
</P>
<P>
   Four players, three of them PGA Tour pros, from the same club _
Fort Worth's Mira Vista Golf Club _ teeing it up in a Tour event on
the same weekend, near their hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday, could there be an all Mira Vista leader board at
the Nelson?
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be nice,'' said Brooks, who won the 1996 PGA
Championship. ``We've got quite a few guys in the field, so that
helps your chances. Hopefully, everybody plays good.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an occurrence would catch the attention of Mira Vista's 500
members, said Miller, the club professional who will compete in the
Nelson for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mark or Clark or Alan are in contention on the weekend,
there's a real buzz in the locker room,'' said Miller.
``Everybody's talking about it. When the telecast is ready to come
on, everybody gets ready to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the three touring pros spend much of their time on
the road, they play frequently at Mira Vista, and Brooks, 38, even
owns a home there. As a result, Miller said, members of the private
club have adopted the three pros as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have something in common with our members,'' Miller
explained. ``There's a bond between them because they are out there
among them playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hardin, a Mira Vista member who has played with Dennis,
Brooks and Bratton, says members follow their progress on the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we do when we get the sports pages is check to
see what those guys shot,'' Hardin said. ``We know to look for the
dark \Rboldfaced\S names in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the chat when we're out on the range: what Alan or Mark
or Clark shot. We keep up with them. It adds something when someone
you've played with at home is out there competing with the best in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the three pros spend varying amounts of time at the
club ``because they're at different stages of their lives. They've
got families and those sorts of responsibilities. Alan spends more
time than the others because he and his wife don't have any kids.
When he's in town, he gets out and plays with the members.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, Miller said, plays about six days a week at Mira Vista
when he's home and even comes out to chip on Mondays. Brooks and
Dennis, he added, play two or three times a week when they are in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said he, Brooks and Bratton are aware of how the other
members of their Mira Vista contingent are faring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always check,'' said Dennis, the 33-year-old Fort Worth
native who had his best year on Tour last season, earning more than
$400,000 and posting a third-place finish at the Kemper Open. ``I'd
like to see us all play good the same week. I'd love it if we could
get three top 10s this week.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, at the Nissan Open at Riviera Country Club in
Pacific Palisades, Calif., Dennis glanced up and saw the leader
board, which showed that, like himself, Brooks had shot a
3-under-par 68, and that Bratton had fired a 4-under 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' Dennis remarked. ``Mira Vista shot 10-under
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis plays regularly with Hardin and Mira Vista members Vance
Minter, Dan Dunkelberg and Mark Wolf, he said. Dennis might even
have a home at Mira Vista in his future; he has purchased a lot
behind the 13th green.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Dennis nor Bratton nor Brooks are carrying their playing
partners at the club, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get some good games going out there,'' Dennis said. ``I've
really got to play. I can't lay down. I don't have to give those
guys strokes. I'm the one who needs strokes sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Minter, who has known Dennis since he was 15 years old, said the
friendly games on the course aren't altered by the fact that a PGA
Tour pro is among the foursomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all such good friends,'' Minter said. ``And I know the
members enjoy having them around. There's no intimidation at all.
Each one is such a really good guy that we pull for all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton, 27, credits his Mira Vista games with helping prepare
him for his successful performance in November at PGA Tour
Qualifying School in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with them got me through Tour school. They got me
ready,'' said Bratton. ``There aren't many country clubs where I
can go and have a good game with members. If I don't play good, a
couple of those guys can whip me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going through the learning stages right now,'' Hardin
said of Bratton. ``He's going to be a heck of a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect a lot of Nelson spectators from Fort Worth to be watching
Miller, too, this week. A top player at Oklahoma State, he was a
regular at the event through the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And, Bratton advises, don't underestimate Miller's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still a great player,'' Bratton said. ``He could be out
here \Ron the Tour\S if he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Mira Vista members said they'll head over to Irving to
watch their club's representatives at the Nelson; others said
they'll wait to catch them next week at the Mastercard Colonial in
Fort Worth. The only issue for members is which golfer to root for.
</P>
<P>
   Minter has the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe, I could pull against anyone of them,'' he
said. ``Everybody out here is pulling for every one of them.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Perhaps Tim Bogar has the solution for whatever ails Chris Holt
during the first inning of almost every ballgame.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bogey told me he was going to pitch the first inning and I
could take over after that,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a worth a try. Bogey would be better than quadruple
bogey, which is what Holt carded in the first inning Sunday for the
second start in a row. And just like before, the deficit proved too
great to overcome for the Astros, who fell 4-2 to the Montreal
Expos before a Mother's Day crowd of 24,804 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Mama may have said there'd be days like this for Holt, but it's
doubtful she was suggesting it would happen with such regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the 24 earned runs Holt has allowed this year have
come in the first inning, including 11 first-inning runs over his
last three starts. After the first inning of his last three
outings, Holt has allowed only one earned run in 15 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going on,'' said Holt, who hasn't had a
1-2-3 first inning in six starts this year. ``For some reason, I'm
just not finding a groove in the first inning. I can't put my
finger on it. I give up a hit here, a hit there, and the next thing
I know we're down 4-0. I'm going to have to get it figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt tried to remedy the problem Sunday by simulating an inning
in the bullpen before he took the mound. So much for that idea; the
Expos piled up five hits and enough runs to win the game before the
Astros stepped into the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just in a funk,'' Holt said. ``It's more of a mental
thing. I can't be anticipating bad things happening. I've got to
shake this. I know I'm 0-5, but I can easily rattle off five wins
and get back to .500.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' record at the Astrodome dropped to .500 after the
bottom-rung Expos took two of three in the series. Prior to
arriving in Houston, the Expos had lost four of their previous six
games.
</P>
<P>
   But they managed to have a big inning against Shane Reynolds on
Saturday and one against Holt on Sunday, while their pitching staff
stifled the Astros, who hit a tepid .248 in the series and left 26
runners on base, including 13 in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they were held in check by righthander Carl Pavano
(2-4), who spaced seven hits over seven innings while lowering his
ERA to 5.54.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would have done much more against Pavano,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``He left a lot of pitches up
(in the strike zone), and he wasn't throwing extremely hard. But we
never really got to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos had trouble getting to Holt after the first inning. He
retired eight of the next 13 batters he faced, but by then it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's typically the way it happens when a pitcher falls
behind,'' Dierker said. ``You start to relax, and you pitch
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuation of Holt's first-inning curse began with a
one-out walk to Jose Vidro, who scored on Brad Fullmer's single to
left. Third baseman Shane Andrews, who drove in five of the Expos'
12 runs in the series, followed with a two-run single, and Orlando
Cabrera also had an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holt's problem is that he hasn't had good command,'' Dierker
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's clearly a different pitcher once he gets out of the
first inning. In the first inning, Holt has a 19.50 ERA and
opponents are hitting a whopping .548 against him. After the first,
he is holding opponents to a .269 batting average and has a 3.49
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my ability is, and I know I've got good enough
stuff,'' Holt said. ``It's just a matter of concentrating and
getting three quick outs in the first.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett's bases-loaded sacrifice fly to center scored Craig
Biggio to slice the Expos' lead to three runs in the bottom of the
first. It was the first time Everett had been at the plate with the
bases loaded this season.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, who walked three times Sunday despite entering the
game with just six walks on the season, drew a leadoff walk in the
third and scored on Bill Spiers' single to left.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros collected only one hit over the next three innings
and five for the remainder of the game. Expos closer Ugueth Urbina
struck out two batters in the ninth and stranded runners at second
and third for his second save in as many days and his sixth of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urbina's tough,'' said Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell, who
was 0-for-5 with two strikeouts. ``The way I was playing, it
wouldn't have mattered who was out there, but he's tough. Those
kids (the Expos) may be young, but they're tough to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Expos' 10-19 record, it sure seemed that way over
the weekend.

MO' ILLS FOR VAUGHN
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just when it didn't look like things could get any
worse for the Angels, Mo Vaughn seems to have suffered a setback
with his sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vaughn's father, Leroy, Vaughn's ankle has
considerable swelling and is hurting. Vaughn might have to return
to the designated-hitter spot Tuesday when the Angels begin a
three-game series in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is gimpy,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``You can
tell his ankle is bothering him. But I asked him how it was and he
said it feels OK. We'll talk about it in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn wouldn't use his ankle as an excuse for going 1 for 11
with six strikeouts in the three games against the Red Sox. In
fact, Vaughn wasn't talking at all to the media after Sunday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fried,'' Angels spokesman Tim Mead said. ``He's done more
(for the media during the weekend in Boston) than he should have
been expected to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was not on the team flight to New York, instead taking a
later flight so he could spend more time at his North Easton,
Mass., home with his parents and sister.
</P>
<P>
   Hurts getting better: Both right fielder Tim Salmon and second
baseman Randy Velarde made progress with their respective injuries
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon (sprained left wrist) hit off a tee and said while there
is still some pain he was able to swing the bat ``pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to do this,'' Salmon said, ``to see where we're at
and how it responds (today). Tuesday maybe I'll take some early
hitting and go from there. It's encouraging, it's a step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, who will have therapy on the wrist today, is hoping to
return during the series against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde (stiff lower back) also plans to take batting practice
Tuesday in New York and possibly play in the series.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell thrown out, again: For the second season in a row,
pitcher Jack McDowell was ejected from a game despite not being on
the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, on the disabled list recovering from shoulder surgery,
was thrown out of Sunday's game by third-base umpire John Shulock.
It happened in the fourth inning after Damon Buford tagged and
scored from third on a sacrifice fly by Jose Offerman. It appeared
that Buford might have left early, and the Angels appealed.
</P>
<P>
   After Shulock gave the safe sign, he stormed toward the Angels
dugout, pointing his finger. McDowell got off the bench and yelled
back and was tossed.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, who refused comment after the game, was thrown out of
a game last season in June when the Angels and Royals fought in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Mound time: It had been four days since closer Troy Percival had
gotten any work, so Collins put him in the game in the eighth
inning Sunday despite not being in a save situation.
</P>
<P>
   Percival came in with a runner on first and two out, and needed
only one pitch to retire John Valentin and end the inning. The Red
Sox didn't bat in the ninth because they had the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``One pitch is about as little work as you can get in a game,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, the Yankees: Last season, the Angels arrived in New
York in August in a pennant race and won three in a five-game
series. Starting Tuesday, the Angels play three at Yankee Stadium
before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in last year when everybody thought the (stuff) was
going to hit the fan and we played great,'' Collins said. ``So
maybe it's the extra challenge that we need. One thing about the
Yankees, they face challenges every day because everybody wants to
beat them. It's something to get up for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have today off. on Tuesday, Steve Sparks (1-3, 4.29
ERA) will start for Anaheim against New York's Andy Pettitte (1-1,
4.88).

   BEIJING _ American diplomats said they felt like hostages in
their offices Sunday as tens of thousands of furious demonstrators
marched for the second day to protest NATO's bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade and pelted embassy buildings with eggs, stones,
paint balloons and chunks of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday morning, as people returned to work and school, the
streets around the American Embassy were mostly empty under heavy
police security. Only one delegation of about 300 students chanted
slogans peacefully in front of the compound. As was the case
Sunday, the restthe rest of Beijing was calm, although
anti-American sentiment ran high.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's demonstrations dwarfed similar protests held Saturday
because a large number of Beijingers flocked to the embassy
district to join student delegations from dozens of universities.
Some came merely to see the scene, many more to march, to sing and,
above all, to vent their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month after Prime Minister Zhu Rongji's visit to the
United States, many of the protesters carried home-made signs
carrying thoughts like ``Blood for Blood'' or American flags marked
with tiny swastikas instead of stars. Some of the protesters
screamed insults at people they identified as American and one
American television journalist was hit on the head as she delivered
a live report.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration scrambled to limit the damage the
embassy bombing may do to a long-term relationship already battered
by differences over trade and human rights and charges of
espionage. President Clinton sent President Jiang Zemin a letter to
express condolences and lay out NATO's case against Yugoslavia, a
White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither that letter nor a statement of deep regret from the
U.S. ambassador to China, James Sasser, were carried in newspapers
in Beijing, where on Sunday long double rows of unarmed policemen
locking arms stood in front of both the British and U.S. embassies,
and for the most part prevented protesters from entering. But the
policeman did nothing to discourage or stop the rain of objects
hurled from the street; a few even snapped photographs.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day Sunday, the imposing facade of the
embassy's old stone office building had been thoroughly defaced,
its windows broken, signs stolen, and its facade covered with
splotches of red and blue paint.
</P>
<P>
   Protests also occurred in a number of other cities over the
weekend, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and the
southwestern city of Chengdu, where the U.S. consul general's home
was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The embassy compounds are still under siege and today was
worse, at times much worse, than yesterday,'' said Bill Palmer, an
embassy spokesman in Beijing who said he was ``stuck'' in one of
the mission's buildings Sunday evening. ``We feel like we're
hostages. We can not come and go safely because of inadequate
Chinese security.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday evening, Vice President Hu Jintao gave an unusual live
television address in which he both endorsed the demonstrations and
cautioned against extremes, reflecting the government's desire to
maintain control while not alienating what is clearly a popular
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government firmly supports and protects, in
accordance with the law, all legal protest activities,'' he said.
But he added: ``We must prevent overreaction and insure social
stability.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The protest Sunday was an odd amalgam of extreme order and total
chaos, as tens of thousands of protesters marched the circuitous
half-mile protest route designated by the People's Armed Police,
passing the British and U.S. embassy compounds.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon on a glorious spring day, thousands of
protesters waited in line to enter the densely packed, slow moving
river of people that moved along the protest route, as if awaiting
admission to some outdoor rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   Delegations of several hundred students from schools like the
Beijing Chemical University and the Beijing College of Fashion
entered the route chanting angry slogans: ``American Killers'' and
``Revenge.'' A number had brought along rocks to throw at the
embassies. And the crowd applauded as protesters burned American
flags.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the protesters carried pictures of the two
journalists killed in the Chinese embassy bombing. The third victim
was the wife of one of the journalists. The bodies are likely to be
returned to China on Tuesday, possibly provoking a further public
outpouring of rage.
</P>
<P>
   Students took turns taking photos of each other. ``After the
bombing of the embassy, I feel more than ever that America is an
international bully,'' said Zhang Xingxing, a 20-year-old student
wearing a headband that read ``inexcusable murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Saturday's protesters, who were nearly all students,
Sunday's crowds included businessmen, lawyers, teachers and mothers
with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the news on the radio while riding in a taxi, and my
shock quickly turned to disbelief, then outrage,'' said Ding Ming,
26, an outgoing young man in a polo shirt who works for an
insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Ding came to the embassy Saturday night with friends and then
again Sunday with his girlfriend. ``We just walked about _ we do
not throw rocks and bottles,'' he said. ``Yes, there were some in
the crowd who went to extremes, but most people here are sensible.
They know their issue is with the American government and still
have friendly feelings towards the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The police generally kept the crowd moving on Sunday but allowed
stops in front of both the British and U.S. embassies, where the
protesters often turned aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon at the British Embassy, one student got through
police lines to scale the wall of the elegant red building and
lowered the Union Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But the featured stop was clearly the No. 3 Compound of the U.S.
Embassy, which houses the offices of top embassy officials,
including the ambassador. The paint-stained building looked like an
amusement park target. In the dense crowd, groups of young men set
off firecrackers, broke up pieces of sidewalk to use as missiles,
begged police officers to let them in to steal the American flag
and gawked at the battered cars that remained in a nearby embassy
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The People's Armed Police have told U.S. officials here that
they will insure that the protesters do not get into the embassy
grounds, but make no other guarantees, said Palmer, the embassy
spokesman. He said that his office has more than a dozen holes in
its windows and an equal number of chunks of concrete on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   An American student living in China, Shuan Rein, said he was
beaten by a group of protesting Chinese workers in front of the
U.S. Embassy gate on Sunday when he tried to explain that the
Americans were sorry about the bombing. Students rescued him and
the police took him away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the stone throwing is understandable because what was
done is intolerable, so I understand why people are driven to
extreme reprisals,'' said Ding Rong, a 29-year-old industrial
designer, who said she came because she attended the same
elementary school as one of the slain reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At various moments on Sunday afternoon, Cuban diplomats,
apparently buoyed by such a fervent resurgence of anti-American
sentiment in China, held up huge photographs of Castro shaking
hands with Jiang. They shouted ``Long live socialism. Down with
America. Long live China,'' and crowds returned the refrain.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the protests said they would most likely return to their
studies or jobs on Monday. They were uncertain of exactly what they
wanted from NATO or the United States, but yearned for some kind of
revenge. Placards carried messages like ``Hang Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Ding Rong said that she hoped the protest would both humble the
Americans and encourage China's leaders to protest more forcefully
against the bombing. Others said they merely sought an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to offer a fair and sincere apology and to
thoroughly investigate the matter,'' said Ding Ming. ``It seems
unbelievable that three bombs could fall on a foreign embassy by
mistake.''

REPORTS SHOW SCIENTIST GAVE U.S. RADAR SECRETS TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 11th graf to correct `today' to `SUNDAY')  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(js) 
 By JEFF GERTH and JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A scientist working on a classified Pentagon
project in 1997 provided China with secrets about advanced radar
technology being developed to track submarines, according to court
records and government documents.
</P>
<P>
   Submarine detection technology is jealously guarded by the
Pentagon because the Navy's ability to conceal its submarines is a
crucial military advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The information about the radar technology, which is considered
promising and has been in development for two decades, was divulged
to Chinese nuclear-weapons experts during a two-hour lecture in
Beijing in May 1997 by Peter Lee, an American scientist, court
records show. Lee was then working for TRW Inc., which had been
hired by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles wanted to charge Lee with
espionage but were unable to, in part because Navy officials in
Washington would not permit testimony about the technology in open
court, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department in Washington, having some questions of
its own, would not approve the prosecution either, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lee ended up pleading guilty to filing a false
statement about his 1997 trip to China and to divulging classified
laser data to Chinese scientists during an earlier trip to China in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the failure to prosecute Lee over the radar technology,
the case shows that the scope of Chinese espionage is broader than
the assertions of nuclear thefts at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory, which officials say involved another American
scientist, Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are not known to be related. The submarine
technology in the Peter Lee case was developed at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, a weapons lab in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Peter Lee case is also significant because it clearly
demonstrates that the American government believed that China was
successfully engaged in espionage _ obtaining American defense
secrets _ during President Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   While the Los Alamos disclosures earlier this year prompted an
array of investigations, Clinton, two months ago, said no one had
brought suspicions of Chinese espionage to him and administration
officials initially portrayed the problem as one confined to
earlier administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press,'' Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged that there had been
espionage by China during the Clinton administration, but he did
not go into detail.
</P>
<P>
   The breach involved in the Peter Lee case _ code-named Royal
Tourist by the FBI _ occurred in 1997, a point made in a classified
November 1998 counterintelligence report ordered by and then sent
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my desire and the desire of my office and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to pursue espionage counts,'' the
prosecutor in the Peter Lee case, Jonathan S. Shapiro, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at Lee's sentencing on March 26, 1998, Shapiro told the
judge that Lee's activities struck at the heart of national
security, according to witnesses at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee and his lawyer argued that the Taiwanese-American
scientist had simply made egregious mistakes and never intended to
help a foreign country or harm the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The judge declined to put Lee in prison and sentenced him to 12
months in a halfway house with three years' probation and a fine of
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Tom Jurkowsky, a Navy spokesman, said, ``The Navy
cooperated fully with the FBI from the start to the finish in their
investigation.'' Jurkowsky declined to comment on whether the Navy
prevented prosecutors in the Peter Lee case to use information
about the anti-submarine warfare technology in open court.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department spokesman, Myron Marlin, said: ``The
matter was handled in a way in which many parties had a chance to
make their views known. In a case of this nature, we obviously
cannot go into details, but there are often a number of reasons as
to why a certain course of action is taken.''
</P>
<P>
   The November 1998 counterintelligence report citing the Peter
Lee case was part of a comprehensive review ordered by President
Clinton as part of his effort to improve security at U.S. weapons
laboratories, which are run by the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   That report states that as late as 1997, Lee had ``provided
China with classified information.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, was briefed
about the Peter Lee case by Energy Department intelligence
officials in July 1997. Berger's spokesman, David Leavy, declined
to say when Clinton first learned about Lee's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Counterintelligence agents from the FBI watched Peter Lee from
the early 1980s, officials said. But the bureau did not prevent Lee
from traveling to Beijing in 1997 to discuss his work on
anti-submarine warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Lee failed to report his trip to superiors at his company, TRW,
who did not know about it until informed by the FBI, court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's 1997 decision not to approve the
espionage prosecution of Lee contrasts with some spy cases
involving the former Soviet Union or Israel in which ways were
found to protect secrets and bring charges.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 decision not to prosecute came a few months after the
Justice Department turned down a request from the FBI to put a
covert wiretap on Wen Ho Lee, then a scientist at Los Alamos
National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Now Congress and the Justice Department are examining how the
Wen Ho Lee case was handled as a result of recent assertions that
he transferred more than 1,000 classified files containing a
virtual history of American nuclear-weapons development to an
unsecure computer system at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Wen Ho Lee's lawyer, Mark Holscher of Los Angeles,
denied any wrongdoing by his client.
</P>
<P>
   The Peter Lee case and the investigation of Wen Ho Lee figure in
a secret congressional report soon to be released in part by a
committee led by Rep. Christopher Cox of California.
</P>
<P>
   The technology at issue in the Peter Lee case involves a radar
ocean imaging program developed in cooperation with Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The former manager of the program, Richard Twogood, said in an
interview that because the project was still in the developmental
stage, there was a debate in the government over its significance.
</P>
<P>
   Some see it as vital to American national security, since
submarines and anti-submarine warfare are crucial to the defense of
the United States. But others are uncertain about how useful the
technology will prove to be, according to Twogood.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear how immediately valuable the
submarine-detection technology would have been to the Chinese.
China does not have a strong navy and has only a modest submarine
fleet, but it has been looking for ways to improve its military
power at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Twogood told the FBI that the information Peter Lee provided the
Chinese in 1997 was ``classified and sensitive,'' court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   The radar program seeks to detect the physical traces, briefly
left as signatures on water surfaces, of the undersea motions of
submarines. Remote sensing devices located, for example, on an
airplane pick up the traces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy has invested a lot in this area for 20 years and so
by definition that implies it's important,'' said Twogood,
currently the deputy associate director for electronic engineering
at Lawrence Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union worked hard to develop this technology during
the Cold War. Recent American advances suggested that Soviet
assertions of success in anti-submarine measures should be taken
more seriously, Twogood told Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has made considerable efforts over the years
to make sure its submarines are difficult to detect.
Ballistic-missile submarines form a critical part of the American
nuclear arsenal, and are especially valuable because they are
extremely difficult to track when submerged.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines also are used to attack an enemy's surface ships and
submarines and increasingly to launch other long range weapons,
like cruise missiles with conventional warheads.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Peter Lee was born in China in 1939. His father was an ardent
anti-Communist and moved his family to Taiwan in 1951. They later
immigrated to the United States. Lee became a naturalized citizen
in 1975 after graduating from California Institute of Technology
with a Ph.D in aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1984, he worked as a physicist in a program at
Lawrence Livermore that specialized in the use of laser power to
initiate nuclear reactions. In 1985, he moved to Los Alamos, where
he worked on the laser program as a contract employee.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1985, Lee met with top Chinese nuclear scientists,
where he twice divulged secrets about his laser work and
``discussed problems the United States was having in its nuclear
weapons testing simulation program,'' according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had traveled to China with a group of scientists at the
invitation of a Chinese visitor to his laboratory. Lee was supposed
to act as a translator for the American delegation, according to
the 1998 report on threats to the Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Lee later told the bureau that on or about Jan. 9, 1985, in a
Beijing hotel room, a Chinese nuclear-weapons scientist asked for
Lee's help, saying that China was a ``poor country.'' Lee told the
FBI, according to court records, that he decided to help because he
wanted to bring China's scientific capabilities ``closer to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese scientist drew a diagram and asked Lee questions
about his laser research, according to court records filed in
connection with his sentencing. Lee said he responded with detailed
answers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Lee was picked up at his hotel and driven to
another hotel to meet a group of Chinese scientists. He answered
their questions for two hours, drawing diagrams and providing
specific mathematical and experimental results related to laser
fusion research.
</P>
<P>
   The laser fusion research that he gave to the Chinese was
declassified by Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary in 1993, prompting
several of Lee's former colleagues to recommend a lenient sentence
to the sentencing judge.
</P>
<P>
   Lee stayed at Los Alamos until 1991, when he went to the space
and electronics group of TRW Inc., in Redondo Beach, Calif. At TRW
he worked on the classified radar imaging research program, which
was financed by the Pentagon, but managed by Lawrence Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 or 1995, Lee applied for another job at Los Alamos, but
the FBI, having intensified its investigation of Lee, warned the
Energy Department of its counterintelligence concerns, and,
according to one official, Lee's application was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, Lee made a three-week trip to China as a
paid guest of China's Institute of Applied Physics and
Computational Mathematics, which handles the design of China's
nuclear weapons, according to an FBI affidavit filed in Lee's case.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit was based in part on what it called Lee's
``confession'' in interviews with FBI officials from October 1997
to early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Lee filed a report with his company, TRW, saying that he planned
to travel to China only for sightseeing and pleasure. But before he
left, he contacted a Chinese scientist to tell him that he would be
giving lectures on laser and nuclear energy at several Chinese
institutes, the affidavit states.
</P>
<P>
   Lee also sent a message that there was another subject that he
planned to lecture on and discuss with Chinese scientists, but
would only discuss it after he arrived in China. Lee's lawyer,
James Henderson, said in an interview that Lee never intended to
spy and has been hurt by insinuations he did.
</P>
<P>
   While in Beijing on May 11, 1997, he gave a lecture about his
work on the radar ocean imaging project at the Institute of Applied
Physics and Computational Mathematics to a group that included
Chinese nuclear-weapons scientists.
</P>
<P>
   He was questioned about its applications for anti-submarine
warfare, and showed the audience a surface ship wake image that he
had brought with him from his lab. After a two-hour, detailed
discussion of the physics of his work and its submarine
applications, he tore the ship wake image ``to shreds'' after
leaving the meeting, Lee told the FBI, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   After Lee initially admitted his encounters in China and his
false statement about his travel, the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles believed it could move forward with an espionage case,
law-enforcement officials said. But any indictment required
approval from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A series of meetings and phone calls ensued in the fall of 1997
involving lawyers in Los Angeles and top Justice and Pentagon
officials in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Navy took varying positions, but officials
said that in the end the Navy refused to let prosecutors disclose
information about the submarine detection technology in open court.
``The Navy was adamant in protecting the information,'' said an
official.
</P>
<P>
   So Shapiro, the prosecutor, lacked a crucial component of an
espionage case, a witness to testify about the classified nature of
the information. He then negotiated a plea bargain. And on Dec. 5,
1997, the U.S. attorney's office filed a two-paragraph criminal
information against Lee in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California, ending a 15-year FBI investigation.

COMMENTARY: CONNECT CHINA'S DOTS
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I called three friends in the departments of
Energy, Defense and Justice and asked them to turn on their office
computers and read to me the first banner that came on their
screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone using this system expressly consents to monitoring'' is
the message. Government employees using government equipment on
government time thus waive privacy claims. Wen Ho Lee, the
scientist who downloaded millions of lines of the nation's most
secret codes to a computer easy to penetrate, also signed a waiver
consenting to a search of his computer without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Reno Justice Department denied the FBI's request for
permission to search Lee's government computer. Eric Holder, Janet
Reno's deputy, decided that a court search warrant was necessary _
but then refused to apply to the special foreign-surveillance court
to get it. Of more than 700 such FBI requests a year, a
surveillance official admits that a flat turndown is extremely
rare. Why this one?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno, who never met an investigation of Chinese penetration
she didn't try to undermine, is suckering us with a claim that the
denial of surveillance was to protect a criminal investigation.
That is foo-foo dust. This was counterespionage, and the Criminal
Division was kept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Making C.D. the scapegoat for the failure to protect America's
deepest nuclear secrets is typical of the Clinton-Reno refusal to
accept responsibility for endangering national security. Reno has
appointed her personal Whitewash Brigade of favorite roundheels.
This enables her to rebuff Congress and the press for months with
the usual ``I cannot comment because an inquiry is ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her non-investigation of this Lee, following last year's
oh-so-gentle prosecution of another Lee for espionage, is part of a
pattern of averting exposure of Clinton's national-security laxity.
Connect the dots:
</P>
<P>
   1. Political contributions poured in from Beijing spymasters
through Johnny Chung, 50-time visitor through Hillary Clinton's
office. Richard Shelby's Senate Intelligence has now passed
evidence of ``suspicious banking relationships'' to Reno Justice,
where it will languish unless Senate Banking picks up the trail.
</P>
<P>
   2. Secret U.S. technology flowed out to China, made possible by
Clinton's easing of export controls to his ``strategic partner.''
This included missile improvements to target U.S. cities and
supercomputers that could take advantage of secrets being stolen
while Justice was determinedly protecting Lee from search.
</P>
<P>
   3. Nuclear secrets poured out of Los Alamos and other labs to
computers easily accessed. Though The Washington Post, a day late
and a scandal short, treats this as the partisan conclusion of
``GOP senators,'' Democrat J. Robert Kerrey said he had ``no
doubt'' that the technology transfer and Chinese espionage at
nuclear labs damaged our national security.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson cannot explain why
Clinton claimed not to know of heavy espionage on his watch when he
demonstrably did. With exquisite irony, Richardson makes a great
show of strapping scientists into lie detectors.
</P>
<P>
   They never learn. Wen Ho Lee beat a polygraph when he was first
suspected, just as the Soviet spy Aldrich Ames did. Reliance on the
sweat machine is the surest way to intimidate innocent scientists
while letting downloaders and dead-droppers appear to be not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   With Clintonites hunkered down and Justice covering up, Congress
must do the digging. A report by the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear
Arms Control showed what Chinese arms enterprises received U.S.
technology over the past decade _ but could supply no names of U.S.
exporters during the Clinton years. That's because that
embarrassment is ``proprietary information'' at the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain's Senate Commerce Committee has the power to
subpoena those names from Commerce, and to have Wisconsin's Gary
Milhollin run those sales against his Chinese-arms database. That
would tell us what political contributors were allowed to sell
sensitive technology in 1996 and 1997 to which Chinese nuclear,
missile and military sites.
</P>
<P>
   Staring at us are dots connecting political money and radical
policy switches to laxity in stopping the sale and theft of
secrets. But none are so blind as those who will not see.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODUJEVO, YUGOSLAVIA _ Three months ago, Milos Savic was
frantic. He had been stopped at a checkpoint by the Kosovo
Liberation Army close to this northern Kosovo city and dragged out
of his car at gunpoint. The fear ravaged him, he said, and he lost
nearly 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   When he met a foreign journalist then, Savic said he was afraid
that the last Serbs would be pushed out of Podujevo, a 95 percent
Albanian city about five miles from the border with Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in his cafe across from the Podujevo municipal building,
Savic says he's feeling better, even as NATO airplanes circle and
bomb in the hills to the west. The rebel checkpoints that began
less then a mile from the city center are gone now, pushed back by
the Serbian offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The regional headquarters of the armed rebels in the hills
around Lapastica, where a commander called Remi used to hold court
for foreign journalists, is also gone, leaving only small groups of
Albanian guerrillas fighting partisan actions in the hills farther
north and west, around Bajgora.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Podujevo's ethnic Albanians are gone, too, and Savic,
when asked, expresses some hopes that more of them will return.
Wearing his wartime civil defense jacket and civil defense cap _
blue with earflaps _ Savic, a simple and essentially decent man,
says he is trying to help remaining Albanians, especially the
elderly, to buy bread and provisions.
</P>
<P>
   But Savic also remembers ``the first night that NATO bombed,
when the Albanians were in the streets cheering and shooting guns
into the air to celebrate,'' he said. ``The Serbs didn't call in
NATO, but the Albanians did, and now NATO kills them as well as
us,'' he said. ``We didn't need NATO, and look at what they're
doing to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   He described how a friend and neighbor, Dragan Bubalo, was
killed in a NATO cluster bomb attack on a village called Merdare
near here, blown off the road in his Ford Sierra. This reporter had
visited the scene a few hours after the attack and remembered the
car and its bloodied interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go to the hospital to identify him,'' Savic said. ``I
washed his body and shaved his face and I buried him.'' Bubalo was
single, and Savic visits the dead man's mother, Mica, nearly every
day. ``Her husband is dead and she has no more sons,'' he said.
``She's crying and yelling every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the Serbs would defend Kosovo, which belongs to them,
he said with bravado. ``It is our house, and the Albanians were
welcome to live there, too. But it is not their house, and we are
not going to give it away.''
</P>
<P>
   The resentment of Podujevo's Serbs toward the Albanians was
mounting three months ago, and it burst forth in a week of violence
after the bombing began on March 24 and ethnic Albanian guerrillas
attacked policemen in the town, killing 10 people, said the town's
mayor, Milovan Tomcic. There were ``heavy battles'' between the
Kosovo Liberation Army and security forces along the main roads and
in the hills to the west along a 20-mile front toward Kosovska
Mitrovica, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The police and the army brought the situation under control, he
said, but not before Podujevo was practically emptied.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was shooting in the town and a lot of panic,'' Tomcic
said. ``Serbs and Albanians fled. There were less than 100 people
in the whole town _ just some officials and old people who couldn't
run away.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence of that anger in the town, with many Albanian
shops and houses burned and looted. Spray painted on some of the
shops are slogans, like ``Serbia _ we aren't leaving,'' and ``You
asked for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But between 55 and 60 percent of the 70,000 ethnic Albanians of
the municipality have returned, Tomcic said, including villagers
who had fled to the higher mountains while Serbian authorities
``cleaned the villages of the terrorists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his task now, he said is to get flour, oil, bread and
potable water to the villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Tomcic, an economist who became mayor in September 1996, is an
angry man, but keeps a flat, even tone with a NATO-country
journalist. He is convinced that Yugoslavia is being bombed
unjustly by a Western world that is siding with the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which he said had killed 1,000 Serbian policemen
and civilians in 1998, and had laid plans that he said were found
recently in its conquered headquarters to take control of Kosovo
and kill Serbian men ``from the ages of 3 to 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a journalist could see such documents, he said it was
impossible, that these were military documents.
</P>
<P>
   The West seemed to think the rebel group was not an army ``but
some kind of humanitarian organization,'' Tomcic said sardonically.
``But it was a military force, and it is now destroyed and
disbanded, except for some small groups of three to five people who
appear somewhere to hit our forces. But their area for maneuver is
smaller and smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomcic is especially angry at the destruction NATO bombing has
caused to bridges, highways and water, electrical and
communications systems, as well as to warehouses for food and fuel
needed for transportation and agriculture. ``The damages are
enormous, unbelievable,'' he said. ``There are no phone lines.
There is no media. There is no way to address the people. We can't
get food to them or water or diesel for farming. And just now the
most important thing is to save the people, to give them enough
food and medical protection, to avoid an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The municipality is preparing vaccinations against dysentery,
hepatitis and typhus fever, he said. ``Summer is coming, and there
is not enough clean water.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he and other officials insisted, the Yugoslav
Army is well dug in and is suffering comparatively little damage.
``Fixed targets like barracks and warehouses have been hit,''
Tomcic said. ``And they have hit decoy tanks and artillery pieces.
But the main damage is to ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomcic believes that what has been broken here can be mended, so
long as the bombing stops and the rebels remain suppressed. ``Even
if all the powers of the world attack us, the Albanians have to
realize that the problems of Kosovo must be solved with the
Serbs,'' he said. ``The Serbs and the Albanians here have to decide
how to live together _ day by day, point by point. I think it was a
terrible mistake that the Albanians listened to some in the West,
and a year ago, with their help, tried to solve the problems here
with weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   In his cafe, Savic, wears his civil defense uniform to wait on
tables while he chats with his newly confident customers, all
Serbs. ``This is a tragedy for all the people,'' he said, as the
planes flew overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always like this in a war. There's killing and bombing
and terrible things, and in the end, someone has to make a peace
between us.''

DIAMONDBACKS SHOOT DOWN METS AS REED FALTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Only once over their first 31 games has a New York
Mets starter lasted more than seven innings. And Sunday, Rick Reed
did not even make it out of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who has been the Mets' most consistent starter over the
last three years, lasted just 1 2/3 innings in an 11-6 loss to the
Arizona Diamondbacks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed a career-high eight earned runs on seven hits. And
even though the Mets (18-13) pounded out a season-high 16 hits,
they were no match for the Diamondbacks, who took a 9-0 lead after
two innings en route to capturing two of three games in this
weekend series.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be successful, you have to be consistent,'' said
Reed (2-1), whose earned run average more than doubled from 3.60
before the game to 7.56. ``It's not a matter of taking pride in it.
If you're consistent, you'll stick around a long time. That's why I
want to forget about today _ as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won only one of their last five games. In just
three games here, the pitching staff's earned run average rose from
3.69 to 4.24 as the Diamondbacks, in their second season, tied a
franchise record by scoring 27 runs over a three-game set.
</P>
<P>
   And with the Mets off to Denver for three games at Coors Field,
the most hitter-friendly park in the National League, there is no
respite in sight for the pitching rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Only Al Leiter, who will start against the Rockies on Monday
night, has lasted more than seven innings, having gone 7 2/3
innings in a 6-4 loss to Montreal on April 16.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Reed had left a game this early without being hurt
was on Aug. 16, 1989, when he was with the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was probably the best I felt all year, believe it or
not,'' said Reed, who seemed to still be having trouble believing
it after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stunk. I just got my pitches up,'' he said. ``When I warmed
up in the bullpen, I felt fine. I was good. But just when I got
between the lines, where it counted, I just didn't get it done.
That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   It took only nine pitches for Reed to fall behind, 3-0. Tony
Womack led off by singling off the mound on a 1--2-pitch. Jay Bell
lashed a 2-1 offering over the fence in left center on a hop for a
ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   And then Luis Gonzalez jumped all over a first-pitch cut
fastball _ one that Mike Piazza said had no bite on it _ for a
413-foot home run inside the right-field foul pole. That extended
his major league best hitting streak to 22 games and gave the
Diamondbacks the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Reed retired the next three batters in succession, but his
troubles started up again in the second. By the time manager Bobby
Valentine sent pitching coach Bob Apodaca out to get Reed, the
Diamondbacks had added on three more runs. And after Steve Finley
greeted the reliever Josias Manzanillo with a three-run homer to
right, the book was closed on Reed, and the Mets were trailing by
nine runs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Valentine fielded a lineup with just four starters
in their regular positions, the Mets hammered away at Arizona's
suspect pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Allensworth had three hits, including his first homer
of the season. Piazza went 3 for 4, with his fourth home run, in
his first multiple-hit game since coming off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo, Todd Pratt and Rey Ordonez each had two hits.
And Mike Kinkade belted his second home run.
</P>
<P>
   But the offense was in too big a hole, and hitting into four
double plays and going 1 for 9 with runners in scoring position did
not help.
</P>
<P>
   The only intriguing element after the second inning came when
the Mets scored three times in the ninth inning and Valentine sent
John Olerud to bat as a pinch-hitter with no one on and two out.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud had a streak of reaching base by either a hit or a walk
in the team's first 30 games _ 47 games dating back to last season.
But Valentine didn't have any pinch-hitters left and Olerud ended
the streak by striking out out.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you want me to do, send up the pitcher and the white
flag?'' said Valentine. ``I don't do that. No one knows what the
record is? Then I guess it doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud said he felt the same way. ``I think a hitting streak
would be a little different than this thing,'' he said. Valentine
concurred, saying he would not have sent Olerud up had it been a
hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Watson, a relief pitcher whom Olerud hit for, had been 3
for 8 this season. His career batting average: .260. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEES MISSED THE CHANCE FOR ANOTHER POSITIVE
DEED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the inside, where Joe Torre recovers gallantly
and another game comes daily, it seems perfectly natural for Don
Zimmer to be limping along as an interim, martyred manager. He
promised Torre he would be a good soldier, a G.I. Joe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any question,'' Chris Chambliss said. ``Given
Zim's experience, and being that he's close to Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, there is another view of how the Yankees have
managed Torre's forced absence. The choice of Zimmer to be the
temporary replacement in his crimped and cranky condition should
raise a question that is disturbingly decades old: to what lengths
will a professional sports team go before it turns to a minority
aspirant, if only to fill in? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, George Steinbrenner responded to
Torre's spring training diagnosis of prostate cancer by calling his
68-year-old bench coach out of his imminent retirement.
Steinbrenner needlessly played on Zimmer's admirable loyalties to
Torre when he might have appointed one of two African-American
coaches with deep organizational roots and high managerial hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss, who has managing experience, and Willie Randolph, who
does not, would have leaped at the chance. Out of loyalty to the
team and personal pride, they knew better than to volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't asked to do it and it wasn't my place to stand up and
say, `I want to manage,''' said Chambliss, the batting coach, a
30-year veteran of professional baseball, a minor league manager on
three levels and manager of the year on two of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sports owners often contend that minority candidates do not
promote themselves, or network enough. Though few owners hire
proactively, many speak sympathetically. Some are less enlightened,
even crude. John McMullen, the Devils' owner, recently contended in
a published report that, based on his experience owning the Houston
Astros, minorities didn't want jobs that would pay less than
``these people'' made as players.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the attitude and agenda, the ladder somehow keeps
growing when a minority candidate reaches the next-to-last rung.
When the Mets sidelined their general manager, Steve Phillips, over
sexual allegations last winter, it was as if his assistant, Omar
Minaya, did not exist. Rather than have a man with working
knowledge of Phillips' blueprint take over, they dusted off an
organizational dinosaur, Frank Cashen. They explained this as a
common corporate strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure if you took a survey of major league teams asking why
this happens, you would get all kinds of different answers,''
Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take much for a member of a minority to start sliding
back down the managerial ladder, his team's or others' who might
have considered him. Chambliss, in the winter previous to last,
interviewed for several major league jobs. He still wishes to
manage, and wants this known. But what does it say to other teams
about Chambliss the prospect that the Yankees picked as Torre's
temp a man with a bum right knee, who is wincing through the
early-season schedule as bone meets bone the way ball meets bat?
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer, supposedly the sensible choice for a smooth transition,
has himself been a distraction. Even Torre told him to go home from
Texas last weekend, when Zimmer suddenly announced he was suffering
too much and was going to quit. Why didn't Steinbrenner just thank
Zimmer for his effort, and tell Chambliss or Randolph, his
third-base coach, to start pressing the buttons for his 125-victory
defending champs until Torre returns later this month?
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers pride themselves on being contrary, but the Zimmer
Chronicles have somehow played out without a second guess. Have we
all become so anesthetized by old-school inequity that logical
alternatives don't cross our minds?
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Steinbrenner, with Torre, ignored Zimmer's
disability and cited his 13 years as a major league manager.
Similar experience didn't seem to be a prerequisite when he hired
Buck Showalter, or Bucky Dent. It is the same old story everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years, until Dave Cowens walked out on the Charlotte
Hornets this season, Paul Silas sat around as an assistant coach
and watched former players like Paul Westphal and Danny Ainge and
career assistants like Jeff Van Gundy climb right on by. Minorities
lack experience and therefore leadership credentials. On the other
hand, Tim Johnson, a white manager who wrote creative fiction on
his personal resume, wasn't canned by Toronto until this spring
when he became an international joke.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Chambliss and Randolph are not complaining about
anything, not even baseball's minority record. ``You have to be
patient,'' Randolph said. ``If you keep asking, `When am I going to
get a shot,' you start to sound a little bitter, like Davey Lopes.
I love the game too much for that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are worse things, Chambliss said, than working with the
best team in baseball, for a class act like Torre. There is no
point in dwelling on issues beyond your control, and no time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you feel Zim's not even hurt,'' Randolph said. ``But
once in a while, he gets up and goes, `Yaaah!'''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer shrugs off the pain the way the players deal with
distraction. Steinbrenner. Strawberry. Irabu. Clemens. Torre.
Zimmer. The Yankees, after beating Seattle, 6-1, Sunday roll along,
in first place. They would have been there under another interim
manager, who would have spared Zimmer this ordeal.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR LEDEE, ANOTHER LOW MOMENT IN A CAREER FULL OF
HIGH PROMISE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the way out to batting practice Sunday morning,
Ricky Ledee, two bats under his arm and and a glove in his hand,
stopped at the Yankees' clubhouse door to look at the lineup card
that had been posted shortly before. The lineup, for the game that
afternoon against Seattle, began: ``Curtis 7, Jeter 6, O'Neill 9,''
meaning, using scorekeeping shorthand, Chad Curtis leading off and
playing left field _ Ledee's position _ followed by Derek Jeter,
shortstop, and Paul O'Neill, right field.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth straight game, Ledee, the slender rookie who the
interim manager Don Zimmer had said was ``one of the hottest
prospects in our organization,'' was not in the starting lineup.
Ledee did not linger. One imagined that his heart sank a little
bit, again.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, who is batting just .200 in his 16 games played this
season, knew he was facing a possible demotion to the Columbus farm
team. While Ledee has suffered numerous disappointments in his
young baseball life _ at 25 he has spent nine seasons in the minor
leagues _ it was dispiriting to face the possibility of another.
Especially after the World Series he enjoyed last October.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not spreading the blame. ``I've been given a big
opportunity to play this season,'' Ledee said before the game,
``and I haven't produced.'' He has struck out 15 times in 45
at-bats. After he did get a 10th-inning pinch-hit single that won
the game against Kansas City last Thursday, he was asked how he
felt at the plate when the count went to no balls and two strikes.
``I thought to myself, `Here we go again,' '' he admitted. It was
hardly the confession of a confident hitter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from his extraordinary play in the World Series
last October, when he batted .600, with 6 hits in 10 at-bats. He
had come up from Class AAA Columbus the month before and played
well enough to start Game 1 of the Series against San Diego.
Ledee's first at-bat came with the bases loaded. He faced Kevin
Brown, perhaps the best pitcher in baseball last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of situation,'' Ledee said, ``that you dream
about as a kid, as a minor leaguer _ World Series, bases loaded.''
He ripped a double, scoring two runs. How did he feel standing on
second base? ``I wanted to scream,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had been signed by the Yankees out of Puerto Rico when he was
16 years old. He had hoped finally that ``the bus rides'' _ his
metaphor for the entire minor league experience _ were just a dusty
memory. It appeared to be one of those wonderful sports stories, a
Cinderella-in-spiked-shoes kind of tale.
</P>
<P>
   But then opposing teams began to study the young man. He was a
good fastball hitter, so let's try breaking stuff, off-speed stuff.
Soon he ran into problems. In spring training, he hit just .167.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been patient enough at the plate,'' Ledee said.
``I've been going after pitches out of the strike zone big time.
Too anxious. That's been killing me. And I'm hard on myself. Yeah,
my confidence level is way down.'' Zimmer, who has spent a
half-century in baseball, had spoken to him gently, telling him to
relax. The concept is easier than the execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time a young ballplayer has run into
difficulty,'' said Paul O'Neill, who was up and down to the minor
leagues three times before sticking as a major leaguer with
Cincinnati. ``And then it becomes a head game. You begin putting
pressure on yourself. It beats you down. Ricky will come out of it.
He's too good a ballplayer not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee said that sometimes he ``thinks too much'' at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to guess what the pitcher is going to throw, and I wind
up striking out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hitting problems may have affected Ledee's play in left
field as well. He has appeared tentative, even to the extent of
playing a single down the line by Kansas City's plodding catcher,
Chad Kreuter, into a two-base blow.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's 6-1 Yankee victory, Ledee was told that Zim
wanted to see him in his office. Zimmer knows how hard Ledee has
tried, regularly coming early to the ball park to work on the parts
of his game. Zimmer knows Ledee's long struggle to get to the major
leagues. Like the rest of the team, Zimmer has a fondness for
Ledee. He broke the news to Ricky Ledee that he was sending him
back to Columbus. I'm sorry, Zimmer told Ledee, but he'd get a
chance to play more there, to get his game together again, he
hoped, to make it back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you send someone down,'' Zimmer said later, ``you're
always half sick to your stomach. Especially a great kid like
Ricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee offered no argument. He left and quietly began to clear
out his locker. Outfielder Shane Spencer, recalled from Columbus
and with hopes bright, will move into Ledee's vacated premises.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, Ledee recalled a dream he had when he was 16 and
having problems in the Rookie League in Tampa, Fla. It had to do
with his father, Antonio, who was killed in an automobile accident
when Ricky was 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the dream I was running the bases,'' he said, ``and I was
feeling so tired rounding second that I didn't think I could make
it to third. But I heard the third-base coach yelling: `Don't give
up! Don't give up!' I looked and saw that the third-base coach was
my father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always remember that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS ARE WINNING DESPITE VAN GUNDY, OR BECAUSE OF
HIM?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Reporters swarmed around Patrick Ewing Sunday as the
Knicks ended their practice at the Miami Arena. Did he think the
Heat had an answer for the new look the Knicks had shown on
Saturday, with its emphasis on speed and quickness? Ewing didn't
have much to add to what everyone saw in the 20-point rout that
gave the Knicks a 1-0 lead in their first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only time will tell,'' Ewing said. ``They're a good team,
also. We mirror each other. They're going to come out with a lot of
intensity. We just have to match it and come with a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing ended his impromptu news conference when a reporter asked
if he felt more inclined to play defense now that the Knicks had
increased their offensive arsenal. Ewing eyed the questioner and
smiled. ``You sound like you're from New York with that comment,''
he said, and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Now the reporters swarmed around Coach Jeff Van Gundy, peppering
him with questions about the fluid, more open offense the Knicks
have shown since the last few weeks of the regular season. Van
Gundy played down the 95-75 victory on Saturday, and especially
brushed away inferences that the team had become more
offense-minded, more transition-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't run,'' he said. ``I mean, it's a misnomer that we
were in transition a lot yesterday. I think they had 14 fast breaks
and we had 16.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won, in Van Gundy's view, because the Heat missed a
lot of open shots, not because New York was better in transition.
``They were wide open, and they just had the misfortune to miss,''
he said. ``I wish we had something more to do with that, but we
didn't have as much to do with that as I thought we did during the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone observed that when Ewing was on the bench, the offense
seemed to be more successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``More successful?'' Van Gundy asked incredulously. ``I
disagree, but again, that's a perception.'' The questioner
persisted: when Ewing is not in the game, the Knicks seem to run up
and down the court more.
</P>
<P>
   ``False,'' Van Gundy said. ``False. Absolutely false. He's our
best rebounder. On the 16 fast breaks we got, he ignited over half
of them with his rebounding and shot blocking. So when he's on the
court, we have a better chance to run.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just another day in the life of the intriguing Knicks, a
team left for dead a month ago but now established as a team to
chase. In the midst of a satisfying transformation that has seen
the Knicks jell, Van Gundy faces a juggling act.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to keep his job as head coach, while playing out a
political drama that resulted in his rival, Ernie Grunfeld, losing
his job as the team's president last month. Grunfeld _ with the
blessing of Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden
_ acquired Marcus Camby and Latrell Sprewell in trades that sent
the core of Van Gundy's team elsewhere. Van Gundy initially had to
be coaxed to play the newcomers; he disparaged Camby's work ethic
and made Sprewell a sixth man. Now the Knicks are winning precisely
because of the two new players, the related new-found
aggressiveness of Allan Houston and the adaptation of Ewing to a
role as a rebounder, shot blocker and scorer when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy still sees the Knicks as a halfcourt team, and they
can certainly play that way in spots. But a bruising halfcourt game
no longer presents the Knicks with their best chance of winning.
``I think we can play both styles,'' Camby said Sunday. ``We're
versatile. We can post up; we can also get out on the break and
run.''
</P>
<P>
   This Knick team, with all the chaos of the last month, has
become a lot like the city it represents, a melange of attitudes
and agendas with politics always being played out, sometimes
harshly, at a number of levels. Yet on the court the attitudes and
agendas have somehow begun to coalesce in a winning unit. The
question Knicks executives have to answer is: Are the Knicks
winning because of Van Gundy's willingness to adjust, or despite
his resistance to change?
</P>
<P>
   With Grunfeld out of view, Knicks fans are getting their first
clear view of Jeff Van Gundy. No longer the sympathetic underdog,
as he was portrayed during his first two seasons as head coach, Van
Gundy has shown himself to be smart, politically savvy,
manipulative and even combative. Last year he grabbed Alonzo
Mourning's leg during a playoff brawl; he sniped at Michael Jordan
and Phil Jackson. This year he criticized Camby to justify
minimizing his playing time. Last week, in a bizarre small-town
move, Van Gundy ordered the Garden's out-of-town scoreboard turned
off so that players and fans wouldn't be distracted by the
Pistons-76ers score.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Van Gundy has taken the Knicks to the playoffs
and a rousing opening victory.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely the only way he can insure his return as the Knicks'
head coach is to take the team to the Eastern Conference finals.
The only way to do that is to give Camby, Sprewell and Houston
greater latitude as the playoffs progress. The team is looking good
and sounding happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing together more,'' Camby said. ``The ball's being
swung around; we don't have any egos; everyone wants to share the
spotlight. When different guys are scoring and passing like that,
it makes the game fun.''

RUSSIA REPORTS PROGRESS ON DIPLOMATIC FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO claimed military successes and Russia heralded
a diplomatic advance Sunday, as efforts to end the conflict in
Kosovo continued, shaken but not scuttled by the NATO bombing
Friday night of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Still apologizing for the bombing, which they called a ``tragic
error,'' NATO officials said the alliance flew 500 sorties Saturday
night, with an airfield and military assembly area in Kosovo among
the targets.
</P>
<P>
   However, news reports said that NATO warplanes generally avoided
Yugoslavia's larger cities. In addition to killing at least three
journalists in the Chinese Embassy, NATO warplanes reportedly
killed 15 with errant bombs in Nis, Yugoslavia's third-largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said their operations had been hampered by
weather and did not say they were intentionally avoiding cities.
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn, Russia's Balkans envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, emerged
from meetings with German leaders Sunday and declared that hopeful
``new circumstances'' had arisen regarding a peace plan backed by
Russia and the seven major industrialized nations. That plan calls
broadly for an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, but
diplomats are still negotiating the details.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin would not describe the ``new circumstances'' but
told reporters that he had presented them by phone to Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, who reacted positively. ``Well, he
took them very well,'' the former Russian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the National
Security Council, said the ``new circumstances'' may involve
Russia's position on some elements of the peace plan, such as the
composition of the international military force that would take
positions in Kosovo to keep the peace when refugees return, or the
timetable for the withdrawl of Milosevic's troops.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin had been expected to fly to Yugoslavia from
Germany, but he returned to Moscow to discuss events with Russian
leaders and possibly later this week with US Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott, who will make his second trip to Moscow in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent a letter of regret to Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, saying that the embassy in Belgrade was not struck
intentionally. He also asked the Chinese leader to continue to
provide security for US diplomats in China, who have been besieged
by angry crowds rallying at US embassies, smashing windows and
damaging cars.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has said that it targeted the embassy, thinking that the
building housed a Serb weapons depot. Sunday, US officials told
reporters that the Central Intelligence Agency initially picked the
building as a target, thinking it was the Yugoslav Federal
Directorate of Supply and Procurement. But subsequent reviews by
other military bodies did not discover that the building actually
housed the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ws no pilot or crew error,'' General Wesley Clark,
NATO's supreme allied commander, said on the ABC program ``This
Week.'' ``It was a case of the selection of the target and the
process that was involved there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at that process, we've got confidence in it, we
think this was an anomaly and we're going to continue to intensify
this air campaign. We're not going to let an incident like this
deter us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is the southern province of Yugoslavia, but an armed
independence movement of ethnic Albanians is pushing to redraw the
political map. Western leaders say Milosevic, a Serb, has used the
independence movement as an excuse to slaughter ethnic Albanians
and to drive more than 700,000 from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments:
</P>
<P>
   -- Chinese officials arrived in Belgrade to arrange for the
return of the bodies of victims from the embassy bombing. The
Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the dead included a recently
married couple. More than 20 people were said to be injured.
</P>
<P>
   -- President Clinton spoke with French President Jacques Chirac
for about 40 minutes about Kosovo and the embassy bombing. ``Chirac
shares our view that things like this will occur,'' said Hammer,
the National Security Council spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   -- Two of Milosevic's political opponents asked the
international community not to sign any deal that would leave him
in power. The president of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro,
Milo Djukanovic, joined with Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Serbian
opposition Democratic Party, to issue the appeal.

HELP WANTED: LEFTY RELIEVERS, PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE UNIMPORTANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was after midnight after a game two weeks ago, and
Tony Fossas was munching on a TV dinner and watching sports
highlight shows in his hotel room in Columbus, Ohio, when a
reporter called. Even though the scene sounded drab, Fossas spoke
excitedly about pitching for the Yankees' Class AAA affiliate and
spoke hopefully about resuming his major league career.
</P>
<P>
   Ten hours after Fossas hung up the telephone, he was called up
by the Yankees. No one was surprised. No one should be. Fossas is a
left-handed relief pitcher and, although he is 41 years old, rarely
throws a pitch that exceeds 86 mph, and has been with seven major
and minor league teams in the last two years, is a precious
commodity in a game where lefty relievers are scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do understand that if I wasn't left-handed, I wouldn't be
here,'' Fossas said. ``I understand that fully. There's no doubt
about it. There's not that many of us.''
</P>
<P>
   One day after Fossas was summoned, he gave up four runs in
one-third of an inning. There was immediate speculation that he
might be demoted or released. Once again, no one would have been
surprised. The job of a lefty reliever can be unpredictable and, if
he does not retire left-handed batters consistently, it can end
abruptly. That is, until the next team with a void in the bullpen
takes a chance. And someone will.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get the opportunity to extend their baseball life more
than anyone else,'' said John Schuerholz, the general manager of
the Atlanta Braves. ``They're hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossas and his brethren have heard all of the hackneyed jokes
about how easy it is for left-handers to make it to the major
leagues. If you are left-handed and can stand up straight, breathe
and throw strikes, someone will eventually give you a chance to
pitch in the major leagues. While that is obviously an
exaggeration, it is true that lefties get many more opportunities
than righties.
</P>
<P>
   Fossas has been released by three organizations in the last
year, and his name has become synonymous with nomadic reliever: Has
left arm, has held lefties to a .240 average over the last five
years and will travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a left-hander does get released, someone like Fossas, you
know he's going to get picked up,'' said the Mets' John Franco, who
has saved more games than any lefty in history. ``Before you know
it, he's released and then you're watching some game on TV and here
comes Tony Fossas. You say, `How the heck did he get there?'''
</P>
<P>
   Why are lefties so precious? Mostly because they are so
difficult to find. Studies have shown that while 5 to 30 percent of
the world's population has some left-handed skills, roughly 13
percent can be considered lefties. Yet 30 percent of the pitchers
on opening day rosters this season were lefty, and general managers
work overtime to raise that percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard stories from my grandparents and my parents that
picking up a fork left-handed was the wrong way of doing it,'' said
Doug Melvin, the general manager of the Texas Rangers. ``Now, if
you pick up a baseball left-handed, that's the right way to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What else makes lefties so precious? Batters swear that their
pitches break differently than those of right-handers, and come
from different arm angles, making it tougher for left-handed
batters to even pick up the ball. In addition, lefty relievers are
more of a mystery because they usually have a trick pitch or a
deceptive motion, and hitters are more accustomed to righties.
Finally, some hitters even mentioned that the lack of quality
left-handed batting practice pitchers can be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams, the Yankees and the Toronto Blue Jays, take
their lefty batting-practice pitcher on every road trip. For the
roughly $20,000 that it costs, it seems like a terrific investment.
Still, Charlie Wonsowicz, who has been the lefty for the Yankees
for seven years, doubted that every team could find a lefty to toss
strikes daily, keep quiet and blend in with a team. Indeed, the
Yankees once dismissed a nuisance of a lefty because he kept
plunking Don Mattingly in batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was an abundance out there, more guys would be doing
it,'' Wonsowicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, like most general managers, is familiar with the
problem. As he sat in his office at Yankee Stadium, staring at
boards that listed all of the players in the organization, he
lamented that the Yankees have only 21 lefties among their 128
pitchers. After the Yankees grudgingly included Graeme Lloyd in the
Roger Clemens-David Wells trade with Toronto, Cashman was so eager
to fill the left-handed void that he signed Trevor Wilson, a
32-year-old who missed all of 1996 and 1997 with injuries and who
tossed seven and two-thirds innings in the majors in 1998. Then he
nabbed Fossas the day after the Rangers released him in March.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said the Yankees had been scrambling to replace him, and
Cashman acknowledged that the team will spend 162 games, if needed,
looking for a second lefty reliever to complement Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lefties are very valuable,'' Cashman said. ``If you can get
your hands on a lefty, you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefties know that, so they plod along, and general managers
toil, sometimes obsessively, to obtain them. Melvin so coveted a
left-hander once that he signed Scott Bailes, who had not pitched
in the majors for two years; he also signed Ed Vosberg, who had
pitched in Italy two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets happily gave Dennis Cook, a left-hander in his 12th
season who was released by the White Sox in 1994, a three-year,
$6.6 million contract because he had become one of the most
versatile pitchers in baseball. Cook, 36, who has 15-month-old
triplets, said he might even play for the minimum after his
contract expired if someone still wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Orosco, who is 42 and could eclipse the record for career
appearances this season, is signed through 2000. His agent and wife
have told him he should pitch until he is 50. Lloyd, 32, thinks he
could easily last another decade while the Indians hope 38-year-old
Paul Assenmacher does not retire. And Fossas? The pitcher who spent
11 years in the minors before emerging as a specialist and who has
never made more than $750,000 in a season is determined to keep
going.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how many coaches told me I'd never make it?'' Fossas
asked. ``Every one.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Teams usually try to cling to the dependable lefty relievers,
specialists like Orosco, Assenmacher, Cook and Milwaukee's Mike
Myers. There are only two lefties who are full-time closers, Franco
and Houston's Billy Wagner, and few lefties are long relievers.
Eddie Guardado pitches so frequently for Minnesota that his
nickname is Every Day. Many lefty relievers are asked to get a few
outs, usually against lefties, and get out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad job,'' Melvin said. ``You might pitch 40
innings and face 40 batters. It's not a bad job if you can get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lloyd, who pitched precisely 39 innings in the regular
season and postseason for the Yankees in 1998, held left-handed
batters to a .198 average and, more impressive, righties to a .182
mark, admitted that he ached to do more. In Toronto, Lloyd's role
has expanded beyond facing only lefties.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Yankees wanted me to do was get one lefty at a time,''
Lloyd sighed. ``But complaining would have been pretty silly. The
team won every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Orosco jogs 10 miles a day three or four times a week in the
off-season to make sure he has strong legs to go with a strong
stomach. While Orosco said he could still pitch in 100 games a year
if he had to go only an inning each time, he expects to retire his
nasty slider by the time he is 45.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like teams feel sorry for us,'' Orosco said. ``You
hear people say, `If you're left-handed, you can get a job.' You
still have to earn it. They don't just give it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Orosco earns it. Before Paul O'Neill homered off him last month,
O'Neill was 0 for 16 off Orosco in his career. Just mention Orosco,
Assenmacher (3 for 24) or Lloyd (2 for 11) and watch O'Neill, a
former batting champion, wince.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys might get one or two outs, but those are the one or
two outs that change the outcome of a game,'' O'Neill said. ``If
they can get left-handers out, they're going to have a job for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time O'Neill grinned during the discussion about his
adversaries was when he mentioned that his 9-year-old, Andy, was a
southpaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws left-handed,'' O'Neill said. ``So he can get me out,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Vosberg, who is now with San Diego and who has been in 10
organizations in a 16-year career, said that being a lefty did not
help him while he languished in the minors for 11 years. Still, the
37-year-old Vosberg was blunt about the lunacy surrounding lefties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a shortage in quality rather than quantity,''
he said. ``A lot of times left-handers can't throw the ball over
the plate. I don't care if you throw 100 miles an hour, you have to
throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman believes Fossas can still do that, so Fossas survives on
perhaps the finest team in the majors. All lefty relievers spoke
reverentially about Fossas and lauded his resilience. But, deep
down, they probably realized that they could be the next Fossas,
too. To Fossas, still speaking like a giddy teen-ager at the prom,
it is an enviable existence. It is the life of a lefty reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be in Cuba,'' said Fossas, whose family left Havana
when he was 13 years old. ``Look at Kosovo. Look at Colorado. I
don't wait for situations like that to happen to get perspective. I
have perspective every day. I'm still in the same la-la baseball
world. If I don't pitch another day in the big leagues, I'm still
the happiest man on Earth.''

TV MOVIE CHRONICLES ORIGINAL ROCKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filmmaker Irwin Winkler was a driving force behind ``Rocky,''
the fictional
</P>
<P>
   rags-to-riches story of Rocky Balboa that captured the world's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler's son, director Charles Winkler, now gives us the long
overdue story of the (begin ital)real(end ital) Rocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky Marciano,'' a made-for-television film that premieres
Saturday on Showtime, chronicles the life of one of the sport's
greatest champions _ the only heavyweight titleholder to retire
undefeated _ who was killed in a plane crash in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Balboa and Marciano have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   They started from little _ Marciano was the son of a shoemaker
in Brockton, Mass. _ but ultimately became heroes. They fought more
like Mike Tyson than Muhammad Ali. And, of course, they were both
Italian-American.
</P>
<P>
   However, the similarities don't go much further.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler's film, starring Jon Favreau as Marciano, is not the
feel-good fairytale the Academy Award-winning movie is.
</P>
<P>
   It is a realistic, relatively subtle depiction of a complex man
_ for example, he was notoriously cheap overall, but extremely
generous with his money to those he loved _ and a savage fighter,
and how he became that way.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Marciano the man is particularly gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   Casual sports fans might know the basics of his life and career:
his unique 49-0 record, the fact he was the last great white
heavyweight champion and his untimely death.
</P>
<P>
   However, few know much about the man. Winkler strays from the
facts in many cases but brings the essence of Marciano to life in a
compelling way that gives perspective to his boxing career.
</P>
<P>
   One scene depicts the humiliation his father (played by George
C. Scott) experiences when he's forced to use food stamps, which
seems to explain Marciano's high regard for money and his
tremendous hunger in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   His reverence for his boyhood hero, Joe Louis, reveals both his
sensitivity and unshakable dedication to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano is devastated when he learns he must fight the great
``Brown Bomber,'' proceeds to beat him mercilessly and then again
is heartbroken afterward. Meanwhile, a simple approving nod by
Louis immediately after the bout is stopped symbolizes Marciano's
coming of age as a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Books and articles about Marciano) talk about how Rocky wept
in Louis' locker room after he beat him. Once I found that, I had
my in for the story. It struck me as totally fascinating,'' Winkler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler worked with his father on many films, including
``Rocky'' and ``Raging Bull,'' probably the greatest boxing film
ever made.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears he learned his lessons: The boxing scenes in
(begin ital)his(end ital) movie are excellent. He and boxing
choreographer Jimmy Nickerson (``Rocky,'' ``Rocky 2'' and ``Raging
Bull'') capture Marciano's machine-like determination and
destructive power in a realistic manner.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly riveting and representative of the damage Marciano
could inflict is his bloody bout with Carmine Vingo, who is nearly
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Vingo goes down and winds up in the hospital, you
understand how it happened,'' Winkler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the boxing was shot in the `Rocky' movies,
particularly the later ones, was incredible. Stallone, at that
point, had the method down to a science. In watching all five of
the movies, we really saw how it got slicker and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, with `Raging Bull,' I remember seeing
(director) Martin Scorsese spending hours and hours setting one
shot up. He really created art with the camera. We had that to look
at, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Favreau, who wrote and starred in the popular film ``Swingers,''
desperately wanted this part.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, is of Italian heritage _ ``It was a chance to make the
Italian relatives proud'' _ and, he said, every actor relishes the
chance to play a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   He trained for six months, learning the rudiments of boxing and
Marciano's awkward style from Nickerson in Joe Goossen's Van Nuys
gym and building a physique that rivals Stallone's.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he poured over all the material he could find
on Marciano. He was determined to do the legend justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to young people, they say, `Oh, you're re-making
the Stallone movie?''' he said. ``They don't know much about him.
He was one of the first positive Italian role models. He wasn't
associated with the Mafia. He had integrity in a sport that is so
corrupt. All this after starting out as the son of immigrants in a
depressed situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By his own will, skill and perseverance, he became the only
undefeated champion the world has ever known. It's an inspiring
story that no one has done until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy: Winkler's film has angered Marciano's relatives,
who say he was not connected to the mob and was not desperate to
leave Brockton as the movie indicates.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, organized crime figure Frankie Carbo has invested
in Marciano's career but the fighter never does anything dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to sit and watch and see things, and you'd say,
`That's a lie, that's not factual,' '' Rocky Marciano Jr. told the
Enterprise in Brockton.
</P>
<P>
   Said Peter Marciano, the fighter's brother: ``Speaking on behalf
of the family, we don't want the people of Brockton to think the
Marciano family in any shape or form had anything to do with this
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Winkler defended any inaccuracies in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic problem is taking a man's life story and boiling it
down to 100 minutes,'' he said. ``You have to combine things to try
to illuminate broader themes in the man's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to do this with no disrespect to Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver lining?: It might turn out that the Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis debacle was the best thing that could've
happened to boxing.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the atrocious scoring of the fight has fed
a movement to reform the sport that is picking up momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Muhammad Ali Reform Act, a bill to protect boxers from
exploitation by promoters and managers and require accountability
from sanctioning bodies, was approved last week by the Senate's
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill was passed by the full Senate last year, but the
House never took up the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the (Holyfield-Lewis) fight will provide some
additional pressure,'' committee chairman John McCain, R-Ariz.,
told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities in New York, where the Holyfield-Lewis
draw took place, have established strict criteria by which to
select and monitor judges.
</P>
<P>
   Similar changes are likely to be made across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas watch: Fernando Vargas of Oxnard will defend his IBF
junior middleweight title against 1992 Olympian Raul Marquez on
July 17 at Lake Tahoe on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Vargas' second defense. &QL;

<P>
   A charter bus carrying at least 46 people from a New Orleans
suburb to a Mississippi casino resort, many of them older women on
a Mother's Day trip, veered across a busy interstate highway and
into an embankment Sunday, killing 23 people and injuring 20.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, but the bus
driver, who was critically hurt, was quoted by the bus company
operator and a hospital official as saying that he had swerved when
another vehicle suddenly passed in front of him. The front of the
bus was mangled, its tires twisted and pushed into the passenger
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The police do not yet know how fast the bus was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   The bus accident was one of the worst in the nation's history,
according to National Transportation and Safety Board records. The
accident with the largest loss of life was in 1976 when a school
bus crashed in Yuba City, Calif., killing 53.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred about 10 a.m. as the bus was on its way to
the Casino Magic casino in Bay St. Louis, Miss., just across the
Louisiana line on the Gulf Coast. The bus had started out in
LaPlace, La., about 25 miles west of New Orleans, and was headed
east on Interstate 610 for the 90-mile trip.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the bus veered across three lanes of
traffic, narrowly missing several vehicles. It hit the edge of a
guardrail and veered onto a tree-lined grassy area. It continued to
careen alongside the highway for about 50 yards, crashing through a
chain-link fence and then over a gully and into an embankment, a
police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen people were pronounced dead at the scene and four died
at hospitals, the authorities said. The bodies could not be removed
for four hours after the crash because of the extensive damage to
the front of the bus, which was so crumpled that its front wheels
were two feet off the ground. Rescue squads had to brace the bus
with timbers and use ladders to reach its windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people on top of each other, crushed between twisted
metal,'' Officer Joe Narcisse of the New Orleans Police told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen people were hospitalized and three were released after
emergency room treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was operated by Custom Bus Charters, based in Gretna,
La. Terrell Walker, a spokesman for Custom Bus, identified the
driver as Frank Bedell, 49. Walker and Jerry Romig, a spokesman for
Charity Hospital, where the most-critically injured were taken,
said on CNN that the driver told investigators that he had swerved
to the right when another vehicle cut him off.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said that Bedell had worked for the company for three
years and had no record of problems. Walker also told the network
that the bus had new brakes and no record of recent mechanical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Marc Morial said the New Orleans Police Department is
working with the NTSB to investigate the crash. He said the driver
would be tested for drugs and alcohol use, as is customary.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said that 46 people were on the bus, but that the list of
passengers was lost in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Romig said the hospital had opened four trauma operating rooms
and was calling in every available doctor and nurse. He said that
the crash was the worst he had seen in 20 years and that the
outlook for many of the injured was poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some very badly injured people, and the fact that
they're elderly doesn't help at all,'' he said. ``Some were in
their 70s, some in their 80's, and that makes it doubly tough. It
makes it more difficult for them to sustain trauma, especially
chest injuries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Four other gambling charter buses, bound for casinos in Atlantic
City, crashed in New Jersey in late December and early January. The
most serious Atlantic City crash occurred on Christmas Eve, killing
eight people.
</P>
<P>
   As in Atlantic City, which does not have a large enough local
population to support its gambling industry, the casinos along the
Gulf Coast often provide inexpensive package tours, meals or other
incentives to attract customers from hours away, often from
surrounding states. Many of these customers, most of them elderly,
visit only for the day.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, it is a common practice for casinos to pay bus
companies to organize excursions for the elderly, although it was
not immediately known whether Custom Bus had such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the passengers on the bus Sunday were members of an
informal club that went to the casino twice a month, George Tassin,
a relative of eight of the passengers, told The Associated Press.
Tassin's wife, daughter and an aunt were among the injured, he
said, as he waited outside the hospital where they were taken.
</P>
<P>
   He said his aunt was making her first trip since the recent
death of her husband. ``My aunt finally decided to go this one time
and this happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site near the St. Bernard intersection several
miles from the French Quarter, bus seats lay on the roadway along
with broken glass and torn clothing. As traffic slowed alongside
Interstate 610, one elderly couple, Gloria and Wayne Bachemin, said
they had taken that charter trip before and had considered taking
the trip to Casino Magic that morning but had a family obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Bachemin worried that one of her friends might have been
a passenger Sunday. ``She was organizing a trip for this weekend,''
Mrs. Bachemin said. ``I just hope it was another bus. She's a
jovial person; she would have been sitting right up front, trying
to get people to sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Four more people had been waiting to board the bus in New
Orleans. &QL;

   GUNDERSON ON DISABLED LIST
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Rangers reinstated right-hander John Burkett from
the 15-day disabled list yesterday, but avoided a difficult
decision by placing left-hander Eric Gunderson on the 15-day
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   That kept the Rangers from exposing Gunderson to outright
waivers by designating him for assignment and from optioning either
right-hander Danny Patterson or left-hander Mike Venafro to
Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin informed Gunderson on Saturday that
the left-hander would be part of the equation in the Rangers'
efforts to make room on the 25-man roster for Burkett unless health
was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm not 100 percent, but I can pitch,' '' manager
Johnny Oates said. ``There's a difference, though, between being
able to pitch and being healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson has experienced tightness in his left shoulder at
times since spring training and has been receiving treatment, Oates
said. Gunderson will remain with the Rangers through this road trip
and undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test Thursday when the
club returns to Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plan to send Gunderson on a medical rehabilitation
assignment before reinstating him from the disabled list. Oates
said he will recommend that Gunderson start in order to build arm
strength. PAVLIK DISAPPEARS So, what became of former Rangers
right-hander Roger Pavlik?
</P>
<P>
   No one appears to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where he is,'' Melvin said. ``I haven't spoken to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavlik was limited to 14 innings with the Rangers last season
because of injuries and the 1996 All-Star became a free agent on
Dec. 19 after rejecting the organization's offer of salary
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin received a telephone call recently from Pavlik's agent,
Alan Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's who I thought he was calling about,'' Melvin said. ``He
was calling about John Cangelosi.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin does not have any interest in the journeyman outfielder,
who played for the Rangers in 1992. SHAVE MAKES `PLAY OF THE DAY'
The performance Saturday by reserve infielder Jon Shave did not go
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Shave participated in two double plays and made a diving stop of
a ground ball at shortstop that minimized the damage during the
Blue Jays' two-run third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went unnoticed, but he made the play of the day on that
ball up the middle,'' said right-hander Mike Morgan, Saturday's
winning pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as big a play as we've had on this road trip,'' Oates
said.

PREMIER GLEN CLARK ANOTHER POLITICIAN DEFYING THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ British Columbia Premier Glen Clark emerges
from a meeting at the provincial Legislature and spots waiting
microphones of his critics in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   He reacts with an almost cheerful defiance that is his political
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated,'' Clark
jokes. He delivers a quick sound bite, warning of ``horror and
anger'' if Alaska catches too many B.C.-bound salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has come through a firestorm reminiscent of the early days
of la liaison de Monica Lewinsky in the United States. The
premier's resignation was widely predicted after the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police raided Clark's Vancouver home two months ago,
supposedly seeking evidence in a gambling case against one of the
premier's neighbors. A BCTV television crew was tipped off, and
filmed the premier during the raid.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it was being revealed that a Clark-championed
project to build two prototype hydrofoil ferries had ballooned to
twice its original budget. The premier's conservative critics were
threatening to mount a recall campaign against all 40 provincial
legislators of the ruling New Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Clinton in January of last year: The only question
seemed to be how many days the guy had left,'' said former Premier
Dave Barrett, a political ally but no personal friend of Clark's.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Clark is still on his feet. The RCMP has downgraded
charges against Clark's neighbor. The recall campaign has
collapsed. Bad economic news was recently broken when
Louisiana-Pacific Corp. announced it would invest $283 million
(Canadian) in four new mills. As Clark's opponents tried to stage a
rally in Nanaimo Thursday, 250 supporters of his government paraded
under the banner: ``Give Us News, Not Right-Wing Propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasts still say that Clark and the New Democrats will
go down for the count in the next provincial election. He may not
even enter the ring, resigning to allow a new, untarnished premier
to lead his party into battle. Changing heads is a time-honored
formula for survival in Canadian politics.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada's maritime provinces, an old joke goes, politics is a
family tradition. Battles over separation make politics a religion
in Quebec. Politics is a business in self-satisfied, prosperous
Ontario. But in British Columbia, politics is a blood sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is played out over a land mass larger than California, Oregon
and Washington combined. Two-thirds of the province's 4 million
residents are squeezed into 3 percent of its land base, around
Vancouver and on lower Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   The political center in British Columbia is as sparsely
populated as much of the province. Parties of the left and right
face off at the polls. They confront each other daily on the floor
of the B.C. Legislature. Punches were traded at the Nanaimo rally
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its name, the opposition Liberal Party represents
conservatism, tax cutting and free enterprise, and gets heavy
backing from big business. Its contributors include the parent
companies of British Columbia's major news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats are closely tied to the 446,000-member B.C.
Federation of Labor. The ``third way'' moderation of Britain's
Labour Party and Germany's Social Democrats hasn't reached
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   The government's new budget anticipates an $890 million
(Canadian) deficit. It is heavy with health, education and
infrastructure spending designed to help jolt the province out of
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, however, wants tax cuts, and is aghast
at the budget. The Clark government ``is beyond salvaging,'' says
Vancouver Mayor Philip Owen, a critic of the premier.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Polls have shown the New Democrats with as little as 18
percent of the vote. Less than 5 percent of those surveyed are
strongly positive toward Clark's performance. Controlled by
billionaire conservative media magnate Conrad Black, Vancouver's
two daily newspapers display their hostility on both news and
editorial pages.
</P>
<P>
   But chances for survival are often measured by the skills of
those seeking your demise. In this respect, Clark may blessed
almost as much as Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party's leader, former Vancouver Mayor Gordon
Campbell, is stiff and ill at ease in the cut-and-thrust of British
Columbia politics. He has fumbled explanations of why Liberal Party
aides were meeting with the RCMP before its raid of the premier's
home.
</P>
<P>
   The RCMP has never clearly explained the purpose of the raid, or
how BCTV was tipped off. A highly placed former police official
told the Toronto Globe &AMP; Mail: ``What I've seen here tells me
someone is after the premier. What they've done is convict him
without a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska may even come to Clark's rescue. U.S.-Canada salmon talks
reportedly have snagged on a call by Alaska to increase its catch
of British Columbia- and Northwest-bound chinook salmon. Such a
demand, if pressed, would vindicate Clark's militant stand toward
the province's neighbor to the north.
</P>
<P>
   In a parliamentary government, there are no set election dates.
The ruling party decides when it will face the voters. New
Democrats have until the spring of 2001 to call the election. The
date of Clark's widely predicted demise is, therefore, controlled
by Clark.

GEORGE LUCAS `SURPRISED' AT ATTENTION FILM IS GENERATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was only fitting that on the day to celebrate the
contributions of mothers everywhere, one of pop culture's biggest
Mr. Moms celebrated his latest child _ the most anticipated movie
in years.
</P>
<P>
   Director George Lucas, a single father of three and the force
behind ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' gushed the
morning after his latest opus was seen at a special screening for
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel proud,'' he said, grinning contentedly Sunday as
reporters swarmed around him with ``Star Wars'' books, posters and
blank scraps of paper to sign. ``Like a very proud mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he was surprised by the amount of attention his
latest baby is generating _ from the media coverage leading up to
the movie's launch May 19 to perhaps even the sight of usually
detached journalists treating him like, well, a Beatle.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed early reviews that have described the movie, filled
with computer graphics and humor, as being too puerile for some
tastes. ``I expect not to do well critically. I never have,'' Lucas
said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   The box office, however, is an entirely different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said he would be a little disappointed if his $110 million
``Phantom Menace'' does not become one of the top 10 grossing films
of all time, powered by the key demographic that has carried ``Star
Wars'' movies of the past: preteens and teens.
</P>
<P>
   As the old song goes, if you can make it here _ New York _ you
can make it anywhere. So when final credits for ``Phantom Menace''
rolled at the end of Saturday night's screening at a Manhattan
movie house, it appeared the swashbuckling adventure saga was on a
sanguine path.
</P>
<P>
   Polite applause _ punctuated by some lusty cheers _ filled the
theater as house lights came up. The most enthusiastic viewers were
young people, many of them teenagers, who were overheard saying,
``That was so cool'' and ``I'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   One man, a 39-year-old New York real estate executive, summed up
the movie this way: ``It was not like the first three,'' referring
to the trilogy of ``Star Wars,'' ``The Empire Strikes Back'' and
``Return of the Jedi.'' ``It was fun. I mean, I enjoyed it. But
would I see it three times in a row? Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phantom Menace'' is hardly short on hype. The movie's
producer, Rick McCallum, said the intense attention stems from
``underground'' channels of information, such as Web sites, and to
a lesser degree from traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done 50 percent fewer interviews'' for this movie than
others in the series, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the power and scope of the Internet, McCallum said
he found a 65-page review of ``Phantom Menace'' by a young man who
had not seen the flick. ``It was a review of other people's
reviews,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But hype, in whatever form it comes, has made the movie very
hip.
</P>
<P>
   People outside the theater before the media screening were ready
to fork out $50 for passes issued to reporters. The event also
attracted actors Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson, who are in
the movie, radio shock jock Howard Stern and rap music mogul
Russell Simmons, who are not.
</P>
<P>
   At ground zero of the New York event, the Regency Hotel on tony
Park Avenue, where rooms normally run $350 a night, the presence of
the Lucas and ``Phantom Menace'' stars overshadowed other hotel
guests, including Elizabeth Taylor and George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   But early word on Lucas' newest movie has been mixed. A headline
in the New York Post dubbed the film ``Luke-Warm Skywalker'' _ and
irked ``Star Wars''-holics by publishing spoilers, or key plot
points. In Sunday's New York Daily News, a review of the movie gave
it two-and-a-half stars. Monday's Los Angeles Daily News gives it
three-and-a-half stars.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Levy, a film critic for The (Portland) Oregonian, said he
enjoyed ``Phantom Menace'' but preferred another spring release,
``The Matrix,'' a sci-fi thriller starring Keanu Reeves and
Lawrence Fishburne.
</P>
<P>
   Luaine Lee, who covers Hollywood for Scripps-Howard News
Service, wrinkled her face and said Lucas' flick ``was a little too
long for my tastes.'' Liz Leyden of The Washington Post enjoyed the
movie, but thought it stopped short of ``the sacred aura''
generated by the trilogy. ``Is it sacrilegious for me to say
that?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics said they thought the plot did not rise to
expectations; still others said a ``Star Wars'' series staple _ the
opening scroll of words _ was confusing. ``Got me totally lost,''
one gray-haired critic huffed.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever its perceived shortcomings, the movie has the stuff
the entire world has come to expect from Lucas: swashbuckling
light-saber duels, eye-candy costumes and out-of-this-world special
effects, including an amazing pod race that conjures up images of
the chariot race in ``Ben Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it has some surprises like... well, to say more would
unleash the wrath of Jedis everywhere!
</P>
<P>
   Still, the movie's actors found the experience of being
connected to Lucas' celluloid legacy life-changing and eye-opening.
</P>
<P>
   Portman, a high school senior who plays Queen Amidala, was
stoked to see herself bedecked on the big screen in ornate, regal
gowns, some of which took months to make. ``They were the most
beautiful costumes I have ever seen on film,'' she said Sunday.
``It makes you feel like a queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Best had the challenge of playing a computer-generated
character called Jar Jar Binks,a fresh entry to Lucas' universe.
Best was amazed at how Lucas ``painted in'' digital worlds around
the acting he performed against a blue screen. A graphic artist,
plying high-tech software, then melded computer images with film to
bring his character to ``life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' said Best, who cut his acting chops in the
San Francisco production of the musical ``Stomp'' before becoming
Jar Jar Binks _ a character with floppy ears, loopy gait and speech
that sounds like Caribbean patois blended with hip-hop rap.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those little details, all those computer graphics,'' said
Best, adding, Jar Jar will be a big hit with kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had enough of the bang 'em up, shoot 'em up,'' he said
stroking his neatly trimmed goatee. ``It is nice to have a cute
little scary creature to look up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Liam Neeson, who plays a Jedi warrior, said he is still
processing the technical wizardry of the film. While acting, he had
to draw on deep reservoirs of imagination because many of the
creatures and special effects were added to scenes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to see it at least two more times to digest it and be
able to talk about it,'' Neeson said, with a look of marvel on his
face. He was equally amazed by the attention surrounding the movie,
calling it ``a strange hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been wild,'' a wonderfully composed Twentieth Century
Fox publicist said. ``This has been so big. Nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not bigger than Lucas himself. Sunday morning, he walked in
a conference room, wearing a brown blazer, blue-and-white checked
shirt and a visage of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   He answered question after question. Some smart. Some dumb. He
spoke about his love for fans, for storytelling and of his movies'
universal themes about taking risks and having courage. He said he
had 100 movies burning inside him, but given his age, perhaps only
20 left to direct. He talked about his other passions, family and
writing. And he discussed his plans to finish two more ``Star
Wars'' movies _ chapters two and three _ before pulling the plug on
the series.
</P>
<P>
   What about chapters seven, eight and nine? a reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Who will direct them then?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one else will,'' Lucas said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the mother of the Force got up from a table and slipped
off, presumably to a galaxy far, far away.

LACK OF URGENCY HURTING DODGERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eric Karros says it's only May. Gary Sheffield
says that is the Dodgers' biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield said it wasn't three home runs off Chan Ho Park that
killed his team in Sunday's ugly 6-4 loss to the lowly Florida
Marlins in front of 29,397 at Dodger Stadium. He said they blew a
four-run lead in the final four innings because they don't play
with a sense of urgency, especially against a patsy that was
winless in nine weekend games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we are not intimidating anyone,'' Sheffield said. ``We
haven't shown anyone any reason to be afraid of us. We did the
first six games and nothing since then. We're too lackadaisical,
just thinking it's going to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros is not wrong saying the season still has a long way to
go. Maybe it was too much fun starting the season 5-1. After
hearing the San Francisco Giants' loss to the Milwaukee Brewers
kept the 17-14 Dodgers 1{ games back in the National League West,
Karros quipped, ``I don't think we've been eliminated, yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is that perception the past few seasons that has found
the Dodgers having to claw and scratch in September without
success. It was an attitude that made management finally realize
they weren't going to win regardless of how many Mike Piazzas they
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other team was supposed to be flat after Friday's game,''
said Sheffield the former Marlin, who singled twice, walked, stole
a base and scored two runs. ``Not us.''
</P>
<P>
   So they added Kevin Brown and things were supposed to change.
When Brown overpowered the Marlins on Saturday night, the crowd
roared its approval. They were booing again on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Park and four relievers walked eight batters. Florida scored two
runs in the sixth, seventh and eighth. Cliff Floyd and Todd
Dunwoody each hit their first home runs of the year; pinch-hitter
Preston Wilson, who seldom plays despite having more home runs
(six) than the rest of the starting lineup combined, tied the game
at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't come inside today,'' reserve catcher Paul LoDuca
said of Park. ``He has a great fastball, but he was keeping it out
over the plate. I don't care who you are, after a while
major-league hitters are going to hit those.''
</P>
<P>
   Park survived a 28-pitch first inning that might have been one
of the worst in recent memory. He walked the bases loaded but came
out of the inning with a 1-0 lead because Marlins starter Jesus
Sanchez walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Park settled down, retiring 11 straight and 12 of 13, and took a
4-0 lead into the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had added to his cushion with a two-run double by
Devon White in the third and an RBI single by Raul Mondesi in the
fifth. But even as Park looked ready to breeze to his third
consecutive victory, there were warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   White felt a tug at his right hamstring running down Greg
Counsell's fifth-inning drive to the gap in right center and left
after his double. White said later the injury is not serious, but
he won't play in tonight's series opener against the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse after Park left the game. Pedro Borbon (0-1)
opened the seventh by walking Floyd, who later scored the winning
run on a bloop single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Florida added another run when Karros threw away a relay during
a rundown play. But damage already was done. Three Florida
relievers, including winning pitcher Brian Edmondson (2-1), limited
the Dodgers to one hit in the final 41/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big inning, then take five innings off,'' Sheffield
said. ``The next thing we know we're down by two and we're trying
to play with a sense of urgency. In Florida, we had a saying, `One
heartbeat.' We've got to be relentless. When you do that, you're
going to win the majority of your games.''

   PAINESVILLE, Ohio _ His hands held high over his head, Michael
Warren jabbed at his thumb with a knife as bright and shiny as the
phalanx of motorcycles that surrounded him. Some people in the
crowd winced and turned away, but when they looked back again,
Warren still had not managed to tease out the drop of ritual blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a sharper knife,'' someone yelled, and the rest of the
crowd laughed. Finally, Warren leaned into the effort and brought
some blood to the surface. He held up his thumb for all to see and
uttered the same words he had said each first Sunday in May for the
last 16 years: ``Let this be the only drop of blood shed on Ohio's
roads this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he bent down and ground his thumb into the dirt track of
the Lake County Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Thus another ``Louie Run'' was officially dedicated. It was a
far cry from the original, in which Warren and 60 others gathered
to mourn the passing of Louie Ivcovic, the proprietor of a local
bar. This year, more than 5,000 bikers participated.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other bar owners in the county, Ivcovic had welcomed the
bikers and provided them with beer and a place to organize their
deer-hunting parties. His biker friends decided to mark the first
anniversary of his death by riding in a pack to his grave and then
having a big party.
</P>
<P>
   The following year saw more deaths within the biker community,
so the group added a few words on their behalf to the Louie Run.
The event has grown rapidly since then, and is now considered the
kickoff for northern Ohio's motorcycle season.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's Louie Run, on May 2, the bikers rode in packs
from 12 different sites for the all-day event, which also featured
bands, bike games, a tattoo contest and the wedding of Dennis
Slother and Gretchen Bryan, who rode to the ceremony on matching
blue Harley-Davidsons and were married by a leather-clad minister.
``They had 5,000 people at their wedding,'' Warren said. ``Kings
and queens couldn't do better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Louie Run is more than an occasion for bikers to air out
their black leather chaps and polish their chrome. The event is
also a serious fund-raiser for a number of causes that the bikers
hold dear. Last year, Louie Run Inc., a nonprofit charitable
organization, gave away more than $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake County Society for the Rehabilitation of Children and
Adults, which provides therapy and socialization to about 6,000
clients, receives the biggest amount. The bikers began making
donations to the society in honor of Ivcovic's son, who is a
client, and have given it more than $50,000 over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good friends,'' Ann Dietrich, the society's executive
director, said of the bikers. ``At our annual dinner, we usually
have two or three tables of people from the Louie Run in their
black leather vests, sitting next to the businessmen and little old
ladies who support our program. There's a long row of their bikes
right outside the windows so they can keep an eye on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another recipient of Louie Run largess is Cleveland's Rainbow
Babies and Children's Hospital. Each year, the hospital compiles a
wish list of toys and art supplies used to entertain patients and
their siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The Louie Run committee and hospital staff go shopping together,
then the bikers arrive in formation at the hospital to deliver the
items, visit the bedridden children and place the ones who are well
enough on their bikes. ``They arrive in their black leather outfits
and the kids just love it,'' said Tammy DeMario, a former
child-life specialist at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of teddy bear image is hardly what attracted these
bikers to the motorcycle subculture. Most members of the Louie Run
committee are burly, bearded men in their 40s who started riding in
their teens, drawn to all the mayhem that the biker life implied.
Now that they are hard-working citizens, they hope the Louie Run
will change the minds of those who still see bikers as bad guys
looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But they may not want to change minds too much. Committee member
Roy Butzer's tattoos _ a skull-faced snake coiling from a scar on
his arm and a massive Harley-mounted skeleton gloating on his back
_ are hardly reassuring images.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still like it sometimes when I walk into a room and people
move out of the way,'' Butzer admitted, braiding his long black
beard, then holding its ragged ends up to the light for inspection.
``I must say that I still do.''

20 MILLION BEES SPILL IN ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALMOUTH, Maine _ The highway north of Portland was abuzz with
activity Sunday after a truck carrying nearly 20 million bees
tipped over on a ramp and unleashed its angry load in swarming
clouds over the interstate.
</P>
<P>
   State Police closed parts of the Maine Turnpike and Interstate
295 for about seven hours after the flatbed tractor-trailer
carrying the bees flipped around 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of bees floating around, and you could tell
that it wasn't normal,'' said Chad Fox, an attendant at a nearby
Mobil gas station.
</P>
<P>
   The truck carried 400 hives, each home to about 40,000 bees, but
few injuries were reported. Five firefighters were stung but none
seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But the swarming bees spread, hovering around the neon light
from the gas station, and covering the flower bushes in front of a
restaurant off the highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were peppered with bees,'' said Cindy Burnett, owner of
the Moose Crossing Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on tips from beekeepers who heard about the crash,
firefighters hosed the dumped hives with water to calm the bees as
they loaded the hives onto another truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bees think it's raining and they won't leave the hives,''
Falmouth Fire Chief James Robertson told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Trooper James McCarthy said the area was reopened
at about 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the truck was at the scene and did not appear to
be hurt, firefighters said. Police believe the truck came from
Florida, but they did not know the name of its owner or where the
driver was from, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Truckloads of bees are brought into Maine every spring to help
pollinate apple and blueberry blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a first,'' Robertson said. ``I've been doing this for
30-some-odd years, but I've never run into bees before.''

EARLY CONGRESSIONAL RACE'S WINNER COULD TURN OUT TO BE VOTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. _ With the campaign already heating up for next
year's 27th District congressional race, local officials see
nothing but opportunity for their communities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Republican Rep. James Rogan and Democratic
state Sen. Adam Schiff, both based in Pasadena, have been focusing
on hot-button issues, attempting to become the hero in the battles
over noise restrictions at the regional airport and a controversial
hillside housing project.
</P>
<P>
   California's 27th congressional district covers the well
established satellite cities of Burbank, Glendale and Pasedena
bordering Los Angeles to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two favorite sons competing to be the white knight,''
said Rob Sharkey, president of the Glendale Homeowners Coordinating
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank City Manager Robert ``Bud'' Ovrom said the city will
take full advantage of the competition in its fight to get a
mandatory curfew and a noise budget at Burbank Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is to use both of them to the maximum. We're
willing to exploit them. It will be nonpartisan exploitation,''
Ovrom said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point both men planned their own ``peace summits'' on the
airport issue, which pits airport officials' designs for expansion
against residents' worries over increased noise and traffic in a
high-spending battle spanning years. Rogan is eagerly awaiting an
answer from the Federal Aviation Administration to his question
about whether the airport can impose a curfew without getting
federal approval. Schiff on Friday called on the FAA to grant a
mandatory curfew for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff has asked for a $5million budget allocation from the
state to buy the Oakmont V property in Glendale to preserve the
brushy hillside land as open space. Rogan sought $20,000 in federal
funds to pay for an appraisal of the Oakmont property as the first
step in securing federal money to purchase the land.
</P>
<P>
   If either one is successful in stopping Oakmont V, Sharkey
predicted it will translate into solid votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could bring that trophy home it would guarantee a trip
to Washington,'' Sharkey said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Schiff announced last month that he would take on Rogan,
who soared to national fame as one of the most prominent House
managers in the impeachment of President Clinton _ a role that has
made him a target of Democratic Party wrath and especially
vulnerable because the district could go either way.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Rogan resisted GOP pressure to challenge
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein next year and decided to seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The race is being watched on a national level and will bring in
heavy contributions from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan is hitting up pro-impeachment Republicans who think of him
as a political star, while Schiff works Democrats who want to see
Rogan ousted as revenge for his impeachment role.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle locally has both men focused like never before on
the most emotional issues for their constituents. While both
candidates insist they have been tirelessly dedicated to
constituents' needs since the day they took office, district
residents agree both are taking much more aggressive approached to
local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of them cared about the airport issue at all until
they were pitted against each other,'' Ovrom said. ``It was a
little awkward during the battling summits.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have insisted they've been working on the
airport issue well before the competition started, with Schiff
noting he called for a mandatory curfew as far back as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the competition is the fact that they have so many of
the same constituents. Rogan's congressional district is located
completely inside Schiff's state Senate district.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a rematch of sorts. Rogan disposed of Schiff twice in
1994, when they both ran for the 43rd District Assembly seat,
beating him first in a June special election and then again in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan is a former Los Angeles County prosecutor and municipal
court judge and Schiff is a former federal prosecutor. Schiff's
profile has been rising steadily since his 1996 election to the
state Senate and he's expected to provide a strong challenge
against Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political science professor at Claremont
Graduate School, said the dynamic is interesting because Rogan and
Schiff, who are political opposites, are taking the similar
positions on local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not leave your opponent alone in the center ring,
especially on issues voters care about,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   This race has started earlier than most, in part because of all
the furor over impeachment, which has been a doubled-edged sword of
sorts for Rogan. He won his second term in November with just
50.7percent of the vote, squeaking by an opponent he outspent by
more than 2 to 1. His 27th District is now 45percent Democrats and
38percent Republicans and voters there supported Clinton in both
1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan's campaign manager Jeff Lennan said he and a cadre of
volunteers are overwhelmed by the task of responding to the 20,000
citizens nationwide who have written Rogan offering to help him
retain his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen his donor base expand considerably,'' Lennan said.
``I was running through our contribution records and we've got 16
donors from Alabama and 23 donors from Connecticut. It's nothing
we've ever seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan recently sent out a campaign fund-raising piece to
conservative activists nationwide seeking ``emergency pledges of
support'' to defend himself against an anti-impeachment backlash.
The mailer is topped with quotes from Democratic officials and
Hollywood media mogul David Geffen, all predicting Rogan's defeat.
Then there is personal letter from Rogan starting with the
question: ``Are we going to let them get away with it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to know from you ... am I going to fight this battle
against Bill Clinton alone? Or can I count on you to help me to
stand against Bill Clinton,'' Rogan writes in the mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Lennan said this mailer was sent out to 60,000 conservative
activists nationwide about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lennan acknowledged that the competition has already started to
impact local issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, these issues are going to be used as political
footballs,'' Lennan said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff said his competition with Rogan is ``great for the
district.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last couple of months Rogan has had to play catch-up,''
Schiff said. ``I have no doubt we will force him to advocate for a
curfew at the airport.''

`ZO' STAYING IN CHECK
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning says he
has learned his lesson. Says he won't do it again. Says he has his
temper in check.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Mourning knows until the moment comes when he has to choose
between taking a swing at an opponent and turning the other cheek
and walking away from a potential altercation _ and he chooses the
latter _ no one believes a word he says. Mourning proved last year
that he would rather fight than let cooler heads prevail.
</P>
<P>
   With 1.4 seconds left in Game 4 of last year's best-of-five
first-round playoff series against the New York Knicks, Mourning
was ejected for fighting Larry Johnson. Both players also were
suspended for the decisive Game 5, which Miami lost because the
Heat probably couldn't win the Continental Basketball Association
title without Mourning in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The fight and subsequent suspension meant Mourning had to endure
a summer of radio-talk-show blabber-mouths blaming him for the
Heat's early exit from the playoffs. And it means he has to prove
that he would rather win than fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always my fault, partner,'' Mourning said. ``If we lose,
it's my fault; if we win, it's my fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm going to be the goat, regardless. I'm just being
truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case Saturday when the Heat lost its playoff opener
to the Knicks, 95-75, despite having the home-court advantage.
Mourning scored 27 points on 10-for-16 shooting, but he knows his
image won't improve unless he can lead the Heat to victory in Game
2, and to an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old, seventh-year center from Georgetown says he has
taken steps to control his anger, and they seem to be working.
</P>
<P>
   In the 46 games Mourning played in this season, he was ejected
only once. Two years ago, he fouled out of nine games. Last year,
he sliced the number to five. This year, he drew no
disqualifications except the ejection.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he might be drawing more cheers than jeers this year.
He is considered a top candidate for most valuable player and has
the statistics to warrant consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, San Antonio's Tim Duncan and Sacramento's Chris Webber
are the only players who averaged at least 20 points and 11
rebounds per game in the regular season. Mourning also led the NBA
in blocked shots with 3.91 per game.
</P>
<P>
   But the most compelling statistics in Mourning's MVP case might
be from the four games he didn't play. Heat opponents scored 96.3
points per game and shot 51 percent from the field while he was
sidelined with an eye injury; in the 46 games he played, Heat foes
averaged 83 points and shot 40 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   He held opposing starting centers to an average of 8.8 points
and 6.6 rebounds per game, while averaging 20.1 points and 11
rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been doing a yeoman's job every day in practice and in
games,'' Heat point guard Tim Hardaway said. ``He's been trying to
do what we ask him to do. We don't even talk about defense, because
he's been exceptional on defense. But he's an all-around ballplayer
now.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Mourning's game was never a question with Heat fans and
the coaching staff. It was his temper that worried them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Alonzo knows what he has to do for us to achieve our
ultimate goal,'' Hardaway said. ``He's one of the nicest guys you'd
ever want to meet, and he has worked extra hard in doing all of the
things that he needs to do in order for us to be considered an
elite team.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat coach Pat Riley has also talked with Mourning about how to
avoid being goaded into adverse situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to get to where we want to get to _ and that
is the championship _ we need to have Alonzo on the court as much
as possible,'' Riley said. ``And he knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he knows that he must remain consumed with winning a title,
not consumed with anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult, but you live and learn,'' Mourning
said. ``And I definitely learned. I definitely, definitely
learned.''

ILLNESS OF `THE ONLY COACH' CAPS A LOUSY WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ To some, it seems, Tom Landry is still The
Only Coach the Cowboys Have Ever Had.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they know better. All things must change. But Landry was
turned loose one winter's night 10 years ago, and some erstwhile
Cowboys fans haven't darkened the turnstiles at Texas Stadium
since.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Saturday's news of his grave illness, leukemia, must shake
them. It does me.
</P>
<P>
   I thought that Tom Landry, like his golfing friend Bob Hope, was
going to live forever.
</P>
<P>
   He still might. If anyone can invent the perfect Flex defense to
fight leukemia, Tom probably will.
</P>
<P>
   Leukemia is curable, the medical journals say. There are
chemotherapy sessions, radiation treatments, blood transfusions.
And if Staubach could come in in the last two minutes and save him,
you know Roger would.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, this just rounds off a lousy week.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys family gathered in Addison on Saturday for a
memorial service for the late Mark Tuinei, it had the news of
Landry's cancer to add to their sorrow and prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, sick? It can't be. He had had the usual assortment of
old football injuries, especially to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   But Landry had to be the only 74-year-old in the country who was
still at his NFL playing weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just amazing,'' an old rival, Joe Gibbs, had observed
respectfully on a trip through Texas last month.
</P>
<P>
   What Gibbs and others didn't realize was that Landry was already
sick and that Tom's Mount Rushmore facade was about to be
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been ludicrous to see the quiet, dapperly dressed
head coach depicted as a meek, cheek-turning, born-again Christian.
Clearly, Landry forgives his transgressors _ he took Owner Jones
off the hook and accepted a Ring of Honor induction, didn't he?
</P>
<P>
   But as former teammates Pat Summerall and Frank Gifford have
often reminded us, Landry was one mean, head-hunting New York
Giants defensive back. And he certainly didn't coach meek defenses.
</P>
<P>
   His strength, however, has to have tested Landry in the years
since he left the Cowboys. The Landrys, Tom and Alicia, lost their
youngest daughter, Lisa, to cancer four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Landry Childress, like her father, was an exceptional
person. She was diagnosed with cancer in 1991. But she was also
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor advised Lisa to have an abortion so that chemotherapy
treatments could begin immediately. Lisa, however, said no.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the baby _ they named her Christina _ was born,
the mother underwent a liver transplant. Lisa finally lost her long
fight with the cancer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never regretted her decision,'' Tom has told us. ``She was
a real inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lisa Landry Childress Foundation was formed in 1995 to honor
her memory and to raise public awareness of organ donations. The
social highlight of the foundation is its annual ``Golf with the
Legends'' tournament.
</P>
<P>
   As testimonial to Tom's own ``legend,'' the field that shows up
for the golf tournament reads like a Hall of Fame roll call. Landry
seemed especially proud last year that ``my quarterbacks'' all
showed up _ Staubach, Danny White, Craig Morton and, yes, even Don
Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   It seems somehow inappropriate to bring up Landry's record here.
His 270 wins are the third most in NFL coaching history. He took
teams to five Super Bowls, winning two. He coached the Cowboys to
20 consecutive winning seasons, a distinction that grows more
remarkable with each passing season. Landry himself was inducted
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But there I go, sounding like I'm eulogizing the coach, when the
message from the Landry family is that they expect Tom to recover.
</P>
<P>
   It seems incongruous, in a way, to be asking Cowboys fans to
pray for Tom Landry. Ours seem so insignificant for someone who has
walked so tall.
</P>
<P>
   But I think the coach needs us. And if Roger has one more Hail
Mary, now may be the time.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a lousy week.  &LR; tagtop:Gil LeBreton, (817) 390-7760

STARS PREFER TO SKIP TALK ABOUT TROUBLE WITH POWER PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Ken Hitchcock said it's twice as hard to
score on the power play in the playoffs. And by watching the Stars
the past two seasons, he has obtained plenty of evidence to back
that up.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the rest of the NHL doesn't follow the same
trend. While the Stars have seen their power-play success rate
during the past two seasons decline from 19 percent in the regular
season to 8.9 percent in the playoffs, the rest of the NHL has held
steady at 15 percent in both the regular season and postseason.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's so much harder to find open space in the
playoffs and that's reflected in our power play,'' Hitchcock said.
``I think every aspect of the playoffs is harder for goal scorers
and that means that goal scorers have to work that much harder.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Stars have yet to lose in this season's playoffs and
Hitchcock continues to say the power play isn't a problem, it's
clear the lack of success with the man advantage can hurt the Stars
in a future series or even tonight when their best-of-seven Western
Conference semifinal series with the Blues moves to St. Louis for a
6:30 game at Kiel Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough situation right now,'' Stars leading scorer Joe
Nieuwendyk said. ``We know it has to get better, so we keep working
at it getting better. But if we start talking about it, start
worrying about it, start holding it up for public debate, we're
just putting more pressure on ourselves and hurting ourselves even
more.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a Catch-22 situation that could begin to steamroll the
Stars if they're not careful. The more they fumble their power-play
chances, the more pressure they feel. The more pressure they feel,
the more they fumble their power-play chances. Game 2 against the
Blues, a Stars' 5-4 victory in overtime Saturday at Reunion Arena,
was clearly the low point for the team's power play in the
playoffs. The Stars went 0-for-4, were outshot 3-1 and gave up four
solid short-handed chances that could have easily been turned into
Blues goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it's not taking energy out of our game, we can live
with it,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   But why live with it? Why not thrive on the power play? Why not
use the obvious talent they have with the man advantage _ they have
scored more power-play goals during the past two regular seasons
(151) than any other team in the NHL _ to open up some breathing
room in the playoffs? Why not win a game by more than one goal _
something the Stars have done only once in their six playoff
victories?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we have talented players and we know we can score on
the power play, it's just not going in right now,'' defenseman
Darryl Sydor said. ``Sometimes you just struggle to beat a hot
goaltender in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars must keep finding the hot ones, because no one else
has a problem. During the past two regular seasons, the NHL has
averaged a success rate of 15.1 ('97-98) and 15.8 ('98-99). During
the past two postseasons, the league has averaged 14.1 ('97-98) and
16.5 percent ('98-99).
</P>
<P>
   Power-play success has actually gone up in this season's
playoffs. The Stars, meanwhile have dropped from an 18.8 percent
success rate on the power play during the regular season and an
average of .90 power-play goals per game to a success rate of 5.9
percent and an average of .28 power plays per game in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   And they've done that for three consecutive seasons in the
playoffs. That's not a glitch, it's a serious trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that really hurt last year and something that
obviously has to be better,'' center Mike Modano said. ``We just
have to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are a team that has high skill at the top level in
Modano, Nieuwendyk and Brett Hull _ not a trio that generally likes
to mix it up in front of the net. So is that the reason the power
play is so much worse when it comes to postseason play?
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly think that sometimes the puck just doesn't go in,''
Modano said. ``We've faced some pretty good goaltending in the
playoffs over the past few years and I think that's a big reason.
It's not like we haven't had some great scoring chances.''
</P>
<P>
   With power-play specialists like the aforementioned forward trio
and defensemen Sergei Zubov and Darryl Sydor, the Stars have proved
they have talent with the man advantage. Zubov has quarterbacked
No. 1-ranked power plays with the Stars, Penguins and Rangers.
Nieuwendyk played for a No. 1-ranked power play in Calgary, and
Hull led the Stars with 15 power-play goals _ ranking him fifth in
the NHL during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the results?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the things that will only make it worse is if
we just keep talking about it and analyzing it and talking about
it,'' Hitchcock said. ``What you have to do with the power play,
especially in the playoffs, is simplify. You have to shoot the puck
and you have to get traffic to the front of the net, and that's
what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he will play Derian Hatcher in front of the net
on the power play and that the return of Pat Verbeek from
suspension will be important to team grittiness with the man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams we see that are successful are the ones that shoot
the puck on net and then go get the rebound,'' Hitchcock said.
``It's rarely the first shot that scores on the power play. It's
more often the second or third or even fourth. We have to find a
way to get to those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or get ready for even more pressure from fans,
media and opponents. nn

`PARADE' LEADS THE DRAMA DESK AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Parade,'' the financial flop about a 1915 Atlanta
lynching, led all contenders in the 1999 Drama Desk Awards Sunday
night, taking six awards including outstanding new musical.
``Wit,'' which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for drama last month,
was named outstanding play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swan Lake,'' Matthew Bourne's modern interpretation of
Tchaikovsky's storybook ballet, won five awards, including nods for
outstanding choreography and outstanding direction of a musical for
Bourne. Trevor Nunn was named outstanding director of a play for
his work on Tennessee Williams' ``Not About Nightingales,'' which
won four awards, including three in the major design categories:
lights, set and costumes.
</P>
<P>
   In the acting categories the Drama Desk chose Brian Dennehy (in
``Death of a Salesman'') as outstanding actor in a play and
Kathleen Chalfant (``Wit'') as outstanding actress. For
performances in musicals, Brent Carver (``Parade'') was named
outstanding actor, while Carolee Carmello (``Parade'') and
Bernadette Peters (``Annie Get Your Gun'') shared the award for
outstanding actress.
</P>
<P>
   In a category that is expected to be highly contested in next
month's Tony Awards, the award for outstanding revival of a play
was also shared, with ``Death of a Salesman'' and ``The Iceman
Cometh'' both being named winners. Both plays are nominated for the
Tony for best revival of a play. ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' was named outstanding musical revival.
</P>
<P>
   David Hare, who was overlooked in last week's Tony nominations,
was named as outstanding solo performer for his work in the
autobiographical ``Via Dolorosa.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drama Desk, which is composed of writers and critics who
cover New York's theater world, also gave several special awards,
including an honor for lifetime achievement to the theater
caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, the longtime caricaturist for The New
York Times Arts and Leisure section.

 INVESTIGATORS CONTEND FBI TRIED TO QUASH PLANE CRASH REPORT  (jw) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because he was convinced that terrorists could have been behind
the 1996 explosion of TWA Flight 800 off Long Island, a senior FBI
official tried to suppress an early federal report that found the
cause to be mechanical failure, not sabotage, according to
investigators for a Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   They said that in January 1997, six months after the plane
crashed into the Atlantic, killing all 230 people aboard, James
Kallstrom, who was in charge of the FBI's New York office, urged
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms not to forward its
report to the National Transportation Safety Board, which by then
was leaning toward a conclusion of mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   When ATF officials objected, saying that aviation safety was
potentially at stake, Kallstrom went over their heads to Raymond
Kelly, undersecretary of the Treasury for law enforcement, who then
ordered that the report be withheld, the subcommittee investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   In later internal memorandums, Kallstrom _ whose agency had
taken an early lead among various federal agencies investigating
the crash _ disparaged the ATF findings as ``speculative theory''
and ``unprofessional and reprehensible.'' The report focused on
fumes in a fuel tank as the probable source of an accidental
explosion and said there was no evidence of a bomb or missile.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kallstrom, who is retired, nor Kelly, who is now the
U.S. customs commissioner and was in Ireland on Sunday, could be
reached for comment. Debbie Weierman, an FBI spokeswoman in
Washington, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has said it gave the ATF report to the safety board in
March 1997, with a cover letter from Kallstrom. Safety board
officials said last week that there was no record the report had
been received, and no trace of any cover letter in the board's log
of official correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, a senior official of the board said that his agency
had, in fact, received a copy of the ATF report ``over the
transom,'' although no one could remember precisely when. In any
case, the official said, receiving the report was not a very
memorable event because it only confirmed what the board already
knew.
</P>
<P>
   The account of dissembling by the FBI official came as the
Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on administrative
oversight prepared to open a hearing Monday on the FBI's role in
the case and on the 24-page ATF report, which was completed in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But while the account cast new light on bureaucratic infighting
during the TWA 800 inquiry, there were no indications that
withholding the report had endangered public safety, or had even
affected the perceptions of the safety board investigators or the
progress of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after the crash in July 1996, investigators for
the safety board, which ordinarily has jurisdiction over crash
inquiries until criminality is established, worked closely with
counterparts from the ATF and understood informally that they had
no evidence of a bomb or missile.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by October 1996 _ several months before the ATF made its
report _ safety board officials were saying publicly that the cause
of the crash was probably mechanical, a view not endorsed by
Kallstrom and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Sunday the attempts by Kallstrom to
suppress and disparage the ATF report. A member of the Senate
subcommittee staff described virtually the same findings to The New
York Times on Friday on condition that they not be published until
Monday, the morning of the subcommittee's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee staff member said that if the FBI had told the
safety board about the ATF findings promptly, the Federal Aviation
Administration and the airlines over which it has jurisdiction
might have moved faster to accept recommendations, made in December
1996, to reduce the risk of future explosions by changing the
atmosphere in fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect on air safety of the bureaucratic squabbling
within the investigative agencies is hard to measure, according to
officials and aviation experts. And the FBI's stubborn adherence to
the theory of a bomb or missile did not appear to have much
influence on the debate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the safety board's recommendations on fuel tank
changes were instantly unpopular with the airlines and even with
some independent safety experts. But in interviews at the time,
none cited the still-open criminal investigation. Most said they
were disturbed only because the airlines, before a definitive
finding, were being asked to make costly changes to preclude a
problem that seemed to occur very infrequently.

   TWA Flight 800, a Boeing 747 bound for Paris, exploded over the
Atlantic a few minutes after it took off from Kennedy International
Airport on July 17, 1996. Ordinarily, the safety board would have
taken over the crash inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But this crash _ a horror atop the memories of the World Trade
Center and Oklahoma City bombings _ seemed to suggest the work of
terrorists, and the FBI quickly seized control, at one point even
barring safety board investigators from taking photographs of the
wreckage, much of which was retrieved from the ocean floor and
reassembled in a hangar at Calverton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation over the next few months seemed to go in two
directions _ the FBI favoring a theory that terrorists were
responsible, and safety board investigators favoring a theory of
mechanical failure. Neither was provable in the absence of
definitive evidence, but as time passed, the lack of evidence of a
bomb or missile began to tip the scales in favor of an accidental
cause.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash has still not been formally established,
but the safety board has said the plane was destroyed by an
explosion of fumes in the center fuel tank, and it has said it is
still searching for the source of the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, James Hall, safety board chairman, asked Congress for
``an explicit statutory basis'' for asserting primacy over
law-enforcement agencies in future cases like the Flight 800 crash.
``I think I failed in asserting our interest and authority'' in the
investigation of that crash, he told the aviation subcommittee of
the House Transportation Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on administrative
oversight, led by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, has delved into
problems at the FBI's crime laboratory, and its hearing was
expected to focus on allegations that the conduct of Kallstrom and
the FBI made the inquiry into Flight 800 more difficult, and may
have delayed the cause of air safety.

`NOT MUCH' LONGER FOR WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK and SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Jerry West took his familiar post in the Forum Club
tunnel on Sunday, and that alone was cause for a headline after a
six-week, self-imposed ban on game-day appearances. But West went a
step further, speaking publicly for the first time in weeks and
hinting once again that retirement was on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on NBC, the Lakers' top executive expressed
disappointment with the team's lack of effort for much of the
season, saying, ``We've been dysfunctional at times.''
</P>
<P>
   So knotted up over his team's play _ and the signing of Dennis
Rodman _ West had rarely attended a game since mid-March. His
hibernation even prompted Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain to
publicly criticize West for disappearing during hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the contrary, I've always been here,'' West said. ``It's
hard for me to watch games sometimes. I'm an emotional guy. It's
easier for me to watch games on television than it is at the
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   And when interviewer Jim Gray asked West how much longer he
could do his job, West said: ``Not much. Not much. Not much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you get to the point in your life where if your life
revolves around coming to the office, and one day you win and
everybody (says) what a smart guy you are and when you lose, what a
dumb guy you are,'' he said. ``I'm none of those. I'm me. I'm no
smarter than anyone else, I'm no dumber than anyone else. I care a
hell of a lot more than most people about this sport, particularly
about this team. That's my biggest problem.''
</P>
<P>
   West was complimentary of interim coach Kurt Rambis' performance
but would not rule out former Bulls coach Phil Jackson as a
candidate if Rambis is not retained. Jackson was recently critical
of the Lakers' handling of former Bull Rodman, who was waived after
a series of misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Lakers would consider Jackson, West said, ``He
doesn't think we do things very well around here.'' He also said
the Lakers were ``under pressure to hire a high-profile coach'' and
that Jackson's comments would not disqualify him from
consideration. But he quickly noted the Lakers don't have a
vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt Rambis is our coach right now, OK? I don't think we're
looking for a new coach at this point in time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Rambis) has done a great job under very trying
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   No jitters: Rambis wouldn't admit to being nervous at his first
foray into the postseason as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun time of the year; it's the most fun time of the
year. So it's not necessarily butterflies of nervousness; it's
butterflies of excitement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference being the coach? Never being able to escape the
game?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an all-day thought process for me,'' he said.
``Basketball and our team is the last thought on my mind before I
go to sleep and the first thought on my mind as soon as I wake up
in the morning.'' &QL; 
Bring back Rodman: Houston forward Charles Barkley, who scored 25
points Sunday, was asked if Rodman could guard him one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. That's why I was sad to see him go,'' Barkley said. &QL;

TO DELIGHT OF FISHERMEN, STRIPED BASS MAKE STRONG COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERPLANCK, N.Y. _ The Hudson River, which for years was a
forgotten waterway between more popular fishing grounds on the
Atlantic Coast and the Great Lakes, has become one of the hottest
spots for striped-bass fishing in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The schools of silver-streaked striped bass migrating up the
Hudson River on their annual spawning run are cleaner, more
plentiful and bigger than they have been in a generation, anglers
and New York state biologists say. And sport fishermen from Texas,
North Carolina, Michigan and Indiana are contributing to a boom in
the charter boat business up and down the river.
</P>
<P>
   In the broad bay near this sleepy village 40 miles north of
Manhattan, anglers who just a few years ago dreamed of landing a
30-pound trophy were catching 4-foot-long 40-pounders last week and
are now dreaming of 50-pound giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an incredible surge in the last five years,''
said Andrew Kahnle, a biologist for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation who has studied striped bass for 20
years. ``People have clearly figured out that the fish are back.''
</P>
<P>
   All along the East Coast, the bass are strongly rebounding from
past overfishing, repopulating rivers from Virginia to Maine,
including some _ like the Roanoke, Delaware and Kennebec _ where
they had largely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hudson the turnabout is even more striking, because
the bass here are overcoming another longstanding problem _
contamination with PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, industrial
chemicals that were dumped by factories in the upper reaches of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   Recent tests by New York state biologists have found that after
a long decline, the levels of PCBs in fish caught south of
Poughkeepsie have dropped enough to meet safety standards set by
federal officials. As a result, Gov. George Pataki has announced
that state fisheries officials are going to consider reopening the
commercial fishery for stripers on the river, which has been closed
since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   And the state Health Department has begun a review of the
warnings it posts about eating bass _ which now suggest that
pregnant women and children eat no river fish and others eat no
more than one meal a month of bass caught south of the town of
Catskill. Bass caught north of Catskill should not be eaten at all,
the advisory says.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is one of many people living along the river who happily
eat the fish in moderation. ``It's great,'' Pataki said as he
trolled for bass in Newburgh Bay on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the river, fishing activity has grown steadily over
the last decade. Unused boat slips are a rarity at marinas. Many
boat dealers say they are nearly sold out of the small craft used
for striper fishing. The combination of plentiful fish, a good
economy and cleaner water means lots of business, said Rich Pasiut,
the general manager of Prime Power Marine, in Newburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making up for a lot of tough years when people were just
hanging on by a thread,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Grant Scott, a professional fishing guide and
boat captain from Marshall Creek, Pa., took clients fishing in Lake
Ontario and along the Jersey Shore. But five years ago, after
reading an article about the Hudson's bass, he said, he tried
launching his boat here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish were just amazing,'' he said, describing how the
screen of his sonar fish finder would ``be a blackout'' _ so thick
with dark spots indicating fish that it looked dark.
</P>
<P>
   He spent several seasons learning the river, then last spring
began running $275-a-day spring charters in the Hudson for anglers
from as far away as Maryland. He has been fully booked ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Boating on the Hudson, an eight-year-old magazine, has seen its
spring and summer circulation grow from a few thousand to more than
22,000, said John Vargo, a retired designer of telecommunications
equipment and the magazine's advertising sales manager. Vargo, a
native of Verplanck, is an avid angler himself, dropping everything
in early May to net herring for bait and then camp out on his boat
on the river.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the return of large bass more evident than in the
waters off Verplanck, which for most of the century was a center
for commercial netting of shad and sturgeon on the Hudson, with
stripers usually a secondary, almost incidental, catch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, angling for bass is the dominant activity in May. On
Thursday, a cluster of boats grew steadily through the misty
morning as anglers converged over a sandy flat frequented by bass,
their fishing lines glinting like spider silk.
</P>
<P>
   The older fishermen here time the arrival of the bass by the
flowering of dogwood trees along the banks. That has always been
the case for Tucker Crawford, 73, a shad and sturgeon fisherman.
Now, though, his grandson Michael, 30, marks his calendar months
ahead of time, securing the first week of May for a vacation from
his janitorial job with the Metro-North Commuter Railroad so he can
take his boat, the Club, out on the river from dawn until dark at
the height of the bass run.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Michael Crawford hooked the fish of his
dreams, a great hulk that did not shake its head at the bite of the
barb the way small 14-pounders do. This one fought with sheer
power, he said, simply swimming away from the boat with the steady
momentum of a heavily loaded freight train.
</P>
<P>
   He sent a code word to fishing friends over the radio:
``submarine.'' This was going to be a trophy, he explained later,
not ``an eater.'' A small crowd of boats converged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were boats real close on both sides offering to help,
but after the first hour, it was personal _ between me and the
fish,'' said Crawford, a burly former wrestler. After 70 minutes of
hauling and reeling, he landed the giant, which now took up an
oversize purple cooler in his driveway, where it awaited a
taxidermist.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Crawford grew up on the river, helping his grandfather haul nets
from the age of 8. It was only in the last five years or so that he
fell in love with using a rod and reel. ``They usually clash _ the
commercial and the pole fisherman,'' he said. ``But I love both.
The commercial fishing has given me a little upper hand:
knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was disturbed to hear that many recreational anglers
opposed the possible return of commercial netting of stripers.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial fishermen have been part of the food chain in the
river for centuries, Crawford said, focusing mainly on shad, which
had a high value because of their delicate roe, but also selling
whatever stripers stumbled into their nets. Now it seemed
reasonable to let the few remaining shad fishermen on the river
resume catching stripers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a handful of the old-timers doing this,''
Crawford said. ``It's in their blood and their heart, and they live
for the river.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that there were more than enough fish in the river to
satisfy the sportsmen and the netters. ``It's like picking a few
grapes from a bushel basket out there,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   The day after he caught the 40-pound-8-ounce giant, which was
well below the state inland record of 48 pounds, 3 ounces, which
was set last year, Crawford was back on the water, this time so his
brother, Sean, 17, could catch a few 30-pounders. They quickly
caught their limit. (Fishermen may keep one striped bass per day
per person; others that are caught must be released.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of the sleek, expensive boats around him, equipped
with electronic fish finders, Crawford's boat was a well-worn old
craft with decks deeply infused with bass essence and herring
scales flecking the deck like sequins on a dance-hall floor.
</P>
<P>
   But the fancier boats tended to follow his every move. When
Crawford lifted his anchor to shift spots, his motions were soon
echoed by others.
</P>
<P>
   Farther upriver, 330 big-bass hunters were preparing for a
weekend fishing tournament whose first prize was a $20,000 boat.
Hard-core anglers are willing to pay lots of money to travel to
places where there is a ``trophy fishery'' _ waters containing big,
aggressive game fish that give an angler something to talk about
back home, said William Conners, a tournament organizer and
director of the Hudson Valley chapter of the New York State
Conservation Council, a private lobbying group representing anglers
and hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, they can simply drop a hook in the Hudson.
``People are starting to realize that they don't have to travel
halfway around the world for that anymore,'' he said. ``It's right
here in their back yard.''

<P>
   A charter bus carrying at least 46 people from a New Orleans
suburb to a Mississippi casino resort, many of them older women on
a Mother's Day trip, veered across a busy interstate highway and
into an embankment Sunday, killing 23 people and injuring 20.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known, but the bus
driver, who was critically hurt, was quoted by the bus company
operator and a hospital official as saying that he had swerved when
another vehicle suddenly passed in front of him. The front of the
bus was mangled, its tires twisted and pushed into the passenger
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   The police do not yet know how fast the bus was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   The bus accident was one of the worst in the nation's history,
according to National Transportation and Safety Board records. The
accident with the largest loss of life was in 1976 when a school
bus crashed in Yuba City, Calif., killing 29.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred about 10 a.m. as the bus was on its way to
the Casino Magic casino in Bay St. Louis, Miss., just across the
Louisiana line on the Gulf Coast. The bus had started out in
LaPlace, La., about 25 miles west of New Orleans, and was headed
east on Interstate 610 for the 90-mile trip.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said the bus veered across three lanes of
traffic, narrowly missing several vehicles. It hit the edge of a
guardrail and veered onto a tree-lined grassy area. It continued to
careen alongside the highway for about 50 yards, crashing through a
chain-link fence and then over a gully and into an embankment, a
police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen people were pronounced dead at the scene and four died
at hospitals, the authorities said. The bodies could not be removed
for four hours after the crash because of the extensive damage to
the front of the bus, which was so crumpled that its front wheels
were two feet off the ground. Rescue squads had to brace the bus
with timbers and use ladders to reach its windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people on top of each other, crushed between twisted
metal,'' Officer Joe Narcisse of the New Orleans Police told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen people were hospitalized and three were released after
emergency room treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Walker, a spokesman for Custom Bus Charters, based in
Gretna, La., said the bus was four years old, in good shape and had
undergone regular inspections and daily maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Walker identified the driver as Frank Bedell, 49, and said he
had a good driving record. ``We never had any problems with him. It
shocked me to find out that it was Frank Bedell, because he was one
of our good drivers.'' There were no passenger seat belts on the
bus, he said, because the only legally required seat belt is for
the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us at Custom Bus Charters are extremely saddened by
today's tragic accident,'' said Donna Begovich, the president of
Custom Bus. ``Our hearts go out to the families of all the
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Marc Morial said the New Orleans Police Department is
working with the NTSB to investigate the crash. He said the driver
would be tested for drugs and alcohol use, as is customary.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said that 46 people were on the bus, but that the list of
passengers was lost in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Romig said the hospital had opened four trauma operating rooms
and was calling in every available doctor and nurse. He said that
the crash was the worst he had seen in 20 years and that the
outlook for many of the injured was poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some very badly injured people, and the fact that
they're elderly doesn't help at all,'' he said. ``Some were in
their 70s, some in their 80's, and that makes it doubly tough. It
makes it more difficult for them to sustain trauma, especially
chest injuries.''
</P>

<P>
   Four other gambling charter buses, bound for casinos in Atlantic
City, crashed in New Jersey in late December and early January. The
most serious Atlantic City crash occurred on Christmas Eve, killing
eight people.
</P>
<P>
   As in Atlantic City, which does not have a large enough local
population to support its gambling industry, the casinos along the
Gulf Coast often provide inexpensive package tours, meals or other
incentives to attract customers from hours away, often from
surrounding states. Many of these customers, most of them elderly,
visit only for the day.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, it is a common practice for casinos to pay bus
companies to organize excursions for the elderly, although it was
not immediately known whether Custom Bus had such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the passengers on the bus Sunday were members of an
informal club that went to the casino twice a month, George Tassin,
a relative of eight of the passengers, told The Associated Press.
Tassin's wife, daughter and an aunt were among the injured, he
said, as he waited outside the hospital where they were taken.
</P>
<P>
   He said his aunt was making her first trip since the recent
death of her husband. ``My aunt finally decided to go this one time
and this happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the crash site near the St. Bernard intersection several
miles from the French Quarter, bus seats lay on the roadway along
with broken glass and torn clothing. As traffic slowed alongside
Interstate 610, one elderly couple, Gloria and Wayne Bachemin, said
they had taken that charter trip before and had considered taking
the trip to Casino Magic that morning but had a family obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Bachemin worried that one of her friends might have been
a passenger Sunday. ``She was organizing a trip for this weekend,''
Mrs. Bachemin said. ``I just hope it was another bus. She's a
jovial person; she would have been sitting right up front, trying
to get people to sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Four more people had been waiting to board the bus in New
Orleans. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Satellite-guided bombs from a B-2 bomber struck the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on Friday night because
CIA analysts used outdated maps, and military databases designed to
catch such mistakes had the wrong address for the embassy, American
officials said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   When the target was initially checked against electronic mapping
data in American military and NATO computers to protect against
civilian casualties, no red flags were raised because half a dozen
different government databases had the location of the old Chinese
Embassy in another part of Belgrade, not the new one, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   With an investigation under way and NATO still blaming the CIA
for picking the wrong target, American officials said Sunday that
something obviously went horribly awry in translating the location
of the intended target into information the military uses to target
its satellite-guided bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The intended target was the headquarters of a Yugoslav arms
agency, picked because intelligence agencies have long suspected
that it helped rivals of America to develop advanced weapons and
that it sold weapons to help finance the Yugoslav military,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence analysts in Washington apparently picked the
Chinese Embassy for attack, which was in its current location for
only two years, without vetting from anyone on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the targets on NATO's hit list, the arms agency
was added only within the last several weeks, when allied planners
requested more sites to strike. Using both open and clandestine
sources, CIA analysts determined the street address of the arms
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using various intelligence, including photographs, and
comparing the arms agency's street address to the addresses of
other known buildings on the same street, the same analysts deduced
what they thought was the building that matched the street address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put an X on the map, but we put the X in the wrong place,''
one American official said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The arms agency and the embassy are about 200 yards apart.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was compounded when geographic coordinates for the
building, derived from aerial reconnaissance photographs, were
plugged into into the bombs' navigational system, officials said.
The bombs, which were dropped by a stealthy B-2 bomber on a 31-hour
roundtrip mission from its base in Missouri, flew precisely to
their assigned point, guided along the way by constantly updated
radio signals from a constellation of Navstar global positioning
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence failure led to a deadly case of mistaken
identity that killed at least three people and wounded 20. While
NATO spared Belgrade from bombing overnight Sunday, officials said
that military targets there had not been taken off the bombing
list.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Defense Secretary William Cohen and the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, faxed an unusual
joint statement to news organizations insisting that neither pilot
error or mechanical failure was to blame. Instead, they said, the
bombing was ``an anomaly that is unlikely to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, faulty information led to a mistake in the initial
targeting of this facility,'' the statement said. ``In addition,
the extensive process in place used to select and validate targets
did not correct this original error.''
</P>
<P>
   But with no further explanation than that for the accident, the
opaque statement gave no evidence for why American and NATO
officials are sure this will not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got confidence in the process and we're going to
continue to target,'' Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander,
said on the ABC News program ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pentagon and intelligence officials refusing to say
anything more about the mishap other than that it was under
investigation, these questions are still unanswered: Who was
involved in the initial targeting? Why were American officials in
Belgrade not consulted? Why was the location of the new embassy not
in the military computers? How were the two buildings confused?
</P>
<P>
   Several intelligence experts expressed dismay at such an
intelligence blunder. ``I'm absolutely dumbfounded,'' said one
senior retired American officer with extensive experience in
picking targets. ``They should have known long before this conflict
where that agency was located.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence experts said Sunday that the accident also raised
questions about the wisdom of the government's decision in 1996 to
fold the CIA's photographic intelligence center into a new Pentagon
agency, a move that prompted many of the agency's most experienced
analysts to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, NATO's track record in the seven-week air war has been
pretty good. After more than 5,000 bombing missions that have used
more than 15,000 missiles and bombs, there have been relatively few
mistakes, largely because of political constraints imposed on both
targets and pilots' tactics to avoid downed aviators and civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO began its strikes on March 24 with a list of about 100
targets, allied officials said. Most of those targets were selected
by military aides to Clark, working with military planners in
Belgium, Germany and Italy and with a special set of aides to the
Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the CIA also plays an important role, military officials
said. In fact, the targeting information for Serbian targets bombed
in Bosnia in 1995 was produced by the CIA's Balkans task force,
intelligence officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The target list is constantly being revised, with sites added or
dropped based on new intelligence and battlefield assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Once a target is identified for its military value, it is
checked and cross-checked for possible risks to civilians. ``Each
target has an assessment of high, medium or low collateral
damage,'' said one senior Air Force general, using the military
term for civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive targets, including the arms agency's
headquarters, require President Clinton's review and approval,
administration officials said. The intended target on Friday night,
the federal directorate of supply and procurement, has long been
suspected by the CIA of helping American rivals to develop advanced
weapons. American intelligence officials say Yugoslavia has a
rudimentary chemical weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say the CIA picked the headquarters building, but
American officials acknowledged that NATO, the U.S. European
Command and the Pentagon's Joint Staff all reviewed and approved
it.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   From the grainy airborne reconnaissance photographs of downtown
Belgrade that NATO military planners use to identify bombing
targets, the Chinese Embassy and a headquarters for a Yugoslav arms
agency situated nearby look very similar: same size, shape and
height.
</P>
<P>
   But at street level, there is no mistaking the embassy's marble
structure with blue mirrored glass, flying the distinctive Chinese
flag, from the Yugoslav military's white office building on the
other side of a major thoroughfare, Lenjinov Bulevar (Lenin
Boulevard).
</P>
<P>
   The address of the Chinese Embassy is No. 3, Ulica Tresnjevog
Cveta (or Cherry Blossom Street), and lies north of Lenjinov
Bulevar, the main highway running through New Belgrade. The address
of the arms agency headquarters is No. 2, Bulevar Umetnosti (or
Boulevard of the Arts), which lies south of Lenjinov Bulevar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone made an assessment of where on the street the target
was, using a variety of means,'' an American official said Sunday
night. ``We just didn't match the right street address on the right
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings were constructed two to three years ago. The arms
agency building is five stories high, a square, white stone or
concrete building, with a new wing under construction. The Chinese
Embassy is roughly five floors high, has a curved north end, and a
separate residence building at the back. The compound, with garden
at the back and parking for cars north and south, is encircled by a
heavy metal fence.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy underscores the
obvious limitations on the Pentagon's high-technology weaponry: The
thousands of precision-guided bombs and missiles are only as good
as the intelligence on which their targets are based.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Brig. Gen. Leroy Barnidge, commander of the Air
Force's B-2 wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, told
reporters that after more than 40 B-2 missions, ``everything had
gone where it's supposed to go and hit what it was supposed to
hit.``
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, that was also true Friday night. The B-2, carrying
up to 16 satellite-guided bombs called joint direct attack
munitions, carried out its assigned mission and hit its assigned
building with at least three of the bombs, American officials said
Sunday. Six Air Force B-2s had dropped more than 500 of the bombs
during the air campaign, Barnidge said last week.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, some influential lawmakers said the embassy strike
was a sign that U.S intelligence capabilities are stretched too
thin. ``I say it's a reaping of the harvest of the underinvestment
in our intelligence capabilities,'' Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who
heads the House Intelligence Committee, said on ``Fox News
Sunday.''

DODGERS' WHITE SIDELINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The day Eric Young returned to the lineup after
missing four games with a calf strain, the Dodgers learned Devon
White could miss the Chicago Cubs series with a tight right
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   White left Sunday's 6-4 Dodgers loss to the Florida Marlins
after doubling in the fifth inning. But he first injured his
hamstring tracking down Greg Counsell's drive in the top of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be playing (tonight), and it might be a few games,''
White said. ``But I wouldn't classify it as serious. We'll know
more before game time.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury comes during one of White's hottest stretches of the
year. He was 5 for 9 in the first two games of the series,
including a two-run single Saturday. He went 2 for 2 Sunday with a
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   White will be replaced in center by Todd Hollandsworth, who
missed most of April with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Young walked and scored in the first inning but flied out in his
other three at-bats. ``The leg felt fine,'' said Young, who was
held out of Saturday's game as a precaution. ``The extra day really
helped. Now we're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot Hundley: Catcher Todd Hundley has to miss games to rest his
surgically repaired right elbow, but it was difficult to sit Sunday
after finally getting hot at the plate. Hundley was batting .141
before going on a seven-game hitting streak that ended Sunday when
he went 0 for 1 as a pinch hitter. During the span, he batted .464
(13 for 28), including 5 for 8 in the first two games of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave that decision to (manager) Davey (Johnson),'' Hundley
said. ``If they want to give me some time off because of the elbow,
I understand. What I'm happiest about is that I've made some
adjustments at the plate. I'm not pulling my head out at the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick Hits: Florida's Preston Wilson, who hit the game-tying
homer, has six this season but isn't starting. He opened the season
in left when Cliff Floyd was injured, but hit just .198. Now he
only plays against the occasional left-hander. He took Dodgers
starter Chan Ho Park deep on a breaking ball. ``You have to go up
there confident he is going to make a mistake,'' he said. ``I'm not
worried about him throwing off speed, just hard stuff. I was
surprised.''... Gary Sheffield's fifth-inning stolen base was his
fifth and the 45th by the club. The Dodgers are on pace to steal
235 bases this season, 37 more than the Dodgers record of 198, set
in 1962.... The Marlins were 0-9 on weekends, 0-4 on Sunday. The
Dodgers are 0-3 on Sunday with one rainout.

SYDNEY GAMES ON SCHEDULE BUT PROBLEMS PERSIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ In the countdown to the Sydney Olympics _
now fewer than 500 days _ the recent focus has been more on
political problems than progress in preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is ahead of schedule on construction and organization for
the 2000 Summer Games, which are scheduled to open on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Yet controversies involving an Australian delegate to the
International Olympic Committee and the planned site on a Pacific
bay for the beach volleyball competition have entangled the local
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from recent scandals about alleged vote-selling by
IO C members may mean that Sydney receives less money from sponsors
to spend on some venues and comforts than it hoped. The Games'
management, the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games,
is government-controlled, with a $3 billion mix of official and
private financing.
</P>
<P>
   Delays by the IOC in dealing with allegations of corruption and
freeloading by some of its members _ including the Australian Phil
Coles _ disturb some business groups, slowing the flow of
sponsorship money.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Knight, a senior Sydney politician who is president of
the organizing committee, and his chief executive, Sandy Hollway,
called on Coles last week to resign from the committee, saying it
is inappropriate for him to serve while he remains the subject of
IOC investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, which will televise the
Games in the United States, and David F. D'Alessandro, president of
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., a major Games sponsor, also
urged Coles to quit.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Coles mounted Monday when Jackie Kelly,
Australia's Sports Minister, called for his resignation. Coles was
to meet Monday with Australian IOC member Kevan Gosper, who was
expected to push Coles to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney has not lost a sponsor, but it has anxiously noted the
precedent of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which recently pulled its $20
million sponsorship from the 2002 Winter Olympics at Salt Lake
City. Officials of those Games have admitted making extravagant
payments to IOC members who were involved in the vote that gave
Utah the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's current sponsorship shortfall is about $100 million.
This is manageable, according to Knight, who says it is only a
fraction of the overall budget of $1.7 billion for the specific
staging of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney committee executives say they expect to reach their
sponsorship target of about $500 million, though last week they did
cut $50 million from the budget as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   One sector being considered for cost cutting is the lavish
hospitality being sought by the 1,500 IOC officials and their
guests and staff who are expected to attend the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The scenery for the Games is important to NBC, which is paying
$600 million for the television rights and insisted that organizers
remove obtrusive power lines near some venues at a cost of $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has also encouraged Sydney organizers to resist demands by
residents of the surfside suburb of Bondi that the 10-day beach
volleyball event not be held there. NBC wants beach volleyball at
Bondi because the mile-wide Pacific bay is known internationally
and would make a fine backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, 1,000 angry Bondi residents held a noisy rally at the
beach, protesting plans to build a 10,000-seat temporary stadium
that would occupy much of the center of the beach for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Bondi Mayor Paul Pearce, who faces an election this year, has
lobbied for changes in the volleyball program but admits that NBC
negotiated rights to the venue.
</P>
<P>
   Bondi's Chamber of Commerce president, Gary Marx, says his
members are opposed to the stadium because they fear that
construction will disrupt the retail trade and that the new crowds
will not produce more business.
</P>
<P>
   And Peter Winkler, the protest committee spokesman, charges that
the stadium could damage the beach and would restrict public access
by swimmers, sunbathers and joggers.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials say the 50-foot-high grandstands will leave no
scars, but acknowledge that construction and dismantling will
interfere with use of the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who include young surfers and aging beach
regulars, vow civil disobedience unless the Games' organizers
retreat to another site. More than 450 have signed pledges to stand
before bulldozers or chain themselves to fences.
</P>
<P>
   There are no similar problems at the other competition sites.
Most of the 20 venues, from the privately financed 110,000-seat
main stadium with boomerang-curve roofs to a mountain-bike track
cut across suburban hillsides, have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Other complaints have not been as dramatic as those at Bondi.
Many residents have been grumbling about traffic snarls and
sidewalk closures caused by a $200 million facelift going on
downtown and by several billion dollars' worth of Olympic-linked
construction elsewhere. And many residents say they will leave town
during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Sydneysiders love sports spectacles, however. More than 100,000
spectators filled the new $425 million Olympic Stadium last month
when it opened with a rugby doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium's first international tryout will come this August _
a football exhibition game between the Denver Broncos and the San
Diego Chargers. &QL;

ROCKETS `LET IT GET AWAY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Forget the Utah Jazz. Ignore the San Antonio Spurs.
Nuke the entire Eastern Conference. There's only two teams truly
worthy of winning the NBA title, at least according to resident NBA
analyst Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the Lakers) don't win the championship, or we don't, it's
a disappointing year _ plain and simple,'' Barkley said. ``Both
teams are built to win the championship. Somebody's going to be
disappointed in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   After Round 1 of this opening-round playoff series, it was the
Rockets' turn to be depressed. They were certain they gave away
Sunday's 101-100 loss to the Lakers before 17,505.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made mental mistakes,'' said Houston coach Rudy
Tomjanovich. ``We can't stop shooting ourselves in the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   But with so many choices, the Rockets just didn't happen to
agree which miscue was the most egregious in the final 80 seconds
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the foul called with 5.3 seconds left, when guard
Sam Mack fell to the ground and made contact with Kobe Bryant, who
made two free throws to give the Lakers a 101-100 lead _ and the
final score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was personally incensed, because I was standing right there
when they called it on Sam,'' rookie guard Cuttino Mobley said.
``He did not foul Kobe. All I have to say is let us dictate the
game, not the refs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was a no-call,'' Tomjanovich added.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was the turnovers. Scottie Pippen lost the ball with
7.6 seconds left and the Rockets in front 100-99. Mobley made an
errant pass with 1:18 left and Houston ahead 97-96.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some turnovers that really cost us,'' Barkley said.
``We let it get away. That's a no-brainer. It's very disheartening
to lose that game. We gave it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   This being a team of superstars, it would be too clear-cut for
everyone to focus on the turnovers. Pippen focused on a major
coaching decision, questioning Tomjanovich's strategy to foul
Shaquille O'Neal with 28 seconds left and the Rockets ahead 100-98.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal missed the first free throw and made the second, so the
move paid off, right? Not in Pippen's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that... was a very smart move,'' Pippen said.
``We should have made them come down and have to work to score. At
least take the time off the clock. We're up two points and we just
allowed them to split the lead and they get the ball back because
now we have to do something at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them the opportunity, and (O'Neal) put us in a
position where we had to score. We just put our backs to the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Pippen was the one who lost the ball on the ensuing
possession.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the Rockets weren't bitter about was Mobley's
drive at the buzzer, when O'Neal came from behind and blocked the
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a good play,'' Mobley said.

GATES GIVES $50 MILLION TO PROGRAM HELPING THIRD-WORLD WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft Corp., has
given $50 million to Columbia University's Joseph L. Mailman School
of Public Health for a program to prevent mothers in developing
nations from dying during childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   The gift is the largest foundation grant for a single program in
Columbia's history, said Dr. Allan Rosenfield, the dean of the
School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Gates and his wife, Melinda, gave $3.3
billion to their two foundations, bringing the total assets of both
to nearly $5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As parents, Melinda and I care very deeply about the health of
mothers around the world,'' Gates said in a statement. ``We're very
excited about this project, because research shows us that nine out
of 10 cases of maternal death in the developing world can be
prevented by providing access to health care services.''
</P>
<P>
   The program will be headed by Rosenfield, an obstetrician and
gynecologist, and Dr. Deborah Maine, a doctor of public health and
a research scientist for the Center of Population and Family
Health, a department in the School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The grant will provide support to government programs as well as
nongovernmental organizations and women's groups whose aim is to
prevent maternal death and disability in developing countries in
Africa, Asia and Latin America. Rosenfield and Dr. Maine said they
would work with organizations like CARE, the World Health
Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield and Dr. Maine first brought maternal mortality and
disability to the attention of the international health community
14 years ago when an article they wrote was published in The
Lancet, the British medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   Every minute, Rosenfield said in a recent interview, a woman in
Asia, Africa or Latin America dies of the complications of
pregnancy or childbirth. In some areas in Africa, he added, one out
of 12 women dies from such complications, compared with one out of
4,000 women in northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in developing countries die, as did women in the West
100 years ago, from hemorrhaging, excess bleeding, infections and
obstructed labor,'' Dr. Maine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some of the poor countries we'll be visiting, they deliver
babies at home with a granny midwife, which is what they call them,
or sometimes with a relative and sometimes by themselves,'' she
added. ``It's sometimes one to 10 hours to the nearest place where
they can get help. We want to find ways to make emergency
obstetrical care more readily available and accessible than it is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Their aim, she said, was not to build new hospitals but to
``improve the functioning and upgrade services in existing
hospitals.''
